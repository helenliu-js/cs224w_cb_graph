Introduction\nThe recent financial crisis and ensuing deep recession led to a sharp increase in the U.S.\nunemployment rate, which peaked at 10.1 percent in October 2009. After adjusting for changes in\nthe demographic composition of the labor force, this represents the highest unemployment rate\nreached since the Great Depression.1 Moreover, in contrast to relatively rapid labor market\nrecoveries following prior deep postwar recessions, the unemployment rate has edged down very\nslowly since the recession, remaining above 9 percent more than two years into the recovery. As\nsuch, the typical duration of an unemployment spell is well above the highs observed in past\ndownturns.\nPersistently anemic labor market conditions are partly a reflection of the sluggish overall\neconomic recovery, which is a common occurrence following financial crises (Reinhart and Rogoff,\n2009). The resulting lackluster pace of job creation has barely kept up with trend labor force growth\nand therefore has not generated enough jobs to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate or\nreduce unemployment duration. Moreover, the unemployment rate has remained high relative to its\nhistorical relationship with other cyclical indicators. For example, it exceeds the level implied by\nthe Beveridge curve, which relates it to the strength of labor demand as reflected in the number of\nvacancies posted.\nThis disconnect between the unemployment rate and other aggregate indicators has raised\nthe concern that rather than being purely cyclical, the recent elevated level of unemployment\ncontains a substantial structural component. Since most short-run monetary and fiscal stabilization\npolices are designed to address cyclical, rather than structural issues, understanding the relative\ncontributions of each to total unemployment is an important policy goal.2 Unfortunately, it is also a\n1 Due to changes in the demographic composition of the labor force, the aggregate unemployment rate in the\nrecent recession did not reach the peak from the 1981 recession (see Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin, 2010)\n2 For example, accommodative monetary policy can reduce cyclical unemployment but cannot directly\naffect structural unemployment associated with skill or geographic mismatch, changes in benefit systems,\nor changes in search frictions.\n2\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nchallenging task, a point made by Peter Diamond (2011) in his Nobel Prize Lecture3 and illustrated\nby the wide span of views held by both economists and policymakers.\nIn this paper, we assess the degree to which the natural rate of unemployment has changed\nand the reasons underlying such a change. We do so in two parts.\nIn the first part, we discuss the implications of a standard textbook model of frictional\nunemployment based on a search and matching framework (Pissarides 2000, Chapter 1). In this\nmodel, equilibrium unemployment is determined by the intersection of two curves: the Beveridge\ncurve, which reflects the steady-state relationship between vacancies and the unemployment rate;\nand the Job Creation curve, which reflects employers’ decisions to create job openings and can be\nloosely interpreted as an aggregate labor demand curve. Our empirical estimates of these curves in\nthe short and long term reveal recent movements that are similar to those that occurred in previous\nsevere recessions. Putting these two curves together, we estimate that the equilibrium or natural\nrate of unemployment has increased over the recession and recovery, but by far less than\nunemployment has risen. Our preferred estimate points to an increase in the natural rate of\nunemployment over the cycle of about one percentage point putting the current natural rate at\naround 6 percent. Importantly, even at the maximum of our range of plausible estimates, we find\nthe natural rate increased by no more than one and half percentage points, boosting the current\nnatural rate to about 6 and one half percent.4 We also discuss the implications of the higher natural\nrate for broader measures of economic activity, specifically the output gap, based on Okun’s Law.\nIn the second part of the analysis, we focus on the three primary factors that economists\nhave offered that may account for an increase in the natural rate: (1) a mismatch between the\ncharacteristics of job openings, such as skill requirements or location, and the characteristics of the\nunemployed; (2) the availability of extended unemployment insurance (UI) benefits, which may\nreduce the intensity of job search or prolong labor force attachment for UI recipients; and (3)\nuncertainty about overall economic conditions, which may have induced firms to raise\n3 In arguing against claims that the much of the increase in unemployment was structural, Diamond stated: I\nam skeptical of the value of attempting to separate cyclical from structural unemployment over a business\ncycle”\n4 For context, the maximum natural rate recorded by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was 6.3\npercent in 1978.\n3\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nproductivity and output without extensive hiring of new employees.5,6 Because the mismatch\nargument has multiple components, we discuss an array of evidence, which on balance suggests that\nthe increase in mismatch has been quite limited and largely reflects transitional factors. We find a\nlarger contribution arising from extended UI benefits, which are planned to expire as the labor\nmarket recovers and therefore constitute a transitory influence on the natural rate. Finally, we\nprovide speculative evidence that the unusual degree of uncertainty may be contributing to elevated\nunemployment through the resulting suppression of hiring; like extended UI, the influence of this\nfactor is likely to be transitory as well.\nTaking these two parts together, we conclude that although the natural rate of\nunemployment has risen over the last few years, substantial slack remains in the labor market, and\nis likely to persist for several years. Moreover, since most of the increase in the natural rate appears\nto be transitory, we expect that as the cyclical recovery in the labor market proceeds, the natural rate\nwill fall back to a value close to its pre-recession level of around 5.0 percent.\n2. Equilibrium unemployment and the natural rate\nThe increase in the U.S. unemployment rate associated with the 2007-2009 recession is\nunprecedented during the postwar era. The unemployment rate rose by 5.7 percentage points from a\nlow of 4.4 percent in late 2006 and early 2007 to 10.1 percent in October 2009; this exceeds the net\nincrease of 5.2 percentage points between mid-1979 and late 1982 (which spans two recessionary\nepisodes). Moreover, two years into the recovery (as of the third quarter of 2011), the\nunemployment rate has declined by only about 1 percentage point.\nThis pattern of persistently elevated unemployment raises the possibility that in addition to\nthe usual cyclical increase, an elevated structural component and corresponding higher natural rate\nmay be may be contributing as well. As defined in Brauer (2007), the natural rate of unemployment\n“arises from all sources other than fluctuations in demand associated with business cycles. The\nnatural rate is determined by the rate at which jobs are simultaneously created and destroyed, the\n5 Basu, Fernald, Kimball (2006) find that positive productivity shocks can reduce employment.\n6 This evidence draws upon our previous work on the labor market during the recession and recovery: Daly\nand Hobijn (2010), Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin (2010), Kwok, Daly, and Hobijn (2010), Valletta and Kuang\n(2010a,b), as well as Wilson (2010).\n4\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nrate of turnover in particular jobs, and how quickly unemployed workers are matched with vacant\npositions. Those factors in turn depend on the characteristics of jobs and of workers and on the\nefficiency of the labor market’s matching process.” Given the severe shock to labor markets, it is\nreasonable to ask whether some of these noncyclical factors have been altered in a way that\nincreases the natural rate of unemployment in either the short or the long term.\n2.1 Frictional unemployment in equilibrium\nTo assess the factors affecting the unemployment rate in the short run as well as its longer\nrun level, we rely on the model of equilibrium frictional unemployment from Pissarides (2000,\nChapter 1). This model specifies two curves that determine equilibrium frictional unemployment:\nthe Beveridge Curve (BC) and the Job Creation curve (JCC). We use this framework to analyze the\npotential increase in the natural rate of unemployment, focusing here on a nontechnical discussion\nof the model’s key elements.7\nIn models of unemployment due to search frictions, not every employer that is looking to\nhire finds a worker and not every job searcher finds an employer. Therefore, the labor market does\nnot fully clear in each period, and some job openings remain unfilled at the same time that some job\nseekers remain unemployed.8 Wage determination is ancillary to the job matching process in these\nmodels. Because employers and job seekers each benefit from a job match, wages are determined\nby the bargain between employers and employees over the surplus generated by the match, which\noccurs after the match and therefore is irrelevant to its formation.9 As such, the equilibrium in this\nmodel is defined in terms of vacancies and unemployment—the intersection of the BC and JCC—\nrather than wages and the equilibrium level of employment.\nFigure 1 depicts typical BC and JCC curves and illustrates the interactions between them\nthat produce equilibrium vacancy and unemployment rates (based on Figure 1.2 in Pissarides 2000,\np. 20). The BC starts with a job matching function, which specifies that the rate at which job seekers\nare matched to job openings depends primarily on the ratio of the job vacancy rate to the\n7 See Daly, Hobijn, and Valletta (2011) for further details regarding the underlying model.\n8 By contrast, in frictionless models of the labor market, wages adjust to equate labor demand to labor\nsupply in a spot market, which excludes the existence of unemployment as an equilibrium outcome.\n9 Assumptions about the type of wage bargaining are important for the cyclical properties of the model\n(Pissarides, 2009) but are not important for the equilibrium concept we focus on here.\n5\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nunemployment rate (Petrongolo and Pissarides, 2001). In conjunction with standard conditions that\ndetermine unemployment as the outcome of job separations and hiring (e.g., Shimer 2005), job\nmatching functions imply a negative relationship between the unemployment rate and the job\nvacancy rate. When labor demand is strong, vacancy rates are high and the unemployment rate is\nlow; the reverse is true when labor demand is weak.10 The position of the BC can also change,\nwith outward shifts occurring when the pace of layoffs rises or the efficiency of the job matching\nprocess declines.\nBy itself, the BC does not determine an equilibrium combination of vacancies and\nunemployment because it does not incorporate other key determinants of overall labor demand. The\nmissing relationship is the JCC, which in its simplest form is determined by a free entry condition.\nAssuming no constraints on vacancy postings, firms will create vacancies up to the point where the\nexpected value of a job match equals the expected search cost to fill the vacancy; the latter\ncombines direct recruiting costs for firms with the probability that the job is filled.\nThe relevant literature on frictional unemployment has not attempted to pin down the\nquantitative determinants of the JCC, focusing instead on the shape of the BC and the types of\nfrictions that underlie it. However, in the simple model we discuss here, the JCC is upward sloping,\nimplying that firms have incentives to create more job openings when unemployment is higher (as\ndepicted in Figure 1).11 In our specific setting, the upward slope arises because as the pool of job\nseekers grows, employers can more easily fill open vacancies; the resulting increase in the\nprobability that a vacancy is filled and the associated reduction in net hiring costs raises vacancy\ncreation by firms. The exact degree of upward slope is affected by other factors that may change\nover time or across the business cycle, such as the efficiency of the matching process, the job\nseparation rate, the level of recruiting costs, and the value of jobs (as reflected in worker\nproductivity and the value of output).12\n10 The concave shape of the BC in this figure reflects a matching technology with constant returns to scale—\ni.e., a doubling of job vacancies and unemployed individuals implies a doubling of job matches—hence\ndiminishing returns to either of these inputs by itself. This assumption has ample empirical support\n(Petrongolo and Pissarides 2001).\n11 The same is true of some models with matching functions based on more elaborate micro-foundations\n(e.g., Shimer 2007)\n12 More generally, it depends on the structure of the product and labor markets in which firms operate and\nhow they bargain over wages, as well as external factors such as the discount or interest rate.\n6\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nThe key implication of this model for our analysis is that the equilibrium unemployment rate\nis determined jointly by the BC and JCC equations.13 Figure 1 illustrates equilibrium in our simple\nmodel of frictional unemployment. For a given BC and JCC, the equilibrium unemployment rate at\npoint (cid:1853) is determined by the intersection of the two curves. In this framework, changes in the\nequilibrium unemployment rate can occur due to an outward shift in the BC, a downward shift in\nthe JCC, or a combination of both.\nWe first consider an outward shift in the BC, from BC to BC’, shown in Figure 1. For a\ngiven JCC, this shifts the equilibrium from (cid:1853) to (cid:1854). Because the JCC is upward sloping, equilibrium\nunemployment increases by less than the outward shift in the BC, to a degree that depends on the\nslope of the JCC. In order for the unemployment rate to increase by the same amount as the\nrightward shift in the BC, the JCC either must be flat or must shift outward (or down) as well. This\nis illustrated by the shift in JC to JC’ in Figure 1. This results in a shift in equilibrium from (cid:1854) to (cid:1855).\nThis simple graphical analysis provides us with two key insights. First, to understand the\ndriving forces of the rise in the unemployment rate, one must consider not only what is shifting the\nBC and by how much, but also what is affecting job creation, i.e. labor demand. Second, to\ndistinguish what part of the rise in the unemployment rate reflects purely cyclical fluctuations in\nlabor demand and what parts are due to other factors, either transitory or permanent, that cause a\nrise in the natural rate, one has to consider what is driving the shifts in the BC and the JC curves and\nhow long these effects are likely to last.\n2.2 The recent shift in the Beveridge Curve\nFigure 2 shows the empirical U.S. BC based on the monthly vacancy data from the Job\nOpenings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), available beginning in December 2000. The data\nare divided into two groups, with the observations occurring prior to the recent recession in blue and\nthe observations occurring since the start of the recession in orange. The last data point in our\nsample is June 2011. In addition to the observed data, the figure contains a fitted BC, which is an\nupdate of the estimate provided in Barnichon, Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin (2010). In terms of our\n13 This is an important point that is frequently overlooked in policy discussions related to movements in the\nBC in which shifts in the BC are interpreted as one-for- one increases in the natural rate of unemployment.\n7\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nsimple framework the fitted curve can be interpreted as an empirical estimate of the BC depicted in\nFigure 1 based on the pre-recession patterns of job matching.\nIn June 2011 the actual unemployment rate was 9.2 percent while the level of the\nunemployment rate on the fitted BC at the observed 2.3 percent vacancy rate is 6.6 percent. This\nimplies the 2.6 percentage point unemployment gap, or implied outward BC shift, that is plotted in\nthe figure.14 It is important to note that the size of the implied shift has varied substantially and at\nhigh frequency over the past few years. For example, during the few months between late 2010 and\nearly 2011, the implied shift fell from over 3 percentage points to about 2.0 percentage points. This\nvariation in the implied shift occurs because the recently observed points are near a very flat part of\nthe BC, which combines large changes in the unemployment rate with small changes in vacancy\nrates. Such short-run variability in the size of the gap suggests that little weight should be placed on\nits individual monthly values.\nMoreover, while the current estimate of a 2.6 percentage-point horizontal shift in the BC\nseems large, it is important to put this estimate into a longer-term historical perspective than that\nenabled by the JOLTS data. Construction of a historical BC before 2000 involves merging data\nfrom JOLTS with the Help-Wanted Index published by the Conference Board. We use such a series\nas constructed by Barnichon (2010). Figure 3 displays the resulting long-term BC. As can be seen\nfrom the figure, the BC shifted rightward about 4 percentage points between the 1960s and the early\n1980s and then shifted back about 2.5 percentage points between 1984 and 1989. This suggests that\nthe current outward shift of the BC is within the range of shifts that occurred during past business\ncycles. Moreover, the outward shifts in previous recessions have coincided with increases in the\nnatural rate of unemployment that are much smaller than the horizontal movement in the BC. This\nis not only true for the CBO estimate of the natural rate but also for the most commonly used\nalternative estimates (Orphanides and Williams, 2002). Credible estimates of the natural rate over\nthese earlier periods suggest that it may have changed about half as much as the horizontal shift in\nthe empirical BC.\nAn alternative way to consider the current shift in the BC is presented in Barnichon, Elsby,\nHobijn, and Şahin (2010). They observe that currently, the job-finding rate is well below its level\n14 The size of the imputed current gap is not very sensitive to the estimation method applied. The non-linear\nOLS estimate in Valletta and Kuang (2010b) yields a similar size gap, as does the recalibrated version of\nShimer’s (2007) BC model presented by Kocherlakota (2010).\n8\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nimplied by the estimated matching function based on pre-recession data. This suggests a substantial\ndecline in match efficiency. They proceed by constructing the shifted empirical BC displayed in\nFigure 2, which takes into account the estimated percentage decline in match efficiency. From the\nshifted BC in the figure it can be seen that, due to the non-linear nature of the BC, the horizontal\nshift is not uniform. At the 2.3 percent vacancy rate in June 2011 the estimated horizontal shift is\n1.8 percentage points. At the 3.0 percent vacancy rate consistent with a pre-recession natural rate of\nunemployment equal to 5 percent, the horizontal shift is 1.4 percentage points.\nHence, our analysis of the shift in the BC highlights several difficulties with relying on\nsimple plots of the BC to make inferences about changes in equilibrium unemployment. First, our\nestimates of the shift in a non-linear BC suggest that the horizontal shift is not uniform but instead\nis larger at lower levels of the vacancy rate. Second, and most importantly, past horizontal shifts in\nthe BC have coincided with much smaller movements in the natural rate of unemployment. This\nunderscores the empirical relevance of the other curve in the model—the JCC.\n2.3 An estimate of the long-run JCC\nOur analyses suggest that, at an average pre-recession vacancy rate of 3 percent, the BC has\nshifted outwards by 1.4 percentage points. It is tempting to infer from this that the natural rate of\nunemployment has thus increased from its pre-recession level of 5 percent to 6.4 percent now.\nHowever, as discussed in conjunction with Figure 1 earlier, this is equivalent to the claim that the\nJCC has shifted out by a corresponding amount or is flat, which is unlikely. The 6.4 percent value is\nmore appropriately interpreted as an upper bound on the current natural rate. The actual change, i.e.\nthe shift from (cid:1853) to (cid:1854) in Figure 1, depends on the shape of the JCC, in particular its upward slope.\nTo our knowledge, there are no existing estimates of the historical U.S. JCC. We therefore\nprovide a rudimentary estimate here, based on the observation noted from Figure 3 that, historically,\noutward shifts of the BC have coincided with increases in the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate of\nunemployment. These historical data also show that when the BC shifts outwards, the average\nvacancy rate generally increases. The average vacancy rate at a particular value of the natural rate of\nunemployment can be interpreted as an estimate of the natural vacancy rate. Hence, Figure 3\nsuggests that the natural rate of vacancies is increasing in the natural rate of unemployment.\n9\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nWe analyze this observation more formally based on Figure 4, which plots the historical\nvacancy rate series used earlier against the CBO’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.\nThe vertical lines created by sub-sets of the points in the figure depict cyclical fluctuations in labor\ndemand for a given level of the natural rate. Each of these lines coincides with a different location\nof the BC in Figure 3.\nA regression of the historical vacancy rate series on the natural rate of unemployment, using\ndata points observed prior to the recent recession, yields the statistically significant upward sloping\nrelationship depicted by the dashed line in Figure 4. This regression line can be interpreted as an\nestimate of the long-run JCC; it reflects typical vacancy creation, i.e. labor demand, as a function of\nthe natural rate of unemployment.\nThe estimated JCC slope of 1.1 in Figure 4 probably is at the high end of the range of\nplausible estimates. The reason is that there is neither agreement on the right historical measure of\nthe U.S. vacancy rate, i.e. the dependent variable in the regression, nor on the estimates of the\nnatural rate of unemployment, the explanatory variable in the regression. Abraham (1987) pointed\nout that some of the variation in the Help-Wanted Index data used for the construction of the\nhistorical vacancy rate time series reflect a longer-run trend due to the occupational mix of job\nopenings, the consolidation in the newspaper industry, and the increased requirements to post job\nopenings for Equal Employment Opportunity purposes. These factors likely drove up the index\nrelative to the actual number of vacancies during the period of rising unemployment in the 1970s\nand 1980s. This might lead to an overestimate of the slope of the long-run JCC.15\nOther estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, including those computed by\nOrphanides and Williams (2002) that allow for more time variation in the natural rate, would\nproduce different estimates of the slope of the JCC as well. In these cases the estimated regression\nline in Figure 4 would be flatter, i.e., the responsiveness of the average level of vacancies to the\nnatural rate of unemployment would be weaker. That said, the empirical JCC would remain upward\nsloping.\n15 Unreported results based on a vacancy rate measure that corrects for these issues still yield a significantly\nupward sloping long-run JCC.\n10\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\n2.4 Putting the BC and JC curves together\nTo assign some magnitude to the potential increase in the natural rate of unemployment we\ncombine the fitted and shifted JOLTS-based BC discussed above with the estimated long-run JCC\ncurve from Figure 4. As can be seen from Figure 5, the shifted BC and the empirical JCC curve\nintersect at an unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.16 Note that this is substantially lower than the 6.4\npercent upper bound on the natural rate of unemployment that we obtained by simply considering\nthe horizontal shift in the BC.\nGiven the simplicity of our estimation strategy for the JCC, the estimated natural rate of 5.4\npercent reflects considerable uncertainty. If one were to use alternative time varying estimates of the\nNAIRU to estimate the empirical JCC, it would flatten out and the estimate of the natural rate\nwould increase. For this reason, we interpret the 5.4 percent estimate as a lower bound on the\ncurrent natural rate of unemployment.\nThus, we find that if the currently estimated shift in the BC is permanent and the economy\nreturns to its long-run JCC, then the long-run natural rate of unemployment has increased from its 5\npercent level in 2007 to somewhere between 5.4 and 6.4 percent as of June 2011.17 In the absence of\nadditional evidence to pin down its exact value, we regard 5.9 percent, the midpoint of this range, as\nour preferred estimate of the current long-run natural rate of unemployment.According to our\nestimate of the shifted BC, this 5.9 percent natural rate of unemployment corresponds to a new\nnatural vacancy rate of 3.3 percent. This is substantially higher than the 3.0 percent natural vacancy\nrate associated with the pre-recession natural rate of unemployment and fitted Beveridge Curve.\n2.5 Implications for potential GDP\nIn June 2011, the unemployment rate was 9.2 percent, 3.3 percentage points above our\nestimate of the new natural rate, while the vacancy rate was 2.3 percent, a percentage point lower\n16 In Figure 5, the empirical JCC intersects the fitted pre-recession Beveridge curve at a 5 percent\nunemployment rate, which is the CBO estimate of the pre-recession level of the natural rate.\n17 It is useful to note that as the recovery has proceeded our estimated range for the natural rate has been\nfalling. For example, in January 2011 we estimated the range to be bounded at 6.9 percent rather than the\n6.4 percent we find currently. We interpret this decline as partially reflecting data revisions to JOLTS and\npartially reflecting the evolution of unemployment and vacancies in 2011. The latter of these two points to\nthe rising importance of weak aggregate demand in determining the elevated unemployment rate.\n11\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nthan the new natural vacancy rate. This 3.3 percentage point unemployment gap, by definition, then\nreflects a shortfall in the demand for labor associated with this business cycle.\nTo map this shortfall in labor demand into a broader measure of the shortfall in overall\neconomic activity relative to its full employment level, one has to consider how the unemployment\ngap is related to the output gap. The output gap is the percentage difference between actual GDP\nand potential GDP. The historically relatively stable statistical relationship between these two gaps\nis known as Okun’s Law.18\nFigure 6 shows Okun’s Law based on the output and unemployment gaps implied by the\nCBO’s (2011) historical estimates of potential GDP and the natural rate of unemployment. As can\nbe seen from the figure, a reasonable rule of thumb is that for every percentage point that the\nunemployment rate exceeds its natural rate GDP drops two percentage points below its potential.\nDuring the recession and in 2009 and 2010, we saw historically large deviations from\nOkun’s Law with the unemployment rate being more than a percentage point higher than implied by\nthe shortfall in output relative to potential. This was mainly due to high average labor productivity\ngrowth during that period (Daly and Hobijn, 2010) and added to the concerns that the natural rate of\nunemployment had increased and that the actual unemployment gap was smaller than implied by\nthe CBO estimate. However, the decline in the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2011\ncombined with revised and slowerGDP growth, has brought the unemployment and output gaps\nback in line with the historical Okun’s Law relationship.\nOur analysis here suggests that the natural rate of unemployment is likely to be about 0.9\npercentage points higher than the CBO estimate used in Figure 6. In that case, the unemployment\ngap would be 0.9 percentage points lower as well and, to be in line with Okun’s Law, potential GDP\nwould be about 1.8 percent less than the current CBO estimate, which amounts to $290 billion\n(annualized). The corrected output gap in 2011Q2 would be 5.0 percent rather than 6.8 percent.\nIn the context of the IS-LM/AS-AD framework that is often used in textbooks on\nmacroeconomics,19 this implies that the shortfall of actual GDP relative to its full employment level,\noften referred to as economic slack, is less than based on the CBO estimates. This means that there\nis less room for short-run fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate aggregate demand without\n18 After Arthur Okun, who first documented it in Okun (1962).\n19 See Abel, Bernanke, and Croushore (2011, Chapter 9) for example.\n12\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nputting upward pressures on inflation. However, even if the output gap since the beginning of the\nrecession was 1.8 percent lower than currently estimated it would still be the second highest, after\nthat of the early 1980’s, during the postwar period.\n3. What is shifting the Beveridge and Job Creation curves?\nOur estimate of a 0.9 increase in the natural rate of unemployment based on the shifted BC\nand long-run JCC in the previous section depends on two important assumptions. The first is that\nthe labor market will return to its long-run JCC and that there are no factors that will permanently\nreduce job creation. The second is the assumption that the entire estimated shift of the BC is\npermanent rather than attributable, at least in part, to temporary factors whose influence is likely to\nfade in the future. This raises the question of what factors affect the current positions of the BC and\nJCC curves and whether these factors reflect permanent or transitory influences. We discuss the\nfactors, beyond weak aggregate demand and layoffs, which are most commonly considered as\nmoving the BC and JCC in this section.\nTable 1 lists the five factors we consider, how they affect the BC and the JCC, and whether\nthey are likely to be transitory or persistent. The factors are divided into two groups: normal cyclical\nshifters, and other factors. Our main focus in this section is on the latter. While we do not provide a\ndetailed discussion of the shortfall in aggregate demand or the elevated level of layoffs, we do\nspend some time discussing how the unusual level of uncertainty in the current environment may be\naffecting firm hiring and relate that back to both cyclical and structural unemployment.\nAs for weak aggregate demand, we consider this to be the determinant of the unemployment\nfluctuations beyond those captured by the natural rate. That is, it drives the shortfall in labor\ndemand that depresses job creation and, for a given Beveridge curve, generates the cyclical move\nalong the Beveridge curve.\nThe omission of layoffs relates to the fact that elevated layoffs rates tend to play an\nimportant role during the onset of recessions but they are of much less importance during\nrecoveries.20 Bowden (1980), Blanchard and Diamond (1989), and Mortensen (1994) all emphasize\n20 This has been documented for the U.S. by, among others, Darby, Haltiwanger, and Plant (1985, 1986) and\nFujita and Ramey (2009). Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin (2008) show that this is also true across countries.\n13\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nthat counter-clockwise loops in (cid:4666)u,v(cid:4667)-space are commonly observed during U.S. business cycles\nand consistent with the simple theoretical framework we consider. Such loops are partly driven by\nan initial outward shift in the Beveridge curve driven by layoffs and a subsequent return inward\nduring the recovery when layoffs dissipate, vacancies get posted, and the unemployment rate\ndeclines. These loops are evident in Figure 3. However, since measured layoff rates from the\nJOLTS data have returned to their pre-recession levels, we do not consider them a concern for the\nlabor market recovery going forward and therefore do not address them below.\nIn the remainder of this section we provide recent empirical evidence on the potential\nimportance of each of these three other factors in Table 1 and discuss whether these factors are\nlikely to be transitory or permanent.\n3.1 Mismatch\nThe mismatch argument for sustained increases in the unemployment rate and the natural\nrate of unemployment is predicated on imbalances in labor supply and demand across industry\nsectors, geographic areas, or skill groups. There is always a certain degree of mismatch in the labor\nmarket which explains why matches do not take place instantaneously. Any rise in mismatch above\nits usual level however makes it harder than usual for workers to find a job and more expensive for\nfirms to fill a vacancy. The result is a decline in match efficiency that both shifts the BC out and\nthe JCC down. Mismatch is generally regarded as the main potential cause of a long-run increase in\nthe natural rate since training or relocating workers and jobs take a substantial amount of time.\nA highly uneven distribution of job gains and losses across industry sectors and states is an\nindication of mismatch in the sense that it suggests that those who become unemployed did not\nwork in industries and regions where hiring is taking place. Valletta and Kuang (2010b) show that\nthe dispersion of employment gains and losses across industries and states spiked in the most recent\nrecession. However, as aggregate employment stabilized, the dispersion of employment gains and\nlosses across industries and states returned to its pre-recession level.\nEven though the dispersion of employment gains and losses across industries and states\ndeclined substantially, there is still a large number of unemployed workers who previously held jobs\nin sectors like construction and financial activities. Since it is likely to take a long time for these\n14\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nsectors to return to their pre-recession employment levels, these workers might suffer from\nprolonged spells of unemployment due to skill mismatch.\nTo address this concern, Şahin, Song, Topa, and Violante (2011) introduce mismatch indices\nthat combine measures of both labor demand and labor supply. For the former they use vacancy\ndata from the JOLTS and the Help Wanted OnLine (HWOL) while for the latter they rely on\nunemployment measures from the Current Population Survey (CPS).These indices show that both\nsectoral as well as occupational mismatch increased during the recession but that geographic\nmismatch across states is relatively small. At the sectoral level, this increase can be traced back to\nconstruction, durable goods manufacturing, health, and education sectors. Occupational mismatch\nrose mostly due to the behavior of construction, production work, health care, and sales-related\noccupations.\nŞahin, Song, Topa, and Violante (2011) also quantify how much of the recent rise in U.S.\nunemployment is due to an increase in mismatch and find that higher mismatch across industries\nand occupations accounts for 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points of the recent rise in the unemployment\nrate. Geographical mismatch turns out to be quantitatively insignificant.21\nHowever, these findings do not necessarily imply that natural rate of unemployment\nincreased by the same amount. Just like the dispersion measures considered in Valletta and Kuang\n(2010b) the mismatch indices constructed by Şahin, Song, Topa, and Violante (2011) rose during\nthe recession and then started to decline in 2010. Thus far, the evidence suggests that mismatch has\nhad a pronounced cyclical component, moving together with the unemployment rate. While\nmismatch has contributed to the increase in the unemployment rate, its current path suggests that it\nis not likely to cause a large long-lasting increase in the natural rate of unemployment.\nConsistent with this, we expect a modest increase in the natural rate due to the contraction of\nthe construction sector. A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation also supports our view. The\nseasonally adjusted unemployment rate for construction workers has been hovering around 20\npercent in recent months, compared with a more typical rate from 2003 to 2006 of about 7 to 8\n21 This result for geographic mismatch is consistent with recent empirical papers, most notably Molloy,\nSmith, and Wozniak (2010) and Schulhofer-Wohl (2010), and Valletta (2010) which all find a very limited\nrole for geographic immobility of unemployed individuals whose home values have fallen below the\namount owed on their mortgages (“house lock”). Recent theoretical work by Sterk (2010) suggests that\nalthough house lock will lead to an outward shift in the BC, the likely shift is much smaller than the one\ndepicted in Figure 2.\n15\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\npercent. This represents about 1.25 million more unemployed construction workers in the current\nrecovery than was typical during the preceding expansion. Assuming that half of them are\nreemployable,22 structural unemployment would increase by only about 0.4 percentage point.\nBecause most construction workers are not hired through formal job openings we expect the\neffect of this type of mismatch on the long-run JCC curve to be limited. Instead, we think that this\neffect of mismatch on the natural rate of unemployment is mainly due to the persistent part of the\ncontribution of the contruction sector to the outward shift of the Beveridge curve calculated by\nBarnichon, Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin (2010).\n3.2 Extended unemployment benefits\nAnother potentially important factor that may be influencing the search behavior of\nunemployed workers and boosting the underlying structural unemployment rate is the extended\navailability of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. UI extensions are a standard policy response\nto elevated cyclical unemployment, and the sharp increase in the unemployment rate during the\n2007-2009 recession resulted in an unprecedented increase in the potential duration of UI receipt.\nBeginning in late June, 2008, the maximum duration of UI benefits was extended multiple times,\nreaching 99 weeks for most UI-eligible job seekers as of late 2009.23 Congress has allowed the\nprimary extension program to expire twice, most notably for nearly 2 months in June-July of 2010,\nbut in each case renewed the extensions, which currently are effective through January 3, 2012.\nIn the context of the job matching function described earlier, increased availability of UI\nbenefits is likely to increase unemployment duration through two primary behavioral channels.\nFirst, the extension of UI benefits, which represents an increase in their value, may reduce the\nintensity with which UI-eligible unemployed individuals search for work and their likelihood of\naccepting a given job offer. This could occur because the additional UI benefits reduce the net gains\n22 Such a reemployability rate is not unreasonable given the recent evidence on industry-mobility of workers\n(see Bjelland, Fallick, Haltiwanger, and McEntarfer, 2010)\n23 The joint Federal-State UI program provides up to 26 weeks of normal benefits. The recent benefit\nextensions reflect the impact of two federally funded programs: the permanently authorized Extended\nBenefits program, which provides up to 20 additional weeks of UI benefits, and the special Emergency\nUnemployment Compensation, which provides up to 53 weeks of benefits, depending on the\nunemployment rate in the recipient’s state of prior employment (which causes the share of unemployed\nworkers eligible for the 99-week maximum to change over time). The previous maximum eligibility was\n65 weeks under the Federal Supplemental Benefits (FSB) program in the mid-1970s.\n16\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nfrom finding a job and also serve as an income cushion that helps households maintain acceptable\nconsumption levels in the face of unemployment shocks (Chetty, 2008). Alternatively, the measured\nunemployment rate may be artificially inflated because some individuals who are not actively\nsearching for work are identifying themselves as active searchers in order to receive UI benefits (a\n“reporting effect,” in the language of Card, Chetty, and Weber, 2007). These behavioral effects on\njob search will increase the non-cyclical or structural component of the unemployment rate during\nthe period over which extended benefits are available.24\nGiven the unique nature of recent economic conditions and the UI extensions, assessing the\nmagnitude of the extended UI effect is challenging. Based on existing empirical research using U.S.\ndata, Chetty (2008) noted that a 10% increase in the overall value of UI benefits increases\nunemployment durations by 4–8%. Other estimates, particularly those that focus on extension\nperiods rather than the dollar value of benefits, lie below this range (see for example, Card and\nLevine, 2000). As such, there is a wide range of uncertainty around the implied estimates of the\nimpact of the recent UI extensions on unemployment duration. Moreover, as noted by others (e.g.,\nKatz, 2010), the impact of UI benefits on job search likely was higher in the 1970s and 1980s than it\nis now, due to the earlier period's greater reliance on temporary layoffs and the corresponding\nsensitivity of recall dates to unemployment insurance benefits. As such, reliance on past estimates\nof the effects of UI generosity and duration on unemployment is likely to lead to overestimates of\nthe effects of extended UI in the current economic environment. Hence, it is important to use recent\nlabor market data to obtain estimates of extended UI effects.\nOur own empirical assessment, reported in Daly, Hobijn, and Valletta (2011),25 focuses on\ndirect calculation and comparison of the duration of unemployment for individuals who are eligible\nor not eligible for UI receipt, as reflected in their reported reason for unemployment. UI receipt\ngenerally is restricted to individuals who are unemployed through “no fault of their own,” to quote\nU.S. Labor Department eligibility guidelines, and have recent employment history that allows them\n24 Our narrow focus on the direct behavioral effects of extended UI ignores the aggregate demand stimulus\nprovided by UI payment, which reduces the cyclical component of the unemployment rate but does not\naffect the level of structural unemployment. Recent research suggests that multiplier effects of normal and\nextended UI payments are quite large (e.g., Vroman 2010), and the reduction in cyclical unemployment\nfrom this channel may exceed the increase in the structural component from the micro-behavioral channel.\n25 Based on the methodology introduced in Valletta and Kuang (2010a).\n17\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nto meet a base earnings test. In terms of the CPS, this means that UI eligible individuals are\nconcentrated in the unemployed who classify themselves as “job losers.”\nUnemployment durations in 2009 and the first half of 2010 have increased by large amounts\nfrom their pre-recession baseline levels for both likely UI eligibles as well as ineligibles. However,\nthe increase was larger for UI eligibles. If one fully attributes this difference to UI eligibility, then\nthis points to an increase in the unemployment rate due to extended UI of about 0.8 percentage\npoints. 26, 27\nThe impact of extended UI on the unemployment rate is expected to dissipate as labor\nmarket conditions improve and the extended UI provisions are allowed to expire. As a result,\nextended UI does not affect the long-run JCC curve, though it might raise current reservation wages\nand thus suppress job creation in the short-run.28 As extended UI provisions expire the shifted\nBeveridge curve is expected move back inwards.\n3.3 Uncertainty\nIn addition to mismatch and extended UI, overall uncertainty about economic conditions and\npolicy is also considered a factor contributing to the outward shift in the BC and, more importantly,\nthe low number of vacancies firms are posting.\nThe depth of the recession and the associated financial crisis increased the amount of\nuncertainty about the business environment within which firms operate. In case of fixed hiring and\nfiring costs such uncertainty about the future state of aggregate demand lowers the option value of\n26 These results were relatively insensitive to alternative assumptions about the relationship between the\nstated reason for unemployment in the CPS data and likely eligibility for UI. Recent preliminary research\nthat performs more elaborate analysis of monthly unemployment transitions, using matched CPS data and\nconditioning out the effects of individual characteristics and state economic conditions, finds even smaller\nimpacts of extended UI, on the order of a 0.3 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate (Farber\nand Valletta 2011). However, this estimate is potentially plagued by measurement problems in the\nmonthly CPS labor force transitions data and therefore is likely to represent a lower bound on the true\neffect of extended UI.\n27 Other recent estimates of the effect of extended UI on the natural rate of unemployment range from 0.7\npercentage points (Aaronson, Mazumder, and Schecter 2010) to a maximum of 1.7 percentage points\n(Fujita, 2010).\n28 No quantitative analysis of this short-run effect exists. However, we expect this short-run effect of\nextended UI on the JCC to be small, since it is offset by the aggregate demand stimulus provided by UI\npayments.\n18\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\nhiring new workers, thereby putting downward pressure on job creation (Bentolila and Bertola\n1990, Bloom 2009).\nTheoretical models of jobless recoveries, like Van Rens (2004) and Koenders and Rogerson\n(2005), suggest that firms might postpone hiring by temporarily boosting productivity growth. In\nVan Rens (2004), the boost of productivity growth comes from moving workers from the\nproduction of intangibles to the production of measured output. In Koenders and Rogerson (2005),\nfirms choose to adopt organizational changes that improve productivity but were temporarily\nshelved during the prior expansion. In either case, the reorientation of production activity reduces\nthe rate of hiring but raises productivity growth. This is what might have driven the significant\ndeviation from Okun’s Law in figure 6 during 2009 and 2010 (Daly and Hobijn, 2010).\nSuch temporary measures to boost productivity growth only go so far. If uncertainty remains\nelevated for a long time, the effect of these measures on productivity growth is likely to diminish\nand uncertainty mainly reduces job creation. This can possibly explain the joint low productivity\ngrowth and job creation in the first half of 2011.\nUncertainty might also contribute to the outward shift of the Beveridge curve, by causing\nfirms that create vacancies at the same time they become more selective about filling them. Such a\nchange in firms’ hiring decisions would cause a decline in the number of hires per vacancy; it is\nalso consistent with a reduction in recruiting intensity in the sense of Davis, Faberman, Haltiwanger\n(2010).\nThough the high level of uncertainty is a possible explanation for the joint weakness in\nvacancy creation and vacancy yields we have observed relative to the strong productivity growth\nduring the first part of the recovery, we would like to emphasize that there are no studies that have\ntried to quantify this effect. This is why, in Table 1, we list the effect of productivity growth on the\nBeveridge curve in parentheses, indicating ambiguity about its role. Since we expect a resolution of\nmuch of the uncertainty about economic situation throughout 2008 through 2011, we anticipate that\nthe upward pressure of uncertainty on the natural rate of unemployment is temporary rather than\npermanent.\n19\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\n4. Conclusion\nThe stubbornly high rate of unemployment in the face of ongoing GDP growth and rising\njob openings has raised concerns that the level of structural unemployment, or the natural rate of\nunemployment, has risen over the past few years in the United States. This is an important policy\nissue since short-run monetary and fiscal stabilization policies are not designed to\nalleviatestructural unemployment and can be costly if misapplied.29\nIn this paper we revisited a simple framework laid out in Pissarides (2001, Chapter 1) that is\nuseful for understanding the movements of equilibrium unemployment. This framework models\nequilibrium unemployment as an outcome from the interaction of two curves—the Beveridge curve\n(BC) and the Job Creation curve (JCC)—and highlights the pitfalls of drawing conclusions about\nstructural unemployment from movements in the BC alone. In addition, this framework supports\nour itemization and description of the factors that can change equilibrium unemployment on a\ntransitory or more durable basis.\nUsing this framework we estimated the empirical BC and JCC and the implied values of\nequilibrium unemployment. The results suggest that the natural rate of unemployment has risen\nfrom its pre-recession level of 5.0 percent to a value between 5.4 and 6.4 percent, with our preferred\nestimate lying at the midpoint of 5.9 percent. This value implies an unemployment gap of over three\npercentage points, which remains quite high. Moreover, even at the top of the range of estimated\nnatural rates, considerable slack remains in the labor market.\nWe then discuss the primary factors that have been identified as potential sources of an\nincrease in the natural rate of unemployment over the past few years: mismatch between the\ncharacteristics of available jobs and workers, the extension of UI benefits, and recent uncertainty\nabout economic conditions. Mismatch implies that the increase in equilibrium unemployment will\npartly persist, while the impacts of extended UI and uncertainty are likely to be transitory.\nIn terms of our estimated shifted Beveridge curve and long-run JCC, we only expect\nmismatch to have a long-run effect on the Beveridge curve and a negligible effect on the JCC. This\n29 In the case of monetary policy, expansionary policy when measured unemployment is near its natural rate\ncan trigger inflation. In the case of short-run fiscal policy such as extended unemployment insurance,\nextensions for individuals who are mismatched may extend the period over which they make required\nadjustments in training or reservation wages.\n20\n\nDaly, Hobijn, Şahin, and Valletta\ncomes with the observation, however, that there is very little research on the shape of the JCC. The\nmain upside risk to our estimate of the natural rate is that there are factors that we did not identify\nthat permanently drag down job creation going forward.\nA better understanding of the determinants of job creation is not only crucial for the\nimproving empirical analysis of equilibrium models of frictional unemployment. It is especially\nimportant for improving labor market policies.\n21\n\nRising natural rate of unemployment\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Bhashkar Mazumder, and Shani Schechter (2010). “What is behind the rise in\nlong-term unemployment?” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Economic Perspectives\n2Q/2010: 28-51.\nAbraham, Katherine G.

    "text": "What the Moment Demands\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n33rd Frankfurt European Banking Congress\nFrankfurt, Germany\nNovember 17, 2023\n3:30 PM CET (local), 6:30 AM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nIn 2004, I read a speech about making monetary policy in a dynamic world.1 It was written by\nthen Governor of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke.\nBernanke noted, that when central bankers know about where the economy is headed or\nface imminent risks, they should adjust policy decisively and aggressively—what he called the\n“cold turkey” approach. He then noted, that in almost every other instance, more caution is\nwarranted. When central banks are unsure about how the economy will evolve; when they\nare unsure of the impact their policies will have; or when they are uncertain about how the\nfundamental benchmarks in the economy are changing, the optimal strategy is to look before\nleaping—to take a “gradualist” approach to policy.\nI reference this speech and its lessons to remind us that the economy has always been\ndynamic. Change is inevitable, and uncertainty is a fact of life.\n1 Bernanke (2004).\n1\n\nBut monetary policy can adjust. Going quickly when conditions demand and more slowly\nwhen the road is less clear. Our tools, strategies, and actions can always meet the moment.\nThe choice, of course, is ours.\nNow before I go much further, I would like to remind you that the views I express today are my\nown, and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nA World in Flux\nSo, what do we face? As many at this conference have noted, we are in a period when the\nrisks seem high and the waters, murky.\nAfter the long fight through COVID, economies around the globe are facing a range of crises\nand complexities: wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the rethinking of economic\nrelations and global production chains, disruptions and dislocations from a changing climate,\nand the potential impacts, good and bad, of artificial intelligence and generative AI.2\nCentral banks also face these challenges, as well as a policy landscape that has shifted\nsignificantly in the past four years.\nRecall that, prior to COVID, central banks around the globe were focused on weaker trend\ngrowth, low real interest rates, below-target inflation, and policy tools constrained by the zero\nlower bound.3 Policymakers were focused on providing sufficient monetary policy\naccommodation and keeping inflation expectations from falling.4\nPost-COVID, the landscape has reversed. Inflation in most countries is now too high, rather\nthan too low. Global interest rates are elevated, and central banks are wondering whether\nthey’ll need to pull the policy reins even tighter to control inflation. Policy debates are now\ncentered on what constitutes sufficiently restrictive and how long to maintain that stance.5\n2 Cevik and Jalles (2023), International Monetary Fund (2023a), and Cook (2023).\n3 Discussed in Daly (2023a). Examples include Dudley (2013), Yellen (2016), Evans (2016), Draghi (2016), and Mertens\nand Williams (2019).\n4 Central banks took a range of approaches, including asset purchases (quantitative easing or QE), negative\ninterest rates, and forward guidance on keeping rates “lower for longer.” See Svensson (2015), Bech and Malkhozov\n(2016), Board of Governors (2023), Diwan, Leduc, and Mertens (2020), and Bernanke (2020).\n5 Powell (2023a, b), Schnabel (2023), Bank of England (2023), International Monetary Fund (2023b), and Daly (2023b).\n2\n\nPolicy for the Moment\nThat is a lot of change in a short period. So it is somewhat surprising that Ben Bernanke’s\nremarks have been so durable.\nBut remember, his key point was that monetary policy is flexible, and it can adjust as\nconditions change. And that is an important lesson for today.\nWhen we know where we are going and it’s important to get there quickly, moving\naggressively makes sense. “Cold turkey” is the appropriate action.6\nWe’ve seen this many times in history. This was the strategy during the Global Financial Crisis,\nwhen central banks quickly lowered policy rates and did multiple rounds of quantitative\neasing.7\nGoing back further, Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker took rapid and aggressive action\nduring the late 1970s and early 1980s, to fight double-digit inflation and a vicious wage-price\nspiral.8\nMore recently, policymakers across the globe acted decisively in response to the pandemic,\nbringing all their tools to bear to offset the impending damage to the economy.9 And then,\nwhen inflation followed and proved to be persistent, central banks raised rates rapidly to\nbring the economy back into balance and restore price stability.10\nEach of these actions were bold. Central banks were clear on what the moment demanded.\nThey acted forcefully, judging that the risks from aggressive measures were smaller than the\ncosts of any potential policy errors.11\nBut most times we face are not so clear. And a different type of boldness is required: the\nboldness to wait.\nWhen uncertainty is high and the risks to our objectives more balanced, we need to practice\ngradualism. To resist the desire to be certain. To react to not knowing with curiosity. And to\nadhere to the idea that patience, measured adjustments, and continual reassessment make\n6 Bernanke (2004).\n7 Kohn (2010), Kuttner (2018), and Dell’Ariccia, Rabanal, and Sandri (2018).\n8 Goodfriend and King (2005), Silber (2012).\n9 Clarida, Duygan-Bump, and Scotti (2021), Milstein and Wessel (2021), UN DESA (2022).\n10 OECD (2023), Council on Foreign Relations (2023). Bernanke discussed factors that contributed to the inflation and\nexpressed concerns about the slow response on the part of the FOMC (Bernanke 2022, Cox 2022).\n11 For the European Central Bank’s response to the pandemic, see the interview with ECB President Christine\nLagarde in Walker (2020).\n3\n\nfor better outcomes.12 Practicing gradualism means having the confidence to say that we\ndon’t yet know.\nThere are many times when gradualism is the best strategy, and there are countless examples\nof central banks taking this more cautious approach.13\nThe reason it is used so often is because it applies to so many different situations. Uncertainty\nabout the economic forecast.14 Uncertainty about the monetary policy transmission\nmechanism.15 And uncertainty about economic fundamentals, like the natural rate of\nunemployment or the neutral rate of interest.16\nIn this moment, we are grappling with all of these situations. At the Federal Reserve, we are\nnot certain whether inflation is on track to return to 2 percent. We are unsure about the length\nof policy lags and whether they are behind us or still to be fully realized. And we are uncertain\nabout whether the dynamics we observe today are cyclical remnants of the post-pandemic\nrecovery or indicators of structural shifts and a new normal for the national and global\neconomy.\nThe truth is none of these are knowable right now. And the perils of deciding too quickly when\nwe are not sure are real. Declaring certainty without knowing is not just a missed forecast. It’s\na policy mistake. And it has the potential to leave a lasting imprint on the economy and\nnegatively affect those we serve.\nCall to Action\nSo here is the main message of my remarks.\nUncertainty is a fact of life, but it does not leave us rudderless. We have the tools and the\nexperience to navigate whatever comes our way.\nOur challenge will be what it has always been. To respond rapidly when the situation\nrequires, and to resist the pressure to act quickly when patience is needed. To have the will to\nmake these choices, that is the policymakers’ job.\n12 Brainard (1967), Sack and Wieland (2000), Bernanke (2004, 2007), Barlevy (2009),\n13 Blinder (2006), Wilkins (2017), Lagarde (2022), Sack and Wieland (2000), Bernanke (2004), Yellen (2017).\n14 See Reifschneider and Tulip (2019) for a discussion on the elevated uncertainty around economic projections.\n15 Greenspan (2004) and Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n16 See, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2002, 2006) and Wieland (2006). Uncertainty about the natural rate of\nunemployment was a key factor coming out of the Great Recession (Kocherlakota 2010, Lacker 2012, and Daly et al.\n2012). Currently, uncertainty about the neutral rate of interest has risen; see, for example, Lubik and Matthes (2023)\nand Mericle (2023).\n4\n\nAnd we need to be collectively up to the task.\n5\n\nReferences\nBank of England. 2023. “Monetary Policy Summary and Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\nMeeting.” Report, November 2.\nBarlevy, Gadi. 2009. “Policymaking under Uncertainty: Gradualism and Robustness.” Federal Reserve\nBank of Chicago, Economic Perspectives 33(2).\nBech, Morten, and Aytek Malkhozov. 2016. “How Have Central Banks Implemented Negative Policy\nRates?” Bank for International Settlements, BIS Quarterly Review, March.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2004. “Gradualism.” Remarks presented at luncheon cosponsored by Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco, Seattle Branch, and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, May 20.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2007. “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty.” Speech presented at the 32nd Annual\nEconomic Policy Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (via videoconference), October 19.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2020. “The New Tools of Monetary Policy.” American Economic Review 110(4), pp. 943–\n983.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2022. “Commentary: Nobel Winner Bernanke: Why the Fed Didn’t Act Faster to Rein In\nInflation.” Barron’s, October 22.\nBlinder, Alan S. 2006. “Monetary Policy Today: Sixteen Questions and about Twelve Answers.” Princeton\nUniversity Center for Economic Policy Studies Working Paper 129, July.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2023. “Federal Open Market Committee Reaffirms Its\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” Press release, February 1.\nBrainard, William C. 1967. “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy.” American Economic Review:\nPapers and Proceedings 57(2), pp. 411–425.\nCevik, Serhan, and João Tovar Jalles. 2023. “Eye of the Storm: The Impact of Climate Shocks on Inflation\nand Growth.” International Monetary Fund Working Paper 87, April.\nClarida, Richard H., Burcu Duygan-Bump, and Chiara Scotti. 2021. “The COVID-19 Crisis and the Federal\nReserve’s Policy Response.” In Monetary Policy and Central Banking in the Covid Era, eds.

    "text": "FINAL\n“Beyond Fairness: The Value of an Inclusive Economy”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nLos Angeles World Affairs Council & Town Hall\nLos Angeles, CA\nOctober 15, 2019\n12:30PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you so much for the invitation to be here. It’s a real honor.\nThe issues of our day require a commitment to dialogue. Allowing\ndiverse groups to discuss, debate, and learn raises the best ideas and creates\nbetter outcomes.\nThe Los Angeles World Affairs Council and Town Hall Los Angeles have\npromoted such dialogue for decades. And now that you’ve joined forces, I\nknow your legacy will grow even more. I’m personally delighted to be one of\nthe first speakers of this new partnership.\nToday, I’m going to talk about one of the most critical issues of our day:\neconomic growth. How we are growing now… growth we’ve experienced in\nthe past… and what factors could temper or spur our growth in the future.\nBut before I begin, I need to give the standard disclaimer: the remarks\nI’m about to deliver are my own and don’t necessarily reflect the views of\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nFINAL\nCurrent conditions\nSo let’s start with growth today. How’s the economy doing?\nHere, the news is largely positive. The economy continues to expand at a\nsolid pace. Job growth is strong, unemployment is low, consumer spending is\nhealthy, and households remain confident. These are all really good signs.\nOn the other hand, we’ve yet to achieve our inflation goal on a sustained\nbasis. And a number of headwinds – such as trade uncertainty and slower\nglobal growth – have started to gust. This has caused manufacturing and\nbusiness investment to soften considerably over the course of the year.\nTo ensure we sustain the expansion against these headwinds, the Fed\nhas adopted a more accommodative monetary policy position – cutting the\nfederal funds rate in both July and September. This accommodation should\nhelp the economy continue to grow so that we can make further progress on\nour mandated goals of full employment and price stability.\nDrags on future growth\nBut what is the pace of growth we’re trying to hit? What’s sustainable?\nThis number has changed dramatically over time. During the 60 years\nprior to the Great Recession, GDP growth averaged around 3.5 percent.\nDuring the current expansion, growth has averaged only 2.3 percent.\nAnd this slower pace, far from being an anomaly, is expected to continue. Most\neconomists and forecasters, including me, predict GDP growth will average a\nbit under 2 percent for the foreseeable future.1\n1 Board of Governors (2019). The median of FOMC member projections of longer-run growth is 1.9\npercent.\n2\n\nFINAL\nSo what’s going on? Why is America’s economy expanding at a much\nslower pace than it used to?\nTo explain, we need to look at the fundamental drivers of economic\ngrowth: productivity and the labor force.\nLet’s first consider productivity growth. Although it’s fluctuated over\ntime, it’s generally contributed a little over 1 percentage point to overall GDP\ngrowth since the 1970s. It’s forecast to do about the same going forward. So\nthe reason for slower growth likely isn’t productivity.2\nLabor force growth tells a different story. In the 1970s, when the U.S.\npopulation was increasing rapidly and women were entering the workforce in\nlarge numbers, labor force growth alone averaged 2.7 percent annually. That\nmeans – even if productivity growth had been zero – the economy would have\nexpanded at 2.7 percent. That’s faster than the pace of our current expansion.\nSince that peak, the number has come down substantially. The labor\nforce has grown less than 0.5 percentage point annually for the past decade –\nand it’s forecast to stay that way for at least another ten years.3\nMuch of this decline in labor force growth is due to simple demographic\nchanges. Our population is aging. Fewer babies are being born. This dynamic\nisn’t unique to the United States – countries around the world are\nexperiencing similar trends.\nBut there’s something that is different in America. We’ve experienced a\ndecline in labor force participation for people between the ages of 25 and 54 –\nwhat we often call prime-age workers. And right now, there is a smaller\n2 Fernald and Li (2019).\n3 Congressional Budget Office (2019) and Fernald and Li (2019).\n3\n\nFINAL\nfraction of this group working or actively seeking work than we had back in\nthe late 1980s and 1990s.\nThis raises an important question: why aren’t more prime-age\nAmericans working?\nThere isn’t a simple answer. There’s a whole host of issues at play.\nOn one end of the spectrum, research suggests that some of the drop\nmay be attributed to wealthier families choosing to have only one earner.4 So\nfamilies with the financial ability to make these work-life choices may account\nfor some of the lost labor force participation.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, many people stay home to take care\nof children not out of choice, but out of necessity. Rising childcare costs and\nlack of access to parental leave likely contribute to lower labor force\nparticipation rates, especially among women.5\nThen there’s the changing labor market, which is leaving many people\non the sidelines – wanting to work, but not having the skills or education to\nkeep pace with the ever-evolving economy.6\nMore jobs currently require a bachelor’s degree than a high school\ndiploma.7 Unfortunately, college completion rates haven’t kept up with\ndemand. Recent data tells us only 37 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds have a\ncollege education.8 And we see that much of the decline in prime-age\nworkforce participation is concentrated among individuals who lack a college\ndegree.9\n4 Hall and Petrosky-Nadeau (2016).\n5 Daly et al. (2018) and Blau and Kahn (2013).\n6 Valletta and Barlow (2018) and Charles, Hurst, and Schwartz (2019).\n7 Carnevale, Jayasundera, and Gulish (2016).\n8 National Center for Education Statistics (2018).\n9 See Tuzemen (2018), who focuses on prime-age men.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThese are just a few of the factors driving down labor force participation\nin the United States. We could also talk about the talent being lost to opioid\naddiction. Or geographic mismatches that leave rural communities with\naffordable housing and few jobs, and urban communities with plentiful jobs\nand skyrocketing housing costs.\nWhatever the reason, we have more people sitting on the sidelines than\nin the past. This poses obvious problems for individuals and families – but it\nalso poses problems for our economy.\nAbsent a surge in productivity growth, slow growth in the workforce is\ngoing to be a significant structural restraint on America’s economic future.\nThe present doesn’t have to define the future\nSo what can we do? Are we really destined to grow at just 2 percent\nmoving forward? The answer is likely yes… unless we make significant\nchanges that better engage all that talent we’re leaving on the sidelines. This\nwill require a concerted effort from many stakeholders – including the Federal\nReserve.\nAt the Fed, our job is to support a healthy economy and achieve the dual\nmandate goals of full employment and price stability. The logic of our mandate\nis that a strong economy benefits everyone. And we can see this in the current\nexpansion.\nTen years of sustained growth have reduced unemployment rates to\nnear historic lows and pulled millions of Americans back into the labor force.\nThis long and robust expansion has been particularly beneficial to historically\nless-advantaged workers, including African Americans, Hispanics, and those\nwith less than a college degree.\n5\n\nFINAL\nThis makes sense. When labor markets are tight, as they are now,\nbusinesses have to compete for workers and find new ways to fill jobs. They\nrecruit more intensively, adjust hiring standards, and look to a broader pool of\npotential employees. This creates new opportunities for less advantaged\nworkers and allows them to get a foothold in the labor force.10 Indeed, the\ndata tell us that the strength of the current expansion has narrowed long-\nstanding gaps between more and less advantaged groups.11\nBut while these gaps are narrowing, they still persist. And monetary\npolicy alone isn’t enough to close them. Reducing the structural barriers that\nlimit workforce participation or keep individuals from reaching their full\npotential requires taking a hard look at some of our social and workplace\npolicies.\nThere are any number of examples we could consider, but I’d like to\nfocus on two from recent research.\nThe first looks at women. In the mid-1990s, a gap began to form in the\nparticipation rates of women in the United States and Canada. By 2017, the\nprime-age participation rate for American women was 8 percentage points\nlower than for similar women in Canada. This is a startling difference. It\nrepresents about 5 million U.S. women who could be in the labor force. A\ngrowing body of work suggests that this difference can be attributed in part to\nCanada’s generous parental leave policies and childcare subsidies, which\nallow women to remain attached to the labor market after child birth.12\n10 Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n11 Aaronson et al. (2019).\n12 Daly et al. (2018).\n6\n\nFINAL\nMy second example relates to educational attainment and career\nopportunities. African Americans and Hispanics receive four-year degrees at\nabout half the rate of whites.13 And even when they do get degrees, their\ncareer paths have a flatter trajectory.14 In economics parlance, we call this is a\nmisallocation of talent.\nBut how costly is this sort of misallocation? It’s hard to know in real\ntime, but we can look to history for some indication. Researchers at Stanford\nand the University of Chicago examined growth in U.S. per capita output\nbetween 1960 and 2010. They asked how much of that growth was due to the\nremoval of structural barriers, such as direct discrimination, lower school\nquality in minority communities, and financial obstacles that kept less-\nadvantaged people from pursuing high-paying careers in fields like medicine\nand law. The findings were striking. They estimated that the removal of\nstructural barriers accounted for up to 40 percent of the gains in U.S. per\ncapita output.15\nSo talent misallocation affects our bottom line. This suggests that\nequalizing educational attainment rates and career opportunities for less\nadvantaged groups could produce a considerable economic boost.\nOne person at a time\nUp until now, I’ve talked about what institutions can do to help get\ntalent off the sidelines and into the labor force. But I want to end with what\npeople can do. Because this is what gives me the most hope.\n13 National Center for Education Statistics (2018).\n14 Daly et al. (2017).\n15 Hsieh et al. (2019).\n7\n\nFINAL\nLet me take you to Firebaugh, California, about four hours north of here\nin Fresno County. It’s a rural agricultural community. Many of the people\nliving there don’t speak English as their first language. It’s one of the poorest\nregions in America.\nAnd yet… 97 percent of Firebaugh’s kids graduate from high school.\nThat’s 12 percentage points higher than the national average. And most of\nthem go on to college or other post-secondary study.16\nSo how do they do it? The entire community of Firebaugh – from\nparents to teachers to students to local leaders – have made education a\nsingular priority.\nBut they’re not the only one.\nBarrio Logan, near downtown San Diego, is a mostly Latinx community.\nThe average annual income for a family of four there is $25,000. Only 38\npercent of adults have a high school diploma.

We treat suicide as a choice variable, conditional on exogenous risk\nfactors, reflecting one’s assessment of current and expected future utility. Using this framework we\nexamine whether differences in group-specific suicide rates are systematically related to income\ndispersion, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and income level. The results strongly\nsupport the notion that individuals consider relative income in addition to absolute income when\nevaluating their own utility. Importantly, the findings suggest that relative income affects utility in a two-\nsided manner, meaning that individuals care about the incomes of those above them (the Joneses) and\nthose below them (the Smiths). Our results complement and extend those from studies using subjective\nsurvey data or data from controlled experiments.\nKeywords: Relative income, interpersonal comparisons, interdependent preferences, suicide,\nhappiness.\nJEL Codes: I31, D6, H0, J0\n\nKeeping Up with the Joneses and Staying Ahead of the Smiths\nEvidence from Suicide Data\n1. Introduction\nA large and growing theoretical literature, spanning several disciplines, posits that individuals’\nhappiness is affected by their relative standing–the relative income hypothesis.1 Empirical work on the\nimportance of relative income is much more limited and generally reliant on analyses of subjective well-\nbeing surveys or observations from controlled experiments. While these studies point to a role for\nrelative income in the utility function, their subjective nature (in the case of happiness surveys) or\nartificial and nonrandom environments (in the case of experiments) limit their acceptance as evidence of\nthe relative income hypothesis. In the absence of strong proof, most theoretical and empirical researchers\ncontinue to model individuals as considering only their own income in formulating utility.\nMaking such an assumption is not costless, however. Several authors have shown that including\nrelative income in standard models of individual utility can alter conventional wisdom regarding optimal\neconomic interventions.2 Others have argued that puzzling macro wage dynamics and unemployment\nfluctuations (Akerlof and Yellen (1990) and movements in asset prices (Abel 1990) can be explained by\nallowing for relative income effects on individual utility. Still others have noted that whether economic\ngrowth is welfare enhancing or not depends on whether individuals are allowed to compare themselves to\na benchmark level of consumption (Easterlin 1974). Finally, much of the debate over rapid increases in\nincome inequality hinges on whether individuals care about their relative ranking. If preferences are\ninterdependent, increases in inequality can have an independent negative effect on welfare even when\nabsolute income rises for everyone.\n1For example Veblen 1899; Duesenberry 1952; Easterlin 1974; Abel 1990; Gali 1994; Kahneman and\nTversky 1996; Becker and Rayo (2004).\n2For example see Boskin and Sheshinski 1978; Layard 1980; Oswald 1984; Ng 1987; Seidman 1987;\nIreland 1998; Ljungqvist and Uhlig 2000; and Abel 2003.\n-1-\n\nThe importance of this unsettled issue suggests that further examinations are warranted. We\ncontribute to this literature in two ways. Responding to limitations inherent in survey and experimental\ndata, we first examine an alternative measure of individual happiness (unhappiness)–suicide deaths.\nTreating suicide as a “revealed preference” regarding current life satisfaction and assessed value of future\nlife, we examine how utility is affected by own and relative income. We then extend the typical empirical\ntest of the relative income hypothesis, which focuses on overall inequality, and investigate whether\nrelative income effects differ across the income distribution; specifically, we consider whether inequality\nin the upper and lower tails affects suicide risk differently.\nOur basic model relates group-level suicide rates, where groups are defined by\ncounty×age×race×sex cells, to group-level controls and various county-level measures of absolute and\nrelative income. Our use of county-level income measures follows others in the literature and assumes\nthat the relevant reference group for interpersonal comparison is a local geographic area. Consistent with\nprior work, results from this model confirm a weak role for overall inequality. The importance of income\ndispersion reveals itself when overall inequality is decomposed into its upper and lower tail components.\nIn these regressions, inequality has a statistically significant and economically important effect on suicide\nrisk. We find that increases in upper tail inequality raise suicide risk while increases in lower tail\ninequality lower suicide risk. These results hold across an array of robustness checks on econometric\nspecification, data and sample restrictions, and measurement choices. Moreover, the results are unique to\nsuicide deaths and not present for other causes of mortality.\nBased on estimates that place the modal suicide victim in the middle of income distribution\n(consistent with the modal members of the general population), we interpret the opposite and significant\nimpacts of upper and lower tail inequality as supportive of the notion that individuals look to others when\nevaluating their own utility and, in fact, look both ways, caring about the incomes of those above and\nthose below them. While our semi-aggregate data do not allow us to directly verify this view, we are able\n-2-\n\nto confirm it using a individual-level data set constructed from actual information on geographic location,\ndemographics, and other controls from the death records combined with estimates of individual income\nobtained from a nonparametric matching process applied to decennial Census data.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the empirical work\non relative income and utility and discuss how information on suicide fits into and expands the literature.\nWe lay out our theoretical framework and motivate our empirical strategy in Section 3. The data sets we\nconstruct and use are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we present our main results and assess their\nrobustness. A summary of our findings and the conclusions we draw are in Section 6.\n2. Empirical Tests of the Relative Income Hypothesis\n2.1 Existing Literature\nAlthough the idea that relative income can affect utility is more than a century old, the empirical\nliterature on the topic has emerged only recently. Empirical investigations generally can be grouped into\ntwo types. The first set consists of controlled experiments contrived to elicit participants’ reactions to\nimposed hierarchies. In these experiments, performed on human and primate subjects, researchers have\nlooked for subjects’ negative reactions to the presence of a hierarchy, i.e., “inequality aversion,” and/or\nfor reactions to subjects’ relative placement within a hierarchy, i.e., “interdependent preferences”\n(Engelmann and Strobel 2004; Brosnan and deWaal 2003; Alpizar, Carlsson, and Johansen-Stenman\n2005). Although such experiments consistently find that inequality and relative income matter, the\nrelatively small sample and contrived nature of these experiments make their results difficult to\ngeneralize.\nThe second vein of empirical work on relative income exploits information gathered from surveys\nof happiness and/or life satisfaction. Research using these data focuses on the relationship between\nhappiness and relative position, generally measured as relative consumption, wages, or income. Along\n-3-\n\nthese lines researchers have looked at relative wages and job satisfaction (Clark and Oswald 1996;\nBrown, Gardner, Oswald, and Qian 2004), and individual happiness and local, regional, and national\nincome (Helliwell 2002; Luttmer 2005; Tomes 1986; and Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2005). Like those from the\nexperimental literature, results from investigations of happiness data lend support to the relative income\nhypothesis. However, concerns about the quality of data on self-reported happiness (Brekke 1997 and\nOsmani 1993; see Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001 for a broader critique of subjective survey data) have\nlimited the broad acceptance of results on relative income and interpersonal comparisons. These\nconcerns, involving language ambiguities (respondents may not all agree on the exact meaning of terms\nlike “happiness” and “life satisfaction”), scale comparability (is one person’s “very satisfied” higher,\nlower, or equal to another person’s “satisfied”?), ambiguity regarding the time period over which\nrespondents base their answers, and respondent candidness, are ones overcome in data on suicide deaths.\n2.2 Suicide Data as an Alternative\nSuicide data provide an alternative measure of happiness (unhappiness) with several advantages\nover experiments or surveys of happiness.3 First, suicide can be thought of as a revealed choice made by\nindividuals who have examined the value of continuing to live versus exiting.4 In studies of consumer\nchoice, using observed revealed choices is thought to be preferable to relying on individual self-reports of\ntheir feelings or preferences. Second, suicide data are comparably measured across individuals and\nregions and over time. Third, in the United States, data on suicides are publicly available and complete,\n3As Oswald (1997) puts it, “suicides represent choices in response to (un)happiness that are intrinsically\nmore compelling than replies made to happiness survey questions, and data that, by their nature, cannot be generated\nin a laboratory experiment.”\n4Here we are assuming that suicide decisions are not always the result of irrational and impulsive actions.\nIf our assumption fails to hold, i.e., suicide is a totally irrational and impulsive action, we should find no affect of\nrelative income (or any economic factor) in our analysis.\n-4-\n\ncovering the universe of reported suicides by year.5\nDespite these advantages, suicide data are not perfect. Suicide victims presumably are at the\nextreme tail of the distribution of life satisfaction over the population, and may not reflect the preferences\nof the non-suicide population. We address this concern by comparing our empirical results to those\nobtained by studies using subjective survey data. Our results are consistent with these previous studies,\nreinforcing the reliability of inferences based on suicide data. It also is possible that suicide decisions are\nlargely idiosyncratic and unrelated, systematically, to the variables that affect happiness or life\nsatisfaction. While this concern cannot be eliminated a priori, if it is binding we should find no\ncorrelation between relative income and suicide risk–a non-finding.\nIt is important to note that we are not the first to consider how economic variables may influence\nsuicide risk. Hamermesh and Soss (1974) develop an economic theory of suicide and, using cross-\ncountry and cross-state data, find that suicide risk is significantly related to unemployment and decreases\nin permanent income. More recently, Ruhm (2000) considers suicide as one of several causes of death\nand finds that, unlike other negative health outcomes which decline during times of recession, suicide risk\nis either increased or unaffected. In other work, Helliwell (2004) investigates the empirical association\nbetween subjective well-being and suicide rates using cross-country panel data and finds a strong\nnegative relationship. In a related survey article on subjective well-being and suicide risk, Oswald (1997)\nfinds that many variables positively (negatively) associated with reported happiness are negatively\n(positively) associated with suicide risk.6 To our knowledge we are the first to use information on suicide\n5Note, however, that reported suicides are likely an undercount of all true suicides; many experts believe\nthat a significant share of true suicides are misclassified as accidents or “undetermined injuries” (see Moyer, Boyle,\nand Pollock 1989; Rockett and Smith 1999; and Mohler and Earls 1999). In Section 5.3 we confirm that our\nempirical results are insensitive to this potential misclassification.\n6Other recent examples of economists trying to explain suicide behavior include Cutler, Glaeser, and\nNorberg (2000), who attempt to explain the rise in teenage suicide and Brainerd (2001), who documents a strong\nlink between macroeconomic instability and male suicide in the transition economies of the former Soviet Union\nduring the 1990s. See also Marcotte (2003), Stevenson and Wolfers (2000), Chuang and Huang (1997), Huang\n(1996), Kimenyi and Shughart (1986), Hamermesh (1974), and Schapiro and Ahlburg (1982-83).\n-5-\n\nrisk to study the existence and nature of interpersonal comparison.\n3. Framework for Analysis\nAlthough our empirical analysis is done at the group level, our underlying intuition is based on\nindividual behavior. In this section we describe our intuition and how it fits well into the existing\nframework of random utility models. We then lay out the empirical formulation and estimation strategy.\n3.1 Intuition and Basic Model\nWe begin with the premise that all individuals regularly assess the value of future life against the\ncurrent value of exit. For the vast majority of the population, this evaluation never nears the threshold\ndefining exit but rather determines the extent to which someone experiences being happy or not so happy.\nFor the marginal person, the threshold is binding and the evaluation ends in suicide. Assuming that the\nfactors affecting this continuum of happiness can be evaluated using the subset of individuals who\nactually cross the suicide threshold (the marginal individual) we can use data on suicide deaths to directly\ntest hypotheses related to the interpersonal comparisons.\nThis intuition fits nicely into the framework of a random utility model (RUM).7 See Appendix A\nfor a complete model of suicide choice based on the RUM. Here, we lay out the intuition of the model in\norder to illustrate how it leads to empirical specifications at both the individual and semi-aggregate level.\nThe basic random utility model, u(x ) - 2, lets contemporaneous utility for individual i in period t\nit i\nbe a function of a deterministic component, u() and a unobserved idiosyncratic component 2, which can\ni\nbe treated as a random variable.8 The deterministic component u() depends on various state variables\n7Our formulation of the random utility model happens to be quite consistent with research in positive\npsychology Peterson, Park, and Seligman (2005) and behavioral genetics (Lykken, 1999) which argues that\nhappiness is a function of an individual-specific set point, exogenous life conditions, and choice variables like\nvolunteering and leisure time.\n8 2 is analogous to the set point in the positive psychology models.\ni\n-6-\n\ncontained in the vector x. A key parameter in this model is 2, an unobserved, individual-specific\ni\ncomponent that incorporates all possible exogenous risk factors that determine an individual’s\npredisposition to commit suicide. Higher levels of 2 lower utility and increase the probability of suicide.\ni\nIn our framework, 2 incorporates the various genetic, biochemical, psychological, and neurological\ni\npreconditions that have been found to be prevalent in suicidal individuals.9 More generally, the\nindividual-specific component of the RUM allows for the fact that not all individuals will receive the\nsame level of utility from the same level of x, even though x affects every individual in the same way. In\nother words, even if all individuals had the same levels of consumption, leisure, etc. , some individuals\nwould still be “happier” than others and some presumably would still commit suicide. The predisposition\nfactors in 2 are assumed to be pre-determined (genetically or formatively) for the adult age range on\ni\nwhich we focus. Under this assumption, 2 can be thought of as a random disturbance term that is\ni\npredetermined and orthogonal to x – this will be important when we specify our semiaggregated\neconometric model.\nWithin the structure of a RUM, we think of individuals choosing whether or not to commit\nsuicide as a process by which they compare the utility they will receive from exiting today to the present\nvalue of expected future utility. This decision can be described by a very general model under two basic\nassumptions: (1) individuals weigh expected future utility against current exit utility when making the\ndecision as to whether to commit suicide, and (2) there is a weakly exogenous (i.e., predetermined)\n“predisposition” factor, 2, that gives one’s propensity to commit suicide for a given x. The general\ni\nmodel requires no assumptions regarding what determines this predisposition factor.\nUnder these assumptions, the probability that an individual commits suicide is simply the\n9For example, neurologists have found that suicidal patients and suicide victims tend to have particularly\nlow cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a metabolite of serotonin (serotonin\ntransmits nerve impulses across synapses). Low levels of 5-HIAA also have been found in perpetrators of murder,\narson, and other violent behavior linked to impulsiveness (see Hendin 1995). Such characteristics of the individual’s\nbrain are thus captured by 2. Also in 2 would be psychological factors such as manic depression.\ni i\n-7-\n\nprobability that his/her 2 is above some threshold level 2*(x). If 2 -G[ ], then\ni i i\nPr[2 > 2*(x)] = 1 - G[2*(x)] = f(x). Parameterizing f( ) (for example, by assuming the suicide\ni i i i\nprobability is linear in x), a researcher equipped with individual level data on suicide and the variables in\nx could estimate the average effect of any variable in x on the likelihood of suicide, and thus infer the\neffect of the variable on utility.10\n3.2 Empirical Specification–Group-level Analysis\nSince we do not have a complete data set at the individual level we must develop an econometric\nmodel at the group-level. We observe cells (age×race×sex×county×year) with information on suicide\nrates and a host of control x variables. To move from the individual model described above to the group-\nlevel specification we estimate we need to assume that the variables in x are constant across members\nwithin a group.11 Taken this as given means that if x = x, the group level aggregate value of x, then the\ni c\nprobability of suicide within a group is simply Pr[2 > 2*(x)] = 1 - G[2*(x)] = f(x), and the suicide rate\ni c c c\nfor a group is:\nr = f(x) + u. (1)\nc c c\nLinearizing (1), we obtain the basis for the primary estimations we perform in this paper. Equation (1)\ncan be estimated via OLS based on the assumption that the predisposition factors, now reflected in u, are\nc\northogonal to the variables in x.\nc\nOf course, the assumption x = x is unlikely to hold exactly. Realistically, x will vary to some\ni c i\nextent within each group c. As the within-group variance of x increases, our ability to infer individual\ni\nbehavior from the group behavior– the ecological inference problem – will worsen. For example, holding\na group’s mean income constant, the higher the group’s variance of income, the larger the share of\n10Note the disturbance term in the estimation can be interpreted as an estimate of 2.\ni\n11In this case the parameters of the individual model (e.g., the parameters of f( )) can be estimated using the\ngroup level data (see. e.g., King & Rosen 1995).\n-8-\n\nmembers that will have income below any particular level. If this unobserved share of low income\nmembers contributes to the suicide rate and is correlated with observed variables in x, then the ordinary\nc\nleast squares estimator will be inconsistent.12 We address this general concern in Section 5.3 by\nconstructing an, albeit imperfect, individual level data set to evaluate whether the results we obtain using\ngroup-level data are driven by these type of ecological inference problems. We find the individual level\nestimations support the group level results.13\n4. Data Sets and Variable Specification\nThe data used in this paper primarily come from two sources, the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS)–for the mortality data, and the U.S. Census Bureau–for local area data such as income\nand income inequality. The NCHS provides two different data sets, the comprehensive but semi-\naggregate Compressed Mortality Files (CMF) and the less comprehensive but individual-level Detailed\nMortality Files (DMF). The empirical analysis in this paper mainly focuses on the former, though we\nprovide some supporting results based on the DMF data. The following section briefly describes the\nconstruction of our primary data set, based on the CMF data. A more detailed description is supplied in\nAppendix B. Section 4.2 describes the individual level data set we constructed from the DMF.\n4.1 Main, Semi-Aggregate Data\nThe data used in our main empirical analyses are two semi-aggregate data sets (1990 and 2000)\n12We are able to handle the specific concern of this example in some of our regressions by controlling for\nthe poverty rate. Note, however, that this is not a perfect control because (1) the poverty rate does not vary across\ncells within a county and (2) the poverty level is defined nationally, not locally.\n13Ideally we would want to estimate panel data treating 2 as a fixed effect and allowing us to control for\nc\npossible correlation between 2 and x. The key hurdle for estimating a panel based on our data is that a number of\nc c\nkey (time-varying) control variables are not available at the disaggregate level on an annual basis.\n-9-\n\non suicide rates, known correlates of suicide, and measures of absolute and relative income.14,15 The data\nconstruction requires combining information from several different sources. Below we describe the data\nconstruction and variable definitions. The CMF data contain disaggregate counts and rates of all deaths\nrecorded in the United States (including deaths for which individual information is not publicly available)\nfrom 1989 through 2002. We use these data to construct suicide rates by gender-age-race-county cells in\nthe U.S. in 1990 and 2000, measuring age in 10-year reference groups and race as white, black, and\nother.16 We also compute the nonsuicide mortality rate by cell to use as a control variable in our analysis.\nExcluding the nonworking age population we end up with an analysis data file containing about 90,000\ncells (approximately 3,000 counties × 3 races (white, black, other) × 2 genders × 5 ages = 90,000 cells).\nOur control and income variables come primarily from a second source, the Integrated Public Use\nMicrodata Series (IPUMS). IPUMS provides individual level records based on a 5 percent sample of\neach decennial census. Because the geographic identifier in IPUMS is not the county, as in the CMF, but\na Census-constructed area known as a PUMA (Public Use Micro Area) we constructed a bridge\ngeographic variable (separately for 1990 and 2000), which we call “geo,” identifying the smallest\n14Ideally we would like a data set with income, location, age, race, gender, marital status, veteran status, etc.\n(everything potentially in x) over some time period at the individual level for all suicide victims as well as for the\nuniverse, or at least a representative sample, of nonsuicide victims. With such a data set, it would be straightforward\nto estimate the effect on the suicide decision of each potential factor using probit or logit regression analysis.\n15The constraints on our data are as follows. The individual-level data from death records which contain\ninformation on location and certain demographic characteristics do not include information on income. In addition,\nthe available individual level data on the overall population (e.g., from the Current Population Survey or the IPUMS\nsamples of Decennial Census responses) do not provide mortality information. We are aware of only two data\nsources that contain both types of information–the National Health Interview Survey (far too few observations of\nsuicide deaths) and the public-use National Longitudinal Mortality Study (no geographic information).\n16To mitigate the problem that these cell-specific suicide rates are frequently zero (suicide is, after all, a rare\nevent), we include suicides committed in either 1989 or 1990 in our “1990” cross-section and include suicides\noccuring in either 1999 or 2000 in our “2000” cross-section. Including only 1990 and only 2000 deaths in our\nanalysis yielded very similar results to those presented here. Age is defined as a five year age group for those 20-24.\n-10-\n\ncommon area between pumas and counties.17 In 1990, the geo matches to a single county (but many\npuma’s) in 22 percent of cases, to a single puma (but many counties) in 53 percent of cases, to a single\ncounty and single puma in 23 percent of cases, and an aggregate of multiple counties and multiple pumas\nin 2 percent of cases. This distribution is similar in 2000. For the remainder of the paper, we use the\nterms “county” and “geo” interchangeably.\nUsing IPUMS, we construct three different types of variables. First, we compute cell-share\nvariables that give the proportion of a gender*age*race*geo cell with a particular attribute; share\nvariables are computed for marital status, hispanic, veteran status, vietnam veteran status, home\nownership, educational attainment, and white-blue collar occupation. We also compute the\nunemployment rate and the average family size at the same cell level. These variables make up our vector\nof controls in the empirical estimation.\nFinally, we use the IPUMS to compute our main analysis variables–absolute and relative income.\nIn keeping with the bulk of the literature on interpersonal comparisons (e.g., Luttmer 2005 and Ferrer-i-\nCarbonell 2004), we compute income and relative income at the county(geo)-level, implicitly assuming\nthat individuals’ reference groups are locally geographic.18 While this represents just one of several\nreference groups one could test, it is the type of model most commonly tested in the literature. The ratios\nwe compute are the following: 90-10 (90th-percentile of income in the county divided by the 10th-\npercentile of income in the county), 90-50, and 50-10. We use household rather than personal income as\nour baseline under the assumption that individuals self-perceptions are formed based on their household\n17PUMAs are contiguous areas constructed so that they have a population above, but as close as possible to\n100,000. Since the geographic distribution of population changes over time, the 1990 puma’s are not the same areas\nas the 2000 puma’s. As such, the 1990 semiaggregated IPUMS data cannot be longitudinally linked to the 2000 data\nto form a panel data set. Thus, we use the data as repeated cross-sections. Ruggles, et al. 2004 provide details on\nthe IPUMS data.\n18 This level of aggregation translates into a reference group that is countygeo-based rather than cell-based;\nin other words, by selecting this countygeo-aggregation for income we are asssuming that individuals look across all\nresidents of their county rather than just at those with their same characteristics. Numerous reference groups are\npossible. We pursue the empirical significance of competing reference groups in other work.\n-11-\n\nsocioeconomic status rather on their monetary contribution to that socioeconomic status. That said, for\nmost of the analysis in the paper we check the robustness of the results substituting personal for\nhousehold income; the patterns generally are the same.\nWhile these variables compose our main analysis data, for the 1990 cross section, we are able to\nobtain additional county-level control variables from the Census Bureau’s USA Counties data files. Using\nthese files we obtain county-level data on a number of variables: growth in per capita income, variance of\nper capita income (over time), poverty rate, violent crime rate, population density, average commute time,\nshare of population in professional occupations, share in blue collar occupations, share in psychiatric\nfacilities, and the share in prison.19 Finally, borrowing from the public policy literature on the effects of\nfirearm availability, we use state-level data on the share of suicides committed via firearm. The data\ncomes from Miller, Azrael, and Hemenway (2002) and refer to the period 1988-1997.\nOur final data set contains 24,665 observations for 1990. This number comes from 908 geos × 3\nraces (white, black, other) × 2 genders × 5 ages = 27,240 cells, and then subtracting the 1,634 cells with\nno population and the 941 cells with undefined unemployment rates (i.e., with zero labor force). For\n2000, we have 27,720 observations derived from 962 geos.\n4.2 Auxiliary, Individual-Level Data with Estimated Income\nIn addition to the CMF-based data described above, we make use also of the Detailed Mortality\nFiles (DMF), available from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)\n(see U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1992)). The DMF are essentially the data from all\ndeath certificates in the U.S.20 However, for confidentially reasons, the county of the deceased in not\nreported in the public-use files for individuals from counties with population less than 100,000, which\n19As of the time of this writing, these county-level variables are available for 1990 as well as past years;\ndata beyond 1990 is not yet readily available.\n20For later years, these data are called Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) files. These data also are\nsometimes referred to as the Mortality Detail Files.\n-12-\n\naccount for about a quarter of U.S. counties. This feature of the DMF leads us to prefer the more\ncomprehensive CMF data described above for our main empirical analyses trying to identify the effects of\nlocal area income and inequality on suicide risk. Nonetheless, the DMF data can be exploited both to\nperform robustness checks on our main results and to provide an estimate of the income distribution of\nsuicide victims, which is vital to interpreting our main results.\nFor both of these purposes it is necessary to know the income of the suicide victims in the DMF.\nAlthough income is not reported on death certificates and hence is not known for the suicide victims in\nthe data, we can estimate their incomes by matching them to persons in the PUMS data. To do this, we\ncombine the DMF data with the PUMS 5% sample of the 1990 census, which we described earlier. The\nmatching procedure works as follows: (1) for each suicide record, find all matching observations in\nIPUMS, matching on county (geo), age, race, sex, hispanic status, education, and marital status; (2)\ncalculate average income (household and personal separately) for this matching cell; and (3) assign this\naverage income to the suicide observation. This procedure provides a reasonably accurate prediction of\nincome. An analysis of variance (not shown) shows that the matching variables jointly explain 24% of\nthe variation in actual income (across the roughly 7 millions observations in the PUMS). County is found\nto have the greatest explanatory power, followed by education and then marital status.\nWith this procedure, we are able to estimate income for 57 percent of the suicide records from\n1989-92, totaling 50,328 suicides (we use more than just 1990 records in order to maximize the number\nof records used in our analyses).21 We use the same matching procedure to obtain estimated income for\nthe non-suicide population (the PUMS sample). For comparability, we use this estimated income in the\n21The main constraining factors here in terms of coverage are county of residence and education. Education\nis simply unknown or unreported on many death certificates. For confidentiality reasons, county of residence (or\noccurrence) is not identified on the public-use DMF data if the county has a population below 100,000. This occurs\nfor roughly a quarter of U.S. counties in 1990, covering slightly more than a quarter of suicides. It should also be\nnoted that some death records include occupation and industry of the deceased, but not enough records contained\nthis information for us to usefully include these variables in our matching procedure.\n-13-\n\nempirical exercises below rather actual income.\n5. Descriptive Statistics and Main Results\n5.1 Descriptive Statistics: Suicide Risk and Model Variables\nThe U.S. suicide rate has been relatively constant since 1950, averaging about 12 per 100,000\npersons (see WHO 2005).22 Looking beneath this average, there is considerable variation in suicide risk\nby gender, age, and race (Figure 1). Men are significantly more likely to commit suicide than are women;\nthis is true across all age groups (panels A and B).23 Suicide rates vary slightly for men across various\nage groups, with the young and old more likely to take their own lives than those in the middle-age range.\nIn contrast, suicide rates for women generally increase with age, although the suicide rate of 55-64 year\nold women slipped below that of 35-54 year olds in 2000. Whites are more likely to commit suicide than\nother races; this is true among both men and women (panels C and D). Among men, blacks are more\nlikely to commit suicide than non-whites of other races. The reverse holds for women.\nThere also is notable variation in suicide rates by region in the U.S. as displayed in panels E and\nF of Figure 1. Suicide rates are lowest in the mid-Atlantic region and highest in the Mountain region of\nthe U.S.24 Separate tabulations, not shown, point to additional variation within regions at the state and\neven the county level. The variation in suicide risk across demographic groups and geographic areas\nprovides us sufficient variation to perform our analysis using semi-aggregated data by gender-age-race-\n22From 1950 to 2000, the U.S. suicide rate has fluctuated within the narrow range of 10.4 to 13.5 per\n100,000.\n23In contrast, mental health scholars have found that women are twice as likely to attempt suicide as men\n(see, e.g., Colt 1991).\n24Hamermesh and Soss (1974) noted that suicide rates during their sample period, 1947-67, were especially\nhigh in the states of the Pacific region. They attributed this to the “restless life often associated with this area.” By\n1990, though, suicide rates in this region were not much different from the national rates. Suicide rates in the\nMountain region, however, were especially high in both 1990 and 2000. A number of researchers in the public\nhealth field have attributed this to the relatively high availability of firearms in the states of this region (see, e.g.,\nMiller, Azrael, and Hemenway 2002).\n-14-\n\ncounty cells.\nThe above patterns are based on the comprehensive CMF data set. In order to get some idea of\nthe income distribution of suicide victims, we now turn to the less comprehensive but individual-level\nDMF-based data set described in Section 4.2 above. Figure 2 plots the distribution of predicted income\nfor working-age suicide victims in our sample against that of the general U.S. working-age population.25\nAs the figure shows, the predicted income distribution of suicide victims (controlling for demographics)\nsits slightly left of the distribution for the general population.26 However, the shape of the distribution is\nquite similar and importantly for our interpretation of the regression results below, the bulk of the\ndistribution of suicide victims is around the middle of the general income distribution.27 We take this as\nsupporting evidence for the notion that middle-income persons, who make up the bulk of the mass of both\nthe suicide population (numerator of suicide rate) and general population (denominator of suicide rate),\nlikely drive variation in the suicide rate, thus allowing our semi-aggregate results below to be interpreted\nas reflecting the behavior of middle-income persons.\nTurning to the explanatory variables in the model, Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for each\nvariable and Table 2 reports the partial correlation of these variables with the suicide rate, controlling for\ngender, age, and race. We begin with the partial correlations to highlight the similarity between patterns\nfound in our semiaggregated data and those found by others using individual-level information. These\ncorrelations then represent the first test of our data and their ability to shed any light on the individual-\n25In order to make the comparison over the same geographic area, the general population distribution\nexcludes individuals from the sparsely-populated counties which are not included in our DMF sample.\n26We also did this matching using education alone and obtained similar results. Full details of both\nestimation strategies are available from the authors upon request.\n27Ideally, one could estimate the income distributions for each and every county (geo) in order to assess\nwhether suicide victims in a given county tend to be massed around that county’s median income. However, there\nare far too few suicide records to be able to reasonably estimate income distributions at such a disaggregate level.\nWe argue that the aggregate relationship between in the suicide income distribution and the general distribution is\ngenerally likely to hold at the county level as well.\n-15-\n\nlevel questions we have posed. The partial correlations confirm several patterns found in the literature on\nindividual suicide risk. For example, using our semi-aggregated data we find a positive and significant\ncorrelation between cell-specific suicide rates and veterans share, divorced share, and the unemployment\nrate (see Kposawa 2001; Charlton, et al. 1992; and Blakely, et al. 2003). Similarly, suicide rates in a cell\nare negatively correlated with the share of college educated persons and the share of persons that are\nmarried. Although rudimentary, these correlations suggest that the semi-aggregated data constructed for\nour analysis produce patterns consistent with the “stylized facts” regarding suicide reported in the\nepidemiology/public health, psychology, and sociology literatures.28\nLooking at the income variables, the partial correlations are suggestive of a relationship between\ncell-specific suicide rates, median income, and each of our three measures of income inequality—the\n90/10, 90/50, and 50/10 interpercentile income ratios. The correlations show a negative relationship\nbetween median income and suicide risk. Interestingly, each of the income inequality measures have a\nsignificantly positive relationship with suicide rates in 1990, but a significantly negative relationship in\n2000. It is these relationships that we will focus on in the remainder of our analysis, and we will find that\nthe discrepancy between 1990 and 2000 does not survive multivariate analysis.\n5.2 Baseline Regression Results\nOur baseline regression, motivated by equation (1), is a cross-sectional weighted GLS regression\nof the suicide rate by gender×age×race×county cells on a full complement of control variables, county\nmedian income, and measures of relative income measured as the ratio of the 90th to the 10th, 90th to the\n50th, and 50th to the 10th percentiles of the distribution of household income. Strong correlations among\nour relative income measures necessitates separate estimation for the 90/10 and for the joint entry of the\n28Partial correlations of the type reported here are actually quite prevalent in these literatures, often even the\nstandard way of summarizing the data. Our multivariate results show that some of these “stylized facts” are not\nrobust to the inclusion of additional variables.\n-16-\n\n90/50 and 50/10.29 Observations are weighted by cell population.\nThe results are shown in Table 3. (Separate results for males and females, which are qualitatively\nsimilar to the full sample results, are shown in Tables A2 and A3). Standard errors, shown in parentheses,\nare obtained from a Huber-White heteroskedasticity-consistent VC matrix allowing correlation of errors\nwithin state clusters. Following the patterns established in the first two tables, the rows, showing\ncoefficients and standard errors for each independent variable, are broken into three sections (for\npresentation purposes) based on the level of disaggregation of the variable.\nBefore discussing the results on relative income, it is worth reviewing the patterns for some of the\ncontrol variables. The coefficients on the race and age variables mostly follow the patterns observed in\nthe descriptive statistics. Even after controlling for various socioeconomic measures and other\nobservables, suicide risk is highest for whites, followed by other, non-black races, and then blacks. The\ncoefficient estimates suggest that, after controlling for other factors such as education and income, the\nsuicide rate for blacks is between 10 and 15 per 100,000 lower than for whites and other races. Over\nthese samples of working age population (20-64), suicide rises with age for women and is more or less u-\nshaped across the age distribution for men. Suicide risk across gender×age×race×county cells rises with\nthe share of divorced individuals in that cell (the omitted category in the regression). All other marital\nstatuses reduce suicide risk, with the largest reduction corresponding to the married and widowed\nstatuses. Suicide risk consistently is highest among cells with higher concentrations of high-school\neducated individuals; risk falls as the share of college educated individuals in the cell increases.\nAvailability of firearms at the state-level, as measured by the share of suicides committed with a firearm\n(the standard method of measuring firearm availability in the public health literature, see Miller, et al.\n2002), is strongly positively associated with the suicide rate in both cross-sections. These patterns in the\ncontrol variables are common across all of the regressions we discuss.\n29Correlations among the income and income inequality measures are shown in Table A1.\n-17-\n\nRegarding the effect of the unemployment rate on suicide, we find a large, statistically significant\nand positive (deleterious) effect for males in both 1990 and 2000; the effect for females is smaller and is\nstatistically significant only in 2000.30 The coefficient estimates suggest that an increase of one\npercentage point in the unemployment rate increases the male suicide rate by about 26 per 100,000, which\nis more than double the aggregate male suicide rate. These results are consistent with the simple partial\ncorrelations in Table 2 and with prior studies focusing narrowly on the unemployment-suicide\nrelationship.31\nIt is interesting to note that the coefficients we obtain on these control variables are remarkably\nconsistent with findings based on subjective well-being data. In particular, Oswald (1997), in\nsummarizing the findings of this literature, states that reported happiness is higher for married persons\nand lower for divorced persons, is increasing with education, and is much lower for the unemployed. On\nthe other hand, our results regarding suicide diverge from those in the subjective happiness literature for\nage (U-shaped with reported happiness) and race (whites have higher reported happiness). These\ndifferences may imply variation in the shapes of the happiness and suicide distributions across age and\nrace groups.\nThe variables that make up the focus of our analysis, median income and measures of relative\nincome, are reported near the bottom of Table 3. Consistent with our earlier partial correlations, we find\ngroup-level suicide rates are negatively associated with county median income. The negative relationship\nbetween suicide and income is consistent with results from the happiness literature which finds reported\n30The unemployment effect for males is larger than for females in both 1990 and 2000, but the difference is\nstatistically significant only in 1990.\n31Hamermesh and Soss (1974) find a positive relationship between the male unemployment rate and the\nmale suicide rate using U.S. aggregate time series data (1947-67); Schapiro and Ahlburg (1982-83) also find such a\npositive relationship using U.S. aggregate data. Most recently, Ruhm (2000) finds that the overall suicide rate is\ncountercyclical using state-level panel data. At the individual level, Kposawa (2001) (using U.S. data) and Blakely,\nCollings, and Atkinson (2003) (using New Zealand data) find that, for a given survey year, the unemployed are more\nthan twice as likely as the employed to commit suicide within the following three years.\n-18-\n\nhappiness to be increasing with income (Oswald 1997, Luttmer 2005). This effect holds for both\nspecifications of the model (with the 90/10 and with the 90/50 and 50/10) and for both time periods, 1990\nand 2000. The results on overall inequality, captured by the 90/10 interpercentile ratio, are insignificant\nin 1990, suggesting little relationship between overall household income inequality in a county and\nsuicide rates of gender×age×race cells within that county. The coefficient on the 90/10 is negative and\nsignificant in 2000, suggesting that for that year, higher overall inequality in a county was associated with\nhigher suicide risk for cell groups in that county.\nColumns 3 and 5 of the table present our key results. These columns show a breakout of overall\ninequality into upper tail inequality–defined as the 90th/50th interpercentile ratio–and lower tail\ninequality–defined as the 50th/10th interpercentile ratio. The results suggest that controlling for\ndifferences in median county income, both upper and lower tail inequality have independent and\nstatistically significant effects on cell-specific suicide risk. Importantly, the results show that inequality\nin the upper tail (90/50 income ratio) raises suicide rates and inequality in the lower tail (50/10 income\nratio) lowers suicide rates. This finding holds in both years of our sample. Specifically, coefficient\nestimates imply that a doubling of the 90/50 ratio is associated with an increase in the suicide rate of 2.5\nper 100,000 in 1990 and 1.7 per 100,000 in 2000. Compared with those magnitudes, the negative effect\non suicide risk of an increase in the 50/10 is about 3 times smaller in 1990 and roughly equal in 2000.32\nAlso worth noting is the relatively high value of the R2's obtained, which on average imply that\nover 40 percent of the variation in suicide rates across county-age-race-sex groups is explained by these\nindependent variables. These high values suggest that there is sufficient systematic variation in suicide to\nmake it a useful variable for analysis. Additional analyses (not shown) show that the demographic\n32Another way of interpreting the magnitudes of these effects is by asking how much the suicide rate\nchanges in response to a one standard deviation change in the 90/50 or 50/10 (these standard deviations are shown in\nTable 1). A one standard deviation change in the 90/50 is associated with an increase in the suicide rate (per\n100,000) of about 0.5 in 1990 and 0.4 in 2000. A one standard deviation change in the 50/10 is associated with an\ndecrease in the suicide rate of about 0.5 in 1990 and 0.8 in 2000.\n-19-\n\ndummy variables alone explain about 37 percent of the variation in suicide rates (in 1990). Adding the\n(non-income) control variables explains an additional 5 percent, and the income variables add another 1\npercent.\nThe baseline results provide very limited evidence of a relationship between overall inequality\n(90/10 measure) and cell-specific suicide rates, suggesting that individuals are not averse to income\ndispersion per se.33 That is, the results are inconsistent with a model of general inequality aversion.34 The\nfindings for the 90/50 and 50/10 are consistent with the hypothesis that utility is a function of both\nabsolute and relative income. Our estimated income distribution for suicide victims, described in Section\n4 above, implies that, on net, the baseline results are driven by behavior of individuals at or near the\nmiddle of the income distribution. This suggests that the upward 90/50 effect and downward 50/10 effect\non the suicide rate is evidence that relative income matters and in a symmetric fashion; at least the median\nindividual looks up and down the income distribution when evaluating utility, and feels worse when\nhe/she falls behind (keeping up with the Joneses) and better when he/she pulls ahead (staying ahead of the\nSmiths). It is important to note that from this model we cannot say why relative income matters to utility.\nIt may be that the income of others (and in turn the utility of others) enters the utility function directly –\ni.e., interdependent preferences – or it could be that relative income enters utility indirectly as a proxy for\nsomething individual such as own income risk. These possible interpretations are discussed in Section 6.\nBefore interpreting our results we test the statistical robustness of the relationships found above\nbetween the suicide rate and upper- and lower-tail inequality and consider other explanations for our\nfindings. We also consider whether our results are artifacts of aggregation and thus not representative of\nindividual behavioral responses. Sections 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 report on the findings from these various tests.\n33In other unreported regressions, we also have found that replacing the 90/10 interpercentile ratio with the\nGini coefficient, as an alternative measure of overall income inequality, does not change this conclusion.\n34Our results have nothing to say about “unfairness aversion,” which, lamentably, sometimes is referred to\nas inequality aversion in other studies.\n-20-\n\n5.3 Statistical Robustness Checks\nTo ensure that the baseline findings are statistically robust, we compare results across different\neconometric specifications, data and sample restrictions, and the inclusion of additional explanatory\nvariables available for the 1990 sample. For ease of presentation we report results only for our key\nvariables: median income and the measures of income inequality.35\nThe first panel of Table 4 reports results from our baseline regression including state fixed\neffects.36 Qualitatively, the inclusion of state fixed effects does not alter our results, though the\nmagnitudes of the coefficient estimates do decline Median income remains a negative and statistically\nsignificant influence on suicide risk. The coefficients on the 90/50 and 50/10 continue to be of opposite\nsign in both periods, and are statistically significant in three of the four cases.\nThe second panel of Table 4 show results from an negative binomial poisson estimation of\nsuicide counts by gender*age*rage*county cells, with cell population as the exposure and controlling for\nthe same set of independent variables as in Table 3. The poisson MLE estimator is a common method for\nanalyzing count data, and the negative binomial poisson (NBP) is typically used when there is a\npreponderance of zeros. Again, the results are not qualitatively different than those from our baseline\n35The patterns for our control variables change little in these alternative specifications of the estimation\nmodel. Full results are available from the authors upon request.\n36A priori, it is not clear whether including state fixed effects is appropriate. On the one hand, the inclusion\nof these fixed effects puts considerable pressure on the data, especially given the preponderance of zeros for the cell-\nspecific suicide rates, and we have attempted to control for measurable conditions across states and counties that\nmay be correlated with our dependent and independent variables. On the other hand, we have no controls for access\nto mental health or other health care treatments and since access to these services may vary by state including state\nfixed effects represents an important check of our results. For example, Daniel Hamermesh pointed out that the use\nof antidepressant drugs are likely taken differentially across states. This differential consumption of anti-depressants\nmay be positively correlated with income and negatively correlated with suicide risk (though the 1990 results should\nbe relatively unaffected by this concern as antidepressent usage was substantially lower at that time). A similar\nargument could be made at the county level, although policies affecting access to health care seem more likely to\nvary by state than by county. Moreover, our key income variables vary by county so this strategy would not work in\nthose regressions.\n-21-\n\nspecification. In the NBP estimation, coefficients greater than one imply a positive influence on suicide\nlikelihood while those less than one indicate a negative influence. The coefficient on median income is\nless than one and significant, consistent with our baseline model.37 Similarly the coefficients on upper\nand lower tail inequality (90/50 and 50/10) indicate opposing effects, with 90/50 inequality associated\nwith higher suicide risk and 50/10 inequality associated with lower suicide risk. Both upper and lower\ntail measures of inequality are statistically significant in both 1990 and 2000.\nThe next two robustness checks concern characteristics of our data and sample. Panel three of the\ntable reports estimates from a sample of cells that excludes the very upper tail of the distribution of\nsuicide rates.38 Excluding the top one percent of suicide rates from our sample does not materially affect\nthe results. The signs, magnitudes, and significance patterns of the coefficients are basically unchanged,\nsuggesting that the baseline findings are not the result of outlier cells. Our second check on the data and\nsample is presented in Panel 4 of the table and focuses on the potential influence of population weighting\non our results. The check involves deleting small-population cells and running the baseline specification\nwithout population weighting. This adjustment has little effect on the results for 1990. In 2000 this\nadjustment eliminates the result on upper tail inequality but has little effect on either median income or\n50/10 inequality.\nThe next panel takes account of the fact that in the United States, deaths are recorded as suicides\nif and only if compelling evidence of intent is established by the police or a coroner (e.g., discovery of a\nsuicide note and/or evidence of intentional, self-inflicted wounds). As such, many epidemiologists,\npsychologists, and sociologists argue that suicide is undercounted in U.S. death records (see, e.g., Moyer,\nBoyle, and Pollack 1989; Rockett and Smith 1999; and Mohler and Earls 2001). Our understanding of\n37Statistical significance of the NBP estimates is evaluated relative to one.\n38We exclude observations above the 99th percentile (100 suicides per 100,000 in 1990 and 114 per 100,000\nin 2000). We also excluded observations above the 95th percentile of the cell specific distribution of suicide rates.\nThe results are similar.\n-22-\n\nthe procedures regarding cause-of-death classification is that suicides lacking clear evidence as such\nlikely are classified as accidents which include deaths from causes such as motor vehicle crashes, drug\noverdoses, and falls. Assuming that accidents do include a meaningful number of misclassified suicides\nwe estimate our baseline model with deaths from suicides and accidents combined. If accidents include\nthese underreported suicides, or more generally reflect the outcome of riskier behavior consistent with\none’s view of the future value of life, we should see patterns on the inequality measures similar to those\nin Table 3. The results for the combined accident-suicide death rate are quite consistent with those for\nsuicide alone. In fact, the magnitude and statistical significance of the 90/50 and 50/10 inequality\ncoefficients are even greater than those for the suicide-only regressions in Table 3. (The higher precision\nlikely owes to the greater unconditional cross-sectional variance of the accident-suicide death rate due to\nthe lower frequency of zeros).\nFinally, we examine whether some omitted, albeit measurable, variable is responsible for the\nresults. For the 1990 sample we are able to incorporate data from the U.S.A Counties database (U.S.\nCensus Bureau 2005) on population density, income growth, and intertemporal income variance by\ngeocounty.39 The last three panels of Table 4 report the results of including these variables (one by one)\nin our baseline model. Including population density in the model does little to change the baseline results,\nsuggesting that the income and income inequality results are not due to urban/rural differences in suicide\nrates and income and/or inequality. The final two panels look at one-year income growth and 10-year\n(backward) income variance. Again, including these variables has little effect on our baseline findings.40\n39We also estimated regressions including other county-level control variables for 1990. These variables\nare the crime rate, the share of the population with a blue collar occupation, the share with a professional occupation,\nshare in a psychiatric institution, share in prison, and the poverty rate. The crime rate has a positive and statistically\nsignificant effect on the suicide rate for females, but not for males; the other three variables were insignificant in all\nregressions. Including these variables had no notable effect on the coefficient estimates or statistical significance of\nthe other variables, thus we excluded them in the presented results in order to facilate comparisons of the 1990\nresults to the 2000 results.\n40We also ran the model with 10-year income growth without effect.\n-23-\n\nLower and upper tail inequality consistently are of opposite signs and significant in each case.\nTaken together the checks in Table 4 confirm our baseline findings that 90/50 and 50/10\nmeasures of income inequality differentially affect cell-specific suicide rates.\n5.4 Alternative Explanations\nNext we ask whether our results are specific to suicide and thus, as we will argue, reflecting\neffects of relative income on utility, or are more generally observed for other causes of death and thus\nmore likely related to some other variable such as access to emergency medical care. Panels A and B of\nTable 5 shows results from our baseline regression estimated on two alternative dependent variables: (1)\nall- cause mortality and (2) deaths from heart failure. All-cause mortality rates are weakly and\ninconsistently linked to median income, and strongly positively associated with inequality, however\nmeasured. The results on all-cause mortality are consistent with those found by other researchers (e.g.,\nRuhm 2000). Importantly, these results depart completely from those for the suicide rate.41\nThe second panel of the table reports results using death rates from heart failure as the dependent\nvariable. Our use of heart attack deaths is meant to test whether our results on suicide risk really owe to\ndifferential access to emergency room care or paramedical care rather than to reactions to relative income.\nResearch has shown that heart attack deaths are correlated with time to treatment (e.g., proximity to\nemergency rooms). If our results on suicide are due to unequal access to emergency rooms such that\nattempted suicides more frequently end in death, then we should see the same pattern for heart attack\ndeaths. Overall, the results show there is much less of an association between median income, income\ninequality, and death rates from heart failure than we found for death rates from suicide. Only in the 1990\nsample are any of our income variables statistically significant. In terms of relative income, the 90/50 and\n50/10 have opposite signs to each other but also opposite signs to the suicide results, suggesting that\n41Ruhm (2000) also finds that suicide differs from other types of mortality in regressions controlling for\neconomic variables.\n-24-\n\n90/50 inequality decreases deaths from heart failure while 50/10 increases deaths from heart failure. Only\nthe 90/50 measure in the 1990 sample is statistically significant. The results on all-cause and heart failure\nmortality support the idea that the relationships we find for suicide risk are entirely unique to suicide and\nmost likely related to relative income concerns in individuals’ utility functions.\nWe have shown that the suicide rates across very disaggregate cells covary systematically with a\nlarger number of economic and non-economic variables. Moreover, they, and they covary in a manner\nconsistent with what one would expect based on findings using subjective well-being data. Based on an\nassortment of robustness checks, the results appear not to be driven by omitted variable bias or by\nmeasurement error in our dependent variable. Parallel examinations of all-cause and heart failure\nmortality show that our findings on upper and lower tail income dispersion are unique to the suicide\nsample. And since suicide represents a very small share of any cell’s population, it is unlikely that our\nresults are driven by reverse causality. Thus, we conclude that the relationships we estimate between the\nincome inequality measures and cell specific suicide rates represent actual effects of upper-tail and\nlower-tail inequality on suicide risk.\n5.5 Artifact of Aggregation?\nAlthough the semiaggregate results hold up to a variety of robustness checks it could be the case\nthat the findings do not reflect underlying behavioral responses of individuals but rather are a misleading\nartifact of aggregation. To examine this possibility we turn to our estimated individual-level data\ndescribed previously. Our objective is to estimate the effects of own income and own income relative to\nreference-group income on the probability of suicide, using probit and logit analyses. These estimations\nare analogous to recent individual-level analyses performed by others using happiness survey data (e.g.,\nLuttmer 2005 or Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2004). We use them as a check on our aggregate results.\nUsing estimated individual data on income, we examine two basic models regressing individual\nsuicide probability on own income, own income relative to reference-group (e.g., county) income, and a\n-25-\n\nset of control variables analogous to those in our earlier, semi-aggregate regressions. The first has a\nsimilar structure as the earlier regressions though at much more disaggregate level and using the\nindividual-level Detailed Mortality Files as opposed to the more comprehensive but semi-aggregate\nCompressed Mortality Files. We compute suicide rates at the least aggregate level possible given the\nvariables available in the DMF–the level defined by county, age, race, sex, hispanic status, education, and\nmarital status. We use the number of individuals (times 20) in the IPUMS five-percent sample in each\ncell as a (admittedly noisy) measure of cell population used in the denominator of the suicide rates. We\ninterpret these suicide rates as estimates of the suicide probability for individuals within these cells.\nCombining these suicide rates with predicted income for these individuals (which varies at the\nsame level of aggregation) and control variables analogous to those in our earlier regressions (e.g., cell\nunemployment rate, share of cell that are Vietnam War veterans, and share that own their home), we\nregress the suicide probability on own (cell) income, average county income, key demographic dummies,\nand other control variables. Note that in our regressions using the DMF-PUMS data, we exclude\ndummies for the key income predictors used in our income estimation procedure, namely, county,\neducation, and marital status. Otherwise, due to mulicollinearity between these variables and predicted\nincome, there would be little independent variation with which to identify the coefficient of own income.\nOur strategy in these regressions amounts to treating estimated income as a summary statistic for\nsocio-economic status.\nThe results of this regression are reported in Table 6. Consistent with the results from the semi-\naggregate analysis, we find that suicide risk falls as own income rises, but rises with the income of one’s\ncounty. This result is consistent with those from our semi-aggregate regressions.\nThe OLS regression is nearly equivalent to combining the suicide records (with predicted\nincome) with the individual records from IPUMS and performing an individual-level probit or logit\nestimation of the probability of commiting suicide as a function of estimated own income, average county\n-26-\n\nincome, and controls. This is particularly true if one clusters on cell and accounts for the fact that each\nIPUMS individual represents 20 individuals from the wider population.42 Panel B of Table 6 reports\nresults from such a probit regression (logit estimation yielded nearly identical results). The coefficients\nrepresent the marginal effects evaluated at the mean. Again, the coefficients are of the expected sign and\nare significant.43\nImportantly, these individual-level results are not only consistent with our earlier, semi-aggregate\nresults, but also are remarkably consistent with recent empirical analyses using subjective well-being\nsurvey data. Most notably, Luttmer (2005) matches data on self-reported happiness (7-point scale),\nhousehold income, and demographic controls for about 10,000 individuals to average income data at the\nPUMA level. He finds that, controlling for own income, PUMA income is negatively associated with\nhappiness.44\n6. Assessment of the Results and Discussion\nUsing a unique data set on suicide risk, we find compelling evidence in support of the idea that\nindividuals care about their own income and the income of others around them. These results are\nconsistent with the findings of other studies relying on data from happiness surveys and/or controlled\nexperiments. These findings, from a baseline regression of cell-specific suicide rates and relative income,\nare remarkably resilient to changes in model specification, sample selection, and to the inclusion of\nadditional variables related to income. We also find that these findings are unique to suicide as a cause of\n42For the sake of robustness, we in fact cluster on more than cell. We cluster at the level of county.\n43Note that for the probit results in Table 6 we display the p-values of the coefficient estimates (with respect\nto the null that the coefficients are equal to zero) instead of standard errors as the latter are extremely small and\nhence difficult to display.\n44Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005) obtains similar results using German data. Neither Ferrer-i-Carbonell nor\nLuttmer address the issue of asymmetric effects for those above and below reference-group income.\n-27-\n\ndeath, shedding doubt on explanations of the findings based on access to emergency or other medical\ncare.\nBased on estimates of income that show the bulk of the suicide victims come from the middle of\nthe income distribution, we interpret our results as evidence that relative income, possibly in addition to\nabsolute income, affects utility and does so in a two-sided manner. Utility rises as one’s income pulls\naway from the bottom of the distribution in one’s local area and falls as one moves away from the top of\nthe local distribution. While this could reveal a form of interdependent preferences whereby individuals\nenviously look up at the Joneses and gratefully look down upon the Smiths, an alternative interpretation is\nthat relative income proxies for income risk. If negative and positive shocks to income are equally likely\nbut the distribution of shocks is proxied by the observed ex-post income distribution, then middle-income\nindividuals may want a long distance between themselves and the bottom of the income distribution (e.g.,\nthe 10th percentile) – i.e., a low risk of falling to that bottom income level – but desire a very short\ndistance between themselves and the most well off – i.e., a high probability of rising to that high income\npoint. Both this risk story and the interdependent preferences hypothesis are consistent with the observed\neffect of relative income on utility. Distinguishing between these as well as other possible interpretations\nare subjects for future research.\n-28-\n\nAppendix A. An Individual Model of Suicide Choice\nIn Section 3.1, we described the basic intuition of the individual level model of suicide that forms\nthe theoretical framework guiding the empirical works we perform in this paper. This Appendix lays out\nthat model in detail.\nOur model is based on the random utility model, which specifies that individual utility has the\nform u(x ) - 2. That is, contemporaneous utility for individual i in period t is a function of a\nit i\ndeterministic component, u() and a unobserved random component 2. The deterministic component u()\ni\ndepends on various state variables contained in the vector x. As is standard, we assume u() is monotonic\nin each variable in x, strictly concave, and twice-differentiable. Mathematically, this can be written as the\nfollowing dynamic programming problem:\nV(x |θ)=max {(1−S )⎡u(x )+θ+βEV(x |θ)⎤ } (1)\nt i it ⎣ it i i t i,t+1 i ⎦\nS\nit\nsubject to the boundary conditions\nV(x |θ)=0; S =1⇒ (S =1) ∀ s >0\niT i it i,t+s .45\nIn the above equations, S is the choice variable. It takes on the value 1 if suicide is chosen, 0 otherwise.\nit\nThe objective function above assumes that the individual receives zero instantaneous utility if he or she\nchooses suicide. Setting the instantaneous utility from suicide equal to zero is an innocuous\nnormalization; individual differences in this utility value can be thought of as part of 2, the individual-\ni\n43In the present set-up, there is no explicit role for age. To incorporate age effects, as in Hamermesh and\nSoss (1974), the bellman’s equation could be augmented as follows to account for the probability of dying next\nperiod (by nonsuicide):\nV(x |θ)=max{(1−S )[u(x )−θ+βP(T −t)EV(x |θ)]} ,\nit i it it i i t it+1 i\nSit\nwhere P(T - t) is the probability of surviving (by nonsuicide) to next period given the individual’s maximum\nremaining lifespan, T - t. It should be the case that P(0) = 0, P(T-t) $ 0, and P N( ) > 0. This implies that V(x) is\nt\ndecreasing in t, which is equivalent to age in this context. However, age could itself be a variable in x affecting\nutility. Therefore, our empirical analysis will allow for age effects with no restriction on sign.\n-29-\n\nspecific component of utility.46 $ is the discount factor and EV(x ) is the expected value of future\nt i,t+1\nutility conditional on this period’s decision, S. Hereafter, let V denote V(x |2).\nt it it i\nThe first boundary condition states that the value function, V, is equal to zero in the final period,\nT, of the individual’s natural life span. The second boundary condition states that suicide is an\nirreversible decision: choosing death today guarantees death in all future periods.\nThis dynamic programming problem can be solved recursively. Let Vc denote the maximal\ni,t+1\nvalue in period t+1 conditional on S = 0, and let S denote the expectation as of t of the suicide\nit i,t+1,t\ndecision next period conditional on S = 0, i.e., S = E [S | S =0]. This can be thought of as the\nit i,t+1,t t it+1 it\nindividual’s self-assessed probability of committing suicide next period. The solution for any period t <\nT is:\n⎧1, if u(x )−θ +βEVc <0⎫\nS* =⎨ it i t it+1 ⎬ , where (2)\nit ⎩0, otherwise ⎭\n⎧T−(t+1) ⎫\nE t V t c +1 =E t ⎨ ∑ βj⎡ ⎣ u t+1+j (x t+1+j )−θ i ⎤ ⎦ ( 1−S t+1+j,t+j ) ⎬. (3)\n⎩ j=0 ⎭\nThis solution equation indicates that an individual will choose suicide when present and expected future\nutility (conditional on not choosing suicide this period) is less than the utility received from choosing\nsuicide (recall that 2 is the idiosyncratic utility component net of whatever instantaneous utility, either\ni\npositive or negative, one receives upon committing suicide). The conditional expected future utility is the\nexpected value of the discounted sum of future utilities, where each future utility value is weighted by the\nprobability of not committing suicide in that period.\n44The instantaneous utility from suicide may differ across individuals and could arguably be positive or\nnegative (relative to natural death). Religious beliefs regarding the sinfulness of suicide or compassion for mourning\nloved ones left behind, for instance, would yield a negative instantaneous utility from suicide. On the other hand,\none might receive some satisfaction in the sympathy and attention one might receive posthumously, implying a\npositive value.\n-30-\n\nConditional on x and $, whether u(x )−θ+βEVc (x |θ) is positive or negative will be\nit it i t it+1 it i\ncompletely determined by the value of the idiosyncratic component 2. For a given x , there exists a\ni it\ncritical value 2*(x ) above which u(x )−θ+βEVc (x |θ) is negative and the individual chooses to\nit it i t it+1 it i\ncommit suicide. The effect of any variable contained in the x vector on the suicide decision can be found\nit\nby partially differentiating 2*(x ) with respect to that variable using the implicit function theorem47:\nit\n⎡ ⎤\n∂θ* ⎢∂u ∂EVc ⎥ ∂F\nt =−⎢ t +β t t+1⎥/ , (4)\n∂x ∂x ∂x ∂θ*\nit ⎢(cid:78)it (cid:8)(cid:9)i(cid:10)t ⎥ t\n⎢⎣\nA B\n⎥⎦\nwhere from (3) we get\n∂E t V it c +1 = T− ∑ (t+1) βj ⎡ ⎢ ∂u t+1+j ( 1−S ) − ∂S i,t+1+j,t+j u ⎤ ⎥ .\n∂x it j=0 ⎣ ∂x it i,t+1+j,t+j ∂x it i,t+1+j ⎦\nBy construction, ∂F ∂θ* <0(cancelling out the negative sign in front of the brackets in (4)), so the sign\nt\nof ∂θ* ∂x will equal the sign of the two expressions in the brackets of equation (4), which we’ve\nt it\nlabeled A and B. A represents the effect of the variable x on contemporaneous utility; we call this the\nit\ncontemporaneous effect. B represents the effect that x has on future values of x as well as other\nit i\nvariables in x; we call this the signal effect. For the variables considered in the empirical analysis of this\npaper, the signal effect is likely to be near zero and hence the overall effect will be dominated by the\ncontemporaneous effect. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that effects of variables on utility and\n45The implicit function is the solution for 2* of the equation:\nF(x ,θ*)= ( u(x )−θ* +βEVc(x |θ*) ) =0.\nt it t it+1\n-31-\n\nsuicide that we identify represent the net effect of these two countervailing forces.48\n46The potential existence of the signal effect would not be recognized if one modeled individual behavior as\ndepending on a single function representing remaining lifetime utility, as in Hamermesh and Soss (1974). In that\ncase, the effect of a variable on lifetime utility is assumed to be unambiguous.\n-32-\n\nAppendix B: Data Construction\nIngredient 1: Suicide and Nonsuicide Mortality Rates by County-Race-Sex-Age\nThe binding constraint in this data exercise is population data, which is necessary for the\ndenominator of any by-cause mortality rate. The narrowest possible level of aggregation for U.S.\npopulation data from the Census Bureau is a county-race-sex-age cell.49 Suicide frequencies at the same\nlevel can be computed from individual death records. The Compressed Mortality Files (CMF),\nconstructed by the National Center for Health Statistics, contains these frequencies along with the Census\npopulation data. The CMF data cover all deaths occurring in the United States (including deaths for\nwhich individual information is not publicly available), currently for years between 1989 and 2002. From\nthis data, we constructed suicide rates for all county-race-sex-age cells in the U.S. in 1990 and 2000.50\nAge here refers to a 10-year age group (except the 5-year group 20-24). Since mortality risk may be a\nfactor in the suicide decision (as could be captured in our model by the P(T-t) term in footnote 6), we also\nconstruct the nonsuicide mortality rate at the same cell level. Excluding the non-working-age population\n(< 20 or > 64), there are roughly 3,000 counties × 3 races (white, black, other) × 2 genders × 5 ages =\n90,000 cells.\n49An alternative to using Census population data, which would allow for an even more disaggregate cell\n(e.g., by education as well) would be to impute population based on the IPUMS 5 percent sample of the 1990\ndecennial census. However, the population estimates would be frequently be based on extremely small sample cells\nand hence would be extremely noisy. Keeping these concerns in mind, we nonetheless do exactly such an\nimputation later in the paper as a check on whether our main results could be driven by aggregation bias/ecological\nfallacy.\n50To mitigate the problem that these cell-specific suicide rates are frequently zero (suicide is, after all, a rare\nevent), we include suicides occuring in either 1989 or 1990 in our “1990” cross-section and include suicides\noccuring in either 1999 or 2000 in our “2000” cross-section. Including only 1990 and only 2000 deaths in our\nanalysis yielded very similar results to those presented here.\n-33-\n\nIngredient 2: Income by County and Controls by County-Race-Sex-Age\nWe construct data at a similar level of disaggregation on income, demographics, and other control\nvariables using the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (see Ruggles, et al. 2004). Among\nother data, IPUMS provides individual level records based on a 5 percent sample of each decennial\ncensus. However, the geographic identifier in IPUMS is not county but rather an Census-constructed area\ncalled a Public Use Micro Area (puma). Pumas are contiguous areas constructed so that they have a\npopulation above, but as close to, 100,000 as possible.51 In some cases, there is a one-to-one mapping\nbetween county and puma; in some cases, multiple neighboring small counties are pooled together into a\nsingle puma; and in some cases, a single large county is broken up into multiple pumas. In a small\nnumber of cases, part of a county may go to one puma while other parts go to a different puma. For the\npurpose of merging the county-level suicide rate data with the puma-level IPUMS data, we constructed a\nnew geographic variable (separately for 1990 and 2000), which we call “geo,” identifying the smallest\ncommon area between pumas and counties. In 1990, the geo matches to a single county (but many\npuma’s) in 22 percent of cases, to a single puma (but many counties) in 53 percent of cases, to a single\ncounty and puma in 23 percent of cases, and an aggregate of multiple counties and multiple pumas in 2\npercent of cases. This distribution is similar in 2000. For the remainder of the paper, we will generally\nuse the terms “county” and “geo” interchangeably.\nFrom IPUMS, we are able to construct three different sets of variables. First, we constructed cell\nshare variables, such as the proportion of the cell in each educational category at the county(geo)-race-\nsex-age cell level. Other such share variables captured the following characteristics: education,\nprofessional occupation, blue collar occupation, marital status, hispanic, veteran status, vietnam veteran\nstatus, and home ownership. Second, we computed the unemployment rate and the average family size at\n51Since the geographic distribution of population changes over time, the 1990 puma’s are not the same areas\nas the 2000 puma’s. Therefore, in general, the 1990 semiaggregated IPUMS data cannot be longitudinally linked to\nthe 2000 data. This leaves us with repeated cross sections, but not a panel data set.\n-34-\n\nthe same cell level.\nThe third set of variables, county-level income interpercentile ratios that we construct from\nIPUMS, are the focus of this paper. The ratios we compute are the following: 90-10 (90th-percentile of\nincome in the county divided by the 10th-percentile of income in the county), 90-50, and 50-10. We use\nhousehold rather than personal income as our baseline under the assumption that individuals self-\nperceptions are formed based on their household socioeconomic status rather on their monetary\ncontribution to that socioeconomic status. That said, for most of the analysis in the paper we check the\nrobustness of the results substituting personal for household income; the patterns generally are the same.\nWe use measures of income and income inequality at the county level for two reasons. First, we believe\nthe most plausible definition of the reference group for which income comparisons are made is local area\nneighbors, regardless of their race, sex, or age; and county is the narrow geographic information available\nin the CMF. Second, practically speaking, income inequality measures calculated from a small number of\nindividuals, as would be the case if we used groups below the county level (given the IPUMS data is\nalready just a 5 percent sample), would be extremely noisy.\nIngredient 3: Other County- and State-Level Controls\nFor the 1990 cross section, we obtained additional county-level control variables from the Census\nBureau’s USA Counties data files. These files provided us county-level data on a number of variables:\ngrowth in per capita income, variance of per capita income (over time), poverty rate, violent crime rate,\npopulation density, average commute time, share of population in professional occupations, share in blue\ncollar occupations, share in psychiatric facilities, and the share in prison.52 Another potentially important\ncontrol variable is accessibility of the typical “instruments” of suicide. The most common such\ninstrument, especially for males, and also the one most likely to vary geographically, is firearms.\n52As of the time of this writing, these county-level variables are available for 1990 as well as past years;\ndata beyond 1990 is not yet readily available.\n-35-\n\nBorrowing from the public policy literature on the effects of firearm availability, we use state-level data\non the share of suicides committed via firearm. We also try using the share of homicides committed via\nfirearm; the results are similar as the two sets of shares are highly correlated. The data comes from\nMiller, Azrael, and Hemenway (2002) and refer to the period 1988-1997.\nAfter merging these three data ingredients together, we arrive at 24,665 observations for 1990.\nThis number comes from 908 geos × 3 races (white, black, other) × 2 genders × 5 ages = 27,240 cells,\nand then subtracting the 1,634 cells with no population and the 941 cells with undefined unemployment\nrates (i.e., with zero labor force). For 2000, we have 27,720 observations derived from 962 geos.\n-36-\n\nReferences\nAbel, Andrew B. “Asset Prices under Habit Formation and Catching up with the Joneses.” American\nEconomic Review, May 1990, 80(2), pp. 38-42.\nAbel, Andrew B. “The Effects of a Baby Boom on Stock Prices and Capital Accumulation in the Presence\nof Social Security.” Econometrica, March 2003, 71(2), pp. 551-78.\nAdler, Nancy E., W.

    "text": "FINAL\n“Why Climate Change Matters to Us”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Economics of Climate Change Conference\nSan Francisco, CA\nNovember 8, 2019\n8:45AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. I’m happy to see\nsuch a full room for today’s conference. We’re joined by many more on our\nlivestream. To all of you – welcome.\nToday, I thought I’d take a few minutes to address a question I’ve heard\na lot over the past few months.\nWhy is the San Francisco Fed hosting a climate conference?\nIt’s a first for us. It’s actually a first for the Federal Reserve System.1 So\nwhy this? Why now?\nThe answer is simple. It’s essential to achieving our mission.\nThe Federal Reserve’s job is to promote a healthy, stable economy. This\nrequires us to consider current and future risks – whether we have a direct\ninfluence on them or not. Climate change is one of those risks.\n1 We are not the first to talk about this. A growing amount of research and discussion has occurred\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System on the impacts of climate change, including Rudebusch\n(2019), Colacito et al. (2018), Fried et al. (2019), Kahn et al. (2019), Kaplan (2019), and Stiroh\n(2019), to cite a few.\n1\n\nFINAL\nThe risks to our mission\nSo how does it affect our business? The Fed has three core\nresponsibilities: ensuring a safe and sound payment system, regulating and\nsupervising the banking system, and conducting monetary policy. We’re also\npublic servants, who are responsible to the communities we represent. The\nimpacts of a changing climate will affect each of these roles.\nLet’s first consider the payment system.\nExtreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires destroy\nproperty and disrupt essential services like health care and education. But\nthey also impact how people buy things. Without power, electronic payment\nmethods – debit cards, credit cards, and mobile services like Apple Pay – don’t\nwork. So you need cash for everything.\nWe think about this a lot in the Twelfth District. We manage the Cash\nProduct Office for the entire Federal Reserve System. And it’s our job to\nensure that people have access to cash when and where they need it – in\nnormal times, and particularly in times of crisis when demand spikes.\nSo we have to understand and prepare for the increase in severe\nweather events – and for the disruptions that they may cause. This is essential\nto ensuring that our cash services remain resilient and dependable for all\nAmericans.\nThe Fed’s second core function is the regulation and supervision of the\nbanking system. And climate events are becoming an increasing area of risk\nfor many of the financial firms we supervise.\nHigher sea levels, heavier rainfalls, dryer conditions, and the associated\nfallout can cause catastrophic losses to property and casualty insurers –\nespecially if the majority of their clients are geographically concentrated in\n2\n\nFINAL\nthe affected region. In 2018 alone, it’s estimated that damages from severe\nweather in the United States cost insurers upwards of $50 billion.2\nAnd the impact goes well beyond insurers. Including uninsured\ndamages, that $50 billion number nearly doubles.3 This impacts banks’\ncustomers, making it harder for them to satisfy their loan obligations. And this\ncan ultimately stress banks’ balance sheets. So ensuring financial institutions\nare regularly evaluating their exposure to climate-related risks is an\nincreasingly important part of our work.\nFinally, climate change can also influence our third function: conducting\nmonetary policy to achieve our congressionally-mandated goals of full\nemployment and price stability.\nEarly research suggests that increased warming has already started to\nreduce average output growth in the United States. And future growth may be\ncurtailed even further as temperatures rise.4 Several of the papers on the\nprogram today outline other ways in which the micro- and macro-economic\nenvironments may be impacted by climate change. While more work needs to\nbe done to clearly understand these effects, there’s little doubt that we need to\nrecognize, examine, and prepare for these risks in order to fulfill our core\nresponsibilities.\nPerhaps most importantly, we also have to understand climate risks if\nwe’re going to effectively serve the public. In the Twelfth District, sea level\nchanges are disrupting communities from San Diego to Alaska. Preemptive\n2 Insurance Information Institute (2019) and Aon (2019).\n3 NOAA (2019).\n4 See Rudebusch (2019), Tol (2009), Hsiang et al. (2017) and references therein for extensive\nreviews of the literature.\n3\n\nFINAL\npower outages and wildfires in populated areas of California are a new way of\nlife. Really, every state in our District is somehow affected.\nThe impact of these events go well beyond their immediate disruptions.\nThey can destroy wealth, exacerbate existing income inequalities, and – in the\nmost severe cases – displace people permanently. Think of Paradise,\nCalifornia.\nAs a community-engaged organization, we need to understand these\noutcomes. And we need to work with local governments, businesses, and\nindividuals to increase the resiliency of our communities. 5\nConclusion\nWhen you put all these pieces together, it becomes pretty clear: climate\nchange is an economic issue we can’t afford to ignore.\nThis isn’t just a concern for the Twelfth District. Or even the United\nStates. Countries around the world are dealing with the economic impacts of\nclimate change. And conferences like this are essential to understanding the\nchallenges that lie ahead – for all of us.\nUltimately, this is our job. The San Francisco Fed is a public service\norganization. We’re responsible for the people and the communities we serve.\nSo we have to get out in front of this issue and do what we do best.\nConvene the best people and ideas. Study data and conduct research.\nTalk to the communities we serve – and really listen when they tell us what\nthey need.\n5 See Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2019), Kabel et al. (2017), Dancy (2018), and\nCarpenter (2013).\n4\n\nFINAL\nWith that, I would like to thank our Economic Research Department for\nplanning today’s event, and the entire support team for executing it so well.\nAnd thanks to all of our distinguished speakers and panelists. I’m really\nlooking forward to your presentations and a robust discussion.\nThank you.\n5\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAon. 2019.

Introduction\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) is a nationwide federal assistance program for aged, blind,\nand disabled individuals with low incomes. SSI was enacted in 1972 and began paying benefits in 1974,\nreplacing a patchwork of state-run entitlement programs created under the Social Security Act of 1935 and\nits Amendments in 1950. The establishment of SSI was the culmination of a four-year debate over a more\noverarching welfare reform proposal—the Family Assistance Plan (FAP)—intended to extend the federal\nsocial safety net to all low income Americans. While Congress eventually rejected the universality of FAP,\nit passed SSI, a categorical welfare program based on the same negative income tax principles as FAP but\ntargeted on a subset of low-income individuals not expected to work—the aged, blind, and disabled.\nSSI began as a relatively small program providing benefits to a largely elderly population. Since\nthat time SSI has grown to become the largest federal means-tested cash assistance program in the U.S.,\nwith a caseload dominated by children and working-age adults with disabilities. In 2001, an average of 6.7\nmillion people—the vast majority under age 65—received federal and state SSI benefits totaling over $32\nbillion. Rapid program growth, the changing composition of SSI beneficiaries, and increasing pressure to\ndevolve federal responsibility for social programs to state governments, as well as to integrate traditional\n“non-workers” into the labor market, all have raised questions about the role that SSI plays in the broader\nUnited States social welfare system.\nIn 1972, those not expected to work included individuals aged 65 and older, the blind, and people\nwith disabilities. These categories have always been somewhat arbitrary and difficult to establish and\nassess, particularly with regard to disability. But dramatic changes in social expectations over who should\nwork and who should be entitled to income transfers have renewed the debate over who SSI should serve.\nOn the one hand, individuals are living and working longer and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\nhas granted people with disabilities a legal right to equal access to employment, suggesting that the aged,\n-1-\n\nblind, and disabled may be better able to work than in the past. On the other hand, the normal retirement\nage for Social Security benefits is increasing, welfare reforms have placed limits on the number of years\nsingle mothers with children may receive benefits in lieu of working, and poverty rates among children\nremain high. These circumstances suggest that income maintenance programs like SSI will play an\nincreasingly important role in the U.S. social safety net. All these factors will impact on the politically\ndetermined boundaries of the only remaining federal cash-based means-tested entitlement program without\ntime limits available to both adults and children.\nIn this chapter we provide the basic information necessary for SSI policy makers to make informed\nchoices about its future. In Section II we review the program’s history and describe the structure and\nevolution of SSI program rules. In Section III we provide expenditure, caseload, and program recipient\nstatistics. In Section IV, we summarize the primary economic issues related to the SSI program. In\nSection V we review the empirical evidence regarding these issues. We summarize our findings in Section\nVI.\nII. History and Structure of the SSI Program\nThe Supplemental Security Income program is a nationwide Federal assistance program\nadministered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which pays cash benefits to low-income\nindividuals who are 65 years of age or older or who are blind or disabled. SSI was enacted in 1972 and\nbegan paying benefits in 1974 replacing the state Old-Age Assistance, Aid to the Permanently and Totally\nDisabled, and Aid to the Blind Programs created by the Social Security Act of 1935 and its amendments in\n1950. In this section we review the history of the SSI program, describe current program structure,\neligibility criteria, and benefit levels, and discuss how the program’s goals and rules have evolved over\ntime.\n-2-\n\nOriginal Rationale and Program Goals\nThe establishment of a federal income maintenance program for the aged, blind, and\ndisabled—SSI—was the culmination of a four-year debate that began with a more overarching welfare\nreform proposal—the Family Assistance Plan (FAP)—proposed by President Nixon on August 8, 1969.1\nFAP was the first serious attempt to institute a federal negative income tax program equivalent to those\nproposed by Stigler (1946), Friedman (1962, 1968), and Tobin (1968). FAP departed from existing\nwelfare policy in three important ways: (1) it was universal rather than categorical, with low income and\nassets as the only eligibility criteria; (2) it was run through the federal tax system rather than administered\nby state and local governments; and (3) it had a low benefit reduction rate, in keeping with the notion that\nlow tax rates provide desirable work incentives.2\nCongress eventually rejected the idea of an income maintenance program for all Americans with\nlow income, but on October 17, 1972 created the Supplemental Security Income program, a categorical\nwelfare program targeted on the subset of the poor who were aged, blind, or disabled. SSI passed after\nFAP failed largely because Congress believed that providing income assistance to needy individuals not\nexpected to work was likely to have a much smaller negative impact on employment than a universal\nnegative income tax program. In 1972, those not expected to work included individuals age 65 and older,\nthe blind, and people with disabilities, subgroups of the population that already were targets of state-based\nassistance programs.\nIn keeping with some of the themes of FAP, the new SSI program federalized benefit\nadministration, set minimum benefit standards, imposed uniform eligibility criteria, and set low benefit\n1See Burke and Burke (1974) and Smeeding (1994) for a more detailed historical discussion of\nhow SSI became the nation’s first negative income tax program.\n2The key features of most NIT proposals are universality, federal benefit administration, and low\nbenefit reduction rates. For a fuller discussion of the origins of NIT policy see Burkhauser and Finegan\n(1989, 1993).\n-3-\n\nreduction rates on labor earnings. Legislative records suggest that SSI was intended to reduce variability in\nthe types of individuals allowed onto the rolls and in the amount of assistance they received, to make\neconomic resources the only determinant of eligibility for those meeting the categorical requirements, and to\nprovide incentives for beneficiaries to work to supplement their income and move towards rehabilitation\n(U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1971).3,4 Thus, under SSI, Congress federalized benefit\nadministration, set minimum benefit standards, imposed uniform eligibility criteria, and set relatively low\nbenefit reduction rates on labor earnings. In addition to adopting some of the administrative mechanisms of\nFAP, the SSI program began to blur the traditional ability-to-work standard for determining who should be\nentitled to public welfare payments. By extending SSI benefits to the needy families of children with\ndisabilities, Congress expanded the social safety net to include families headed by adults who were\n“employable”.5,6\nSSI Eligibility Criteria\nAs noted earlier, SSI is a income support program for low-income individuals who are aged, blind,\nor disabled. As such, SSI eligibility is a function of three program-based categorical criteria–age,\ndisability, or blindness—as well as more general requirements associated with income and asset limits, and\ncitizenship and residency rules. The Social Security Administration is responsible for screening applicants\n3Most legislative models of the NIT, including FAP and SSI, impose both an income and asset test.\nThroughout this chapter we refer to income and assets as economic resources.\n4Under the former state-run programs the amount of assistance could vary from recipient to\nrecipient according to an individual’s assessed needs, age, and living situation.\n5Poor children with disabilities had previously been included in state AFDC programs.\n6A final category of people allowed onto the SSI rolls, despite their potential to find alternative\nprivate support, were noncitizens. By law, legal immigrants had to show income sponsorship before\nimmigrating to the United States. Largely due to the definition of income in the SSI means test, the 1972\nlegislation allowed sponsored immigrants who were poor to apply for SSI. This primarily affected the SSI\naged program.\n-4-\n\nand making awards for SSI. Table 1 summarizes the SSI eligibility requirements described in detail in the\nremainder of this section.\nMeans-Tests. To be eligible for SSI, individuals must fall below federally mandated income and\nasset limits. In 2002, the countable income limit was set at $780 per month ($9,360 per year) for\nindividuals and $1,170 per month ($14,040 per year) for couples. The countable income limit is\ndetermined by the federal benefit rate (FBR) and increases annually with the average U.S. wage index. In\ngeneral, the countable income limits fall just short of the U.S. Census Bureau official poverty thresholds.7\nSSI applicants also must meet countable asset limits. In 2002, asset limits were set at $2,000 for\nindividuals and $3,000 for couples. Unlike the countable income limits, the asset limits are not indexed for\ninflation. Thus, over time, countable asset limits for SSI eligibility have become stricter. Countable asset\nlimits were last changed in 1989, rising from $1,500 for individuals and from $2,250 for couples.\nAs noted earlier, not all income received by individuals or couples is countable. Exclusions include\na $20 monthly income disregard for all forms of income with the exception of means-tested income and an\nadditional $65 monthly disregard for any labor income.8 After these disregards, for every $1 in labor\nearnings a worker loses $0.50 in SSI benefits. Therefore, after all income disregards, an SSI recipient\nfaces a 50 percent implicit tax on labor earnings.9 Neither the income or asset exclusions are indexed for\ninflation.\n7For example, in 2001, the Census Bureau poverty threshold for all single person households\n(under and over age 65) was $754 per month ($9,044 per year). The countable income cutoff for SSI was\n$740 per month ($8,880 per year) in 2001.\n8In certain cases, impairment-related expenses may be deducted from this total. Also, income is\ndisregarded when it is used for Plans for Achieving Self Support (PASS).\n9As we will discuss below, for those SSI beneficiaries receiving other means-tested program\nbenefits, the effective marginal tax on work can be much higher.\n-5-\n\nIn-kind assistance from government programs like Food Stamps and public housing are not\ncounted as income against the individual’s overall SSI benefit. All other benefits from government\nprograms are taxed at 100 percent. Countable resources include resources other than the home a person\nlives in, a car (depending on use or value), and limited amounts of life insurance and burial funds.10 In\ncases where an eligible individual resides in a household with ineligible individuals, a portion of the other\nperson’s income is considered when determining the amount of the SSI payment. This process, known as\n“deeming,” applies to married couples with one eligible member, parents of child applicants, and U.S.\nsponsors of noncitizen applicants. The deeming rules are straightforward; if an individual or couple is\nliving in another person’s household and is receiving both food and shelter from the person in the\nhousehold, the federal benefit rate is reduced by one-third.\nAlthough the federal benefit rate—and thus, the monthly income test—rises with inflation each\nyear, the monthly income disregards, the asset limits, and the value of allowable assets (e.g., car, household\neffects) are not indexed, and thus have fallen substantially in real terms since SSI began. The real decline\nin the income disregards and asset limits over time effectively has eroded the value of SSI benefits and\nnarrowed the population of potential recipients relative to 1974 levels. Consider first the 1972 set\ndisregards of $20 on all income and $65 on labor income. Valued in 2002 dollars, these disregards would\nbe $84 and $275 per month, respectively. Adjusting the asset limits for inflation discloses the same\npattern. Valued in 2002 dollars, the asset limits set in 1972 would be $6,345 for individuals and $9,517\nfor couples.11compared to the $2,000 and $3,000 limits currently in place. Thus, compared to when it was\n10In 2002, the dollar value on disregards on assets was $4,500 for a car or medical treatment,\n$1,500 on life insurance, and $2,000 on personal property and household furnishings.\n11Had the asset limits of $2,000 (inividuals) and $3,000 (couples) set in 1989 kept up with inflation\nthey would be $2,856 and $4,284, respectively in 2002.\n-6-\n\nenacted in 1972, SSI now covers a narrower and less economically advantaged portion of the income distribution.\nCitizenship and Residency Criteria. In addition to meeting the economic resource criteria,\nindividuals also must meet residency and citizenship requirements. To be eligible for SSI an individual\nmust be a resident of the United States and a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or a “qualified alien” in an SSI-\neligible noncitizen category.12 The current SSI-eligible noncitizen categories generally can be characterized\nas covering individuals who were lawfully in the United States as of August 22, 1996, individuals who are\nrefugees or in refugee-like situations, and individuals who have contributed to the country either by service\nin the military or through extended periods of work. These relatively restrictive allowances for noncitizens\nwere implemented under 1996 welfare reform (PRWORA), and were a direct response to concerns that\nnewly arrived noncitizens with immigration sponsors were increasingly applying for, and receiving, SSI\nbenefits. The SSI provisions in the 1996 welfare reform act generally excluded these individuals from\nreceiving SSI by mandating that the income of the noncitizen’s immigration sponsor be considered in the\nmeans test.\nCategorical Eligibility Criteria. Individuals meeting income, asset, and citizenship tests may\nqualify for SSI benefits based on three categorical criteria: age, blindness, or disability. Applicants need\nonly meet one of the three criteria, although some applicants fit multiple categories. The categorical\nprogram requirements for the aged and the blind are straightforward. Individuals are categorically eligible\nfor SSI based on age if they are age 65 or older. Individuals may receive SSI benefits for the blind if they\nhave 20/200 vision or less with the use of a correcting lens in their better eye, or if they have tunnel vision\n12The term qualified alien is defined in section 431 of P.L. 104-193, as amended by P.L. 104-208\nand P.L. 105-33. See Parrot, Kennedy, and Scott (1998) for a complete listing of the qualifying criteria.\n-7-\n\nof 20 degrees or less. These objective standards make for relatively easy and uniform screening of aged\nand blind SSI applicants at offices of the Social Security Administration across the United States.13\nIn contrast, the disability screening process is more complex. First, there is no simple definition of\ndisability.14 The most frequently applied model of disability comes from Nagi (1965, 1969a, 1969b, 1991).\nIn the Nagi model, disability is a dynamic process in which an individual’s pathology interacts with the\nsocioeconomic environment.15 The dynamic nature of the disability process is represented by the movement\nthrough three stages: pathology, impairment, and disability. The first stage, pathology, is the presence of\na physical or mental condition that interrupts the physical or mental process of the human body. An\nexample is deafness. This leads to the second stage, impairment, which Nagi defines as a physiological,\nanatomical, or mental loss or abnormality that limits a person’s capacity to function. For example,\ndeafness limits the ability to interpret sound. The final stage, disability, is an inability to perform or a\nlimitation in performing roles and tasks that are socially expected. For example, a person with deafness\nis unable to use the telephone. Under the Nagi model, those with a pathology that causes a physical or\n13Although the measurement of these “objective standards” is relatively straightforward, the\njustification for using them as standards for “inability to work” is less so. A literature exists which argues\nthat categorical age is not a useful measure of ability to work. A parallel literature exists which suggests\nthat functional ability rather than medical conditions are superior criteria for determining “ability to work”\n(Library of Congress 1998; Wunderlich, Rice, and Amado 2002).\n14Mashaw and Reno (1996) argue that the appropriateness of any definition of disability depends\non the purpose for which it is used. They document over 20 definitions of disability used for purposes of\nentitlement to public or private income transfers, government services, or statistical analysis. In the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment\nthat substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being\nregarded as having such an impairment. LaPlante (1991) provides a useful discussion of alternative\ndefinitions that can be used to estimate this population. Burkhauser, Houtenville, and Wittenburg (2002)\nprovide detailed analyses of different definitions of disability in national representative U.S. surveys.\n15The World Health Organization (WHO) has a model of disability very similar to that of Nagi.\nThe key to both of these definitions is the recognition that individuals move from the presence of a health\ncondition to a point where it begins to impinge on activities that are socially expected of them and that this\nmovement is related to the environment in which individuals live. See Jette and Badley (2002) for an\nexcellent comparison of the Nagi and WHO models.\n-8-\n\nmental impairment that subsequently limits one or more life activities—such as work—but who\nnevertheless work would not be considered to have a work disability.16 (This is the case whether work was\npossible though changes in the work environment, access to rehabilitation, or individual adaptability.)17\nThe first component is the presence of a pathology—a physical or mental malfunction, or the interruption\nof a normal process, or both. This leads to a second component, an impairment, which Nagi defines as a\nphysiological, anatomical, or mental loss or abnormality that limits a person’s capacity and level of\nfunction. The final component of disability is defined as an inability to perform, or a limitation in\nperforming, socially expected roles and tasks. For men and, increasingly, for women of working age,\nmarket work is a socially expected role. Hence, those who are unable to perform or are limited in their\nability to work are considered disabled.\nThe disability determination process for SSI incorporates some of the reasoning put forth in Nagi’s\ndisability definition. Applicants for disability benefits move through a multi-step process in which their\npathology, impairment, and level of functioning are judged. Applicants thought to be unable to engage in\nany substantial work become eligible for benefits. Below we describe the process of disability\ndetermination for both adults and children applying for SSI disability benefits.\nLike the aged and blind, persons seeking disability benefits also apply at an office of the Social\nSecurity Administration. Once the federal officials and the applicant have gathered sufficient\ninformation to complete the application, it is submitted to a state agency for determination of disability.\nState disability examiners, working with vocational and medical consultants, act as the primary\n16This measure closely resembles what Verbrugge (1990) calls social disability, or the intersection\nof an individual’s physical impairment (e.g., deafness) and the environmental challenges of the activities\nrequired by a social role, such as work.\n17For example, a person with deafness who is accommodated at the workplace with a TTY\nmachine that permits him or her to use the telephone.\n-9-\n\ngatekeepers of both SSI and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).18 Disability decisions are made\nby state agencies, acting under contract to the federal government. Therefore, although disability\neligibility criteria are uniform across the country, the interpretation of these criteria, and hence the\ndisability determination process itself, can and does systematically vary from state to state and over time.\nTable 2 shows differences in mean allowance rates (initial acceptances to initial applications), by state\nbetween 1974 and 1993. As the table indicates, mean allowance rates vary considerably across states,\nranging from lows of 28 in Louisiana and New Mexico to highs of 48 in Delaware, New Jersey, and\nRhode Island.\nDisability Screening for Adults. SSA defines adult disability as the inability to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is\nexpected to result in death or last at least 12 months. Applicants must be unable to do any work that\nexists in the national economy for which they are qualified by virtue of age, education, and work\nexperience. The United States does not award federal disability benefits for partial disability.19\nAs a practical matter, SSA asks the state disability determination offices to follow a five-step\nprocedure in their initial disability determination.20 First, the examiners check to see if applicants are\ncurrently working and making more than the “substantial gainful activity” (SGA) amount—$780 a month\n18SSDI is a social insurance program that provides payments to individuals who have paid social\nsecurity taxes for the appropriate number of quarters and who are judged to be disabled under the SSA\nguidelines. Unlike SSI it is not means-tested. However, it does have restrictions on labor earnings\nconsistent with its criteria for disability eligibility. See Bound and Burkhauser (1999) for a fuller\ndiscussion of this program from an economic perspective.\n19However, as will be shown later, in some instances the SSI program allows individuals with\ndisabilities to exceed the earnings limit and continue to receive SSI benefits, making it a type of partial\ndisability insurance. Most other western industrialized countries provide partial disability benefits to their\nworking-age populations. For a discussion of disability program rules in other western industrialized\nnations see Aarts, Burkhauser, and DeJong (1996).\n20Our discussion of the adult disability determination process draws heavily on Bound and\nBurkhauser (1999).\n-10-\n\nin 2002. If so, their application is denied. As can be seen in Figure 1, almost no cases are rejected in this\nmanner, since presumably the SSA field offices have already checked to see if applicants are working\nbefore they send applications to the disability determination office.21 Second, the state disability\nexaminers determine if the applicant has a severe impairment that is expected to last 12 months or result\nin death. If not, the application is denied. About 20.1 (13 + 7) percent of all applicants were denied at\nthis step in 2000. Third, the state disability examiners look to see if the impairment meets the medical\nlistings. If the impairment is listed, applicants pass the categorical screening for disability. If the\nimpairment is judged to be equivalent to one of the medical listings then applicants also meet the\ncategorical requirement for benefits. Most recipients who pass the disability screening do so at this stage\nbecause their impairment either “meets” or “equals” one on the medical listing (22 percent of all\napplicants were approved at this step in 2000).\nFourth, if a decision cannot be reached on medical factors alone, applicants are evaluated in\nterms of residual functional capacity. If they are found to be able to meet the demands of “past relevant\nwork” their claim is denied (20 percent of all applicants were denied at this step in 2000). If individuals\nare deemed unable to do past relevant work, examiners determine if the impairment prevents the\napplicant from doing any other work. Here vocational factors are considered. If, for example,\napplicants’ maximum sustained work capacity is limited to sedentary work and they are at least age 50 to\n54, with less than a high school education and no skilled work experience, then they would be considered\ndisabled and pass the categorical screening. In contrast, if applicants’ previous employment experience\nincludes skilled work, then they would not receive benefits. At this stage, 16 percent of all applicants\nwere determined eligible for benefits and 22 percent were denied benefits in 2000.\n21The percentages denied in Figure 1 are based on outcomes from initial SSDI applications, the\ndata available from published sources. However, there is no reason to believe that the patterns for SSI\nwould be significantly different.\n-11-\n\nApplicants who are denied benefits can ask for a reconsideration. Their file will then be\nreviewed by a second team of examiners. If they are rejected after reconsideration, individuals may\nappeal the case to an administrative law judge. It is at this stage that applicants will for the first time\ncome face-to-face with a gatekeeper. Individuals denied benefits at this stage may appeal the decision to\nthe Social Security Appeals Council and then to the District Courts. In 2001, about 33 percent of those\ninitially denied benefits appealed the decision. About 10 percent of those who appealed the decision\neventually were awarded benefits (SSI Annual Report, 2002).22 For the claimants who are either allowed\nbenefits at the initial level or who don’t appeal, the application and decision process usually takes a few\nmonths. For those who appeal to the administrative law judge, the process can take a year or more.\nDisability Screening for Children. Screening children for disability eligibility has proven to be\neven more complex and contentious than adult disability screening. When the SSI program was originally\nconsidered, Congress recognized the potential difficulties of applying the standard SSA disability definition\nto children. Thus, under the original legislation, Congress wrote that a child should be considered disabled\nif “he suffers from any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of comparable severity” to a\ndisabling impairment in an adult (SSA 1997). In practice, children originally qualified for SSI if they had\n“a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which results in marked and severe functional\nlimitations, and which can be expected to result in death, or which has lasted or can be expected to last for\na continuous period of not less than 12 months.” Between 1974 and 1989 the child disability determination\nprocess did not include a functional assessment or take into account the equivalent of adult vocational\nfactors. See Figure 2 for a comparison of the child and adult initial disability determination process.\n22There is some evidence that the proportion of claimants who appeal and the proportion of\ndecisions that get reversed rise and fall with the percentage of initial denials (Lando, Cutler, and Gamber\n1982).\n-12-\n\nThis changed in 1990, when the Supreme Court decided the case of Sullivan vs. Zebley. The\nCourt ruled that in order to meet the standard of equal treatment, a functional limitation component parallel\nto that of adults must be included in the initial disability determination process for children. In response,\nSSA added two new bases for finding children eligible for benefits: (1) functional equivalence, which was\nset at the medical listing level of the disability determination process; and (2) an individual functional\nassessment (IFA), which was designed to be parallel with the functional and vocational assessment\nprovided for adults. By allowing applicants who did not meet the medical listing to be found disabled if\ntheir impairments were severe enough to limit their ability to engage in age-appropriate activities, such as\nattending school, the IFA lowered the level of severity required for children to be eligible for SSI benefits\n(GAO 1994, 1995).23\nIn 1996, as part of welfare reform, Congress modified the definition of disability for children.\nLegislators replaced the comparable severity (to adults) criteria with a definition of disability that is unique\nto children. Under the new definition, a child’s impairment—or combination of impairments—are\nconsidered disabling only if it (they) results in marked and severe functional limitations, is expected to\nresult in death or has lasted or can be expected to last at least 12 months (SSA 1996).” The new focus on\nassessing the severity of impairments among children was reflected in changes in the evaluation process.\nThe legislation removed the IFA, replacing it with a criterion based on functional equivalence or\nevaluations of the extent to which impairments create medical listing-level severity. The revised rules\ndefined medical listing-level severity for functional limitations as: (1) marked limitations in two broad\nareas of functioning, such as social functioning or personal functioning; or (2) extreme limitations in one\narea of functioning, such as inability to walk (SSA 1997). In practice these changes meant that although\nfunctional limitations continued to include behavior-related limitations, they no longer covered the same\n23Following the Zebley decision a large number of previously denied cases were reassessed and\nawarded disability benefits. This can be seen in the caseload statistics presented later in this chapter.\n-13-\n\nbreadth of functioning included in the IFA. For example, Congress specifically removed maladaptive\nbehavior disorder from the functional listing criteria. Thus, the post-1996 standard represents a broader\nmeasure of disability than originally applied to children, but a narrower standard than the one used between\n1990 and 1996 (see Figure 2).24\nSSI Benefits\nFederal Benefit Levels. Each eligible SSI beneficiary in his/her own household with no other\ncountable income received a Federal cash payment of $545 per month in 2002 ($817 for jointly eligible\ncouples). The Federal SSI benefit is increased each January by the cost-of-living index used to adjust all\nSocial Security (OASDI) benefits. Although the original objective of the SSI program was to guarantee an\nincome at the poverty level, from the beginning, the federal minimum SSI benefit was set below the official\nBureau of the Census poverty line. Excluding state supplementation, SSI payments represent about 75\npercent of the poverty threshold for an eligible individual, and about 90 percent of the threshold for an\neligible couple; these percentages have remained relatively constant over time.25\nSSI recipients are required by law to apply for every government program for which they may be\neligible. In most states, recipients receive state supplemental payments and become eligible for Medicaid\nand Food Stamps without making a separate application.26,27 Since 1986 SSI benefits and eligibility for\n24When the new rules were applied in 1997 previously allowed cases into denials. This can be seen\nin the caseload statistics presented later in this chapter.\n25This difference arises in part because the SSI program and the U.S. poverty thresholds assume\ndifferent economies of scale. The SSI program assumes that a single person needs 67 percent of the couple\nbenefit to be equally well off; the U.S. poverty threshold assumes that a single person needs 80 percent of\nthe couple benefit to maintain an equivalent standard of living.\n26We discuss states’ latitude in determining Medicaid eligibility for SSI recipients later in this\nsection.\n27In most cases, individuals who are eligible for SSI are categorically eligible for Food Stamps.\nThe exceptions to this general rule are SSI beneficiaries living in households where other members do not\nreceive and are not applying for SSI. These individuals must apply for Food Stamps at the local food\n-14-\n\nMedicaid have been continued for those who earn above the SGA; this is known as 1619(b) status.28 In\ngeneral, the special eligibility test for Medicaid applies if the individual has earnings over the level that\noffsets their SSI benefits, but is still lower than a threshold amount established in the state in which they\nreside.29 Adult SSI recipients with disabilities also are eligible for federally-funded, state-administered\nvocational rehabilitation.30\nState Supplementation. In designing the SSI program Congress recognized that states may want to\nboost benefit levels beyond the federal program. In addition, Congress wanted to ensure that those states\npaying above the federal level in 1972 would continue to provide the same level of assistance as they had\nprior to the federalization of SSI. As a result of these two goals, there are two types of state\nsupplementation for SSI: mandatory and optional.31 Under mandatory supplementation, states whose Old-\nAge Assistance and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled benefits were greater than the federal\nminimum had to make up the difference in mandatory state supplements.32 Although nearly every state was\nsubject to mandatory supplementation in 1972, increases in Federal benefit levels over the years, have left\nonly a few SSI beneficiaries receiving mandatory payments today.\nstamp office and meet the household income test to obtain food stamp eligibility.\n28In 1995, only about 46,000 (1.3 percent) of the 3.5 million SSI disability recipients were in\n1619(b) status (Mashaw and Reno 1996).\n29In making this determination, the SSA takes the average expenditures on Medicaid and SSI\n(including state SSI) and compares this amount to an individual’s earnings.\n30The Ticket to Work/Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 expanded the eligible pool of\nvocational rehabilitation providers available to disabled SSI recipients, by allowing beneficiaries to receive\nvocational rehabilitation services from not-for-profit and for-profit vendors. The first tickets from this\nprogram were issued in 2002.\n31For a detailed description of state supplementation see Ponce (1996).\n32Mandatory state supplements applied to individuals receiving benefits in December 1973.\n-15-\n\nIn 2000, 45 states and the District of Columbia provided optional supplemental benefits (columns\n1-3, Table 3). States offering supplements can follow the same rules as the federal SSI program and have\nthe program administered by SSA, or they can administer their own program and use a state-specific\neligibility criteria. Despite the apparent cost-advantage to federal administration, states have increasingly\nopted for state administration of supplemental payments. About three-quarters of states providing optional\nsupplementation administer their own programs or jointly administer them with the federal government.\nOnly 11 states rely solely on federal administration.\nAlthough a majority of states have optional supplementation programs, a number of factors\nminimize the importance of these programs. First, only 23 states provide supplements to the vast majority\nof SSI recipients living independently in their own households.33 In the remaining states with optional\nprograms, supplements are paid only to the minority of SSI recipients living in institutions.34 Second,\nbecause state supplements are not annually adjusted for inflation, the real value of the median state\nsupplemental payment to individuals living independently declined by about 60 percent between 1975 and\n1997.35\nThat being said, public concern over states reducing their SSI supplemental payments when\nFederal benefit levels rise led Congress to mandate that States pass along SSI benefit increases resulting\nfrom annual cost-of-living adjustments. States may meet this passalong requirement by maintaining\npayment levels year-to-year—the payment method—or they may spend the same amount of money in the\n33Over 90 percent of SSI recipients live in their own households (U.S. House of Representatives\n1998).\n34One explanation for the ongoing supplementation of SSI recipients living in institutions is that\nsupplementary SSI payments provide states with a mechanism of supporting such facilities.\n35Over time some states have even reduced the nominal value of supplemental payments.\n-16-\n\naggregate that it spent the year before the federal benefit rose—the total expenditure method. In 2002, 40\nstates used the payment levels method and 10 states used the expenditures method (columns 4-5, Table 3).\nCoordination with Other Programs. In addition to SSI federal and state cash payments, SSI\nbeneficiaries frequently gain automatic eligibility to Medicaid and Food Stamp programs. Generally, SSI\nrecipients are categorically eligible for Medicaid. A State may either use SSI eligibility criteria for\ndetermining Medicaid eligibility, or it may use its own criteria as long as the criteria are no more restrictive\nthan the State’s January 1972 medical assistance standards.36\nForty states use SSI criteria and 11 states use eligibility criteria more restrictive than those of the SSI\nprogram (See columns 6-7, Table 3). States may also enter into agreements with SSA to make Medicaid\neligibility determinations for them, based on the federal SSI criteria; 33 states have such contracts with\nSSA (column 8, Table 3).\nWith the exception of California, SSI recipients in all states may be eligible for food stamps.37\nSSA offices notify applicants and recipients of SSI of their potential eligibility for food stamps. Eligibility\nfor the Food Stamp program is determined by the Food Stamp office.\nFinally, 38 states (column 9, Table 3) have agreements with SSA to be reimbursed for basic needs\nassistance provided during the period during which an eligible individual’s SSI application for benefits was\npending, or an individual’s SSI benefits were suspended and subsequently reinstated.\nAdministration and Financing\nAs a federal income maintenance program, SSI is funded from general revenues and is\nadministered by the Social Security Administration. Although, as discussed earlier, many states\nsupplement federal benefit levels, over time the share of supplemental benefits paid by states has declined.\n36This final option is known as the “209(b) option.”\n37California “cashes out” food stamps and SSI recipients in California receive a cash payment in\ntheir State supplementary payment in lieu of food stamps.\n-17-\n\nIn 1975, state SSI expenditures accounted for approximately 27 percent of total SSI payments. In 2001,\nstate supplemental payments amounted to about 11 percent of annual SSI expenditures (SSA 2002).38\nSummary\nAlthough the goals of the SSI disability program have not changed since its inception in 1974, its\nstructure has been subject to numerous legislative, administrative, and court actions. These actions\nprimarily have focused on making the disability criteria more target effective and on enhancing incentives\naimed at returning recipients to the workforce. For the child disability component of the program, changes\nhave focused on providing an appropriate vocational criteria for children that does not unduly discourage\nrehabilitation and school success. Notably, there have been few changes to the means test criteria and no\nadjustment for inflation in these criteria, meaning that over time, the amount of income that will disqualify\none for SSI has fallen in real terms or simply put the means-test has become more restrictive. Finally,\nother legislative efforts have centered on limiting the eligibility of non-citizens. The legislative history of\nSSI shows that the primary mechanisms used by policymakers to alter the coverage and the generosity of\nSSI have been changes in the categorical eligibility criteria, rather than changes in the size of SSI benefits.\nIII. Program Statistics\nTrends in Expenditures, Caseloads, and Benefits\nThe SSI program has grown substantially in both recipients and expenditures since it first paid\nbenefits in 1974. However, its growth has varied over time (Figure 3). Between 1974 and 1982, caseloads\nfell by 4.5 percent and real federal expenditures declined by about 15 percent. This decline caused concern\namong policymakers that too few potentially eligible recipients were enrolling (Menefee, Edwards, and\nSchieber 1981). After this slow start, the number of SSI beneficiaries increased steadily until 1996,\n38The numbers reported reflect the average for all states. Looking across states, in January 1999,\nthe federal share of the maximum SSI benefit ranged from 58 percent in Alaska and 74 percent in\nCalifornia to 100 percent in the eight jurisdictions without a supplemental program (CRS 1999).\n-18-\n\ngrowing from roughly 3.9 million in 1982 to 6.6 million in 1996, a 70 percent increase. Federal payments\nfor the program rose even faster during this period with the greatest growth between 1989 and 1992.\nValued in 2001 dollars, total annual payments increased from $17.6 billion in 1982 to $32.5 billion in\n1996, an increase of about 85 percent. Between 1996 and 2001 (the last year of data available) caseloads\nand expenditures have risen by less than 2 percent. Despite rapid growth in the SSI program over time, as\na percentage of total federal outlays SSI expenditures have remained relatively stable at 1.9 percent since\nthe program began in 1974.\nTrends in Characteristics of Recipients\nOriginally considered a program for the elderly, SSI is now dominated by adults and children with\ndisabilities. Figure 4 shows the age composition of SSI beneficiaries between 1974 and 2001. In 1974, the\nmajority of the SSI caseload was over the age of 65. The number of aged beneficiaries peaked at 2.5\nmillion in 1975, gradually dropped to around 2 million in 1982 and remains at about that level. In contrast,\nthe number of blind and disabled adults (aged 18-64) on SSI has more than doubled since 1974, with the\nmost rapid growth occurring after 1982.39 In December 2001, 3.8 million adults 18-64 received SSI\nbenefits, about 2.1 million more than in 1982. The number of blind and disabled recipients who are under\nage 18 also has grown substantially in recent years.40 Between 1974 and 1989 the child caseload increased\nto about 185,000. However, following the Zebley decision in 1990, the number of blind and disabled\nchildren rose rapidly, reaching 955,000 by 1996.41 Since then, child SSI rolls have declined slightly, falling\nto 881,000 in 2001.\n39This growth is almost entirely due to increases in the number of disabled beneficiaries. The\nnumber of working-age SSI recipients eligible due to blindness has remained relatively constant over time\n(Annual Statistical Supplement, SSA, various years).\n40Again the growth is almost entirely explained by increases in the number of disabled children.\n41As noted earlier, this increase was due both to the reassessment of previously denied cases and\nthe increase in applications due to the more lenient eligibility rules.\n-19-\n\nAs a result of rapid growth in adult and child disabled beneficiaries, the SSI population looks\ndramatically different today than it did when the program was created. In 1974, blind and disabled adults\nand children comprised only 40 percent of the SSI population. In 2001, over 70 percent of SSI\nbeneficiaries were disabled individuals under the age of 65.\nTable 4 shows that other key demographic characteristics also have changed since the programs\ninception.42 The first section of the table shows the age, gender, and citizenship composition of all SSI\nrecipients. Since 1975, the proportion of males has increased. In 1976, more than two-thirds of SSI\nrecipients were female and about 64 percent were white. In 2001, about 60 percent of SSI recipients were\nfemale. Another notable change in the composition of the SSI population has been the rapid increase in the\nnumber of noncitizens receiving benefits. In 1982, the first year for which records on citizenship were kept,\na little over 3 percent of all SSI recipients were noncitizens. In 1994, two years before citizenship became\na requirement for new applicants, about 12 percent of all SSI beneficiaries were noncitizens. This\npercentage fell slightly once the citizenship restrictions were imposed, but noncitizen beneficiaries remain a\nsizeable component of the SSI population—10.4 percent in 2001.\nThe second section of Table 4 shows trends in the three main qualifying diagnostic\ncategories—physical impairments, mental retardation, and psychiatric disorders other than mental\nretardation—for SSI recipients with disabilities (adults and children) In the early years of the program,\nless than one-quarter of SSI beneficiaries qualified on the basis of mental impairments other than mental\nretardation. Following expansions in the eligibility criteria for mental impairments in both adults and\nchildren, the number of adults and children qualifying for SSI on the basis of a mental impairment began to\n42Notably race is not included in the table. Information on the racial composition of SSI\nbeneficiaries in the 1998 “Green Book” showed an increase in the number of Latinos enrolled in the\nprogram over time. These data also showed that African Americans are disproportionately represented in\namong child and adult disabled beneficiaries. Unfortunately, there are no comparable data on race after\n1995.\n-20-\n\ngrow. As a result, in 2001, 36 percent of all SSI recipients qualified on the basis of mental impairments\nother than mental retardation.\nSSI Participation\nAn important policy concern with respect to all public assistance programs is the degree of\nparticipation among eligible individuals. That is, of the people who meet the categorical, economic\nresource, and citizenship tests, what proportion are receiving SSI benefits. It is relatively straightforward\nto make such calculations for those aged 65 and older and a literature exists on this question.\nUnfortunately, the difficulties of establishing and assessing disability for adults and children not only\nmakes if difficult for policymakers and administrators to accurately determine SSI eligibility for those who\napply, but also for researchers to calculate program participation rates that require some estimate of the\neligible disabled population that does not apply for benefits. Existing nationally representative data sources\neither lack sufficient information on economic characteristics or health characteristics to generate precise\nestimates of the population eligible for the disability components of SSI. As a result, there is almost no\nresearch on SSI participation rates among the eligible population with disabilities.43\nIn Table 5 we provide a preliminary approximation of “take-up rates” for SSI that we believe is\nuseful in establishing broad trends. We use the official U.S. Bureau of the Census poverty calculations and\nshow the share of SSI recipients in age-based poverty populations. This method was used in the 1998\nGreen Book for the population aged 65 and older. On the one hand, because our estimates do not account\nfor citizenship, assets, and most especially disability status, they will understate program participation\namong those in the poverty population who are eligible. On the other hand, since those eligible for SSI may\nhave household incomes above the official poverty line, our approximations may overstate program\n43It is possible to estimate the population with some level of disability using national data sources\n(see Bound and Burkhauser 1999 for examples). It is much more difficult to isolate the sub-population\nwithin this broader category that would meet the medical listing or vocational criteria for SSI eligibility.\n-21-\n\nparticipation among all eligible households. Nonetheless, the trends in Table 5 are revealing of how SSI is\nbeing used by low income persons.\nAs the first column of Table 5 shows, the participation rate among the poor elderly declined from\n78.5 percent in 1974 to 53.6 percent in 1982. Since then, participation rates have fluctuated from year to\nyear, but have remained well below the highs recorded in the early years of the program. In general, no\nmore than two-thirds of elderly individuals living in poverty receive SSI benefits. More complete measures\nof participation suggest that take-up rates among the elderly are lower than the gross measures indicate.\nResearchers consistently find the participation rate among persons eligible for SSI aged benefits at between\n45 and 60 percent (Menefee, Edwards, and Schieber 1981; Warlick 1982; Coe 1985; Shields et al. 1990;\nMcGarry 1996).\nThe remaining columns in Table 5 show SSI participation rates for poor adults age 18-64 and poor\nchildren. Consistent with the caseload growth highlighted in Figure 4, participation rates among poor\nworking age adults and children have risen over time. Participation rates among poor adults rose from 14.8\npercent in 1974 to 20.7 percent in 1998, with the most rapid increases occurring during the 1990s.\nRecipiency rates for poor children also increased rapidly during the 1990s, rising from 2.1 percent in 1989\nto 6.6 percent in 1998. As column four shows, the prevalence of disability has not risen since 1980 which\nsuggests that the increase in SSI take-up rates among the poor is not a function of increased disability.\nMultiple Program Participation among SSI Beneficiaries\nA large fraction of SSI beneficiaries participate in other government programs. Table 6 shows\nsimultaneous program participation for SSI recipients and their households by gender and age in 1999.44 In\n1999, 36.1 percent of all SSI recipients also received Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance\n(OASDI), either for retirement or disability. OASDI receipt was most common among men and women\n44Unless otherwise noted the percentages reported in Table 6 are based on estimates from the\nSurvey of Income and Program Participation and taken from the SSI Annual Report, 2002.\n-22-\n\nage 65 and older. Medicaid receipt was nearly universal, with 89.4 percent of all SSI recipients on the\nprogram. A substantial fraction of SSI recipients also received Medicare benefits—41.4 percent in 1999.\nLooking at other means-tested programs, 42.6 percent of households with an SSI recipient also received\nfood stamps and about one in ten received energy or housing assistance.\nSeparate data from the 1998 “Green Book” produced by the U.S. House of Representatives (not\nshown) indicates that over time the percentage of SSI recipients receiving OASDI and Medicare has been\ndeclining. At the same time the percentage of SSI recipients receiving food stamps, WIC, free or\nsubsidized meals, and public housing has been rising. The fact that a growing share of SSI recipients\nreceive benefits from multiple means-tested programs suggests that the work incentives faced by the typical\nbeneficiary are increasingly complex. SSI beneficiaries face multiple implicit taxes in the form of reduced\nbenefits from SSI and any other transfer programs, plus the regular assortment of federal, state, and local\ntaxes, as well as the loss of medical insurance for those not meeting the 1619(b) provisions. As others have\nshown, the cumulative marginal tax rates for individuals receiving multiple programs can be quite high\n(Giannarelli and Steurle 1994; Keane and Moffitt 1998).\nAlthough the empirical literature on the effects of changes in these various marginal tax rates will\nbe discussed later in this chapter, it is useful to lay out the tax circumstances SSI recipients potentially\nface. Figure 5 (from Burkhauser and Wittenburg 1996) shows how a single male’s 1994 net income\nchanges with each additional dollar of his labor if he is eligible to receive the federal SSI benefit of $458\nand the average cash value of Medicaid insurance for SSI disability of $540 per month. With no labor\nearnings, this person would receive $998 per month in SSI benefits and Medicaid insurance.\nAs the figure shows, the interaction of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and federal taxes as\nwell as Food Stamps, which one-half of all SSI beneficiaries receive, significantly alters the marginal tax\nrates faced by recipients with various amounts of labor earnings. The EITC phase-in subsidy to work\noffsets social security (FICA) taxes, but because the food stamp program subtracts 24 cents in Food\n-23-\n\nStamps for every dollar of labor earnings, the net tax on the first dollar of labor earnings is 23.85 percent.\nThis tax rate continues to the SSI disregard level of $85 per month. At this point the 50 cent loss in SSI\nbenefits per dollar of labor earnings interacts with the food stamp program taxes on work, resulting in a net\ntax of 58.85 percent. When the EITC plateau begins, the net tax on labor earnings rises to 66.5 percent\nand when the EITC phase-out tax begins, the net tax on labor earnings rises to 74.15 percent. When the\nfederal income tax standard deduction level is passed and federal income tax starts, the marginal tax rate\nrises to 89.15 percent. Marginal tax rates only begin to fall after Food Stamps and EITC break-even\npoints are reached. The final increase in tax rates occurs just before SSI benefits phase out, when all\nMedicaid benefits are lost because earned income now equals the Medicaid special eligibility plateau. The\nreduction of such cumulatively high marginal tax rates via a single universal income support program was\none of the arguments made in support of President Nixon’s original FAP program.\n-24-\n\nIV. Review of Economic Issues\nAlthough economic analysis of social programs frequently takes the goals of the program as given,\nwith SSI the motivation for the program is itself an important determinant of how we view the behavioral\nreactions to it. In this section we first discuss the economic rationale behind a federal income floor for the\nsubset of the poor who are aged, blind, or disabled. Next, we review the theory related to individual\nresponses to the existence and structure of SSI including takeup, work, savings, and disability-reporting\nbehavior. Finally, we consider the equity goals of SSI and discuss attempts to evaluate program\neffectiveness.\nPublic Income Provision for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled\nAs noted earlier, SSI was born out of a failed effort to provide a guaranteed income floor under all\nAmericans—FAP. Hence, while the motivation for providing an income floor to the subset of the adult\npoor who are aged, blind, or disabled is primarily distributional, it also rests on a political compromise that\noffered this entitlement only to categories of individuals not expected to work. While this compromise\nallowed SSI to become law in 1972, social expectations regarding work have changed over time for the\nthree groups targeted by SSI—the aged, blind, and disabled. Individuals are living and working longer; the\nnormal retirement age for Social Security benefits has been raised; and the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(ADA) has granted people with disabilities a legal right to equal access to employment.\nAlthough work expectations have risen for the aged, it is people with disabilities who have\nexperienced the largest shift in public attitudes. In 1990, people with disabilities successfully argued that\nunequal access to jobs—rather than an impairment—is the primary barrier to employment opportunities.\nAs a result, people with disabilities gained legal rights to accommodation under Title I of the ADA.\nSome disability advocates even have argued that there is no such thing as a disabled worker; rather, there\n-25-\n\nis only a society that does not provide the appropriate accommodations for such individuals.45In a world\nof full accommodation, the disability-transfer population should be zero. Such attitudinal changes raise\nbasic questions about how society should treat people with disabilities. Most fundamental of these\nquestions being, should people with disabilities categorically be expected to work or not?\nThese types of cultural changes potentially shift the boundaries of the population not expected to\nwork and hence eligible for a categorical guaranteed income floor based on age or disability. As the\nopportunities for employment and the demand for the productivity of people with disabilities and those over\nage 65 increase, the clear categorical lines drawn between them and other groups with similar difficulties\nfinding work, such as low-skilled or less-educated younger persons, or single mothers facing welfare limits,\nare increasingly blurred.\nThe original political compromise that made the families of disabled children eligible for SSI was\nslightly different, and represented a departure from the not expected to work criteria applied to the aged and\nto adults with disabilities. Some argued that SSI benefits for disabled children replaced the earnings of\nparents forced to reduce their work effort in order to care for their newly disabled child. Others argued that\nSSI-children benefits indirectly offset extra disability-related household expenses. In both cases, SSI-\nchildren benefits were intended to offset lost income and partially return the family to its previous level of\neconomic well-being. (See NASI 1995 for a fuller discussion of these issues.)\nSSI and Behavioral Change\nIf the aged and disabled adults are neither able or expected to work, then many of the disincentives\ndiscussed in regard to other means-tested transfer programs are irrelevant. In such a world, cumulative\nmarginal tax rates could approach 100 percent with no change in work behavior and SSI could provide\nrelatively high income guarantees and still maintain relatively low break-even points (the income level at\n45See Johnson (1997) for alternative views of the rights and responsibilities of people with\ndisabilities.\n-26-\n\nwhich a person is no longer eligible for benefits). Moreover, to the degree that age and work disability are\nclearly defined and immutable categories, differences in the guarantees, time-limits, or funding mechanisms\nfor SSI and other programs would have little effect on SSI allowances and caseloads. In such a world SSI\nprogram participation is purely a function of the prevalence of health limitations in the low income\npopulation. Below we suggest that none of these premises hold with respect to the disability component of\nSSI. Thus, SSI policymakers must take behavioral changes on the part of potential SSI recipients and state\nand local governments into account when establishing program eligibility criteria and considering future\nprogram rules.\nPropensity to Apply for SSI. Disability is neither a static or precise concept. Responses to the\nonset of health conditions depend not only on the severity of the impairment, but also on the social\nenvironment that people with health impairments face—including the availability of employment, the\navailability of accommodation, rehabilitation and retraining, the presence of legal supports or protections,\nand the accessibility and generosity of SSI and other government transfer programs. The propensity for\nindividuals to apply for SSI benefits depends on the probability they place on their health impairment and\nvocational circumstances being sufficient to meet the SSI disability eligibility standards as well as on their\nemployment potential and the generosity of SSI relative to other forms of public assistance. The latter\ncomparison is particularly relevant in light of 1996 welfare reform (PRWORA) that restricts the access to,\nand generosity of, alternative public assistance programs. If low-income adults have health conditions or\nhave children with health conditions, the relative generosity of SSI to other alternatives may induce\nindividuals to apply for benefits.\nProgram Participation and Work Incentives. The economics of program participation and labor\nsupply for individuals potentially eligible for SSI mirrors the analyses of these issues in programs such as\nAFDC and TANF. Thus, to understand the work disincentives embodied in the SSI program, we turn to\nthe framework used for other categorical welfare programs. Moffitt (1983) provides a discussion of the\n-27-\n\nbasic economic issues. In these models individuals make choices that depend on the income gained from\nthe program and the costs of participating, including the time and money costs associated with applying for\nand maintaining eligibility for benefits.\nTo see how this works in the case of SSI, consider the conventional labor-leisure model diagramed\nin Figure 6.46 Figure 6 compares the budget constraint of an SSI program with a 50 percent marginal tax\nrate, (t=0.5) and one with a marginal tax rate of 100 percent (t=1.0). Segment ACDE of the figure\nrepresents the budget constraint of those not categorically eligible for SSI. The line has a slope equal to the\nhourly wage rate, w. Segment ABCDE applies to those same individuals if they are categorically eligible\nand they face a marginal tax rate of 100 percent. Benefits are taxed one dollar for each dollar earned and\nphased out at the break-even level (point C). That is, even though they are categorically eligible for\nbenefits, their labor earnings offset all SSI benefits at hours levels greater than point C. Segment ABDE\napplies to those same people but now they face a marginal tax rate of 50 percent. Benefits are taxed at a\nrate of 50 cents per dollar earned and the break-even hours point is D. Under this model, categorical\neligibility for SSI benefits unambiguously reduces work effort relative to not being categorically eligible.\nThere is an income effect associated with the guarantee (AB), and a substitution effect associated with the\nmarginal tax rate (BC or BD). The income and substitution effects work in the same direction, and hours\nof work among participants fall. Only those whose optimal hours worked prior to program eligibility were\nbeyond the break-even hours point may not be affected and even then it will depend on the shape of their\nindifference curve (i.e., some would be willing to accept less income by substantially reducing work and\nliving on program benefits).\nThe next question to ask is what happens if the marginal tax rate is reduced. Here the\n46This discussion draws from the expositions in Moffitt (1986), Hoynes and Moffitt (1995), and\nMoffitt’s review of the AFDC/TANF program in this volume. This discussion is made primarily in the\ncontext of adults with disabilities.\n-28-\n\nanswer is unclear; the net effect of a reduction in t, from 100 percent (BC) to 50 percent (BD), is\nambiguous. The arrows in the Figure 6 show the various responses that could occur following a reduction\nin the marginal tax rate (represented by a shift from segment BC to BD). For individuals initially receiving\nSSI benefits and not working (i.e., initially at point B), a reduction in the tax rate may encourage\nparticipants to work more, represented by Arrow 1. At the same time, a reduction in t expands the range of\nindividuals eligible for benefits, and brings some portion of those categorically eligible but not previously\nreceiving SSI onto the rolls. As these individuals move onto SSI their work effort is reduced, as shown by\nArrow 2. Arrow 3 shows that some categorically eligible individuals who continue to earn too much under\nthe lower tax rate may be motivated to reduce their hours of work enough to become eligible for benefits,\nthereby combining work and SSI benefits. Finally, it also is possible that a reduction in t will increase\npayments by enough to induce previously eligible persons on earnings grounds but not on categorical\ngrounds (segment AC) to risk entry onto the rolls.\nTaking each of these possibilities into account, the net effect of a lower marginal tax rate on work\neffort is ambiguous. The only thing that is clear is that lower marginal tax rates increase caseloads. A\nlower tax rate makes more categorically eligible individuals eligible for the program on income grounds\nand, given positive takeup rates, unambiguously boosts the number of individuals on the rolls. Moreover,\nby lowering the costs associated with staying on the rolls, lower marginal tax rates reduce exit rates from\nthe program, thereby increasing caseloads. Finally, lower marginal tax rates may induce those on the\nmargin of categorical eligibility on health grounds to apply for benefits since the gains to program\nacceptance have increased.\nUnlike SSI benefits for the elderly, where categorical age eligibility is easily demonstrated and\nbenefit receipt is automatic if one meets the means test, categorical eligibility for SSI benefits is more\ndifficult to demonstrate. Thus, eligibility for benefits is not certain and models of SSI application must\ntake this risk of non-acceptance into consideration. In general, those considering applying for SSI will\n-29-\n\nvalue disability benefits with a probability of less than one. Holding the underlying health condition\nconstant, the probability of acceptance onto the rolls will depend on the disability screening process.\nConditional on the same impairment, tighter eligibility criteria are likely to increase the probability of\ndenial and reduce the expected value of applying. In contrast, looser criteria increase the probability of\nacceptance and increase the expected value of applying.47 In either case, individuals facing uncertainty\nsurrounding acceptance, informational hurdles, or stigma associated with benefit receipt, may be induced to\nparticipate by the increase in benefits associated with the lower marginal tax rate.\nIf those categorically eligible for benefits on health grounds are completely unable to perform any\nsubstantial gainful activity under any circumstances then there is no need to lower the marginal tax rate on\nSSI, since those on the program are neither expected or able to work. However, to the extent that work is\nboth possible and expected for people with disabilities who meet the other eligibility criteria, policy\ndiscussions with respect to trade-offs between tax rates, guarantees, and break-even points become much\ncloser to those taking place for other income maintenance programs.\nThe same model also incorporates stigma and other fixed program costs. As in other income\nmaintenance programs, the presence of stigma and other program costs associated with applying for\nbenefits explains why some categorically eligible individuals are observed on segment ACD. As fixed\nprogram costs and stigma decline, participation among this group will rise. What the model in Figure 6\ndoes not show are potential program interaction effects. As discussed in Figure 5, the actual budget\nconstraint facing those categorically eligible for SSI benefits is more complex, with more nonlinearities due\nto the cumulation of taxes from multiple programs. In like manner, multiple program eligibility will cause\ncomplications for those interested in the behavioral effects of other transfer programs. Burkhauser and\n47Weathers (1999) develops a multi-period model of the SSDI application process in which the\noptimal time of application following the onset of a disability is a function of the opportunity cost of lost\nwages versus the gain in SSDI, adjusted for the probability of acceptance. A similar model could be used\nto predict the timing of SSI-disability applications.\n-30-\n\nSmeeding (1981) and Powers and Neumark (2001) show the incentives to accept actuarially reduced Social\nSecurity benefits (OASI) at younger retirement ages are increased for those who would be eligible for both\nSSI and OASI at age 65, since OASI benefits after a small disregard are taxed on a dollar for dollar basis\nby SSI.\nFinally, one can also use the model in Figure 6 to think about the labor-supply behavior of parents\nof children with disabilities. If a child is judged eligible for SSI benefits, then an able-bodied parent faces\nthe same marginal tax rates, guarantees, and break-even points shown in Figure 6. Stigma, information\ncosts, and reduced program benefits (adjusted for the probability of acceptance) also apply. One additional\nissue that affects parents of children with disabilities is how benefit receipt will influence the future well-\nbeing of their child.\nSavings Behavior. The presence of asset testing in the eligibility criteria for SSI may reduce\nsaving among those meeting other eligibility criteria. This point is made generally about means-tested\nprograms. Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995) argue that when eligibility is tied to assets, individuals\nmeeting the income test have incentives to reduce their savings in order to qualify for benefits. Among\nthose applying for SSI benefits, the most likely group to be affected by the asset test is the elderly, who\nmay have accumulated savings over their lifetime.\nBalancing Efficiency and Equity Concerns\nOur discussion above has focused on the behavioral effects of the SSI program. This focus on the\nefficiency costs of SSI induced behavioral change ignores the social benefits of SSI and may may lead\nsome to conclude that a socially optimal SSI program would have no behavioral impact on benefit\napplications, work, or savings. This conclusion is inappropriate for two reasons. First, even if actual\ndisability status were perfectly observable, society would probably still want to target some level of\nbenefits on disadvantaged low income workers and their families even if it resulted in some efficiency\nlosses. Hence the more important question is not whether there are program related behavioral changes but\n-31-\n\nwhether they are small relative to the social gains from redistributing income to less advantaged persons.\nAnalyses of the welfare implications of the SSI program should focus on this second and more important\nquestion.\nSecond, in a world where the socially appropriate eligibility standard for SSI is difficult to assess,\nsome individuals will be denied benefits who are less capable of work than is socially acceptable. In such a\nworld, a more lenient eligibility criteria will involve a trade-off between the reduction of type II errors on\nthe one hand and the additional costs of type I errors on the other. The issue is: in the presence of\nuncertainty, do the social benefits outweigh the efficiency costs arising from increasing the probability of\nguaranteeing an income floor to those below some minimum level of work capacity at the cost of also\nproviding these funds to some who are more capable of work. In both cases, it is appropriate to assign\nsome value to SSI as a mechanism for providing social protection against the economic consequences of\naging and disability for disadvantaged workers. To do otherwise would be to hold too narrow a view from\na social policy perspective. See Bound, Cullen, and Schmidt 2000 for a fuller discussion of these issues.\nV. Review of the Evidence\nIn the previous section we reviewed the potential consequences on application, work, and savings\nbehavior of SSI program rules and showed that if the aged or disabled adults are capable of work, the SSI\nprogram rules could their influence behavior. We also discussed how SSI program rules could affect the\nwork behavior of the parents of children with disabilities. In this section we review the empirical literature\non the effects of the existence and structure of SSI on behavior. Despite the size and importance of the SSI\nprogram, the empirical literature on its behavioral effects is relatively small. Moreover, almost without\nexception, empirical studies focus on only one of the three groups SSI targets. For this reason, the\nempirical evidence on the behavioral effects of SSI for each target population group will be discussed in\nturn.\nSSI and Adults with Disabilities\n-32-\n\nWork Effort of Adults with Disabilities.48 Most of the research on the work effort of those with\ndisabilities focuses on a broader population than those receiving either SSI or SSDI. The most common\nanalyses relies on nationally representative survey data that include questions based about whether a health\nlimitation prevents individuals from working or limits their ability to work full time or to do certain jobs.49\nWhile such research is not as targeted as one might like, it does provide a backdrop for understanding the\ntypes of trends faced by the SSI program.\nBased on these data, Figure 7 shows that over the past two decades employment rates for those\nwith disabilities as well as SSDI and SSI caseloads have varied greatly, fluctuating with the economy,\nchanges in benefit eligibility criteria, and the implementation of other public policies intended to support\npeople with disabilities. The figure shows employment rates of working-age men and women with self-\nreported disabilities and the number of individuals receiving disability benefits for the period 1980-1999.\nThe employment data come from Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville, and Nargis (2002) and reflect the\nemployment rates of CPS respondents who say they are limited in the amount or type of work they can\nperform. Data on SSDI and SSI beneficiaries come from the Social Security Administration (2000). Also\nindicated in the figure are a few key events: when disability screening was liberalized in 1984 and the\npassage of the ADA in 1990.\nThe trends in Figure 7 highlight the major concerns of disability policymakers over the past two\ndecades. First, the number of disability beneficiaries has increased continuously since the eligibility\nexpansion and liberalization in 1984, with especially strong growth during the 1990s (application and\nacceptance rates in the 1990s rivaled those experienced during the expansion period of the late 1970s).\n48This discussion draws from Burkhauser and Daly, 2002.\n49Although numerous scholars have questioned the validity of such data, Burkhauser, Daly,\nHoutenville, and Nargis (2002) show that questions of this type can be used to track trends in outcomes,\nsuch as employment, for the population with disabilities.\n-33-\n\nSecond, while employment rates for those with self-reported work limitations rose through the economic\nexpansion of the late 1980s, they have fallen almost continuously since, even during the strong expansion\nof the 1990s.\nSo far, three major hypotheses have been proposed to explain this decline. Kaye (2001) argues\nthat declining employment rates among those with disabilities in the 1990s were caused by dramatic\nincreases in the severity of impairments. Hence, for Kaye, the recent trends are health-based and not a\nreflection of changes in public policy. Other researchers have taken a more social environment-oriented\nview. For example, DeLeire (2000) and Acemoglu and Angrist (2001) attribute the downturn in\nemployment among those with disabilities during the 1990s to the passage of the ADA. Bound and\nWaidmann (2001) argue that changes in disability benefits eligibility and generosity made it easier and\nmore profitable for workers to leave the labor force and take benefits. Autor and Duggan (2001) suggest\nthat a combination of disability benefits that replaced a greater share of labor earnings and declining job\nopportunities for low-skilled workers induced an increasing share of workers to choose benefits over\nemployment. Which one of the many changing social variables deserves the most credit is a matter for\nfuture research, but in all likelihood the “true” cause is a combination of factors, rather than a single policy\naction or identifiable event.\nWhile researchers debate the reasons for the declining employment and rising benefit rates of men\nand women with disabilities during the 1990s, policy makers are debating whether these outcomes are signs\nof success or failure of U.S. disability policy. For some advocates of those with disabilities, the increasing\ndisability benefit rolls reflect an appropriate increase in support for a group of workers with limited labor\nmarket opportunities. For others, the increased rolls reflect the shortcomings of a transfer-focused policy\nthat failed to provide the necessary supports (e.g., universal health insurance, rehabilitation, and job\nservices) to allow individuals to select work over benefits. For others still, the outcomes observed during\nthe 1990s are simply evidence of the law of unintended consequences in policy making, where policies to\n-34-\n\npromote economic well-being (in the case of benefits) and work (in the case of the ADA) actually increased\nthe disability benefit rolls and reduced employment.\nWhichever explanation accounts for the decline in employment among those with disabilities,\nresearch by Bound, Burkhauser, and Nichols (forthcoming) shows that one must be careful in making\ngeneral statements about the population targeted by SSI based on aggregate data on the population with\ndisabilities or data on the SSDI targeted population. Table 7, taken from Bound, Burkhauser, and Nichols,\nuses longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) linked to social\nsecurity administrative files to compare the monthly labor earnings and employment of those who apply for\nSSI or SSDI three years before application, one to three months before application, and three years after\napplication. As Table 7 shows, unlike SSDI applicants, the vast majority of SSI applicants are not\nemployed three years before they apply for benefits. Only 25(28) percent of those awarded (denied) SSI\nwere working three years before their application and their average monthly labor earnings were only $144\n($260). Moreover, both their employment and their average monthly labor earnings were a small fraction\nof the employment and labor earnings of SSDI applicants three years prior to application.\nThe data in Table 7 suggest that the factors causing the low employment and labor earnings of SSI\napplicants at the time of application and after they move onto the SSI rolls were in effect well before the\ntime of their application. This is not surprising since Bound, Burkhauser, and Nichols also show that they\ntypical SSI applicant is less likely than the typical SSDI applicant to be white, a high school graduate,\nmarried, wealthy, or live in a high income household prior to application.\nFactors Affecting SSI Participation. While application for SSI disability benefits is a function of\nhealth, it also is influenced by program rules and benefits. These include eligibility criteria and the\ngenerosity of benefits relative to work, the comparative generosity and availability of other means-tested\nwelfare and social insurance programs, macro economic conditions (national, state, and local), and\napplicants’ education and job skills. During the 1990s, considerable attention was devoted to\n-35-\n\nunderstanding the link between these non-health factors and SSI caseload growth. The following\ndiscussion reviews the evidence on determinants of SSI caseload growth, looking first at the relationship\nbetween caseload dynamics and screening stringency (benefit supply), and then at factors affecting the\ndemand for SSI benefits, including ease of benefit access, benefit generosity relative to work and other\nprograms, and economic conditions.\nSSA began modifying its disability determination process in the mid-1970s. Concerned that state\noffices were not consistently and uniformly applying the residual functional capacity (RFC) and vocational\nstandards in adult disability determinations, in 1979 SSA published regulations specifying who was to be\nclassified as disabled, essentially tightening the eligibility criteria. SSA also tightened its policy towards\nbenefit terminations in continuing disability reviews (CDRs) by state Disability Determination Services\n(DDS), permitting benefit termination without proof of medical improvement. This policy resulted in a\nthree-fold increase in the number of cessation decisions on continuing reviews by state agencies (The Lewin\nGroup 1999). Consistent with the tighter standards, the yearly allowance rate (initial acceptances divided\nby initial applications) of adult SSI disability applications began to fall in 1976 (Table 8).\nThe Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 continued the trend of tightening the disability\ndetermination and review process. Importantly, the 1980 law changed both the frequency and nature of\nmedical eligibility reviews done on disability beneficiaries.50 Before 1980, the only beneficiaries targeted\n50The 1980 law tightened Social Security Administration control over the state disability\ndetermination services. In particular, SSA previously had reserved the right to review initial determinations\nbefore they were transmitted to the applicant, but during the 1970s it reviewed only 5 percent. The 1980\namendments required that SSA review two-thirds of successful applications. To enforce administrative\ncontrol over administrative law judges, the secretary of Health and Human Services was empowered to\nappeal administrative law judge rulings that were favorable to the applicant.\nPrior to 1980, the law provided that disability determinations be performed by state agencies under\nan agreement negotiated by the states and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The 1980\namendments required that disability determinations be made by state agencies according to regulations of\nthe Secretary. It also required the Secretary to issue regulations specifying performance standards to be\nfollowed in the disability determinations, and if the Secretary found that a state agency was failing to make\ndisability determinations consistent with regulations, then the Secretary was required to terminate the\n-36-\n\nfor medical eligibility review were those who had conditions that were likely to improve over time. The\nnew law stipulated that all beneficiaries periodically should receive continuing disability reviews, and that\nall but those deemed to have permanent disabilities should be reviewed every three years. The 1980 law\nmade permanent the practice of using the same standards in CDRs that were applied when initially\nevaluating claimants. In addition to tightening the disability adjudication and review process, the 1980 law\nestablished two key work incentives: (1) the 1619(b) provision; and (2) the deduction of impairment-\nrelated work expenses (IRWEs) from earnings when determining the SGA. As noted earlier, the 1619(b)\nprovision authorized a three-year demonstration project, allowing for the payment of special SSI benefits\n(and the retention of Medicaid coverage) for SSI recipients who exceeded the SGA level. Section 1619\nbecame permanent in 1986.\nAs could be expected, the 1980 law had a discernible impact on administrative practice. As\ndemonstrated in Table 8, the yearly allowance rate for adult SSI disability recipients fell from a high of\n52.6 percent in 1975 to 26.6 percent in 1982. The number of recipients fell from 1.75 million in 1978 to\n1.66 million in 1982. This decrease occurred despite the economic recession of 1980-1982. This removal\nof individuals from the rolls generated a major political response. Most of the people removed from the\nrolls appealed the decision, requesting a hearing before an administrative law judge and causing a huge\nbacklog of cases. As a result, some state governors instructed their DDS service not to terminate anyone\nfrom the disability rolls unless that person’s conditions had improved.51\nIn 1984, in response to concerns that federal disability policy had become too restrictive, the Social\nSecurity Administration agreed to a moratorium on CDRs pending the enactment and implementation of\nrevised guidelines. The 1984 law had profound effects on the standards used to evaluate a person’s\nstate’s authority and assume federal responsibility for the determinations.\n51For a fuller discussion of disability policy in this period, see Berkowitz and Burkhauser (1996).\n-37-\n\npotential eligibility for SSI. When reviewing existing beneficiaries, the burden of proof was shifted back to\nthe SSA to show that a beneficiary’s health had improved sufficiently to allow him or her to return to work.\nA moratorium was imposed on re-evaluations of the most troublesome cases—those that involved mental\nimpairments or pain—until more appropriate guidelines could be developed. Finally, benefits were\ncontinued pending the outcome of an appeal.\nThe 1984 law substantially increased the weight given to source evidence (i.e., evidence provided\nby the claimant’s own physician) by requiring that it be considered first, prior to the results of an SSA\nconsultative examination. SSA also was required to consider the combined effect of all impairments,\nwhether or not any one impairment was severe enough to qualify a person for benefits. Perhaps most\nimportant, the SSA substantially revised its treatment of mental illness, reducing the weight given to\ndiagnostic or medical factors, and emphasizing the ability of an individual to function in work or work-\nlike settings.\nTable 8 shows that the dip in the SSI adult disability population which occurred between 1978 and\n1982 was reversed thereafter, and rose about 4 or 5 percent a year during the economic growth years of the\nlater 1980s. When the next economic downturn came in the early 1990s, conditions were ripe for a surge\nin applications and in the number of people on the SSI disability rolls. The increases in the disability\ntransfer population in the early 1990s exceeded anything seen in SSI since the start of the program. The\nannual acceptance rate for SSI adult disability benefits was almost 45 percent in 1992, the highest since\n1976. Economic recovery and Congressional action with respect to SSI disability eligibility have slowed\nthe growth in the working-age adult SSI population, but acceptance rates remain well above those in the\n1980s, suggesting that a future downturn in the economy could result in an increase in the rolls.52\n52As part of more general welfare reforms in 1996, Congress removed drug and alcohol addiction\nas allowable conditions for SSI eligibility. In 1995, there were about 135,000 SSI recipients whose\ndisability was based solely on drug addiction or alcoholism. The Congressional Budget Office estimated\nthat about 65 percent of these individuals would be eligible for SSI based on other sufficiently disabling\n-38-\n\nThe legislative history underlying the disability screening process highlights how access to benefits\nhas changed over time. Figure 8 shows that the desire for SSI disability benefits also has fluctuated.\nFluctuations in applications have been as large as changes in the SSI disability rolls. To some extent these\nfluctuations have mirrored changes in eligibility standards, contracting when eligibility standards were\ntightened in the late 1970s and early 1980s, rising after the relaxation of eligibility standards in 1984, and\nfalling again following the tightening of standards in the mid-1990s. However, other factors including local\neconomic conditions, outreach efforts by both SSA and state governments to search for eligible candidates,\nand the generosity of SSI relative to other programs all are likely to have contributed to the variability in\napplications over time.\nA number of scholars have estimated the link between local economic conditions and SSI\napplication rates. The fact that SSI is a national program restricts the extent to which regional variation in\nbenefits can be used to identify the effect of the program on applications. However, in recent work Black,\nDaniel, and Sanders (2001) used regional variation in economic conditions to identify the effect of financial\nincentives on the decision to apply for SSI (and SSDI) disability benefits. In particular, they examined the\nimpact of the coal boom during the 1970s, and the coal bust during the 1980s on the number of SSI\nbeneficiaries. Using panel data on 186 counties in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia they\nestimated an elasticity of program payments with respect to local area earnings of between -0.5 and -0.7 for\nSSI recipients. While these results lend some support to the notion that labor market conditions in an area\naffect the decision of individuals to apply for disability benefits, the point estimates are hard to interpret.\nBlack, Daniel, and Sanders interpret the estimated coefficient on the local earnings variable as reflecting the\neffect of changes in the financial attractiveness of disability benefits. However, given the nature of the\nspecification used, it is possible that the earnings variable is picking up the effect of general economic\nconditions. For a full discussion of these reforms and their impact see U.S. House of Representatives\n(1998).\n-39-\n\nconditions rather than the relative financial attractiveness of SSI.53 Furthermore, their estimates reflect the\nshort-run effect of changes in the local economies in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia on\nthe number of disability beneficiaries. Given the fact that the typical SSI spell is lengthy in duration,\nlong-run effects likely will be substantially larger than short-run effects.\nA considerable amount of government-sponsored research has attempted to explain the dramatic\ngrowth in the SSI population in the early 1990s. A useful summary of this work can be found in Rupp and\nStapleton (1995). Much of this analysis has used the considerable variation in state-level applications and\nawards to test their models. Using cross-state data from 1988-1992 Stapleton, Coleman, Dietrich, and\nLivermore (1995) find convincing evidence that the recession of the early 1990s contributed to the rapid\nrise in the number of applications for SSI benefits. They estimate that a 1 percentage point rise in the\nunemployment rate was associated with a 2 percent rise in applications for SSI. The effects on final\nawards were somewhat lower. Finally, they found that the changes in the unemployment rate had a smaller\neffect on benefit awards than on applications, suggesting that recessions induce those with less severe\ndisabilities to apply for SSDI and SSI benefits.\nStapleton, Coleman, Dietrich, and Livermore also provide strong, if indirect, evidence that changes\nin screening stringency in the 1990s played a central role in explaining program growth. Indeed, the very\nfact that award rates were rising at the same time that application rates were rising would seem to suggest\nan important role for changes in screening stringency. They find that changes in the unemployment rate,\ntogether with other factors they include in their models, could explain almost all of the growth in\napplications for impairments related to conditions of internal organs, but could account for much less of the\ngrowth in applications for impairments related to musculoskeletal or mental health conditions. These\npatterns suggest that regulatory changes such as the increased weight given to pain and other symptoms,\n53As will be discussed shortly, the evidence that recessions lead to increases in the number of\napplications for SSI is strong.\n-40-\n\nthe increased reliance on source evidence, and the broadening of the standards used for those with mental\nimpairments all have contributed importantly to the recent surge in applications for SSI.\nWhereas the 1990s recession seems to be part of the explanation for the rapid rise in applications\nfor SSI benefits that occurred during the first part of the 1990s, no such rise occurred during the severe\nrecession of the early 1980s. A reasonable interpretation of these patterns is that the tightening of\neligibility standards that occurred during the early 1980s counteracted the effects of the 1980s recession.\nDuring the mid-1980s, when eligibility standards were relaxed again, the booming economy slowed any\nimmediate response. However, when the 1990s recession hit, applications grew rapidly.\nResearchers studying the increases in SSI caseloads have found evidence that an important factor\nexplaining the growth in SSI over the 1990s has been efforts by states to shift individuals off state-funded\nprograms such as general assistance and onto SSI. States that cut general assistance benefits experienced\nabove-average growth in the application for SSI benefits (Lewin-VHI 1995a). Using monthly\nadministrative data from Michigan, Bound, Kossoudji, and Ricart-Moes (1998) find that the increase in the\napplication for SSI benefits exactly coincided with the end of general assistance in Michigan. However,\nthey also find that general assistance benefits typically are less generous than are SSI benefits. This finding\nis surprising within the context of a simple labor supply model that ignores the relative costs of application\nfor these two types of benefits. The fact that many potentially eligible people did not apply for the more\ngenerous SSI benefits suggests that applying for disability benefits may be difficult and onerous. There is\nalso considerable anecdotal evidence that states and third parties often act as intermediaries to facilitate the\nSSI application process (Livermore, Stapleton, and Zeuschner 1998; Bound, Kossoudji, and Ricart-Moes\n1998).\nBrown, Hoyt, and Scott (1999) approach a similar question using county-level data on SSI and\nAFDC participation rates. They find that prior to 1996 welfare reform, variation in AFDC programs\nacross states explains little of the variation in SSI participation. They also find that program and eligibility\n-41-\n\nvariables explain more of the county-to-county variation in SSI participation than in AFDC participation,\nsuggesting that SSI is a more tightly targeted program than AFDC. Still, they conclude that given the\nsignificant changes in welfare programs embodied in the transition from AFDC to TANF, SSI participation\nrates likely will be affected.\nIncreases in the value of Medicaid benefits for individuals on SSI also may have contributed to the\nrecent growth in applications for both programs. Yelowitz (1998) uses cross-state variation in Medicaid\nbenefits to estimate the effect of changes in their value on participation in SSI. In particular, in response to\ncourt orders, many states increased Medicaid benefits in 1991. Using these changes, Yelowitz estimates\nthat increases in the value of Medicaid which occurred over the late 1980s and early 1990s can explain\nabout 20 percent of the increase in the working-age population receiving SSI benefits.\nHowever suggestive Yelowitz’s results are, they do not seem to be very robust. Stapleton and his\ncolleagues (Lewin-VHI 1995b) used Yelowitz’s methodology to look at the effect of changes in the value of\nMedicaid on the application for SSI benefits and found no measurable effects. Given the expectation that\nincreases in the value of Medicaid initially would have a proportionately bigger effect on the number of\napplications (a flow) than on the beneficiaries (a stock) this non-result is surprising. While it is hard to\nimagine that eligibility for Medicaid benefits does not make SSI more attractive, finding statistical evidence\nof this effect has proven to be quite challenging.\nEffects of Work Incentives and Disincentives. Because the United States has few program\nalternatives that offer long-term benefits to working-age persons who are not working, the relatively\ngenerous benefits and imperfect screening mechanisms in SSI could pose significant work disincentives\nfor persons with disabilities who are considering applying for benefits. Additionally, the high marginal\ntax rates for those on the program could discourage exit from it and entry into the labor force.\nA large empirical literature has tried to estimate the magnitude of moral hazard effects. Some of\nthat literature has examined the net effect of SSI (and SSDI) on labor force participation rates, such as\n-42-\n\nhow much higher participation rates would be were it not for these programs. However, this literature\nhas primarily focused on estimating the disincentive effects of SSDI program parameters, benefit\ngenerosity, or screening stringency. For a complete review of this literature see Bound and Burkhauser\n(1999). While it is tempting to look to the SSDI literature to gain some insights into how the SSI program\naffects the behavior of low-income adults with disabilities, doing so is problematic. First, whereas both\nprograms use the same inability to perform substantial gainful activity criteria with respect to establishing\ncategorical eligibility, the benefit structures of the two programs are quite different.54 Second and perhaps\nmore important, as noted earlier, typical SSDI applicants have much different socio-economic\ncharacteristics and work histories than typical SSI applicants.\nAs seen in Table 7, most of the individuals who apply for SSI were not working three years prior\nto application. More importantly, the causes for their low employment rates at that time likely were more\nclosely associated with the problems faced by low skilled or poorly educated workers generally than with\nspecific effects of poor health or of the work disincentives of SSI or SSDI. Furthermore, only 19 percent\nof those who were denied SSI benefits were employed three years after their application (Table 7). In\ncontrast, 35 percent of denied SSDI applicants were employed three years after application. These patterns\nsuggest that changes in program work incentives and disincentives for those on the SSI rolls are less likely\nto induce them to leave the rolls and return to employment than would be the case for SSDI beneficiaries.\nThis seems especially likely given that far fewer SSI beneficiaries than SSDI beneficiaries worked three\nyears prior to application when they presumably did not have as a work limitation severe enough to qualify\nfor benefits.\n54For example, SSDI is an insurance-based (non-means-tested) program with its benefits based\non past individual earnings history, while SSI is a flat rate means-tested welfare program. SSDI provides\nrecipients Medicare benefits after they are on the program two years and restricts its recipients to labor\nearnings up to $750 per month for a limited period, after which they face a significant program “notch”\nand lose all SSDI benefits. SSI provides it recipients with immediate access to Medicaid and, once on\nthe program, allows them more generous work options compared to SSDI.\n-43-\n\nAlthough it is not clear that the SSDI research will shed much light on the work behavior of SSI\nrecipients, there is a large literature on the work incentives/disincentives in other welfare programs. This\nempirical research consistently finds that recipients are unresponsive to changes in marginal tax rates (for\nreviews of this literature see Moffitt, 1986 and Hoynes and Moffitt, 1996). This literature provides little\nevidence that individuals participating in means-tested programs respond to financial incentives by working\nmore. Research on the extent to which individuals with disabilities have the same income and substitution\nelasticities of participants in other programs would be an important step in determining whether the results\ndiscussed are applicable to the SSI population.\nFinally, the small amount of research that does exist on the work efforts of SSI recipients suggests\nthat, despite special allowances for SSI recipients who receive earnings (e.g., 1619(a) and (b) status), only\na small percentage of disabled adult SSI recipients work.55 In 1976 only 3.4 percent of all disabled adult\nbeneficiaries worked. Since that time, the percentage of disabled SSI recipients with earnings has nearly\ndoubled but, at 6.3 percent in 2001, remains quite low.56 A somewhat more optimistic picture comes from\nwork by Muller, Scott, and Bye (1996), looking at the work history of SSI recipients. They find that\namong a sample of SSI beneficiaries coming onto the rolls between 1976 and 1988, approximately one-\nquarter worked during the time they received benefits.\nIn response to the low number of SSI recipients who work, the Social Security Administration has\nconducted two large-scale return-to-work demonstration projects to study the effectiveness of providing\nrehabilitation and employment services to SSI beneficiaries. The first, the Transitional Employment\nTraining Demonstration (TETD) project, which operated between 1985 and 1987, focused on SSI\n55Section 1619 (Public Law 96-265) became law in 1986. These provisions dramatically altered\nthe earnings opportunities for SSI disabled adults. Section 1619(a) allows recipients to maintain their SSI\n(and Medicaid) benefits even when their earnings exceed SGA. Section 1619(b) extends Medicaid\ncoverage to workers whose earnings make them ineligible for SSI cash payments.\n56Data on recipients who work come from SSI Annual Statistical Supplement, 2002.\n-44-\n\nbeneficiaries whose primary condition was mental retardation. The second, Project Network, operated\nbetween 1992 and 1995 and included SSDI and SSI beneficiaries with a wide range of diagnoses. The two\ndemonstration projects were run in a similar fashion. Eligible beneficiaries in selected cities were invited to\nparticipate in the two projects. Volunteers were then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups.\nThe treatment groups were provided with rehabilitation and employment services, while the control group\nwas not. Using both survey and administrative data, the effectiveness of the rehabilitation and employment\nservices could then be studied by comparing outcomes of the experimental and control groups.\nAnalysis of the impact of the TETD project suggests that the employment and rehabilitation\nservices provided to SSI beneficiaries significantly increased earnings for participants over the six years\nthey were observed (earnings of the treatment group were close to 70 percent higher than the control group\n(roughly $4,000 in 1996 dollars) but the program only had a small impact on average SSI payments ($870\nper participant). This small reduction in SSI payments was not nearly sufficient to cover the average costs\nof transitional employment services for program participants (Thornton and Decker 1989).57 However,\nwhen the employment and earnings gains for program participants are weighed against the costs of\nproviding the employment services, the program may very well have produced a net social benefit. Similar\nresults were obtained from Project Network. Analyses of the program (Kornfeld and Rupp 2000) show\nthat during the first two years of operation Project NetWork produced modest net benefits to persons with\ndisabilities, as earnings gains among participants more than offset reductions in SSI and SSDI benefits.\nHowever, the small gain in earnings was not nearly sufficient to offset the costs of administering Project\nNetWork. Moreover, data for a third year follow up on about 70 percent of the sample show earnings\ngains declined to about zero, suggesting that the increase in earnings may have been temporary.\n57The net effect of the transitional employment services is harder to evaluate and depends crucially\non the extent to which the services provided by the project substitute for other services paid for by the\ngovernment (Thornton and Decker 1989).\n-45-\n\nImportantly, in both cases the fraction of program eligibles who volunteered for either TETD or\nProject Network was small—roughly 5 percent in each experiment. This suggests that, however beneficial\nit might be to those who participate, the provision of transitional employment services to those on SSI who\nvolunteer for services is unlikely to have much of an impact on the overall SSI population. This is hardly\nsurprising. As shown earlier in this chapter, only a small fraction of SSI applicants were working in the\nyears prior to application. In addition, beneficiaries go through a long process to establish that they have\nmedical conditions that prevent them from performing substantial gainful activity. At least at the time they\napply for SSI benefits, applicants would appear to have put substantial energy into becoming eligible for\nprogram benefits—benefits that must more than compensate applicants both for any loss of income\nassociated with moving onto SSI as well as for the costs associated with applying for benefits.58 For the\ngreat majority of those awarded benefits, their health is unlikely to improve over time and their labor\nmarket opportunities are probably deteriorating. Moreover, those who return to work may be subject to\nhigh marginal tax rates.59 Under such adverse conditions it is not surprising that voluntary returns to work\nare rare.\nSSI and Families of Children with Disabilities\nAs noted earlier, the primary justification for awarding cash benefits to poor families containing\na disabled child is that the families of disabled children face additional economic burdens associated with\n58As will be discussed later in this chapter, the cost of applying for SSI disability benefits for the\naverage applicant may be lower today than in previous periods. To the extent that welfare reform has\nchanged the SSI applicant pool, individuals may not be making a choice between work and benefits but\nrather between other welfare and SSI. Moreover, in response to both welfare reform and state financing\nissues, state governments may engage in more SSI outreach and lower the applicant’s cost of applying.\n59The evidence we have on the extent of work activity by those who have been awarded SSI\nbenefits comes mostly from the analysis of Social Security Earnings data. Anecdotal evidence suggests that\nsome fraction of those on SSI are actually working, but are working “off the books.” Research targeted on\nsuch “off the books” work by SSI beneficiaries along the lines of that done by Edin and Lein (1997) on\nwelfare recipients would be valuable.\n-46-\n\ntheir child’s poor health (see NASI 1996). These economic burdens may include lost earnings from a\nparent who provides care for the disabled child and medical and nonmedical expenses related to the\nchild’s specific disability. However, SSI child benefits are not based on an earnings replacement or\nexpenditure offset formula, but, rather are means-tested against current income. It is difficult to know a\npriori whether beneficiary families experience dramatic drops in labor earnings or increases in net-of-\ndisability-expenditures in family income. In fact, it is equally possible that recipient families have low\nincomes prior to the onset of the child's disability, and that the additional burdens placed on families with\na disabled child are not the root cause of their current financial situation.\nAs with the adult SSI program, the child SSI program faces the problems related to moral\nhazard—incentives for parents to have their children become and remain eligible for SSI. The degree to\nwhich this potential moral hazard causes behavioral changes with respect to gaining and maintaining\neligibility depends, to some degree, on the pre-disability economic circumstances of the covered families.\nIf the typical family is a middle-income family that experiences a dramatic decline in their economic\nwell-being at the onset of their child's disability, but in all other ways has the market and social\ncharacteristics necessary to attain middle-income status, then cash programs that only partially offset\nthese losses are unlikely to lead to major disincentives for labor market participation or the child's\nrecovery. However, if the typical family that comes onto the SSI rolls is already economically vulnerable\n(e.g., family members have few market skills, one-parent family, etc.) prior to the onset of their child's\ndisability, eligibility for SSI is likely to have much greater economic importance. Poor families who\nhave a child with a disability may be able to completely replace or even increase their family income if\ntheir child's disability results in the receipt of SSI benefits. Thus, pre-disability differences in economic\nwell-being alter the replacement rate of SSI among families of children with disabilities and make the\nmoral hazard of behavioral change much greater among pre-disability low income families than among\nmiddle- or high-income families.\n-47-\n\nFactors Affecting SSI Participation. As is true for the adult disability determination process, the\ndisability determination process for children has undergone substantial revision. As noted earlier, the most\nimportant change came in 1990 when the Supreme Court required SSA to significantly broaden the\neligibility criteria for childhood disability. The same year as the Zebley decision, SSA also released\nregulations revising the procedures used to evaluate mental impairments among children. The new rules\nexpanded SSA’s medical listings for childhood mental impairments by adding such illnesses as attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and by incorporating functional criteria in the listings. Similar to\nthe changes made in the adult process, SSA modified the types of evidence used to judge the damage of\nmental illness; less emphasis was placed on the testimony of medical professionals and more weight was\ngiven to the information parents, teachers, and counselors provided about the child’s condition. As with the\nIndividual Functional Assessment (IFA), the new mental impairment regulations focused on how\ndisabilities affected a child’s performance in school.\nFollowing these changes the child SSI caseloads grew rapidly. Data from the Social Security\nAdministration show that between 1989 and 1996, the number of children under 18 receiving SSI more\nthan tripled, from 265,000 to 955,000. Applications increased from 132,000 in 1989 to 541,000 per year\nin 1994, and awards more than quadrupled. The yearly allowance rate on applications rose from 39\npercent in 1989 to a peak of 58.1 percent in 1992. In 1992, the number of children on SSI grew by 40\npercent (GAO 1998).\nIn response to rapid caseload growth and a burgeoning concern that the disability determination\nprocess was allowing too many children without serious medical problems onto the disability rolls,\nCongress narrowed the criteria for childhood disability in 1996. In addition, Congress mandated SSA to\nredetermine the eligibility of children on the rolls who might not meet the new eligibility criteria because\n-48-\n\nthey received benefits on the basis of the former, more lenient, standards.60 In 1997, the number of SSI\nrecipients under age 18 fell by 7.9 percent and increased only slightly in 1998.\nEconomic factors also influence the decision of families to participate in SSI. Evidence suggests\nthat a large fraction of the children coming onto the rolls in the 1990s previously participated in the\nAFDC program. Daly and Burkhauser (1998), using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of\nYouth (NLSY), calculate that two-thirds of children found eligible for SSI in the early 1990s were in\nfamilies already receiving some type of welfare assistance. Other things equal, families eligible for\nmultiple programs are likely to select those programs that provide the highest net benefit to them.\nAlthough additional costs are associated with SSI (e.g., more stringent application rules, greater stigma\nrelated to receiving benefits, etc.), as the benefit difference between SSI and other programs increases,\nmore families will be willing to incur these costs to improve their economic situation.\nKubik (1999) tests the empirical significance of this prediction. He finds that AFDC recipient\nfamilies who successfully qualify a child for SSI benefits can increase family income substantially.\nTable 9 (taken from Kubik, 1999) shows how a family’s income can change when a child moves from\nAFDC to SSI. The analysis is for two states, Maryland and Connecticut, and demonstrates two points:\n(1) families can significantly improve their economic well-being if someone in the family qualifies for\nSSI; and (2) the generosity of SSI relative to AFDC has grown over time, implying that the incentive to\ntransfer to the SSI program has grown. Table 8 shows that a family of three living in Maryland in 1990\ncould have increased monthly family income by over $3,500 if one child transferred to the SSI rolls. By\n1994, this advantage had grown to almost $4,400. Since other in-kind benefits, such as Medicaid and\nFood Stamps remained constant, the family experienced a net gain in income if the child moves from\nAFDC to the SSI rolls.\n60SSA originally identified 288,000 children as potentially affected by changes in the eligibility\ncriteria. In 1998, SSA scaled back their estimates; new estimates suggest that fewer than 100,000 children\nwill become ineligible for SSI (GAO 1998).\n-49-\n\nA small number of empirical papers have examined the responses of AFDC participants to\nchanges in the SSI program, including the post-Zebley broadening of the childhood disability criteria,\nand increases in the relative generosity of SSI benefits during the 1990s (see Rand (1998) for a thorough\nreview of this literature). Garrett and Glied (2000) examine the impact of the Zebley decision on SSI and\nAFDC caseloads using the Zebley ruling as a “natural experiment,” representing an exogenous increase\nin the supply of SSI benefits (i.e., eligibility criteria are relaxed and more families are allowed onto the\nSSI program). They exploit the state-level variation in the difference between SSI and AFDC payments\nto test whether families are responsive to increases in net benefits. Their findings suggest that families\nare responsive to differences in program generosity. They found that in low AFDC states, where the\ndifference between AFDC and SSI payments would be largest, about 53 percent of the new post-Zebley\nchild SSI cases switched from the AFDC program; nationally, only about 43 percent of new SSI child\ncases came from the AFDC program.\nAlong the same lines, Kubik (1999) examines the incentives for families to identify children as\ndisabled when SSI benefits are more generous than AFDC benefits. Using data from the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS) and changes in the difference in SSI and AFDC benefits, Kubik finds that\nreported disabilities—particularly mental impairments—were higher in low AFDC benefit states than in\nhigh AFDC benefit states.61 Using data from the Current Population Survey on household SSI receipt, he\nalso finds that relatively generous SSI benefits (relative to AFDC payments) affect SSI participation.\nKubik estimates that a 10 percent increase in SSI benefit generosity increases the probability of SSI\nparticipation among families with low education by 0.39 percentage point—a five percent increase in SSI\nparticipation. Overall, Kubik finds a significant and positive relationship between the marginal value of\nSSI benefits and the prevalence of disability, and receipt of SSI, among children.\n61To account for state-specific factors that may affect the prevalence of disability, Kubik examines\nthis relationship before and after Zebley. Thus, he measures the change in the prevalence of reported\ndisability and compares it to the change in the difference between SSI and AFDC benefits by state.\n-50-\n\nEffects of SSI on Work Effort of Families. SSI support for families potentially affects the labor\nmarket effort of parents. However, there is not a large empirical literature on this relationship. Indeed, of\nthe literature on childhood SSI, only the Garrett and Glied (2000) and Kubik (1999) papers consider this\nissue. Garrett and Glied (2000) estimate that the Zebley decision had a significant impact on the\nemployment of unmarried women without a high school education. Kubik (1999) finds similar results;\nexamining behavior after Zebley, Kubik finds that increases in SSI benefits lowered the probability that\nlow-education household heads work. He estimates that a 10 percent increase in SSI benefits decreases\nlabor force participation of low-education household heads by about 2 percent. The empirical evidence on\nthe effects of SSI benefit levels on parental work effort after Zebley suggest that, in addition to responding\nto the particular health needs of a child, mothers also respond to the income effect present in the guarantee\nas well as to the high marginal tax rates placed on their labor earnings.\nSSI and the Behavior of the Aged\nFactors Affecting Participation. Researchers have offered a number of hypotheses to explain the\nlow enrollment in SSI among the elderly, including lack of knowledge about the program and eligibility\ncriteria, prohibitively expensive application costs (e.g., time cost or cost of learning), and unobserved costs\nof receiving benefits (e.g., welfare stigma). Early work on this topic focused primarily on the roles of\nwelfare stigma and program knowledge on the decision to apply. Coe (1985) reported that of the SSI\nnonparticipants classified as eligible (48 percent of all eligible individuals), a significant fraction were not\naware of the program or did not think they were eligible. Coe also found that benefit levels were\npositively and significantly related to participation, with each $10 in additional benefits resulting in a 2.4\npercentage point increase in the probability of participation. This is consistent with the notion that\nrelatively high benefit levels would outweigh any noninformational barriers to participation, such as\naccess costs. However, Coe notes, noninformational barriers accounted for only 25 percent of the\nnegative effect of low benefits on participation. The primary reason lower benefit levels decreased\n-51-\n\nparticipation was that eligible individuals facing low benefit levels were more likely to believe that they\nwere not eligible to participate. Warlick (1982) also concluded that program information and the\ndifficulty of the application process were the primary reasons for low participation rates among the\neligible elderly.\nRecent work by McGarry (1996) draws a slightly different conclusion. McGarry extends\nprevious research by using detailed asset and income information from the 1984 SIPP to more accurately\nclassify eligibility by accounting for differences in benefit levels introduced by state supplementation,\nand by explicitly controlling for measurement error in the estimation process. McGarry concludes that\nthe participation decision is primarily determined by the financial situation of eligible individuals. She\nfinds that although all persons eligible for SSI are poor, the probability of participation declines as the\nnumber of alternative resources increases. Similar to Coe, she finds that the elasticity of the expected\nbenefit is about 0.5 and that, after controlling for size of the SSI payment, those with greater resources\nare less likely to participate.62\nMcGarry departs from previous research in finding little evidence that welfare stigma or\ninformational program costs affect participation. However, as she notes, her results must be interpreted\nwith caution. The estimated model is a reduced-form version, which includes variables likely to affect\nparticipation through more than one path. If a variable operates in opposite directions on different\nfactors, its importance may be obscured. Thus, while she argues that the negative coefficient on years of\nschooling implies that lack of information does not deter participants, this result can just as easily be\ninterpreted as evidence of stigma associated with receiving benefits (e.g., more educated individuals feel\nmore stigma associated with receiving benefits).\n62Coe’s measure of other resources includes only the home ownership variable. McGarry uses a\nmore extensive set of resource measures, including home and other asset ownership, labor earnings over the\nyear, and income-to-needs ratio.\n-52-\n\nIn general, the low SSI participation rates among the elderly remain somewhat of a mystery.\nAlthough there is reason to believe that some individuals are uninformed about the program or their\neligibility for benefits, there is not much evidence that a large fraction of the elderly poor in need of\nassistance are constrained by transactions costs. What does appear to be the case is that eligible\nindividuals who are close to the margin on the means test are less likely to participate in the program. As\nCoe (1985) argued, this may be due to individuals misunderstanding the income disregards and other\nprogram rules that determine eligibility. Thus, unless individuals are sufficiently below the means test\nguidelines, they believe that they will be ineligible, and thus, do not apply. This interpretation is\nconsistent with McGarry’s simulation of responses given a change in benefit levels. McGarry examined\nhow raising the federal income guarantee to the U.S. poverty line impacted the participation of those\npreviously, and newly eligible for benefits. She finds that raising the benefit level increases the\nparticipation rates of those previously eligible by 16.5 percentage points, from 0.534 to 0.699. In\ncontrast, she finds that less than 30 percent of those newly eligible under the increased income limit\nparticipate in the program.63\nSavings Behavior. Although it is well recognized that means-tested programs create incentives for\npotentially eligible individuals to alter their behavior to ensure qualification, few studies have rigorously\nreviewed the incentives facing elderly individuals close to the age and resource tests for SSI. Yet, it is\nlikely that SSI program features create disincentives for working and saving as individuals approach the\nage of eligibility. Neumark and Powers (1998) focus on the relation between saving behavior and SSI\nreceipt among the elderly. They argue that SSI’s influence on the savings patterns of elderly individuals\nshould vary with the expected level of their benefits and the likelihood of receiving them. In practice,\n63McGarry (2000) simulates the effects of changes in eligibility criteria on participation and costs.\nShe finds that extending the income guarantee for all elderly individuals to the poverty line has the largest\nimpact. Modifications to SSI that increase income disregards, eliminate the asset test, or base income\neligibility are less costly but also have less of an impact on poverty.\n-53-\n\nindividuals with low lifetime earnings living in high-benefit states should reduce saving more than high\nlifetime earners living in low-benefit states. Neumark and Powers use state-level variation in the generosity\nof supplemental SSI payments to identify the effects of SSI on the savings behavior of the elderly. They\nfind that SSI reduces the saving of men and women nearing the age of retirement who are likely\nparticipants in the program.\nSSI and Labor Force Participation at Older Ages. There only are a handful of papers that discuss\nSSI and the labor force behavior of older workers. Duggan (1984) finds that SSI has a negative impact on\nthe labor force participation of men and women over 54 years of age, with especially strong effects for\nmen. Powers and Neumark (2001, 2002) investigate the role that SSI plays in exercising the early\nretirement option in the Social Security program. While Powers and Neumark find only weak empirical\nevidence that eligibility for SSI benefits positively influences early retirement decisions, these effects may\nincrease in coming years. The normal retirement age for receiving social security benefits is now in the\nprocess of increasing from 65 to 67 over the next 15 years, increasing the value to those eligible of the SSI\nbridge, especially for those in very poor health.\n-54-\n\nVI. Summary and Conclusions\nThe enactment of the Supplemental Security Income program in 1972 was the culmination of a\nfour-year debate over a much more overarching welfare reform—a federally-funded minimum income\nguarantee for all Americans. Unlike Nixon's FAP proposal, SSI was targeted on the sub-group of low-\nincome individuals \"not expected to work.\" Since then, SSI has grown dramatically, with the composition\nof SSI beneficiaries shifting towards adults and children with disabilities.\nHow one views the increases in the SSI disability population largely is influenced by one's view of\nthe social purpose of SSI. For those who see SSI as an incomplete substitute for a universal guaranteed\nincome program like the NIT, expansions in the SSI program are seen as appropriate because they bring\nthe United States more into line with most Western European countries that provide such a universal\nminimum social safety net for all their citizens. However, for those who are worried about the long-term\neffects of a life-time on government transfers, the rise in the prevalence of disability transfer\nrecipients—particularly among poor children and younger adults—is of more concern.\nWhatever perspective one takes, however, as the population on SSI changes and the group of those\nnot expected to work narrows, the structure of SSI comes into question. As we have shown, the SSI\npopulation has dramatically shifted over time. It is now dominated by children and young adults with\ndisabilities. To date, despite some attempts to offset the negative work incentives in SSI—Section\n1619—exits from SSI to employment, even among this younger population, have been rare. As shown\nearlier in this chapter, for individuals and families receiving SSI and other transfer program benefits the\nmarginal tax rates can go from 50 to near 100 percent at relatively low earnings levels. While such high\ntax-rates and relatively generous guarantees make sense for populations not expected to work, in a\npopulation where work is possible, they seriously discourage work. Hence, for those with a capacity to\nwork, SSI, together with eligibility for other programs, can become the “poverty trap” that the original\nsupporters of Nixon’s single universal FAP program were trying to avoid.\n-55-\n\nSuch concerns are particularly relevant in light of other government policies to protect those with\ndisabilities. Support for civil rights-based legislation like the ADA is based on the idea that people with\ndisabilities should have equal access to employment. Supporters of this type of legislation view unequal\naccess to jobs to be a greater impediment to employment than a health impairment. Furthermore, they ask\nthat social policy focus on altering workplace institutions to more fully accommodate people with\ndisabilities. Hence, in a world of full accommodation, they argue the disability-transfer population should\nbe zero. Fundamentally, the current policy debate over expanding SSI transfer rolls hinges on the role\npeople with disabilities should play in society. Should people with disabilities be expected to work or not?\nIf yes, then policies targeting people with disabilities—particularly the young—would be better focused on\neducation, rehabilitation, job training, and accommodation than on increasing or expanding transfers.\nLikewise, for children with disabilities, investing more time, energy, and resources toward enhancing their\neducation and development, rather than focusing solely on supplementing the income of their households,\nmight be more desirable.\nIn general, our examination in this chapter suggests that in the absence of a universal guaranteed\nincome program for all Americans, the operational flexibility of the categorical eligibility criteria for SSI\nhas made the program sensitive to both downturns in the business cycle and to increases in the pool of\nvulnerable people. Moreover, when the dividing lines separating the working-age adult and child\npopulations eligible for SSI from those eligible for other income-based benefits are imprecise, as with\ndisability, policy changes in other welfare programs likely will affect SSI caseloads.\n-56-\n\nReferences\nAarts, L., R.V.

Yet its causes remain poorly understood. This\nstudy documents a paradox: the happiest places have the highest suicide rates. The study\ncombines findings from two large and rich individual‐level data sets — one on life satisfaction\nand another on suicide deaths — to establish the paradox in a consistent way across U.S. states.\nIt replicates the finding in data on Western industrialized nations and checks that the paradox is\nnot an artifact of population composition or confounding factors. The study concludes with the\nconjecture that people may find it particularly painful to be unhappy in a happy place, so that\nthe decision to commit suicide is influenced by relative comparisons.\n2\n\nIntroduction\nHuman well‐being is increasingly studied in science and social science [1‐7]. A common claim of\nmany countries and even states within the U.S. is that they are filled with happy and/or\nsatisfied people. Rankings from the World Values Survey and the U.S. General Social Survey\nfrequently appear in the press—and more scholarly outlets—where we learn that Danes,\nSwedes, and the Swiss are among the most satisfied people in Europe and that it may be better\nto reside in Alaska than in California [2,8].\nA rarely‐noted difficulty is that these notably ‘happy’ places have high rates of suicide.\nWhile this puzzling fact has been remarked on occasionally for individual nations, especially for\nthe case of Denmark, it has been attributed in an anecdotal way to idiosyncratic features of the\nlocation in question (e.g., the dark winters in Scandinavia), problems or variations in\nmeasurement of well‐being and/or suicide, or differences in culture and attitudes regarding\nhappiness and taking one’s life. Few scholars have thought of the anecdotal observation as a\nsystematic relationship robust to replication and investigation.\nA further, and potentially related, empirical issue has been discussed but never resolved\nin the literature on the epidemiology of suicide. There is no known explanation for the\nstatistical evidence that suicide rates drop during wartime [9‐11].\nA possible cross‐country association between happiness and suicide has been\nmentioned, albeit in passing, in innovative previous work examining whether survey data on\nsubjective well‐being might be used as tractable markers of population mental health [12].\nOther research has examined the spatial patterns in suicide [eg. 13].\n3\n\nThis paper documents the existence of a happiness‐suicide paradox. Happier places\nhave more suicides. Figure 1 provides the first and simplest evidence. It uses raw, unadjusted\ndata on subjective well‐being rankings (from the World Values Survey) and suicide rates (from\nthe World Health Organization). Although there are variations around the average (e.g., the\nNetherlands), the striking association in the scatter plot is the positive association between\nhappiness ranking and suicide rate. This gradient is the opposite of that expected.\nThe positive gradient in Figure 1 is not driven by the Scandinavian nations alone.\nNations such as Iceland, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada, and the U.S. each display relatively high\nhappiness and yet high suicide rates. Moreover, the finding is not an anomaly of the World\nValues survey or a result merely of raw correlations between happiness and suicide. If we use\nthe estimated relative happiness values across countries, taken from another study [14], which\nemployed regression‐equation methods to adjust for nations’ demographic characteristics, the\nsame positive relationship holds between subjective national well‐being and national suicide\nrates (Figure 2). The data in these scatter plots suggest the presence of a robust relationship\nthat holds in countries with harsh and less harsh winters, with more and less religious influence,\nand with a range of cultural identities. Nevertheless, because of the variation in culture and\nsuicide‐reporting conventions, cross‐country scatter plots are no more than suggestive.\nThe Paradox in U.S. Data\nThe central contribution of this paper is to establish the happiness‐suicide paradox across space\nwithin a single country, the United States. The scientific advantage of doing so is that cultural\nbackground, national institutions, language, and religion are then held constant in a way that is\nimpossible in Figures 1 and 2.\n4\n\nBuilding on two channels of previous work, it has very recently become possible to\nexamine data on both happiness and suicide risk across the 50 U.S. states and the District of\nColumbia [2, 15]. The paper’s data are drawn from (i) the Behavioral Response Factor\nSurveillance System, which are based on individual reports of subjective well‐being for 1.3\nmillion Americans, (ii) published state suicide rates, and (iii) the National Longitudinal Mortality\nStudy, which matches death certificate data to individual records from the U.S. Census Bureau’s\nCurrent Population Surveys from 1978 through 2001. This paper uses these data to obtain\naverage life satisfaction and average suicide risk for each of the 50 U.S. states, and repeats the\nform of analysis performed above on Western industrialized countries.\nSpatial U.S. data allow us to address two questions related to the possible existence of a\nhappiness—suicide paradox. First, is it real? Since the potential bias embedded in cross‐\ncountry comparisons are minimized, any observed positive association is likely to be the result\nof a true positive correlation as opposed to a spurious outcome of omitted variables. Second,\nand importantly, it is possible with the paper’s two large individual‐level data sets, on life\nsatisfaction and on US suicides, to establish that the observed association between happiness\nand suicide in the United States is robust to the inclusion of controls for the demographic and\nsocioeconomic characteristics known to be correlated with happiness and suicide risk.\nThe analysis first examines the correlation between reported happiness and raw suicide\nrates. It then calculates regression‐adjusted correlations, where the adjustments here are for a\nfull set of demographic and socioeconomic controls using multivariate regressions. The\nregression controls include age, race, gender, marital status, education, income, and\nemployment/labor‐force status as well as year fixed effects to control for any changes over\n5\n\ntime. [For a full discussion of the data and methods, see the section at the end of the\nmanuscript.]\nResults\nFigure 3 provides a scatter plot of raw (ie, unadjusted) suicide rates and raw ‘happiness’ scores\nfor the 50 U.S. states. These unadjusted suicide rates and raw life satisfaction scores are\npositively related (Pearson’s correlation=0.249, p = 0.06; rank correlation=0.255, p = 0.05). This\nassociation is consistent with the pattern observed for the Western industrialized nations.\nStates which are happiest have higher suicide rates than those which are less happy. For\nexample, Utah is ranked number 1 in life‐satisfaction, but has the 9th highest suicide rate.\nMeanwhile, New York is the 45th happiest state, yet has the lowest suicide rate in the USA.\nA natural question is to what extent the paradox holds when controls for population\ncomposition are included. Figure 4 plots the results of this analysis, where the average life\nsatisfaction and suicide risk by state are adjusted for differences in age, gender, race,\neducation, income, marital status and employment status. The Pearson correlation coefficient\nis positive (correlation = 0.127, p‐value > 0.1). However, this apparently lower correlation\ncoefficient is disproportionately affected by suicide outliers such as Nevada, Alaska, New\nHampshire, and California. A more reliable Spearman rank correlation, which is robust to\noutliers, is 0.271, which is positive and significant (p‐value < 0.05). Hence the paradoxical\npositive relationship seen in raw, unadjusted data is not due to confounding caused by\ndifferences in population characteristics across states.\nTable 1 shows more details on these scatter plots and allows a focus on the patterns\nacross states. The table reveals that Hawaii ranks #1 in adjusted average life satisfaction, yet\n6\n\nremarkably has the fifth highest suicide rate in the country. At the other end of this spectrum,\nNew Jersey ranks near the bottom in adjusted life satisfaction (47th) yet has one of the lowest\nadjusted suicide risks (coincidentally, the 47th highest risk).\nDiscussion\nThe paradox holds in data for western nations, but it is its occurrence in data from the\nintrinsically more homogeneous setting of the U.S. states (both in raw correlations and adjusted\ncorrelations) that makes it more persuasive empirically. The explanation for the pattern found\nis currently unknown; that must await future research. However, looking beyond culture and\ndifferences in the reporting of happiness and suicide scores, one possible account draws on\nstudies of comparisons. Unhappy people in a happy place may feel particularly harshly treated\nby life, thereby increasing their risk of suicide. If humans are subject to mood swings, the lows\nmay be most tolerable in an environment ‐‐ whether a time of war or a geographical area ‐‐ in\nwhich other humans are unhappy. Whether such relative comparisons work by producing\ndiscord due to unmet aspirations, or reflect a real inability to integrate into the broader society\nand gain access to key supports [16], remains to be understood.\nData and Methods\nTo measure state level life satisfaction, we draw upon data collected under the auspices of the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The BRFSS is a state‐based system of health\nsurveys that gathers information on risky behaviors, preventive health practices, and access to\nhealth care. The BRFSS was established in 1984 by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC); currently data are collected monthly in all 50 states, the District of Columbia,\nPuerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. The data set is meant to “identify emerging\n7\n\nhealth problems, establish and track health objectives, and develop and evaluate public health\npolicies and programs.” More than 350,000 adults are interviewed each year; the BRFSS is the\nlargest telephone health survey in the world.\nWe study a sample of respondents between the ages of 18 and 85 with non‐missing\ninformation. The data set’s annual samples provide statistically representative1[1] cross‐\nsectional snapshots of the U.S. Information on individual life‐satisfaction was collected in\nBRFSS for the first time in 2005. Hence there has been little published research on life‐\nsatisfaction using this data set.\nIn addition to questions on health behaviors, access to health care, and physical health\nstatus, the survey also contains questions about mental health and subjective well‐being. We\nrely on one particular survey question. It provides information about how satisfied people feel\nabout the quality of their lives. The exact wording of the BRFSS life‐satisfaction question is: “In\ngeneral, how satisfied are you with your life?” Here people are able to answer one of the\nfollowing: Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, or Very Dissatisfied [Questionnaire line code\n206].\nTo measure state‐level suicide risk, we first obtain crude suicide rates from the report\n\"Ranking America's Mental Health: An Analysis of Depression Across the States.\" We then\nestimate adjusted average suicide risk by state using data from the National Longitudinal\nMortality Study, which is constructed by and housed at the U.S. Census Bureau. The adjusted\nsuicide risks are the hazard ratios corresponding to the estimated coefficients on state dummy\nvariables in a suicide Cox Proportional Hazards model which includes age, race, gender,\n8\n\neducation, income, marital status, and employment/labor‐force status – the same set of\ncontrols used to adjust the life satisfaction estimates. See Daly, Wilson, and Johnson (2008)\nand Daly and Wilson (2009) for more details about the NLMS and the Hazards model we use\nhere.\nFor the cross‐country comparisons, suicide rates are taken from the WHO:\nhttp://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/. Country happiness\ncoefficients are taken from Table 3 of Blanchflower and Oswald [14]. Controls in the underlying\nregressions include age, gender, education, marital and employment status and age left\nschooling.\n9\n\nReferences\n1. Easterlin RA (2003) Explaining happiness.

Introduction\nUnsustainable growth in program costs and beneficiaries, together with a growing\nrecognition that even people with severe impairments can work, led to fundamental disability\npolicy reforms in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Great Britain. These fundamental reforms\nsubstantially reduced disability recipiency rates in these nations and put their disability programs\nback on a sustainable fiscal footing. For the most part the reforms focused on slowing entry onto\nlong-term disability cash transfers by keeping newly impaired workers in the labor market.\nAlthough there were some efforts to reduce the number of existing beneficiaries through\ndisability reassessments and work incentives, these were both less important and less successful.\nIn Australia, rapid growth in disability recipiency led to more modest reforms; disability\nrecipiency rates have fallen slightly in response, but there are reasons to believe the system\nremains vulnerable to a resurgence in growth.\nThe United States is now considering how best to reform its primary long-term disability\ncash transfer program, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI). As was the case in Australia,\nthe Netherlands, Sweden, and Great Britain before their reforms, disability recipiency in the U.S.\nis rising at an unsustainable pace. The DI rolls have risen from 1.2 million in 1967 to 8.8 million\nin 2012, and since 2009, the DI program has been paying out more in annual benefits than it\nreceives in taxes and interest from its trust fund. Based on current growth, the DI program is\nprojected to be insolvent by 2016 (Social Security Administration 2013a). At issue is whether\nmodest reforms that adjust aspects of the existing program or more fundamental reforms that\nchange how disability is identified and supported will be necessary to resolve these problems.\nHere we describe the factors driving unsustainable DI program growth in the U.S., show\ntheir similarity to the factors that led to unsustainable growth in these other four OECD\n2\n\ncountries, and discuss the reforms each country implemented to regain control over their cash\ntransfer disability program. Although each country took a unique path to making and\nimplementing fundamental reforms, shared lessons emerge from their experiences.\nFirst among them is that disability is not an immutable state, but rather a product of\nhealth and the social, cultural, and economic environment faced by individuals with\nimpairments. This leads to the second lesson: disability policy itself affects the behavior of\nindividuals with impairments. As reforms in these countries demonstrate, generous programs\nconditioned on not working lead to lower levels of work and higher disability recipiency than\nprograms focused on maintaining individuals with impairments in the labor market.\nThe third lesson is that incentivizing individuals with impairments to stay in the labor\nmarket is far easier than incentivizing existing disability beneficiaries to return to work. This\nmeans that gaining control of disability rolls is best done by stemming the flow of new\nbeneficiaries rather than trying to reduce existing DI caseloads. Finally, a recurring theme in\neach of the countries undertaking fundamental reforms is that disability policy is part of the\nbroader social safety net and cannot be altered independently. As the experiences of these\nOECD nations demonstrate, attempts to alter disability programs without acknowledging that\nthey interconnect with unemployment, retirement, and general social welfare programs and vice\nversa can result in unintended changes in program use and unsustainable growth in program\nrolls.\n2. Disability Program Growth across Countries\nThe number of workers receiving social insurance for disability has increased\nsubstantially in most OECD nations over the past forty years. Population growth explains part of\n3\n\nthis increase, but disability caseloads as a share of the working age population age—known as\nthe disability recipiency rate—also have risen rapidly.1 This can be seen in Figure 1, which\nshows the total number of persons receiving long-term categorical disability income benefits as a\nshare of the working-age population in the United States and four other OECD countries.2 This\nis the number most critical to policymakers since it measures the magnitude of the fiscal burden\nthat these disability programs place on country finances.3 We show values beginning in 1970\nthrough the last year these data were made public in each country.4 A more detailed description\nof the data for each country is provided in Appendix A.\nThe figure plots the level of disability recipiency (disability beneficiaries as a share of the\nworking-age population) over time for each country. In 1970, disability recipiency rates in our\nthree European nations were considerably higher: 3.5 percent in Sweden, 2.8 percent in Great\nBritain (1971) and 2.4 percent in the Netherlands, than they were in Australia (1.6 percent) and\nthe U.S. (1.2 percent). Since then disability recipiency rates have risen substantially in each\n1In a recent paper, Pattison and Waldron (2013) argue that population growth explains the bulk\nof the rise in disability recipiency in the U.S. In this paper we remove the influence of\npopulation growth and consider the factors that explain the remaining rise in the program. Since\npopulation growth alone would not put additional financial pressure on the system, knowing\nthese other factors is critical to policymakers tasked with putting the system back on sustainable\nfinancial footing.\n2The U.S. disability recipiency rate only includes beneficiaries receiving DI. Although\npolicymakers treat Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and DI as separate programs,\nBurkhauser and Daly (2011 and 2013) argue that for the purpose of evaluating the role of\ndisability benefits in the U.S. they should be combined. When SSI-disabled adults and DI\nprogram beneficiaries are combined, the level of the U.S. disability recipiency rate is higher, but\nthe patterns over time are roughly the same. See for instance Burkhauser and Daly 2013, Figure\n2)\n3The fiscal burden of disability programs comes from the fact that beneficiaries receive income\nsupport and they generally do not contribute to the tax base since they are largely out of the labor\nforce.\n4Disability caseloads data are made public with a considerable lag in some countries. Hence we\ncan’t fully document how the Global Financial Crisis affected recipiency rates in all countries.\n4\n\ncountry, although as the figure highlights, they have done so along significantly different\ntrajectories.\nTo see these fluctuations more clearly, Table 1 provides average annual growth rates in\ndisability recipiency by decade and over the entire sample. As the table shows, disability\nrecipiency rates rose in all countries during the 1970s, with especially rapid growth in the\nNetherlands. In the 1980s, each country gained some control over their disability programs.\nRecipiency rates grew more modestly and even fell in the U.S. By the 1990s, growth in the\nNetherlands ended and disability recipiency rates fell on balance over the decade. In the other\ncountries, rates increased, with Great Britain posting the fastest pace of growth. During the\n2000s, disability recipiency rates continued to come down in the Netherlands and either\nplateaued (Australia) or fell (Sweden and Great Britain) in all countries but the U.S.\nThe final average (1970-final) shows that smoothing through the fluctuations in growth\nthat have occurred over the decades, the U.S. has experienced the highest average annual growth\nrate over the sample period. This is because periods of unsustainable growth in other countries\nwere followed by program reforms that tempered or reversed the path of disability recipiency\nand allowed countries to regain control of program growth. In contrast, with the exception of the\n1980s, growth in U.S. disability recipiency has been nearly continuous over the sample period.\nOf course one possible explanation for the differences in growth across countries is that\nhealth and population characteristics have evolved differently for each nation over time. If this is\nthe case, then U.S. policymakers might find little guidance in the reforms of other nations. For\nexample, if health or population characteristics are driving growth in the U.S. disability rolls,\nrather than disability policy and its implementation, then the fundamental restructuring of\ndisability policy undertaken in other nations may not be warranted or successful in the U.S.\n5\n\nTo understand the extent to which these factors might explain the growth in disability\nrecipiency shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, we compare trends in self-reported health across\ncountries and more formally evaluate the role that demographics and other changes in the\npopulation eligible for disability benefits might have in impacting trends in disability recipiency\nrates. We begin by examining trends in self-reported health over time and across countries.\nFigure 2 reports data from the OECD on self-reported health status for each of our countries.\nThe plot shows the percentage of the population in each country reporting that they are in good\nhealth on a survey that asks respondents to state whether they are in good, fair, or poor health.\nAlthough there are persistent differences across countries in the percent of individuals\nreporting good health, there is little variation over time within countries.5 Over the past ten years\nthe overall prevalence of good health among working-age populations has remained relatively\nsteady in each country. The relative stability of the health measure in each of our sample\ncountries suggests that changes in the prevalence of disabilities in the working-age population is\nunlikely to be responsible for the within and across country fluctuations in disability recipiency\nrates found in Figure 1 and Table 1.\nA second reason disability recipiency rates may have varied across countries over time is\nthat the eligible populations in those nations may have evolved differently. To investigate this\npossible explanation, we compute counterfactual disability recipiency rates for each country\nusing the methodology in Daly, Lucking and Schwabish (2013). This measure represents the\ngrowth in disability recipiency rates, absent the influences of the aging of the workforce and any\nincrease in eligibility age for retirement benefits. In addition, in the U. S., we also consider the\n5Some of the difference across countries relates to the age structure of the population. Older\npopulations report lower rates of good health than younger populations. Remaining differences\nlikely owe to reporting differences that are idiosyncratic to each country (see Van Soest,\nAndreyeva, Kapteyn and Smith, 2011).\n6\n\nrise in the employment rate of women and associated increase in DI coverage (to be eligible for\nDI you must have worked at least 5 of the last 10 years) which have changed over this period.\nThe details of these calculations and the specific factors we control for in each country are\nprovided in Appendix B.\nFigure 3 (panels A through E), plot the actual (the same rates shown in Figure 1) and\nadjusted disability recipiency rates, that net out these demographic and eligibility factors, for\neach country over time. The gray bars in the figures reflect recession periods in each country.\nThe figures also include information about key policy changes in each country; we will refer\nback to these in the next section when we summarize the evolution of policy in each country.\nThe panels in the figure show that changes in the composition of the eligible population\nhave been more important in some countries than in others. For example, changes in the eligible\npopulation had a notable effect in the U.S. and Australia whose post-World War II baby boom\ngenerations were large. As these populations aged, they put notable pressure on disability\nrecipiency rates in the 1990s and 2000s. This was not the case in the three European countries,\nwhere adjustments for demographic changes make almost no difference to the path of disability\nrecipiency rates.\nOverall, accounting for these changes does little to alter the picture developed in Figure 1\nand Table 1. This is confirmed in Appendix Figure B1 and Table B1 which repeat the analysis\nin Figure 1 and Table 1 using the adjusted disability recipiency rates. Figure B1 shows that\ncontrolling for these population factors, it remains the case that over the entire sample period a\nhigher share of working-age people are on categorical disability cash transfers in the\nNetherlands, Sweden and Great Britain than in the U.S. and Australia. Table B1 shows that over\nthe past 40 years, the U.S. has had the highest average growth rate. Thus, even when we adjust\n7\n\nfor differences in population characteristics across countries, the U.S. remains an outlier in\nexperiencing ongoing growth in disability recipiency rates.6 Since to date no major policy\nreforms have been implemented to address this growth, this gap between the U.S. and these other\ncountries is likely to grow larger in coming years.\nThe finding that neither health nor population characteristics can explain the cross-\ncountry differences in disability recipiency rates, either levels or trends, underscores the potential\nrole for policy.7 In what follows we describe how changes in disability policy and its\nimplementation in each country account for the fluctuations in the growth of these disability\nrecipiency rates.\n3. Disability Policy and Program Growth\nIn industrialized nations, social protection from income loss associated with disability is\njust one part of a broader social safety net designed to protect working age individuals from the\nloss of labor market income. Since labor market work is the primary source of income for most\nfamilies, OECD nations generally have built complex social protection schemes designed to\nsupport individuals who are unable to earn wages in the labor market. Most countries provide\n6The fact that adjusting for demographics and the entry of women into the labor force in the U.S.\nexplains only a fraction of the overall growth in disability recipiency rates is consistent with\nresearch by Duggan and Imberman 2009 and Daly, Lucking and Schwabish 2013. The\ncharacterization of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration (see Goss 2013)\ncontrast with this view, but this owes to the fact that they decompose growth in disability\ncaseloads rather than disability recipiency rates. As noted in footnote 1, we believe this\napproach is less informative to policymakers.\n7We are not the first to make this point. The OECD (2010) summary of disability program\ngrowth across OECD nations concludes that policy rather than population characteristics are\nbehind the rapid expansion of disability benefit receipt in most nations. The point is also\nemphasized by Autor and Duggan 2010 and Burkhauser and Daly 2011 and 2012.\n8\n\nthis protection in tiers associated with the social expectations for employment of different\ngroups.\nIn general, the first tier provides universal, long-term, needs-based cash transfers that\nguarantee a social minimum income to all families. The second tier provides cash support to\nthose available for employment and expected to work, but who are temporarily unemployed.\nThese benefits are usually conditional on past work, limited in duration, and may be needs-\nbased. The third tier targets benefits to those not expected to work—the aged, disabled, etc.—\nand can either be needs-based or based on past earnings. Since recipients of these benefits are\nnot expected to return to employment, benefits are typically higher and not time limited.\nWhen these tiers provide substantially different amounts of income and their categories\nare mutable, it is critical that the long-term or higher benefit programs have verifiable eligibility\ncriteria that allow program gatekeepers to consistently determine who should come onto the\nprogram. For retirement programs this is straightforward; age is an arbitrary but easily verifiable\neligibility marker. Eligibility determinations by program gatekeepers will not vary greatly over\nthe business cycle and forecasts of program growth will be relatively easy to make.\nDisability is more difficult. Unlike retirement, there is no precise definition or easily\nverifiable marker for determining categorical eligibility for long-term disability benefits.\nMoreover, disability is not a static concept and social conceptualizations of disability evolve over\ntime. For example, over the last 20 years the medical model of disability underlying categorical\ndisability programs in most OECD countries has been rejected and replaced by a\nconceptualization that recognizes that the social environment is as important as health in\n9\n\ndetermining an individual’s ability to participate in society (WHO, 2001).8 Under this model,\n“work disability” is a changeable state that depends on a number of factors, including an\nindividual’s health impairment, the level of accommodation offered in the workplace, and the\nrelative economic payoffs associated with working or exiting the labor force to receive disability\nbenefits.\nThe fluid nature of the disability category has meant that changes to disability policy\nparameters such as the level of benefits and the scope of conditions that qualify have had much\nlarger impacts on caseload growth and disability recipiency rates than policymakers expected or\neven intended. For the most part, the unanticipated effects can be traced back to the interplay\nbetween disability programs and the policy and economic environment within which they\noperate.\nFor example, in a number of OECD nations, the relative value of disability benefits has\nrisen significantly over time, as policymakers have cut payments or imposed stricter eligibility\ncriteria on other benefit programs including unemployment insurance and general welfare.\nStructural changes in the economy including the declining job and wage prospects for low-\nskilled workers also have made disability benefits more attractive as means of long-term income\nsupport. Finally, disability benefits have increasingly become an option for displaced or long-\nterm unemployed workers dislocated during economic downturns. Since very few disability\nbeneficiaries ever return to the labor market, the growth in the rolls that occurs during and after\nrecessions leads to a long term increase in disability recipiency rates. These rates then remain\n8There is no clear consensus on the most appropriate conceptualization of disability, although the\nmost widely used is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\nDisability, Health, and Functioning (WHO, 2001).\n10\n\nelevated until these recession induced cohorts of beneficiaries age out of the system or die. For a\nmore detailed discussion of these issues in OECD nations see OECD (2010).\nBelow we discuss how disability program designs and changes in disability policy\nparameters in Australia, Great Britain , the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.S. have affected\ndisability recipiency rates in each country. When relevant we also discuss how these policy\nstructures have interacted with macroeconomic conditions and the broader social safety net to\namplify growth in the disability rolls. For reference, Figure 3 (Panels A through E) shows\ndisability recipiency rates (unadjusted and adjusted) along with major policy changes over time\nfor each country. Table 2 provides key information about the current state of disability programs\nin each nation.\n3.1 The U.S. Experience\nThe United States has no first-tier, universal needs-based cash transfer program that\nprovides a guaranteed social minimum income floor to all its citizens. The Supplemental\nSecurity Income (SSI) program, which is limited to the aged, disabled adults and parents of\ndisabled children, is its only long-term needs-based cash transfer program.9,10 The only other\nmajor categorical needs-based cash transfer program in the U.S. is Temporary Assistance for\nNeedy Families (TANF), which is targeted at single mothers and provides an even lower\nguaranteed income level and the guarantee is limited to 5 years.\n9SSI is similar in design to Australia’s Disability Support Pension (DSP) and the Dutch\ncategorical disability-based welfare program (Wajong) but its income guarantee level is\nsubstantially lower than either.\n10The SSI aged and disabled adults programs share the same categorical eligibility criteria\napplied for the earnings based retirement or Old-Age Insurance (OAI) and Disability Insurance\n(DI) programs. Individuals with sufficiently low earnings records may jointly qualify for OAI\nand SSI aged benefits and for DI and SSI disabled adult benefits. This said, these programs are\ngenerally treated separately by policymakers.\n11\n\nThe second tier in the U.S. includes unemployment insurance benefits, which replace a\nfraction of wages for covered workers for short periods of time. In normal economic times,\nunemployment benefits can last up to 26 weeks. During recessions, this maximum is often\nextended and it rose to 99 weeks in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. Unemployment\ninsurance benefits are generally higher than SSI or TANF benefits.\nThe social security old-age retirement (OAI) and disability (DI) programs make up the\nthird tier of benefits in the U.S.; they provide social insurance to workers who have paid social\nsecurity taxes over their working life. To be eligible for benefits, workers must have\naccumulated sufficient quarters of coverage, as defined in the Social Security Administration’s\npension rules. These requirements are sufficiently strict to limit OAI and DI benefits to those\nwith substantial attachments to the labor market. (For a summary of the benefit requirements\nand rules, see Social Security Administration 2013b.) Benefit levels from these programs are\nbased on past earnings and can be substantially higher than the social minimum level of benefits\nguaranteed by the SSI aged and disability programs.\nEligibility for DI benefits requires applicants to meet a federal disability standard applied\nby administrative evaluators and adjudicators located in each state. The criteria are in principle\nquite strict. Eligibility requires that a worker be “unable to perform any substantial gainful\nactivity on any job in the economy for at least one year”. There is no benefit for partial\ndisability. Disability benefits are intended to be a last-resort for those with permanent and total\nimpairments. See Table 2 for more details on the U.S. DI program.\nAlthough the written eligibility criteria have not changed over time, their implementation\nhas and in a direction that has increased the number of working-aged adults receiving disability\nbenefits. Indeed, many of the disability recipiency rate fluctuations shown in Figure 1 and Table\n12\n\n1 line up with changes in Social Security Administration (SSA) policy that made it easier or\nharder to gain entry to the DI rolls. For example, rapid disability recipiency rate growth in the\n1970s aligns with Congressional actions that increased the replacement rate for a disabled\nworker with median earnings from 35 to 49 percent (Figure 3, Panel E). In the late 1970s and\nearly 1980s disability recipiency rates fell, first because program gatekeepers were urged to more\nstrictly interpret existing rules, and then because Congress in 1980 required SSA to reevaluate all\ncurrent recipients to see if they still met the medical standards. This rule change, which was\nrigorously enforced by SSA at the start of the new Reagan administration, resulted in a drop in\nthe DI rolls despite a major recession—the substantial drop in normalized adjusted disability\nrecipiency rates in the U.S. between 1978 and 1983 are in stark contrast to the sizable growth in\nthese values before 1978 and after 1990 (Figure 3, Panel E).\nBy 1983 the widespread reevaluation of those already on DI was halted as the courts and\nthen Congress restricted the SSA’s power to reevaluate beneficiaries. Furthermore, in 1984,\nresponding to a backlash against restrictive cuts imposed in the Social Security Disability\nAmendments of 1980, policymakers expanded the ways in which a person could medically\nqualify for the DI program. The 1984 legislation moved away from a strict medical listing\ndetermination of eligibility to one that also considered an applicant’s overall medical condition\nand ability to work. In addition, the legislation allowed for symptoms of mental illness and pain\nto be counted when assessing DI eligibility, regardless of whether the person had a verifiable\nmedical diagnosis (Figure 3, Panel E).11\nThe expansion of eligibility to more difficult to measure impairments that do not\nprecisely meet the medical listings means that SSA has increasingly been tasked with making\n11See Berkowitz and Burkhauser, 1996 for more discussion of these changes and their effects.\n13\n\nmore subjective decisions about the impact that presenting impairments might have on an\napplicant’s work ability.12 For applicants who do not meet or exceed the medical listings,\nprogram administrators consider a set of vocational criteria. While these vocational criteria have\nbeen in place over the history of the DI program, their use by program gatekeepers to determine\nbenefit eligibility has risen dramatically since 1991. Currently, they are used to justify the\nmajority of new awards, especially among those with the more difficult to determine conditions\nof mental illness and musculoskeletal conditions—the primary condition of more than 50 percent\nof all newly enrolled beneficiaries (Burkhauser and Daly, 2011).\nOne consequence of expanding eligibility beyond identifiable medical listings is that DI\napplicants and gatekeepers have much more of a role in determining program growth. For\nexample, over time the cyclical sensitivity of DI application rates has risen considerably.\nApplications rise during recessions and fall during periods of economic growth (see Rupp and\nStapleton, 1995; Stapleton, D., Coleman, K., Dietrich, K., and Livermore, G. 1998; Black,\nDaniel, and Sanders, 2002; Autor and Duggan, 2003). But as can be seen in Figure 3, Panel E,\nincreased applications generally result in an increase in disability recipiency rates which do not\nsubside as economic conditions improve, since once on, very few beneficiaries ever leave the\nprogram.\nIn addition to the cyclical sensitivity of disability applications and awards, there is\nevidence that there has been a secular rise in the number of workers who apply over time related\nto the unintentional increase in the replacement rates of DI for low wage workers (Autor and\n12Autor and Duggan (2006) argue that under these new eligibility standards, DI is a form of\n“unemployability” insurance in which individuals who have limited employment options can\nfind some way to qualify. They offer the example of individuals removed from the rolls in 1996\nwhen drug and alcohol addiction were removed from qualifying impairments. Autor and\nDuggan (2010) cite research by the Lewin Group (1995, 1998) showing that two-thirds of those\nremoved from the rolls re-qualified based on some other impairment.\n14\n\nDuggan, 2003). Again, since few beneficiaries ever leave the rolls to return to work, the surge in\ndisability recipient rates associated with business cycle fluctuations or economic restructuring\nhas generally translated into a long-term increase in disability recipiency rate in the working age\npopulation.\nFinally, there is evidence that the strictness of DI gatekeepers also varies. Maestas,\nMullen, and Strand (2013) using SSA administrative records estimate that 23 percent of\napplicants are initially accepted or denied based on whether they were assigned an easier or a\nstricter DDS gatekeeper rather than on differences in the status of their health or impairment\nstatus.\n3.2 The Netherlands13\nAs in the U.S., the disability system in the Netherlands contains both a social insurance\nprogram that protects workers against lost labor earnings and a program that provides a social\nminimum for disabled adults with little or no work history. A separate social minimum scheme\nfor the disabled self-employed ended in 2004. The Dutch social insurance program (WAO/WIA)\nprovides cash transfers to working-age men and women based on lost labor earnings. The\nNetherlands does not have a separate program similar to Workers’ Compensation. Rather, it has\na longer-term disability transfer program that, together with the sickness benefits all private firms\nmust offer their workers, provides a comprehensive system of both partial and total disability\nbenefits to workers regardless of how or where their disability occurred. The Dutch also have a\ncategorical disability-based welfare program (Wajong) that, unlike the general welfare scheme,\nis not means tested. This program is similar to the SSI-disabled adults program in that it targets\nmen and women whose disabilities occurred prior to their entrance into the labor force and are\n13A longer version of this summary of the Dutch system can be found in Burkhauser and Daly\n2011.\n15\n\nsevere enough that they have not engaged in full-time employment as adults. (See Table 2 for\ndetails of the disability program in the Netherlands.)\nOne reason for the rapid growth in the Dutch disability program over the 1970s was the\nrelatively generous benefits that the system provided (Figure 3, Panel C). The first level of\ndisability protection for Dutch workers was a universal sickness benefit—essentially a universal\nshort-term disability system. In the 1970s, government payments from this program replaced up\nto 80 percent of net-of-tax wage earnings for up to one year. However, most employees (90\npercent) and all civil servants had the rest of their net-of-tax earnings replaced by collective-\nbargaining agreements with their employers. These disability replacement rates were far in\nexcess of comparable programs in the U.S. Sickness benefits were payable for up to twelve\nmonths. After one year, employees still receiving benefits were eligible for disability benefit\nscreening. Workers with chronic conditions that caused a reduction in their capacity to perform\nwork commensurate with their job training and work history were eligible for disability benefits.\nThose judged fully disabled were eligible for benefits equal to 80 percent of their previous\nbefore-tax earnings. Those judged partially disabled (those with some residual earnings\ncapacity) were eligible for partial benefits; the minimum degree of impairment for eligibility was\n15 percent.\nIn a significant loosening of access to full disability benefits in the mid-1970s, Dutch\ncourts determined that unless disability evaluators could prove otherwise, they were required to\nattribute a partially disabled worker’s lack of employment to discriminatory behavior. The result\nwas that it became “administrative practice” to treat unemployed, partially disabled persons as if\nthey were fully disabled. That interpretation of the law made assessing lost earnings capacity\nunnecessary beyond the minimum 15 percent, since that became sufficient to entitle a person to\n16\n\nfull benefits. This essentially made the Dutch partial disability system a very generous full\ndisability program. These increases in eligibility together with the generosity of the system in\nlarge part explain the 11.45 percent per year increase in adjusted Dutch disability recipiency\nrates seen in Table 1 and Figure 3, Panel C, during the 1970s.\nThe serious recession of the early 1980s and the growing costs of the disability system\nput pressure on the Dutch government to reduce the growth of disability-based transfers.\nReforms initiated between 1982 and 1987 were the first of three major efforts over the next two\ndecades to regain control of the Dutch disability transfer system. By 1985, a series of cuts in the\nreplacement rate effectively lowered it from 80 percent of before-tax income to 70 percent of\nafter-tax income for both new entrants and current beneficiaries. But that did not halt system\ngrowth completely and in 1987 the labor market consideration rule was abolished. Despite the\nlegal ban on including labor-market considerations in their assessments, disability adjudicators\nstill tended either to grant or deny full benefits. Denial rates remained quite low, suggesting that\nthe legal change did not stop the de facto use of labor-market considerations in the adjudication\nprocess. Nonetheless these changes are responsible for the slower growth in disability recipiency\nin the 1980s that brought the Netherlands more in line with disability growth in Sweden and\nGreat Britain.\nBut it was not until the 1994 reforms that disability recipiency rates began to drop. These\nreforms included further tightening of eligibility criteria. Additionally, in a new policy, firms\nwere made responsible for an employee’s first six weeks of sick pay. The introduction of this\ntype of privatization of the disability system, although echoing a similar reform introduced in\nGreat Britain in the mid-1980s, was unprecedented in the Netherlands. It represented a\ndeliberate change in policy intended to encourage firms to provide accommodation,\n17\n\nrehabilitation, and continued employment opportunities to workers as an alternative to moving\nthem onto long-term cash benefits. The mandate that firms would bear the full responsibility for\nsick pay was extended from six weeks to one year in 1996. Despite these reforms, the decline in\nthe Dutch disability recipiency rate stopped in 1997 and began to slowly climb.\nIn 2002, the Dutch disability system began to phase in the third and most significant set\nof reforms. These reforms culminated in the establishment of a new disability insurance scheme\nin 2004—WIA—which replaced the WAO scheme that had been in place since 1967. These\nsystemic reforms fundamentally changed disability policy in the Netherlands. The reforms made\nwork rather than cash benefits the expectation and enforced this by increasing the incentives of\nboth employees and their employers to invest more time and effort in accommodation and\nrehabilitation following the onset of a disability.\nForemost among the reforms was the extension from one year to two years of the\nmandate that firms (including small employers) bear full responsibility for employees’ sick pay.\nThese changes effectively meant that during the first two years following a health shock, workers\nwere the responsibility of the firm and not eligible for long-term government provided disability\nbenefits. During these two years, employers must allow workers receiving sickness benefits to\nremain with the firm and can only dismiss employees who refuse to cooperate in a reasonable\nwork-resumption plan.\nThe reforms also gave firms a list of prescribed rehabilitation and accommodation\nactivities that they (via a private occupational health agency) must provide to workers to assist\nthem in remaining on their job or finding alternative employment. When the two years are\ncomplete, workers are allowed to apply for long-term disability benefits, but they are required to\nprovide documentation regarding return-to-work efforts during the two-year period. In 2007,\n18\n\nnearly 14 percent of disability insurance claims were returned to employers and the employer\ncontinued to be responsible for employing the worker until the claim was processed or the\nworker had returned to the old or a new job.\nReforms at the front end of the process were accompanied by significant reforms in the\nlonger-term benefit program. All employers were made to pay for the full and permanent\ndisability program through a uniform pay-as-you-go premium rate. Employers also had to pay to\nfund the publicly run partial disability program, but they could opt out of it by enrolling their\nworkers with a private insurer instead. Either way, employers have to pay experience-rated\npremiums that cover the first ten years of partial disability benefit receipt. After ten years,\nbenefits are covered by the uniform pay-as-you-go rates that also cover the fully and\npermanently disabled and the stock of current beneficiaries under the old system. Based on these\nreforms, the Dutch disability system, long seen as out of control, is now considered by Prinz and\nThompson (2009) in their comparison of OECD disability systems as one that has learned from\nits mistakes and provides an example for other OECD countries to follow.\nWhile it is still too early to determine the full effect of these policy changes on the Dutch\ndisability beneficiary population, Van Sonsbeek and Gradus (2011) provides the first micro-\nsimulation of the consequences of the post-2002 round of policy changes discussed above. They\nestimate that the combined impact of the introduction of experience rating together with the\nintroduction of the statutory Gatekeeper Protocol and stricter examinations will reduce the\nprojected long-term number of disability beneficiaries by 600,000 and that the introduction of the\nnew WIA scheme will further reduce that projected number by 250,000 by 2040, as compared to\na “no-change scenario.”\n19\n\n3.3 Sweden\nLike most European nations Sweden has a long-standing first-tier, universal needs-based\ncash transfer program that provides a guaranteed social minimum income floor to all its citizens.\nThis first-tier protection is funded out of general revenues and is available to everyone who lives\nor works in Sweden. Although benefits provide minimum income to anyone in need, applicants\napply for benefits based on income and particular circumstances, such as disability, parental\nneeds, or old age. Benefits are set nationally and indexed to keep pace with the price level.\nSweden also provides second and third tier benefits. The second tier in Sweden includes\nunemployment insurance benefits, which include both a mandatory and voluntary component.\nThe mandatory component is paid for by all employers and replaces a minimum fraction of\nwages for covered workers. The number of weeks covered by unemployment insurance has\nfluctuated over time but is generally longer than in the U.S. Most individuals also are covered\nby voluntary unemployment insurance which is negotiated between firms and trade unions.\nSomewhat uniquely among the countries we review, Sweden also has many private options for\nunemployment insurance; these may be purchased individually or through an employer.\nSweden provides third tier benefits, including old-age pensions and sickness and\ndisability benefits, through a combination of programs. For those with an earnings history the\nbulk of the protection is provided based on a social insurance program that, as in the U.S., is\nfinanced by statutory employer and employee contributions. Many employers in Sweden also\npay into occupational-based insurance and pension programs on behalf of their employees.\nParticipation in these schemes is driven by competitive forces or collective bargaining\nagreements with unions but a majority of employers in Sweden participate in these programs.\nSee Table 2 for more details about the Swedish disability system.\n20\n\nAs in the Netherlands, a key reason for the rapid growth in the Swedish disability\nprogram over the 1970s (see Table 1) was the relatively generous benefits that the system\nprovided. That generosity was apparent both in the ease of entry onto the program and the\nreplacement rate of benefits. The first level of protection for Swedish workers with health\nproblems is a sickness benefit. In the 1970s, sickness benefits replaced about 90 percent of\nexpected earnings for individuals with “abnormal physical or mental conditions” that reduced\ntheir normal work capacity by at least 25 percent. Workers claiming sickness absence for more\nthan eight days were required to get a certificate from a doctor. This was primarily facilitated by\nthe individual’s doctor with no centralized screening or standards.\nAfter one year, employees still receiving benefits could apply for long-term disability\ninsurance. Workers with functional limitations that caused a reduction in their capacity to\nperform work commensurate with their job training and work history were eligible for disability\nbenefits. Benefits were awarded for partial (50 percent) and full disability. For those under age\n60, benefits included rehabilitation and vocational training. For those 60 and older, beneficiaries\nwere provided income support. Like sickness benefits, disability benefits were very generous\nreplacing the vast majority of expected lost earnings.\nOver the course of the 1970s, standards for obtaining long-term disability benefits were\nalso loosened to make it easier for the long-term unemployed to move onto the program. For\nworkers of all ages, unemployment spells of more than one year were added to the list of criteria\nconsidered in the disability screening process. For workers over age 60, long-term unemployed\nbecame a sufficient condition for moving onto disability benefits, even without a certifiable\nfunctional limitation. Similar to the Dutch case, these changes meant that the disability benefit\n21\n\nprogram was increasingly being used as a very generous long-term unemployment insurance\nprogram.14\nGenerous benefits and easier access resulted in steady growth in disability recipiency\nrates over the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 3, Panel D). These features also left the program\nvulnerable to rapid growth related to the serious recession in the early 1990s. As shown in\nFigure 3, Panel D, following the foreign exchange crisis in 1990 and ensuing deep recession,\ndisability recipiency rates surged. Policymakers responded by lowering the replacement rates on\nsickness benefits, making employers pay for the first 14 days of sickness absence, and removing\nthe pure labor market criteria for disability benefits for older workers. With these changes to\npolicy and an improving economy, disability recipiency rates stabilized for most of the rest of the\ndecade. That said, they remained quite high and at a level that policymakers believed\nunsustainable. As such, additional policy reforms were made throughout the 1990s designed to\nincrease the employer cost of worker sickness absence and increase the threshold for workers\napplying for sickness and/or disability benefits.15\nFacing increasing fiscal pressures and a renewal of disability recipiency rate growth\n(Figure 3, Panel D), in 2000 the Swedish government proposed much more sweeping reforms to\nthe sickness and disability system. Despite considerable opposition from various advocacy\ngroups, significant reforms were put into place over the remainder of the decade. The driving\n14Econometric studies of the Swedish system support this view. See for example Rebick, 1994;\nLarrson 2002.\n15The Swedish government made numerous changes to sickness benefit replacement rates, the\nnumber of days the employer paid for employee sickness absence, and the number of days the\nworker had to wait before receiving sickness benefits (Andren 2003). In addition, policymakers\nremoved most of the special allowances for disability insurance afforded to unemployed and\nolder workers Jonsson, Palme, Svensson 2011.\n22\n\nprinciple behind the reforms was that work support, rather than cash assistance in lieu of work,\nwas the primary goal of disability policy.\nThis general principle translated into a number of important specific reforms. In 2003,\nthe government merged the sickness benefits and disability systems and began a series of\nchanges to standardize and enforce the administration of these now joint systems. Most notable\namong them was the centralization of screening processes. Up until this point, certification for\nsickness benefits had been variable as had disability benefit allowance rates. Although\nrehabilitation and vocational training were goals, many doctors and regional disability\ngatekeepers focused on providing income support rather than work retraining. By centralizing\nthe process and developing standardized protocols for granting cash benefits, policymakers were\nbetter able to regulate the gatekeepers and enforce the strategy of promoting participation in\nwork before offering cash benefits. Although it is too early to judge the effectiveness, the idea is\nthat this standardization will temper the link between regional economic conditions and disability\nrecipiency that had historically been present.\nIn addition to standardizing the screening process, the merger of the sickness and\ndisability programs forced disability gatekeepers to become actively involved early in the\nprocess. By getting vocational and rehabilitation experts involved early, at the sickness benefit\nstage, policymakers intended to stem the flow of new applicants to the long-term disability\nprogram. To aid in this process, sickness benefits were capped at one year, and beneficiaries\nwere evaluated for work ability at 180 days of absence. Only those who could show that they\nhad no capacity to perform any job were allowed to remain on the program for the full year. In\naddition, employers were required to work with disability administrators to create a rehabilitation\nplan. And gatekeepers were given the power to demand that employers provide certification\n23\n\nabout the types of accommodations they made for the worker. These reforms resulted in a\ndecline in the use of sickness benefits and a subsequent decline in the flow of new beneficiaries\nonto the long-term disability system.\nIn 2008 the Swedish government undertook an additional series of reforms to its sickness\nand long-term disability programs (these reforms are detailed in Hartman 2011 and OECD\n2009). These reforms were meant to further curb growth in the rolls and more actively return\nnewly impaired workers to back to the labor market. The 2008 reforms went beyond engaging\ngatekeepers and employers and focuses on individuals with disabilities. New rules aimed at\nstrengthening the incentives for individuals with disabilities to work and improving their\nopportunities to do so. The principal reform was the establishment of a new timeline for the\nprovision of rehabilitation services under the sickness absence program with checkpoints closely\naligned with assessment of work capacity and a reduction of the cash value of sickness benefits\nfor those who did not return to work. In addition to adding more checkpoints, the reforms also\nfront-loaded the evaluations so that they were being done at 3-, 6-, and 12-month increments.\nThe earlier checkpoints provided rehabilitation, counseling and assessment much closer to the\nonset of an impairment, when return to work was more likely.\nThe reforms significantly increased the return to work of new sickness program entrants\nand reduced their time on the program. In contrast, few of those already on the sickness program\nwhen the new reforms were initiated ever returned to work. When their sickness benefits ended\nthey simply moved onto other social assistance programs. These findings provide empirical\nevidence that early intervention matters. Waiting even one year following the onset of\nimpairment significantly reduces the chance that rehabilitation will result in a return to work.\n24\n\nImportantly, these reforms resulted in further reductions in disability recipiency rates in Sweden\n(Figure 3, Panel D).\nAlthough the disability reforms put in place by the Swedish government late in the 2000s\neffectively reduced disability recipiency rates in the nation, the reduction came mostly from\nreductions in new beneficiaries rather than returning existing beneficiaries to work. In recent\nreforms, policymakers have specifically focused on reducing disability caseloads. For example,\nin January 2013 the government launched an experiment that allows a large group of existing\nbeneficiaries to return to work without fear of ever losing their right to return to benefits. So far\nthe program has had little impact on the work effort of existing beneficiaries eligible for the\nprogram. Although early in the experiment the limited impact suggests that returning\nbeneficiaries to the labor market after a long absence is difficult.\n3.4 Great Britain\nGreat Britain has substantially reconfigured the way it provides social insurance and\nsocial welfare cash transfers over the last four decades. In 1971 it provided first tier universal\nneeds-based cash transfers via its Supplementary Benefit program. It provided somewhat higher\nsecond tier cash transfers via its Unemployment Benefit program for those expected to work.\nGreat Britain’s major social insurance program for working age people with disabilities between\n1971 and 1995 was its Invalidity Benefit (IVB). All those of working age who were deemed\nunable to work in their usual occupation on grounds of ill health or disability (determined largely\nby the claimant’s family doctor) and who had a record of sufficient social insurance\ncontributions (paid during employment) were eligible, initially for Sickness Benefit (the first 28\nweeks) and subsequently for IVB.\n25\n\nBoth Sickness Benefit and IVB-proper recipients were counted in the IVB register.\nIndividuals with an insufficient record of social insurance payments were eligible for “credits\nonly” payments (the IVB system would pay their social insurance contributions) generally\nalongside means-tested Supplementary Benefit payments. This group was also counted in the\nIVB register.\nIVB paid a slightly higher third tier flat rate to beneficiaries, which was more generous\nthan unemployment benefits for longer-duration claimants. Some (generally older recipients\nwith a sufficiently long work history) also received a small earnings-related premium known as\nthe Additional Pension. Even for those receiving this Additional Pension their replacement rates\nwere still considerably less generous than those in the Swedish and Dutch disability systems.\nThis regime was in place throughout the period of slow but steady growth in disability recipiency\nrates over the 1970s and early 1980s (see Figure 3, Panel B).\nThe 1980s brought a number of major changes that affected IVB recipiency rates in\nopposite directions. One change in particular that held back growth during the early-mid-1980s\nwas the introduction of Statutory Sick Pay in 1983, which–like the Netherlands–made employers\nresponsible for paying sickness benefits, in this case for the first 8 weeks of a claim. This was\nextended to 28 weeks in 1986. These beneficiaries were not counted by the IVB register, so\neven if this reform did not impact behavior – which seems unlikely given the change to employer\nincentives – it did remove many short-duration claims from the roll (see Anyadike-Danes and\nMcVicar, 2008).\nLabor market factors, including recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s and rapid\nstructural change away from mining and heavy industry throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s,\nacted in the opposite direction. Indeed the rapid growth in the disability recipiency rates during\n26\n\nthe latter half of the 1980s and the first half the 1990s has been widely interpreted as a form of\nhidden unemployment (Figure 3, Panel B). These were applicants with health-related\nimpairments who had lost their jobs and resided in local labor markets characterized by low\nlabor demand, who either moved directly onto IVB or switched to IVB following an\nunsuccessful period of job search on (less generous) unemployment benefits (see Beatty et al.,\n2000). Further, echoing the trend in the US, a growing proportion of IVB claims over this period\nwere related to hard-to-measure mental illness or muscular-skeletal conditions, despite no\nexplicit change in the medical screening regime for IVB over this period (McVicar, 2008).\nBoth financial and “hassle-avoidance” incentives to shift to IVB from unemployment\nbenefits were intensified with the introduction of Restart in 1987-1988, which imposed\ncompulsory work-focused interviews for long-term unemployment benefits claimants, reduced\nthe generosity of unemployment benefit payments, and introduced a requirement to show\nevidence of job search activity at fortnightly signing interviews. Huddleston (2000) suggests\n“there is clear evidence of a ‘structural break’ around 1987” in moves from unemployment to\nIVB (for which no such reforms had been introduced), coinciding with the in-step increase in\ndisability recipiency rates.\nAnother factor likely contributing to growth in the IVB rolls occurred in 1988 when the\nIncome Support program replaced Supplementary Benefits as the primary means-tested social\nassistance payment for those out of work with insufficient work history to qualify for IVB proper\nor other insurance-based payments. . Although there were various elements to this reform, the\nkey change for our purposes was that those claiming Income Support on grounds of disability,\nand thus counted in the disability roll, could now receive a higher level of payment (the\nDisability Premium) than those claiming Income Support on other grounds.\n27\n\nBecause yearly increases in IVB fixed rate (since the 1980s), unemployment, and social\nassistance payment benefits are tied to inflation they have generally declined relative to real\nwages, hence lowering their real replacement rate even at the bottom of the wage distribution.\nBut for those IVB beneficiaries who were also eligible the Additional Pension this was less the\ncase since their value was tied to real wages. This was especially the case in the recessionary\nyears of the early 1990s when rises in Additional Pension benefits temporarily made IVB more\nthan twice as generous as unemployment benefits for many older recipients (Huddleston, 2000).\nThis period of rapid growth in disability recipiency rates came to an abrupt end in 1995,\nwith a set of major reforms that ended the IVB program and replaced it with the Incapacity\nBenefit (IB) program for all new beneficiaries. Like other European countries, this reform\nattempted to slow inflows into the disability benefit system–which had been particularly high\nduring the years of rapid growth leading up to 1995 (Anyadike-Danes and McVicar, 2008)–\nrather than reduce the existing stock of beneficiaries. Means-tested beneficiaries of the Income\nSupport program with disabilities continued to receive a Disability Premium and be counted as\npart of the IB program. But IB was both less generous than IVB (the earnings-related Additional\nPension was scrapped for new claimants and payments were made taxable) and most importantly\nthe medical eligibility system was tightened. Medical screening was now carried out by\ngovernment doctors, working for the relevant agency, rather than family doctors. This type of\nstandardization is similar to that adopted by Sweden in 2006 (although workers’ eligibility for up\nto 28 weeks of Statutory Sick Pay was still determined by family doctors).\n28\n\nThe bar was also set higher, moving to an assessment of the claimant’s capacity to carry\nout any work rather than work in their usual occupation.16 In addition, IB’s status as a social\ninsurance payment was blurred in 1999 with the introduction of limited means-testing for new\nclaimants with significant (private) pension income, even those who had made sufficient social\ninsurance payments to be otherwise fully covered for IB benefits. There were also further\nreforms tightening the conditions for unemployment benefit receipt and reducing its generosity\nover this period, most notably the replacement of the old regime of unemployment benefits with\nJobseekers’ Allowance in 1996. This tightening of second tier unemployment benefits might in\npart explain why disability recipiency rolls began to rise again in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nDisability recipiency rates only began to fall again in the mid-2000s coincident with a\nnew set of work-first reforms called Pathways to Work, aimed at slowing the inflow of disability\nbeneficiaries and boosting outflows for those having recently joined the roll. This program was\npiloted in 2003 and rolled-out nationally beginning in 2005. It made movement onto the IB\nprogram (including receipt of social assistance on disability grounds) conditional on attendance\nat work-focused interviews, with the aim of steering at least some recipients into employment\nsupport services and ultimately back into the labor market. It also introduced a ‘back to work’\nbonus payment and provided additional in-work condition-management health support for those\nreturning to employment from IB. Finally, medical assessments (now relabeled Personal\nCapability Assessments) were brought forward, taking place 3 months into the IB claim rather\nthan 6 months into the claim. Early evaluation evidence from the pilots suggested that Pathways\n16 Although what was assessed in practice was the claimant’s capacity to carry out a series of\nroutine tasks (Beatty and Fothergill, 2005).\n29\n\nto Work made a significant contribution to falling (local) disability rolls at the time, although the\nextent to which this was reflected at the national level has subsequently been questioned.17\nDisability recipiency rates have continued to decline since then, even in the midst of the\ndeep and long-lasting slump in labor demand associated with the Global Financial Crisis. In part\nthis is likely to reflect the inflow-constraining effects of the earlier reforms to disability benefits\ndescribed above. But there have also been further reforms to disability benefits over the last five\nyears, which are likely to have further restrained growth in the disability roll despite the difficult\nmacroeconomic conditions.\nIn 2008 the new Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) program replaced IB as well\nas IS on grounds of disability for new applicants. This new program of insurance-based benefit\nfor those with sufficient work history and means-tested social assistance benefit for those\nwithout sufficient work history included a new tougher Work Capability Assessment, with fewer\nexemptions, in place of the existing system of Personal Capability Assessments (see Sissons,\n2009). The requirement to attend work-focused interviews introduced under Pathways to Work\nhas been extended into a requirement to engage in work-related activity for all but the most\nseverely disabled, linked explicitly to payments, with around one quarter of the existing benefit\npayment made conditional upon compliance. There is also no longer a higher rate of payment\nfor longer-duration claims. Sissons (2009) interprets the lack of growth in disability recipiency\nrates over the period 2008-2009 as evidence that they have ceased to play a role as a major\ndestination for the hidden unemployed.\nIn a break with the tradition of reforms largely targeted on inflows (or at least recent\njoiners) to disability rolls, and echoing similar efforts at activation of existing recipients in\n17 For further details see Adam et al. (2010) and National Audit Office (2010).\n30\n\nSweden, between 2009 and 2013 existing IB recipients have also been reassessed under the new\nESA eligibility criteria. Many have been judged ineligible as a result of medical re-screening\nunder the stricter Work Capability Assessment, although some have since successfully appealed\nthese decisions and others, as was the case in Sweden, have moved onto unemployment benefits\nrather than into employment. It remains to be seen whether the additional activation measures\nfor existing recipients will have any more impact than was the case in Sweden.\n3.5 Australia\nUnlike the other disability programs discussed above whose benefits are at least partly\nconditional on past contributions, Australia’s disability income support program—the Disability\nSupport Pension (DSP)—does not provide benefits based on workers past earnings or even\nrequire them to have “paid for coverage”. Instead it is most similar to a means-tested guaranteed\nminimum income program whose benefits are greater than those provided by other Australian\nwelfare or unemployment benefit programs. Hence, DSP is closer in concept to a disability-\nbased welfare program than a traditional social insurance program. However its benefit\nguarantee is substantially higher relative to average wage earnings in Australia than is the U.S.\nSSI benefit guarantee relative to average wage earnings in the U.S. In that sense its replacement\nof lost earnings is closer to what DI pays in the U.S. In both Australia and the U.S. disability\nprogram benefits are substantially less generous than those of the Netherlands and Sweden.\nNonetheless the DSP program is susceptible to the same risks to growth discussed in the\ncontext of our other countries, since it pays benefits higher than those from other programs and\neligibility is based on the malleable concept of disability. While there have been some changes\nin the DSP income disregard, tax rates, and in its nominal benefit guarantee, over the entire\n31\n\nperiod from 1970 to 2011, the break-even income threshold where DSP benefits go to zero has\nonly increased slightly faster than average wage earnings. Although this represents an overall\n“loosening” of the income eligibility criteria for DSP, it is not large enough to explain the\nvariations in disability recipiency rates pictured in Figure 3, Panel A.\nCai and Gregory (2004) show that there was little or no trend increase in the level of the\nDSP benefit guarantee payment relative to average weekly earnings between 1970 and 1999—it\nrose slightly in the early 1970s and has since been a relatively constant fraction of average\nweekly earnings—suggesting that increases in the replacement rate are not an important\nexplanation for DSP growth over the period up to 1999. Moreover, over the first decade of the\n2000s the income threshold actually increased more slowly than average earnings, corresponding\nto a “tightening” of eligibility criteria for DSP and coinciding with a flattening out of the\ncumulative unadjusted DSP recipiency rates over the period and a slight decline in the\ncumulative adjusted DSP recipiency rates between 2002 and 2007 (McVicar and Wilkins 2013).\nBut, DSP has become more generous relative to earnings at the lower end of the earnings\ndistribution, at least over the period from 1993 to 2011, and this may be a more relevant\ncomparison for low-skilled workers with disabilities. For example, over this period, adult full-\ntime weekly earnings at the 10th percentile increased by a factor of just under 2, whereas the\nmaximum DSP payment has increased by a factor of approximately 2.4 (ABS 1994; 2013).\nSimilarly, the level of DSP payments has increased substantially relative to the level of the\nAustralian minimum wage over the period from 2000 to 2011, and particularly from 2008\nonwards. The DSP has also become more generous relative to more general income-support\npayments, most notably unemployment benefit (known as ‘Newstart Allowance’ (NSA) since\n1996), since the mid-1990s.\n32\n\nNonetheless it is likely that the major changes in DSP recipiency rates shown in Figure 3,\nPanel A , are driven by changes in disability eligibility criteria rather than the relative generosity\nof benefits. This view is supported by work by Cai and Gregory (2004) who suggest that the\nsmall drop in DSP recipiency rate between 1980 and 1982 was the result of a tightening of\neligibility rules by the administrative authority, which began placing greater emphasis on\nmedical factors and less weight on socio-economic factors, but that this change in approach was\nlargely reversed in 1983, when the Labor Government came to power.\nThe most important run up in the adjusted DSP recipiency rate occurred in the 1990s\n(Figure 3, Panel A). Australia experienced its last official and most serious recession in the early\n1990s. In 1991, in the midst of this recession, there was a major change in the DSP eligibility\ncriteria. To be eligible for DSP a worker had to be incapable of working more than at 15 per\ncent capacity. This was increased from 15 per cent (an 85 per cent work impairment standard) to\n‘no more than 30 hours per week’—effectively a 25 per cent impairment standard if a 40-hour\nwork week is considered normal. This effectively changed DSP from a long-term total disability\nprogram to a long-term partial disability program with no reduction in benefits. Hence it\nrequired DSP gatekeepers to decide if an unemployed worker with a partial (as low as 25 per\ncent) disability was unemployed because of his or her disability or because of economic\nconditions in the midst of a period of slow economic growth and high unemployment rates.\nIt is not surprising that DSP rates increased substantially over this period. While DSP\nbenefits were not significantly greater than first tier social minimum benefits, DSP then provided\na somewhat higher and more permanent income floor with no work requirement.18 Because, as\nin the U.S., few entrants to DSP leave the program to return to work, such increases in the inflow\n18There is no tier two unemployment insurance benefit program in Australia. Rather, unemployed workers are\ncovered by a tier one universal minimum benefit, now called the Newstart Allowance. Benefit levels, like in SSI,\nare need-based and do not require past work experience. However, recipients are expected to return to work.\n33\n\nof beneficiaries during recessions led to increases in disability recipiency rates that lasted over\nmany additional years.\nAs the Australian economy recovered and then expanded, growth in DSP recipiency rates\nslowed (Figure 3, Panel A). Although unemployment has ebbed and flowed in Australia since\nthen, the deterioration in employment conditions during the two subsequent worldwide\nrecessions, especially during the Global Financial Crisis, has been less severe in Australia than in\nthe U.S and other OECD countries. Nonetheless DSP recipiency rate growth increased during\nboth worldwide recessions. And since 2008, DSP recipiency rates have increased each year\ndespite a major DSP eligibility change in July 2006 that lowered the work capacity level from no\nmore than 30 hours to no more than 15 hours per week—effectively an increase from a 25 to a\n62.5 per cent in the impairment standard.\nMcVicar and Wilkins (2013) provide a reason for this recent growth. Since 1996 DSP\nbenefit levels—whose growth is indexed to average wage earnings—have grown, both with\nrespect to the minimum wage and with respect to the first tier universal social minimum income\nguarantee program that is tied to an inflation index. Hence DSP is not only replacing a greater\npercentage of low skilled workers’ wage earnings but is an increasingly attractive alternative to\nAustralia’s Newstart Allowance social minimum benefit guarantee. This pattern is similar to the\none documented by Autor and Duggan (2003) and Autor (2011) for the U.S.\nCai and Gregory (2004) and McVicar and Wilkins (2013) also argue that reforms to non-\nDSP welfare payments over the 1990s and 2000s had unintended consequences for DSP receipt.\nCertain types of payments, such as for temporary sickness, were discontinued in the 1990s and–\nmore importantly–over the 1990s and 2000s welfare benefits for the unemployed and for lone\nparents became increasingly conditional on verifiable job search and participation in active labor\n34\n\nmarket programs, reducing the relative attractiveness of these benefits. Consistent with these\nchanges, and also with the increased relative generosity of DSP, McVicar and Wilkins (2013)\nshow that over the period from 1993 to 2011, receipt of non-DSP welfare benefits by people with\ndisability declined appreciably, but that this was largely offset by the increase in DSP receipt.\nThus, welfare reforms that made the benefits for unemployment and lone parents less generous\nwere to some extent thwarted by the shift of significant numbers of beneficiaries from these non-\nDSP welfare programs to the DSP.\nThe increased incentives for unemployed low skilled applicants to apply for disability\nbenefits puts additional pressure on DSP gatekeepers to only admit those who are unemployed\nbecause their impairment reaches the DSP standard. But because the relationship between\nimpairment and disability is mutable this is hard to do. Thus, in economic downturns, the\nincreased pool of potentially eligible unemployed workers is likely to result in program growth\nand may have done so despite the increase in eligibility standards in 2006. This suggests that\nwhile the tightening of program eligibility rules from a 25 to a 62.5 per cent impairment standard\nmay have had some role in mitigating the rise in the relative generosity of DSP program benefits,\nit is more likely that it is the strong Australian economy that did not go into recession, rather than\na fundamental change in its disability system, that is responsible for the plateauing of DSP\nrecipiency rates over the 2000s reported in Figure 3, Panel A and Table 1. If the economy rather\nthan reforms are responsible, Australia likely remains vulnerable to increases in disability\nrecipiency in the future (for a fuller discussion of this issue, see Burkhauser and Daly 2013).\n35\n\n4. Lessons from Reforms in other Countries\nIn the remainder of this paper we consider how the reform experiences in Australia, Great\nBritain, the Netherlands, and Sweden can inform U.S. policymakers tasked with ensuring DI’s\nfiscal sustainability.\nFirst and foremost to effectively design policies to curb disability recipiency rate growth,\npolicymakers have to acknowledge why it is growing. A large body of research has shown that\nin advanced industrialized economies with large and complicated safety nets, both exogenous\nfactors—population demographics, population health, or economy-wide shocks--and endogenous\nfactors—changes in eligibility rules, benefit replacement rates, or access to other social\nprograms--can influence disability recipiency rate growth. The disability reforms undertaken in\nthe Netherlands, Sweden and Great Britain were possible once these countries acknowledged\nthat changes in behavior rather than changes in health were driving program growth. By\nrecognizing that their policy designs influence behavior and program outcomes, policymakers\nopened the door to more fundamental disability policy changes.\nImportantly, this acknowledgement also allowed policymakers to rethink their national\ndisability scheme’s goals and bring them more in line with modern notions of disability. This\nmeant discarding terminology and criteria of incapacity and replacing them with a focus on\nability. More than just semantic window dressing the new terminology changed people with\nimpairments expectations from dependence on disability benefits based on not working to work.\nOf course, for some individuals work was not possible, but this increasingly became the\nexception rather than the norm.\nAs the previous section demonstrated, each nation implemented reforms slightly\ndifferently, but all shared the goal of curbing unsustainable program growth by changing the\n36\n\nculture and social expectations of and for people with disabilities and better aligning the\nincentives embedded in program design with these expectations. The data show the reforms\nhave generally been successful. Although each of the nations recognize their reforms have not\nbeen completely successful, from the U.S. perspective these reforms demonstrate that policies\nmatter and provide a relevant starting point for discussions about reforming the U.S. system.\nBelow we provide the four lessons most relevant to U.S. policymakers.\nLesson 1. Disability does not Mean Incapacity\nAlthough disability is frequently thought of as an immutable, health-based condition that\nlimits functionality and prevents the performance of socially expected tasks (such as attending\nschool or working), modern notions of the productive capacity of all people is at odds with this\ncharacterization. A more accurate concept of disability, and one embodied in the U.S. Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA) and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International\nClassification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), considers disability to be the product\nof an interactive process between an individual’s health conditions and the social and physical\nenvironment. In this perspective, disability is neither immutable nor determined solely by health.\nEach of the European countries we reviewed embrace this idea. Ensuring that their\ncitizens with disabilities have the opportunity to work in the paid labor market is now a\ngovernment priority.19 . Key among the findings based on their successful efforts to reduce their\ndisability recipiency rates is that a substantial share of people who were moving onto the long-\nterm cash transfer disability programs were, with reasonable levels of support, able to find or\nmaintain employment. Of course, a subset of workers with disabilities have impairments so\nsevere that work is not possible, but this has proven to be a smaller portion than previously\n19See OECD 2003 and Bernd, Prinz, and Queisser 2004 for a discussion of this transformation in\ndisability policy goals.\n37\n\naccepted onto these programs. And those now coming onto the rolls are, by demonstration rather\nthan assumption, unable to integrate effectively into the labor market even with appropriate\nincentives and support.20 This design offers an important advantage over programs based on\ncategorical determinations of disability that can expand in unintended ways when individuals are\nincentivized to change their behavior (i.e., attempt or not attempt to work) to become eligible.\nThe lesson for U.S. disability policy is that the population with disabilities is\nheterogeneous and many of its members can work. This view is at odds with the current U.S.\nsystem in which the Social Security Administration (SSA) requires applicants to demonstrate an\ninability to perform substantial gainful activity before receiving access to benefits or any other\ntype of support, including work support. Embracing the ideas of many European countries about\nthe work capacity of individuals with disabilities calls for restructuring the U.S. system to bring\nforward the focus on employment and make long-term cash benefits a last-resort option once\nrehabilitation and accommodation had failed.\nLesson 2. Incentives Affect Behavior\nOnce it is recognized that the social and cultural environment faced by individuals with\nimpairments partly determines the extent to which their impairment limits them, it is easy to see\nthat the incentives embedded in policy design can affect outcomes. The important lesson from\nthe reforms in our sample of countries is that it is important to correctly incentivize all actors in\nthe process to attain the outcomes desired.\nIn the Netherlands, this meant making employers bear more of the direct costs of the\nprogram and making employees comply with rehabilitation and retraining in order to maintain\n20Importantly, in Great Britain the assumption is that with appropriate support the majority of\nindividuals with disabilities can perform some type and amount of work.\n38\n\nbenefits. In Sweden this meant standardizing the disability screening process and holding\ndisability gatekeepers accountable for engaging applicants in work rehabilitation plans. Sweden\nalso mandated that employers document how they had attempted to accommodate impaired\nworkers. Finally, reforms focused on making workers comply with the work-first approach by\nreducing or eliminating benefits to those workers who did not comply with the rehabilitation and\naccommodation plans. Great Britain has similarly made employers responsible for paying\nsickness benefits for the first 28 weeks of a claim, has standardized the disability screening\nprocess, and has made it increasingly difficult to remain passively on long-term disability\nbenefits without engaging in work-related activity. Reforms have also sought to address\nfinancial incentives related to imbalances in replacement rates between disability benefits and\nother welfare benefits. In Australia, most recently (since 2011) it has meant implementation of a\nnew disability benefit assessment procedure, under which eligibility for benefits typically\nrequires evidence that claimants were unable to obtain employment through vocational\nrehabilitation or other employment services over a period of up to two years, during which time\nclaimants receive NSA and associated support services.\nThe lesson for U.S. policymakers is that program incentives affect how people with\ndisabilities and their employers react to, and fare after, the onset of a health impairment. In the\nU.S., DI is funded from a payroll tax and the federal government is responsible for a great share\nof the costs associated with providing long-term disability benefits to working-age people with\ndisabilities. Because employers bear no direct responsibility for funding benefits paid to former\nemployees, employers have no direct financial incentive to accommodate and rehabilitate\nemployees who become impaired. Incentivizing employers to make greater investments in\naccommodation and rehabilitation by creating a scheme that makes employers internalize some\n39\n\nor all of the costs of moving employees onto long-term disability could curb DI growth by more\neffectively aligning incentives. Autor and Duggan 2010 and Burkhauser and Daly 2011 propose\ntwo different models for doing this in the U.S.\nAs the reforms in these countries show, incentives cannot be changed solely for\nemployers. Incentives for people with disabilities and program gatekeepers also need to be\naligned with program goals to realize sizeable and lasting reductions in disability recipiency\nrates.\nLesson 3. Early Intervention Reduces Flows—Stocks Are Harder\nA recurring theme in the experiences of Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden is\nthat reforms focused on early intervention can be very successful at reducing the flow of new\nbeneficiaries onto the program and/or boosting the flow of new beneficiaries off the program.\nFor example, early intervention that coordinated employer actions with the employees’ particular\nhealth shock were critical to keeping impaired workers in the labor force in the Netherlands.\nSuch intervention significantly increased the return to work of impaired workers and reduced\ntime on the sickness or disability program. Evidence from Sweden shows that waiting even one\nyear following the onset of impairment significantly reduces the chance that rehabilitation will\nresult in a return to work. Evidence from Great Britain suggests that bringing medical screening\nforward can help to control program growth.\nIn contrast, none of these countries, nor Australia, has been successful to date at moving\nexisting longer-term beneficiaries back into the labor market, although the process of re-\nscreening and seeking to activate existing longer-term beneficiaries in Great Britain has only\nrecently begun. Across all countries, once enrolled on disability benefits for more than a few\nmonths, only a small fraction of recipients return to work. Even when strict time limits are put in\n40\n\nplace, as in the case of Sweden, movement off the disability system for longer-duration\nbeneficiaries is difficult. Even when it is done, most frequently it results in a shift to another\npublic program rather than into employment.\nThese experiences have several implications for U.S. policy discussions. First, the fact\nthat most current DI recipients do not work is not evidence that they would have been unable to\nwork if given alternative policy treatments (e.g., timely accommodation and rehabilitation).\nIndeed, the marked difference in outcomes between those given early versus later employment-\noriented services in the Netherlands and Sweden shows that in a system oriented towards long-\nterm cash benefits rather than work, many of those with residual work capacity will never return\nto work.\nThe experiences in these countries also call into question the viability of ongoing\nattempts to gain control of the U.S. DI rolls by funding additional continuing disability reviews\nor enhancing post-entry rehabilitation or job training programs like Ticket-to-Work. While such\nprograms have merits, the experiences in Sweden tell us that these efforts will fall short of\nbringing growth in the rolls down to sustainable levels.\nFinally, the reforms and outcomes in these nations show the difficulties of focusing\npolicy reforms on current beneficiaries—a practice SSA is forced to follow by rules requiring\nSSA-collected funds to be focused on current program recipients. This suggests that eliminating\nthis rule and allowing SSA to focus its energies on workers with health-based work limitations\nwho are trying to decide whether to stay on the job or apply for benefits will likely do more to\ncurb DI growth.\n41\n\nLesson 4. Hurdles to Reform in the U.S. are Surmountable\nDespite this growing body of evidence that structural reforms to long-term cash disability\nprograms can curb program growth and potentially improve outcomes for those with health-\nbased impairments, the political coalition necessary to achieve fundamental disability policy\nreform has been slow to evolve in the U.S. So what are the hurdles? There are several including\na number of concerns raised by supporters of the current system. (See Reno and Ekman 2012 for\na summary of these arguments.)\nOne issue raised in response to proposals for fundamental DI reform is that these\nbenefits, while not especially generous, are essential to keeping millions of disabled-worker\nbeneficiaries out of poverty. The evidence from Europe shows that this is a very static view\nwhich assumes that in the absence of benefits, individuals with disabilities would remain out of\nthe labor market, dependent on other forms of public or private assistance for support. European\ndisability reforms over the last decade provide plausible evidence that increased employment\nwill occur when pro-work policies replace policies that have had the opposite effect. Their\nreform experience shows that a significant number of people with disabilities, who would\notherwise have moved onto long-term cash benefits, were able, with reasonable levels of support,\nto return to work. While it is always the case that tightening the criteria for disability benefits\nruns the risk of denying disability benefits to those who will not be able to find work, on balance\nthe European experience suggests that reasonable pro-work policies will both substantially\nreduce disability recipiency rates and increase the employment of those who would otherwise\nhave been on the long-term disability rolls.\nNonetheless it is the case that fundamental DI reform could worsen the already\nprecarious economic position of some people with disabilities. But this should be put the context\n42\n\nof what has been happening to the overall well-being of working age people with disabilities in\nthe U.S. Over the past 25 years the household incomes of Americans with disabilities have\nstagnated relative to other working-age people. This is associated, in part, with the near\ncontinuous decline in their employment.\nOur reading of the European evidence is that when programs are designed to award cash\ntransfers in lieu of work, employment falls. In contrast, when programs are designed to\nencourage work and award transfers only when work clearly is not possible, employment rises.\nSince work generally leads to increased income, especially when public policies make work pay,\nefforts to promote work among those with disabilities can produce positive outcomes.\nThe most important lesson though, is that by not working, long-term disability\nbeneficiaries will over time slip further and further behind the rest of the working-age\npopulation, whose employment allows them to benefit from increased economic growth.\nA final concern is that programs like DI are especially important in economic downturns\nwhere individuals with limited work capacity are not only more likely to be laid off but less\nlikely to find a new job. Past experience of European countries, especially The Netherlands,\nwhich intentionally or unintentionally used this logic to turn their long-term disability programs\ninto more general unemployment programs, suggests that it can be a very expensive and\nultimately ineffective policy decision. Indeed, many European nations continue to struggle to\nregain control over their disability systems which for many decades have been used as long-term\nunemployment insurance programs. A key message from the European experience is that\nexplicitly divorcing long-term “unemployability” insurance from disability insurance is critical\nto effectively targeting resources towards both populations.\n43\n\nTogether the experiences of other nations suggest that it is possible to balance the\ncompeting goals of providing social insurance against adverse health shocks during working-age\nand maximizing the work effort of all working-age adults with and without disabilities. Past\ndisability policies in both the United States and other OECD countries have focused more on the\nformer than the latter, resulting in rapid growth in disability transfer populations that outpaced\ngrowth in the economy. Efforts to shift to more pro-work policies over the last decade in Europe\nsuggest that fundamental disability reforms, if done well, can lower projected long-term costs for\ntaxpayers, make the job of disability administrators less difficult, and importantly, improve the\nshort- and long-run opportunities of people with disabilities.\n44\n\nAppendix A: Data Description and Sources\nData Description\nSummary of DI Data Availaibility Across Countries\nAustralia Great Britian Netherlands Sweden United States\nInitial Year 1970 1971 1970 1970 1970\nFinal Year 2011 2012 2009 2009 2011\nMissing Years (-) 1970 (-) 1984 1981\nAge Range of Working Population 16-64 16-64 15-65 16-64 16-64\nData Sources\nAustralia\nHistorical population estimates are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics\nwww.abs.gov.au\nDSP caseload data is from Australian Government Department of Social Services\nStatistical Papers 1-10 http://www.humanservices.gov.au/\nGreat Britain\nHistorical population estimates are mid-year population estimates from the Office for\nNational Statistics http://www.ons.gov.GB\nDisability benefit caseload data (combining IVB, IB and ESA caseloads) are from Social\nSecurity Statistics, and from 1999 onwards, from the Department of Work and Pensions,\nhttp://dwp.gov.uk.\nNetherlands\nHistorical population data are from Statistics Netherlands. http://www.cbs.nl/en-\nGB/menu/home/default.htm\nDisability insurance caseloads data are from the Institute of Employee Benefit Schemes,\ncourtesy of Jan Maarten van Sonsbeek.\nSweden\nHistorical population estimates are from Statistics Sweden. http://scb.se\nDisability Insurance prevalence data are from the Social Insurance Agency yearbooks,\ncourtesy of Lisa Laun and Marten Palme.\nUnited States\nHistorical population estimates are from the Census Bureau’s Annual Estimates of\nResident Population. http://www.census.gov\nSSDI caseloads and covered workers data are from the Annual Statistical Supplement to\nthe Social Security Bulletin. http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/\n45\n\nAppendix B. Decomposing the Disability Recipiency Rate\nThe disability recipiency rate is equal to the number of disabled worker caseloads as a share of\nthe working age population. The rate in year t, can be expressed as:\n𝑅𝑡\n𝐶𝑖,𝑡\n𝑅𝑡 = �\n𝑖\n𝑃𝑡\nwhere is the number of SSDI caseloads in demographic group i and year t and is the size\nof the working age population in year t.21 We further decompose this ratio as\n𝐶𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑡\n𝐶𝑖,𝑡 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡\n𝑅𝑡 = � ∗ ∗\n𝑖\n𝐸𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑡\nwhere is the number of SSDI eligible workers in demographic group i and year t and is\nthe size of the working age population in demographic group i and year t.\n𝐸𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡\nCounterfactual Disability Recipiency Rates\nWe consider several counterfactual scenarios of the disability recipiency rate. The first and\nsimplest is the scenario in which the normal retirement age is still 65. We do not need to perform\na decomposition for this calculation. The counterfactual 2011 rate in this scenario, denoted\n, would be equal to the number of SSDI caseloads in 2011 for persons under the age of 65\ndivided by the working age population in 2011.\n𝑅 �2011\nNext consider the case in which caseloads only evolve due to the aging of the population. The\ncounterfactual rate in this scenario is\n𝐶𝑖,1980 𝐸𝑖,1980 𝑃𝑖,2011 𝐶𝑖,1980 𝑃𝑖,2011\n𝑅�2011 = � ∗ ∗ = � ∗\n𝑖\n𝐸𝑖,1980 𝑃𝑖,1980 𝑃2011\n𝑖\n𝑃𝑖,1980 𝑃2011\nNow consider the case in which caseloads only evolve due to the increase in women’s labor\nforce attachment. This causes the share of DI eligible women in each age group to increase. For\nthis exercise we let i index age groups and differentiate between genders using the superscript m\nfor males and f for females. Then\n𝑚 𝑚 𝑚 𝑓 𝑓 𝑓\n𝐶𝑖,𝑡 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 𝐶𝑖,𝑡 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡\n𝑅𝑡 = � 𝑚 ∗ 𝑚 ∗ + 𝑓 ∗ 𝑓 ∗\n𝑖\n𝐸𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑡 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑡\n21 We use the following age groups for men and women (14 total demographic groups): 20-29,\n30-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54 55-59, and 60-64. For the Netherlands age categories are\ndecomposed as follows: 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64\n46\n\nand the counterfactual rate is\n𝑚 𝑚 𝑚 𝑓 𝑓 𝑓\n𝐶𝑖,2011 𝐸𝑖,2011 𝑃𝑖,2011 𝐶𝑖,2011 𝐸𝑖,1980 𝑃𝑖,2011\n𝑅�2011 = � 𝑚 ∗ 𝑚 ∗ + 𝑓 ∗ 𝑓 ∗\n𝑖\n𝐸𝑖,2011 𝑃𝑖,2011 𝑃2011 𝐸𝑖,2011 𝑃𝑖,1980 𝑃2011\nIn the special case in which we allow for the increase in women’s labor force attachment to also\ninclude a “catch-up” effect of women’s disability receipt, the above equation becomes\n𝑚 𝑚 𝑚 𝑓 𝑚 𝑓\n𝐶𝑖,2011 𝐸𝑖,2011 𝑃𝑖,2011 𝐶𝑖,2011 𝐸𝑖,1980 𝑃𝑖,2011\n𝑅�2011 = � 𝑚 ∗ 𝑚 ∗ + 𝑓 ∗ 𝑚 ∗\n𝑖\n𝐸𝑖,2011 𝑃𝑖,2011 𝑃2011 𝐸𝑖,2011 𝑃𝑖,1980 𝑃2011\nPercentage Point Contribution to the Increase in DI Receipt\nNow that we have these counterfactual disability recipiency rates it is straightforward to\ncalculate how much of the increase in the total DI recipiency rate since 1980 can be explained by\neach factor. The percentage point contribution of each factor to total growth is\n100∗(𝑅�2011− 𝑅1980)⁄(𝑅2011 − 𝑅1980)\nAdditional Details for Australia\nThrough 1995, women were eligible for the Age Pension beginning at the age of 60. Since then\nthis minimum eligibility age has been increased in six-monthly steps every 2 years. The final\nstep is in January 2014, when women, like men, will only be eligible for the Age Pension from\nbeginning at the age of 65. At each step, there is a clear increase in the number of female DSP\nrecipients aged 60–64 years, from fewer than 1,000 in 1995 to almost 80,000 in 2011. Following\nDaly, Lucking and Schwabish (2013), we can reasonably assume that all additional 60–64 year\nold female DSP recipients beginning in 1996 (that is, 79,000 by 2011) joined the roll because of\nthe increase in the Age Pension age. This has therefore been a major factor in the growth of the\nfemale DSP roll, particularly over the period from 2002 to 2011, where it accounts for almost 70\nper cent of the increase in the female disability recipiency rate.\nAdditional Details for Great Britain\nSimilarly to Australia, women in Great Britain were eligible for the state (age) pension at the age\nof 60 until May 2010. Since then the state pension age has increased by one month every second\nmonth, a process which will be complete when the female pension age reaches 65 years – the\ncurrent male pension age – at the end of the current decade. We make the same assumption for\nGreat Britain as for Australia, i.e. that all additional female disability recipients over the age of\n59 since May 2010 joined the roll because of the increase in the state pension age. In contrast to\nAustralia this has not yet been a major driver of the disability roll in Great Britain, but its\ncontribution is likely to grow as the process continues over the coming years.\n47\n\nseirtnuoC\nssorcA\nycneipiceR\nytilibasiD\ndetsujdA\nni\nhtworG\n.1B\nerugiF\nxidneppA\negatnecreP 01\nsetatS\ndetinU\nnedewS\nsdnalrehteN\nnaitirB\ntaerG\nailartsuA\n8 6 4 2 0\n0102\n6002\n2002\n8991\n4991\n0991\n6891\n2891\n8791\n4791\n0791\nfo\nuaeruB\nnailartsuA\n,secivreS\nlaicoS\nfo\ntnemtrapeD\ntnemnrevoG\nnailartsuA\n,uaeruB\nsusneC\nSU\n,noitartsinimdA\nytiruceS\nlaicoS:ecruoS\nycnegA\necnarusnI\nlaicoS\nhsidewS\ndna\nnedewS\nscitisitatS\n,scitsitatS\nlanoitaN\nrof\neciffO\n,snoisneP\ndna\nkroW\nfo\ntnemtrapeD\n,scisitatS\nsemehcS\ntifeneB\neeyolpmE\nfo\netutitsnI\neht\ndna\n,sdnalrehteN\nscitsitatS\n,skoobraey\n\nAppendix Table B1.

    "text": "Policy Nimbleness Through Forward Guidance\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nShadow Open Market Committee Conference\nChapman University\nOrange, CA\nJune 24, 2022\n1:00 PM PDT\nA few weeks ago, I met a young man with a warehouse job. He was worried. He shared that he\nhad just called in sick to his employer. When I asked him if it was COVID, he told me no. He just\ncouldn’t afford the gas that day and still manage to pay his rent.\nNow it would be of little consolation to him to learn that much of the inflation we see today is\ndriven by supply chain bottlenecks or the ongoing war in Ukraine. Nor would he be relieved to\nlearn that excess demand, supported by fiscal and monetary policy aid and a robust recovery,\nwere to blame. All he and so many others want to know is, when will this end?\nSo, let me start by saying here what I said to him: Bringing inflation down is the Federal\nReserve’s number one priority right now. And we have the tools and the will to do it.\nBut we actually want to do more than that. We want to bring inflation down without crippling\ngrowth and stalling the labor market.\nAfterall that is the dual mandate. Our job is to ensure that Americans everywhere have\nopportunities to earn a living and the confidence that the living they earn will hold its value.\nSo today, I will talk about how we can achieve that. But first, let me remind you that the views I\nshare are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nEvolving Risks\n1\n\nTo understand the path going forward, we first need to understand how we arrived here. So,\nlet’s start there.\nThe earliest signs of rising inflation pressures came in the spring of 2021. At that time, overall\ninflation was running below the Fed‘s 2 percent target, as it had been for over a decade.\nBut conditions were changing. Fiscal and monetary policy support were charging through the\nsystem, boosting demand for a variety of goods. At the same time, COVID was still ravaging\nsupply chains, disrupting production and distribution, and leaving accumulated backlogs for a\nrange of products.\nThe challenges were apparent. Consumers were robustly purchasing goods, while suppliers\nwere having trouble making and delivering them. And as we would expect, price pressures\nemerged.\nBut since high inflation readings were mainly limited to sectors most directly affected by the\npandemic, and newly developed vaccines promised to knock out—or at least significantly\ntemper—COVID, few people viewed high inflation over a longer period as inevitable.1 Indeed,\nat that time the overwhelming consensus among policymakers and economists more broadly\nwas that upward and downward risks to inflation were balanced.\nFinancial markets generally agreed. In line with most forecasts at the time, markets perceived\nthat the risk of high inflation was elevated. But they did not see this as the only—or even the\nmost likely—scenario.2 In fact, a broad range of indicators pointed to the possibility that\ninflation would settle lower, not higher once the pandemic was behind us.\nRecall that for over a decade preceding the pandemic, central banks across the globe had found\nit difficult to get inflation up to target.3 Structural forces including changing demographics,\nslower productivity growth, more global price competition, and weaker links between wages\nand prices persistently exerted downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.4\nIn other words, at that time the risk landscape on future inflation was decidedly two-sided. We\ncould act preemptively to stave off the potential for broadening price pressures only to find\ninflation once again too low, or we could wait until the path of inflation was clearer and find\nourselves with inflation too high.\n1 Shapiro (2020, 2021). By April 2021, roughly a third of the U.S. population had received at least one dose and\nabout a fifth had been fully vaccinated. https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=USA\n2 In early 2021, markets saw a roughly 33 percent chance that consumer price index inflation would average more\nthan 3 percent over the subsequent 5 years. https://www.minneapolisfed.org/banking/current-and-historical-\nmarket--based-probabilities\n3 Jordà et al. (2019b).\n4 Basu and Fernald (2002), Fernald and Li (2019), Crump et al. (2019), Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017), and\nJordà et al. (2019a).\n2\n\nTo manage these risks we needed to do more than just assess their likelihood. It was also\nimportant to stack the potential outcomes against the tools we had to deal with them.\nUnfortunately, with the proximity of the zero lower bound our tools are not symmetrically\neffective. When inflation is too high, we have ample room to raise the federal funds rate to pull\nit back down. But when inflation falls too low, and the zero lower bound binds, we have to rely\non less robust tools, such as asset purchases.5\nThis meant there could be significant potential costs to overreacting based on emerging—but\nstill limited—evidence of price pressures. Especially when any premature tightening would be\nhard to reverse and its consequences could hamper growth and productivity in the longer run.6\nAll of this tilted my thinking toward a balanced approach, one that weighed the early signs of\nprice pressures against the still-recovering job market and a policy toolkit more readily able to\nfight misses on the inflation upside than on the downside.7 This assessment was supported by\ndata showing that longer-run inflation expectations among households, businesses and market\nparticipants remained well anchored.8\nBut of course, by fall of 2021, the risks of persistently high inflation readings had become a\nreality, and forecasts showed little relief on the horizon. COVID continued to surge across the\nglobe. Vaccine uptake had plateaued. And price pressures were spreading outside those sectors\nmost directly affected by the pandemic.9\nThe Power of Communicating\nThe evolving landscape meant that monetary policy had to pivot. And it had to do so quickly.\nTo some of you, that may sound like a contradiction. Monetary policy is usually associated with\ngradual adjustments that transmit through the economy with long and variable lags. It is not\ntypically associated with agility and speed.10\nBut just as the risks facing the economy have evolved, so has our policy approach, which can\nrespond more nimbly now to incoming data than it could in the past.\nThis evolution stems largely from an evolution in the Fed’s communication. Today, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) is transparent about its reaction function and expected\n5 Cúrdia, Chen, and Ferrero (2012).\n6 Ajello et al. (2021).\n7 As of March 2021, there were 8.1 million fewer workers on payrolls than pre-pandemic. However, the\ndistribution of worker shortfalls varied across sectors and states (Albert, Foerster, and Sarte 2021).\n8 In March 2021, Daly (2021a) noted that inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5-10 years ahead had\nonly recently risen to roughly 2 percent.\n9 Lansing, Oliveira, and Shapiro (2022) and Shapiro (2022).\n10 Friedman (1961) and Rudebusch (1995).\n3\n\noutlook. This enables the committee to signal policy adjustments long before they are actually\nmade. And these signals transmit increasingly rapidly into the behavior of financial markets and\nthe economy.11\nFor example, in the fall of last year, as incoming information confirmed that persistent and\nbroad price pressures were forming, FOMC participants signaled that the future path of policy\nwould likely be tighter. The December FOMC statement and the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) moved sharply relative to previous releases, projecting an earlier date of liftoff\nand a faster pace of rate hikes than previously anticipated. At the same time, we communicated\nthat the balance sheet would adjust accordingly.\nFollowing this forward guidance and prior to any actual movements in the funds rate, yields on\nTreasuries across all durations rose, and rates in other markets followed suit. Mortgage rates,\nfor example, started an ascent that currently puts them at their highest levels in a decade.\nWhile adjustments in financial markets after FOMC communications are not unusual, the speed\nand magnitude of the movements during the past six months have been unprecedented, as the\nfigure shows.\nSource: Goldman Sachs and FRBSF staff calculations.\n11 The Fed did not begin releasing post-FOMC statements until the mid-1990s. A series of measures to increase\ntransparency followed, including the Summary of Economic Projections, the announcement of a 2 percent inflation\ntarget, and an accompanying policy framework that was revised in 2020.\n4\n\nAs financial conditions have tightened, some leading indicators of economic activity have\nsoftened, especially in interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing. And consumers have\nexpressed caution more broadly, recognizing the impact of expected higher rates on their\nfuture borrowing prospects.12\nThe fact that financial conditions and real activity are adjusting to expected monetary policy\ntightening, even when actual rates have not fully risen, means that long and variable lags may\nnot be as long, or variable, as typically assumed. And that supports policy nimbleness, allowing\nmonetary policy to be tighter than the actual level of the Fed Funds rate would suggest.\nBut guidance requires action. And here is how I see that work evolving.\nLast week, the FOMC increased the funds rate by 75 basis points and signaled that further rate\nhikes of a similar magnitude are likely.13 This was the largest single meeting increase since 1994\nand puts policy on an expeditious path to neutral by the end of the year. After that, I see\nadditional tightening beyond neutral as the likely next step.\nHow much additional tightening will be required depends on a number of factors that fall\noutside of the Fed’s direct control, including the speed and magnitude of supply chain recovery,\nthe duration of the war in Ukraine, and the willingness of individuals who have left the labor\nforce to reenter.14\nJust as 2021 required navigating a broad range of possible outcomes, policymaking now is also\nabout managing risks. If supply continues to fall short and inflation remains high, we will need\nto do more. If conditions improve and supply bounces back, we can do less.\nRegardless of which path we take, there will likely be some slowing in the economy. That’s how\nmonetary policy works. We remove accommodation or adjust rates into more restrictive\nterritory, and growth slows and the labor market cools.\n12 For example, consumer perceptions and expectations about access to credit have declined.\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2022/20220613\n13 In its March SEP, the Fed’s median projection for the federal funds rate was 1.9 percent by the end of this year\nand 2.8 percent by the end of 2023 (Board of Governors 2022b). In June, the SEP projected a revised median funds\nrate of 3.4 percent by year-end, and 3.8 percent by the end of 2023 (Board of Governors 2022a).\n14 An estimated 2 million fewer immigrant workers joining the U.S. labor market since 2020 relative to the pre-\npandemic trend (Peri and Zaiour 2022) has added to the headwinds constraining labor supply.\n5\n\nThe question is: how much economic slowing are we likely to see? Here, history gives us some\nuseful reference points.\nOne is the Great Inflation of the 1960s and ’70s and the subsequent Volcker disinflation, which,\nby the mid-1980s, had brought inflation down from its double-digit peak. But it came at\na very high cost, pushing the economy into what was then the most severe recession since the\nGreat Depression.\nBut this is not the only example or precedent of how the economy reacts to policy tightening. In\nthe mid-1990s policymakers faced a rapidly declining unemployment rate and worried that a\n1970s-style high inflation environment was coming. So they raised interest rates by 3\npercentage points in roughly a year. This rapid policy tightening put the brakes on falling\nunemployment, but the overall effects on growth were mostly benign. Most notably, the\neconomy and the labor market maintained a relatively strong expansion through the end of the\ndecade, and inflation remained in check.15\nFor a number of reasons, I expect our economic transition now to look more like the mid-1990s\nthan like the 1970’s Great Inflation and subsequent painful disinflation. That’s because many of\nthe factors that helped fuel the Great Inflation are not as prominent today.\nFor example, part of the surge in inflation during the 1960s and ’70s was because policymakers\noverestimated economic and labor market potential.16 These policy misses were exacerbated\nby widespread wage indexation that contributed to a wage-price spiral. But today’s\npolicymakers use a broader and more robust range of data to assess the economy’s potential\nperformance, and the link between wages and prices is far weaker than it was in the past.17\nThe Federal Reserve is also different than it was back then. We are a far more transparent\ninstitution now. We regularly share our views about the economy, our goals, and our expected\npolicy path. This tells markets and the public more generally what we are thinking and how we\nare likely to react as the economy changes. This consistent communication has helped keep\nlonger run inflation expectations anchored despite persistent months of high inflation readings.\nIt also has allowed us to respond to evolving data more nimbly and influence the behavior of\nfinancial markets and the economy more quickly.\nFinally, conditions in the economy are quite different now than they were in the Great Inflation.\nThere is a sizeable amount of excess demand in both product and labor markets, supported by\nCOVID related fiscal and monetary policy. This translates into large, accumulated back orders\nfor goods and historically high job vacancies in the labor market. Adjusting rates to slow the\neconomy will most likely reduce these backlogs and high job vacancies before digging into\ncurrent production and employment.\n15 See Blinder (2022) for additional discussion of past tightening.\n16 Daly (2022).\n17 Daly (2021b).\n6\n\nIn economics terms, this would mean that we are on the steep portion of a fixed supply curve\nor Beveridge curve.18 And moving along those curves by reducing aggregate demand to return\nnormal conditions would bring inflation down with a more limited effect on overall economic\nactivity.19\nIn its extreme form, this implies that policy adjustments to lower inflation will be cost free.\nWhile I think that scenario is highly unlikely, I do expect the costs of adjustment to be\nmoderate, with some slowing of GDP growth below its longer-run trend and an increase in the\nunemployment rate from the very low levels we see today.\nThis would, to my mind, constitute a relatively smooth transition from a pandemic-wracked,\nhighly accommodative economy to one in which tighter policy supports both full employment\nand price stability.\nThat is the future that I am working toward.\nCreating that future will not be easy. Some have called it a narrow path.\nBut we know the direction we need to head, we understand the risks we face, and we have the\ntools to respond to a range of conditions however they emerge.\nMost importantly, we have the will to act. Not just for this moment, but also for similar events\nin the future. Always recognizing that our decisions affect every American and no one should\nhave to choose between fueling up to get to work and paying rent to keep their home.\nThank you.\n18 The Beveridge curve depicts a systematic relationship between job openings and unemployment, which\nbecomes very steep at low unemployment rates.

    "text": "A Strong Economy – But We Can\nAim Higher\nRemarks by\nM C. D\nARY ALY\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo\nRegional Economic Development for Eastern Idaho (REDI)\nIdaho Falls, Idaho\nNovember 12, 2018\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nIntroduction\nThanks very much for that kind introduction. I’d like to thank Park Price for helping organize this\nevent and for his long service as a San Francisco Fed Director. Park is the definition of a Fed Family\nmember, and I am delighted to deliver my first speech as the president and CEO of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco in the community Park calls home.\nPage 1 of 11\n\nI would also like to recognize our veterans who have chosen to spend part of their day with us; we\nthank you for your service.\nI’ve been coming to Idaho since 1997, when I was just a rookie economist. It was love at first sight,\nthe mix of agriculture and technology, rural and urban, the natural beauty, and all the things I love to\ndo: skiing, biking, and hiking. Indeed, when days get hard my mantra is, I’m packing up and moving\nto Idaho. Apparently I am not the only one. Boise was recently flagged by Forbes magazine as the\nfastest-growing metro area in the country,1 and Eastern Idaho is sure to be right behind.\nMore generally, Idaho’s economy is flourishing, so it’s a perfect backdrop to talk about the broader\nU.S. outlook, which is very favorable. As the president of the San Francisco Fed, my job is to\nrepresent most of the western states—from Idaho and Utah out to Hawaii and Alaska—in the\nformulation of the nation’s monetary policy. The Fed’s goal, simply put, is to keep the expansion on\na solid and sustainable footing. Congress has given us two mandates meant to support this: full\nemployment and stable prices. Most of our job focuses on the short run, not letting the economy get\ntoo hot or too cold, but we also have to consider the economy’s longer-term performance. My\nremarks today will focus on each of these in turn.\nNow, before I dive in, let me say that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nCurrent economic conditions\nI’ll start with the current state of the economy, which is very good. The expansion is over nine years\nold and seems destined to set a new record for the longest period without a recession in U.S. history,\nwhich it should reach in the middle of next year. The labor market is booming. Household and\nbusiness balance sheets are very healthy, and confidence is high. All these factors point to significant\nunderlying economic momentum, which is being boosted by tailwinds including the federal fiscal\n1 Sharf (2018).\nPage 2 of 11\n\nstimulus and global growth that, despite some recent unevenness, has been solid over the past few\nyears.\nEven in this strong economy, though, some people are getting left behind. There are pockets of\neconomic distress, and we need to do all we can to ensure that growth is inclusive and everyone has\nan opportunity to benefit.\nMonetary policy, however, can’t do everything. Our job is to keep the overall economy healthy, thus\nhelping promote sustainable economic growth. By doing this, monetary policy supports economic\nwell-being and creates opportunities for all to advance.\nImplications for monetary policy\nThis principle of sustaining a healthy expansion has guided our recent policy and plans. As you\nprobably know, the Fed’s monetary policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nmeets eight times per year. We left interest rates unchanged at our meeting last week. More\ngenerally, though, we’ve been gradually increasing rates in order to bring the stance of monetary\npolicy closer to neutral.\nThis policy normalization, or return to neutral, reflects our commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate.\nOne goal is “maximum” or full employment. This means an unemployment rate that is very low,\nreflecting normal worker turnover in a thriving labor market. Recent unemployment numbers below\n4 percent strongly suggest that the labor market has reached or exceeded full employment. But there\nare other indicators as well, and I’ll return to them in a moment.\nOur other goal is stable prices. In 2012, the FOMC determined that aiming for price inflation of 2\npercent was most consistent with that broad long-run goal.2 We’d been mostly running below that\ntarget since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Recently, though, inflation has come back up and is\nbasically on target. I expect this modest uptrend to continue, with inflation rising to just a bit above\n2 percent over the next year or so. Of course, there are risks on both sides of that projection.\n2 Board of Governors (2012).\nPage 3 of 11\n\nInflation could pick up more rapidly than expected, or it could drop back down again.3 For now,\nthough, the inflation numbers are very encouraging.\nThese conditions, with both of the Fed’s goals essentially met, merit the gradual normalization of\nmonetary policy.\nSo why gradual? I view this gradualism as a process of iterated learning, guided by incoming data.\nThat is, we take a policy action, wait, learn about the economy’s response, and repeat. The\ninformation gathered through this gradual approach is crucial for determining the speed and size of\nthe subsequent policy adjustments. Of course, since monetary policy acts with a significant lag—\nlikely a few years—policymakers must plan ahead, but need to be ready to adjust if the data or the\nenvironment change.4\nIn other words, the FOMC is not on autopilot, with quarterly rate increases locked in. We’re\nconstantly looking at the data and adjusting the monetary policy path as needed in response.\nAre we at full employment?\nThat summarizes where I see the economy and policy headed. But there are always uncertainties.\nWe’ve been surprised at how long it’s taken inflation to return to target. This has raised questions\nabout whether the economy has truly reached its full potential. In other words, are we at the point\nwhere growth will be increasingly constrained by bottlenecks and other supply factors, rather than\ninadequate demand?\nIn the labor market, this idea of an economy at its potential corresponds to full employment. Hence\nthe question: “Are we at full employment?” [slide]. While we frequently summarize the state of the\nlabor market with the unemployment rate, we always look at a wide variety of other labor market\nindicators. These include broader measures of underemployment that take into account individuals who\nare out of the labor market or stuck in part-time jobs. We also watch an array of independent data\nseries on job openings, worker quit rates, reported job availability and difficulties filling jobs, and\n3 These risks are discussed in Powell (2018). See also Shapiro (2018, forthcoming).\n4 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\nPage 4 of 11\n\nothers. Essentially all of these indicators are flashing bright green: they’ve met or moved beyond\ntheir values from past peaks, signaling a labor market that is indeed at full employment.\nThe key exception is continued low rates of labor force participation. This refers to the fraction of\nthe working-age population that is either employed or is unemployed and actively seeking work. My\nfirst chart shows the patterns in participation over the past 25 years for the overall population ages\n16 and over and for workers in their prime working years, corresponding to ages 25 to 54.\nYou can see that the overall rate has generally been on the decline since the year 2000.\nDemographics play a big role—specifically aging, as many of the baby boom generation head off for\nretirement.\nBut an aging population doesn’t explain everything. The chart also shows a drop in labor force\nparticipation among prime-age workers. Like the overall rate, prime-age participation peaked around\nthe year 2000. It fell around the 2001 recession and then took an even steeper tumble during and\nafter the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009. It reached a low point in 2015, nearly eight years\nafter the initial downturn. We’ve seen a bit of improvement since then. But currently, the prime-age\nparticipation rate is significantly lower than it was in the 1990s.\nPage 5 of 11\n\nThis raises the question—why aren’t Americans working like they used to? Some observers think\nthis reflects a labor market that hasn’t yet recovered from the last recession. But my reading of the\nevidence suggests that longer-term factors are at play.\nA number of influences have been identified. Research by San Francisco Fed economist Nicolas\nPetrosky-Nadeau and his coauthor Bob Hall suggests that some of the drop owes to economically\nsecure families opting in favor of one employed spouse rather than two.5 In other words, there may\nhave been some shift toward the “life” end of the work-life balance.\nAnother factor behind the decline is ongoing job polarization that favors workers at the high and\nlow ends of the skill distribution but hinders those in the middle. This is mainly due to changing\ntechnology. I know for myself, I never call a travel agent anymore. With a few taps and swipes on\nmy phone, I can book a trip to almost anywhere in the world in seconds. But it goes far beyond that:\nour economy is automating a wide range of jobs in the middle-skill range, from assembly lines, to\ncall center workers, to grocery checkers.\nA growing body of research finds that these pressures on middle-skill jobs leave a big swath of\nworkers on the sidelines, wanting work but not having the skills or flexibility to keep pace with the\never-changing economy.6\nWhat to do?\nI’ve argued that low workforce participation reflects long-term challenges. Good monetary policy\ncan’t directly cure these problems. But as I’ve already noted, it can help by keeping the expansion\ngoing. Recessions cause long-term damage to workers’ employment and wage prospects.7 Keeping\nthe economy on an even keel can help avoid these problems.\nBut much can be done beyond good monetary policy. We shouldn’t think of “full employment” as a\nfixed target, but instead think of it as something that can be moved. From that perspective, there\nappears to be quite a bit of upside potential for U.S. workforce participation.\n5 Hall and Petrosky-Nadeau (2016).\n6 See Abraham and Kearney (2018), Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006), Autor (2010), and Valletta and Barlow (2018).\n7 See for example Davis and von Wachter (2011).\nPage 6 of 11\n\nInternational comparisons are helpful on this point. The next chart shows the prime-age\nparticipation rate in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In these other\nadvanced economies, participation has increased overall and now stands well above the rates\nobserved in the United States. This is especially striking because, just like the United States, these\ncountries are facing long-term challenges like labor market polarization. Yet, they have managed to\noffset the downward pull on participation rates.\nWhat factors have contributed to this growing divergence between us and other countries?\nEducation is one. Like most advanced economies, job creation in the United States has tilted toward\njobs that require a college degree.8 But we’re not adequately preparing our new workers for the jobs\nof the future. Although the share of young people with four-year college degrees is rising, we are\nfalling behind many of our international competitors.9\nSo where should we focus our efforts when it comes to increasing college education? A good place\nto start would be reducing the educational attainment gap across students of different races and\nethnicities. Equalizing opportunity and access to higher education has substantial upside potential\n8 Carnevale, Smith, and Strohl (2013), OECD (2018a).\n9 OECD (2018b).\nPage 7 of 11\n\nfor overall growth, as well as for enhancing the economic mobility that is at the core of our\nAmerican identity.10\nBut education is not the only answer. There are other things that can be done. The United States\nversus Canada comparison is especially telling (chart). You can see a growing participation gap\nbetween the two countries since the late 1990s. By 2017, the prime-age participation rate was over 5\npercentage points higher in Canada than in the States. This is a startling difference. It represents\nabout 6.7 million additional individuals in the U.S. who could be in the labor force.\nIn a research report scheduled for public release tomorrow, I worked with current and former San\nFrancisco Fed staff to try to understand this gap.11 We found that it’s mostly due to differences for\nwomen: they account for about three-fourths, or 5 million, of that 6.7 million total. And it’s not a\nmatter of differences in educational attainment: the Canadian edge is generally evident across all\neducational groups.\n10 Further discussion is provided in Daly (2018).\n11 Daly et al. (2018).\nPage 8 of 11\n\nWhy is there such a large gap in women’s participation rates across the two countries? We discuss\nsome tentative but compelling answers in our research note. Government subsidies for the cost of\nchildcare in Canada may play a role, supporting the return to work for parents—especially\nmothers—with young children.\nProbably more important, though, are Canada’s generous parental leave policies. Workers are\nassured of being able to return to their prior job, with the same compensation, after taking a\nprolonged parental leave—up to a year and a half in some provinces. They also receive payments\nthat replace much of their lost income during leave, funded out of the nation’s employment\ninsurance system. This system encourages people to return to jobs rather than drop out of the labor\nforce following the birth of children.\nNow I’m not advocating we adopt the Canadian system or recommending any particular policy. But\nthe comparison with Canada, as well as with other industrialized nations, shows that policy matters\nand that, with the right mix of skills and support, there’s meaningful potential for increasing U.S.\nworkforce participation.\nThe Fed can help by making sure that the economy continues to grow, creating work opportunities\nfor wide swaths of the population. But over the long term, it is equally important to develop more\nsupportive educational and family policies, so that individuals are encouraged to take advantage of\nthose opportunities.\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, the U.S. economy is in very good shape. Keeping it that way requires continuing on the\npath of consistent, thoughtful monetary policy. In conjunction with policies designed to encourage\nworkforce participation, this also may help boost our economy’s longer-term growth potential,\nthereby supporting economic advancement for all Americans.

    "text": "The Choice to See\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCommencement Address, Sol Price School of Public Policy\nUniversity of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nMay 12, 2023, 11:00 AM PDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThank you, Dean Goldman, for your kind introduction. It is truly my honor to be here.\nFirst things first. I would like all the graduates—and only the graduates—to give yourselves a big\nround of applause. You have earned this day. And it’s important that you take the time to\nrecognize it.\nI also want to acknowledge the family, friends, faculty, and everyone else who, in ways big and\nsmall, helped make this day possible. Thank you.\nThis day is especially meaningful to me because I also graduated from a public policy school: The\nMaxwell School at Syracuse University. While the colors of our gowns are different, and a few\ndecades separate my graduating class from yours, we are bound by a commitment to mission-\nminded work and public service.\nOf course, when people hear “public service,” they think either of the president of the United\nStates or the DMV. But we know the label is bigger than that.\nIn fact, it’s not a label at all. It’s a choice.\nI first learned about this choice decades ago in Ballwin, Missouri. A high school guidance\ncounselor made a phone call. She asked her friend, Betsy, to meet with a former student: a\nyoung teenager who had done well in school, read a lot, loved to learn. But the family finances,\nand the family itself, had fallen on hard times. And the teenager, needing to help out, had\n1\n\ndropped out of school. She was working a bunch of different jobs—driving a donut truck,\nstocking shelves at Target, mowing lawns—whatever she could find. And her goal was to one\nday get a job as a bus driver so she could have a stable income and good benefits.\nBetsy agreed to meet her. And right away she could see that the young woman had a plan. But\nBetsy knew that, for the plan to work, this young woman needed a GED. So, she suggested it,\nand the girl took her advice. Then, Betsy told her she would have even more opportunities if she\nwent to college, at least for a little while. The young woman applied and she got in. But she\ncouldn’t afford the tuition. So, Betsy wrote a check—they still had those then—to the bursar at\nthe University of Missouri—St. Louis. And at that moment, everything changed. A semester of\ncollege turned into a BA from the University of Missouri—Kansas City, and eventually into a PhD\nfrom Syracuse University in economics and public policy.\nAnd that path led me here. Yes, that young woman was me. I went from a teenager hoping to\nbe a bus driver to president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. And the\nreason was Betsy.\nBetsy wasn’t a public servant in the traditional sense. And she certainly didn’t see herself that\nway. But that’s exactly what she was. That’s exactly who she was. And it was not because of a\njob or a title. It was her lens on the world.\nBetsy could see beyond what was right in front of her. In front of her was a teenaged dropout\nstruggling to make ends meet. Betsy saw a young woman full of promise who had simply fallen\non hard times.\nAnd her seeing changed my life. It is the reason I am here today.\nThat is service.\nBut seeing a person right in front of you is one thing. Seeing millions whose names and faces\nyou will never know is quite another. Every step you take up the career ladder puts you farther\naway from the people you serve. And that distance makes it easy to lose sight of what really\nmatters.\nIt took a charged moment to bring this point home for me. And it was the most meaningful\nmoment in my thirty-plus year career. It came in 2009, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.\nI was part of the San Francisco Fed Research team and we were briefing the Bank’s then-\npresident Janet Yellen—Treasury Secretary now, of course.\nColleagues were describing the ongoing challenges in the labor market, which included near\ndouble-digit unemployment, lack of job growth, and a dismal forecast for recovery.\n2\n\nJanet asked a simple question. What would the impact be? The answer was immediate, almost\nreflexive—the labor market will eventually come back.\nBut eventually was beside the point, and Janet instinctively reacted. She struck the table with\nher fist and said, “These are people!” Except there was a bleep before “people.” In the Midwest,\nwe would say “friggin.” But let’s just say, Janet Yellen is not from the Midwest.\nBoth the expletive and the fist pound were startling. And for a moment we all fell silent. Janet\nhad just laid bare the truth about our work. It was not simply theoretical. Behind our data, our\nmodels, our forecasts lived people—individuals who had lost jobs, homes, sometimes hope. And\nwe had missed it.\nThe moment passed and we returned to the briefing. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And I\nhave never forgotten it.\nAs a Reserve Bank president, I have tens of millions of constituents. And it’s not enough to look\nat the data and think I know them. Real knowing comes from seeing the who behind the\nstatistics. And how our policy decisions affect their everyday lives.\nThat’s what Janet Yellen’s pound of the fist really meant.\nIt was a call for us to see.\nNow, this practice of seeing, done day after day, changes not just what we see, but also what\nwe do.\nA vivid example of this occurred early in my research career. We were studying the impact of\nenvironmental programs. One of the study sites was a village that had a tree planting program\nto prevent soil erosion and offer shade. And we had gone to check on it.\nWhen we arrived at the village, the results of the program were painfully clear: every single tree\nwas dead. A sea of perfectly planted, completely lifeless sticks in the ground.\nThe program workers were devastated. But it was obvious what had happened. The trees hadn’t\ngotten enough water, and they died.\nSo, we went to speak to the villagers. We learned that it was a two-mile walk to the well and\nback—a trip they already made multiple times a day to get water for cooking, drinking, and\nbathing. When we heard that, we understood. Of course the trees had died. We had given hard-\nto-care-for trees to people with limited access to water.\nIt was a tragic but classic policy miss: providing a well-intentioned solution without ever\nspeaking to the recipients and seeing what they needed.\n3\n\nAnd this is why seeing is so important. When we don’t see things clearly, we don’t do things\nwell, no matter how good our intentions.\nWe end up with a sea of dead sticks.\nI share these three stories with you because they capture a powerful truth. When we see things\nclearly, we do things differently.\nWe develop programs that give people what they actually need.\nWe acknowledge the real-life struggles that numbers don’t show.\nWe write the check for a struggling teenager that changes the course of her life.\nSo, as you go out into the world, remember this: Public service is not a job. It’s a choice—a\nchoice to see people clearly and to act on what you see.\nAnd if you make this choice, no matter where your career takes you—a courtroom, a classroom,\na boardroom, or the Situation Room—you will be a public servant.\nThat is my call to you.\nCongratulations, Class of 2023. And welcome to the fold.\nThank you.\n4",

Inaddition,most SES datathat areobtainedarenot reported.7-9\nThis datadeficiencywas highlightedat arecent federally-sponsoredhealthconferenceonSES\nandhas beennotedbytheNational CommitteeonVital andHealthStatistics (NCVHS). Inboth\ncases,therecommendationwas forregularcollectionofSES dataandfortheuseofSES\nvariables instudies ofdifferential healthoutcomes.10\nDespitegrowingawareness oftheneed forregularcollectionofSES measures,there\nremains littleagreement onwhichSES measures shouldbegathered.11 Oneproblem is that\nnumerous measures ofSES status havebeenshowntoaffect healthoutcomes,e.g.,occupation,16\neducation,17,18andhouseholdincome.19-22 Moreover,researchers haveshownthat thesemeasures\narenot interchangeable,23-26andthat theimpact ofanyparticularSES measureonhealthvaries\nacross social groups,gender,andage.27-30 Thefact that various measures ofSES maysummarize\ndifferent components ofoverall healthrisksuggests that asystematicevaluationofthe\nexplanatorypowerofvarious SES measures is requiredbeforeaneffectiveset ofoptimal\nindicators canbecreated.\nThis papercontributes tothis examinationbyevaluatingtherelationshipbetweenaset of\nSES measures,availablefrom bothadministrativeandsurveydatasources,andmortalityfora\n4\n\nCSES Measures andMortality\nnationally-representativesampleofindividuals. Theanalysis takes advantageofauniquedata\nset,thePanel StudyofIncomeDynamics,toexaminethepredictivepowerofavarietyofSES\nmeasures. Specificallytheanalysis focuses ontheeconomiccomponents ofSES,differentiating\nbetweenhouseholdandindividual measures,stocks versus flows,andshort versus long-run\ncircumstances. Inaddition,thepaperdistinguishes amongmeasures ofSES that canbegathered\ninadministrativedatasources suchas birthanddeathrecords,as well as incross-sectional and\nlongitudinal surveys. Theresults confirm previous researchonthelinkbetweenadministrative\nSES measures andmortality,andsuggest that economiccomponents ofSES shouldbeastandard\nfeatureofourmeasurement system formonitoringlinks betweenSES andhealth.\nMEASURES OFSES\nIngeneral,measures ofsocioeconomicstatus aremeant toprovideinformationabout an\nindividual’s access tosocial andeconomicresources. Inpractice,numerous indicators fit this\ndescription. Among themost commonlyusedareeducationandoccupation. Less commonly\nused,but potentiallyas important,areeconomicmeasures suchas income,thewagerate,and\nwealth. Thefollowingsectiondescribes thebenefits anddrawbacks ofeachofthesemeasures.\nYears ofcompletedschoolingarereportedwithreasonableeaseandreliabilityandarea\nmeaningful indicatorofSES forvirtuallyall adults. Thesefactors ledtotheselectionof\neducationforthedeathcertificatein1989,31and thepreliminaryassessment oftheNational\nCommitteeofVital andHealthStatistics that educationmaybethemost feasibleSES indicator\nforadministrativedatabases.32 However,becauseeducationis typicallycompletedearlyin\nadulthood,it captures neitherdifferential on-the-jobtrainingandothercareerinvestments made\n5\n\nCSES Measures andMortality\nbyindividuals withsimilarlevels offormal schooling,northevolatilityineconomicstatus\nduringadulthoodthat has recentlybeenshowntohaveadverseimplications forhealth.33\nUsual ormost recent occupationalsohas beenlongemployedas anindicatorofSES and\nis useful forpersons whohavehadlaborforceexperience. Measures ofoccupational class are\nwidelyusedinotherindustrializedcountries andhavebeenfoundrobust inpredictingvariations\ninhealthstatus.34 TheNIHconferencecalled foroccupationtobeincludedas acoreSES\nvariableintheU.S.35 Still,occupationis problematicforsubgroups ofthepopulation,suchas\nteenmothers andothers withlittlelabormarket experience. Moreover,later-careeroccupations,\nunlikeeducation,aremoresubject toreversecausationproblems inwhichpoorhealthleads to\ndeclines inoccupational status.\nIncomehas beenusedmorewidelyas ameasureofSES instudies basedintheUnited\nStates thanelsewhere.

Occasionally,studies areabletouse\nanincomemeasurethat has beenaveragedoveranumberofyears.39,40\nAs with occupation,it is difficult todisentanglehealthselectionandsocial causation\nmechanisms usingproximal measurements ofincomeandhealth. Becauseofthehighvolatility\ninincomefrom onemonthoryeartothenext,41questions about \"usual income\" areill-advised.42\nMoreover,anannual (ormulti-year)incomemeasureoftenhas greaterexplanatorypowerthana\n6\n\nCSES Measures andMortality\nmonthly(orsingle-year)measure.43 Longitudinal surveys areespeciallyvaluableforassessing\nincome-basedSES,sincetheycanfacilitatethemonitoringofchanges inSES overtime.\nContrarytopopularbelief,it is possibletoaskabout incomeinsurveys andencounterfew\nproblems ofnonresponse.44\nIndividual labor-market earnings measuredonanannual orper-hourbasis is another\nindicatorofeconomiccircumstances,but appropriateonlyforpersons withlaborforce\nexperience. Althoughmanyeconomists wouldconsiderthehourlywageratetobea\nconceptuallysuperiormeasureofincome-basedSES, it is rarelyusedbyhealthresearchers. The\nhourlywagerateis typicallymeasuredbydividinglabormarket earnings oversometimeperiod\nbythetotal numberofhours workedduringthat time. Thewagerateis conceivedbyeconomists\nas ameasureofthestockofeconomicallyvaluableskills acquiredbefore(i.e.throughformal\nschooling)andduring(i.e.throughon-the-jobtraining)adulthood. As such,it reflects thevalue\nof\"humanwealth\" (humancapital)andcomplements theconcept offinancial wealth. Although\nindividuals not currentlyworkinghavezerolabormarket earnings,theymaystill haveapositive\nwagerate,that is,theamount perhourtheycould earniftheydidwork. Observedorimputed\nwagerates areoftenconceivedas general measures oftheproductivityofanindividual's time\nbothinandout ofthelabormarket.\nIncontrast toincome,whichconsists ofaflowofresources oversometimeperiod,\nwealthcaptures thestockofassets oreconomicreserves at agivenpoint intime.

Riskratios exceeded2.0onlyinthecaseofthefemale\nlaborers,operatives andcraft workers whobeganthemortalityriskperiodundertheageof65.2\nOne-year(1983inthis case)familyincomeemergedas amorepowerful correlateof\n1984-1994mortalitythaneithercompletedschoolingoroccupation. Incomehadaparticularly\nhighassociationwithmortalityforpre-retirement women(RR=3.89,CI=1.62,9.38forwomenin\nbottom versus topincomequintile),but was significant as well forpre-retirement men(RR=2.97,\nCI=1.02,8.68). Forbothpreretirement menandwomen,themortalitygradient withrespect to\nincomewas significant throughthemiddlequintile. Inthepost-retirement sample,incomewas a\nuniformlyinsignificant predictorofmortality,withcomparativeriskratios neverexceeding1.6.\nResults forthe\"survey-based\" indicators ofSES arepresentedinTable3andshowthat\nhouseholdwealthhas thestrongest associations withsubsequent mortality. Bothmenand\nwomenunderage65in1984andinthebottom wealthquintilehadmortalityrisks roughlythree\ntimes as high(RR=2.81,CI=1.19,6.65formen; RR=3.01,CI=1.33,6.84forwomen)as thoseof\nsimilarly-agedmenandwomenwhosehouseholdwealthplacedthem inthetopquintile. In\n2Small samplesizes precludedseparateriskestimates withinthesethreeoccupational\ncategories forwomen.\n13\n\nCSES Measures andMortality\ncontrast to single-yearincome,thewealth-mortalityassociationwas alsosignificant fortheage\n65+cohorts,althoughtheriskratios wereonethirdlower(RR=2.11,CI=1.19,3.75formen;\nRR=2.00,CI=1.26,3.15forwomen)relativetotheunderage65cohorts.\nWeassumethat theinterviewinwhichtheSES informationis gatheredprovides five\nannual observations onfamilyincomeas well as theinformationneededtoadjust incomefor\nfamilysizeusingU.S.povertythresholds (thus producingthemeasurelabeled\"Incometo\nNeeds\"). Withoneexception,averagingincomeoverthefive-yearinterval between1979and\n1983changedrelativemortalityriskestimates verylittlefrom thosebasedonsingle-year(1983)\nincomealone. Bottom-to-topdecilecomparisons oflonger-runhouseholdincomeproducea\nhigherriskratioforpre-retirement women(RR=4.88,CI=1.94,12.3)relativetosingle-year\nincome.

This suggests that it is thecombinationoflowincomes andlarger\nfamilysizes duringthepre-retirement years that elevatewomen’s risks themost.\nHourlyearnings hadat best amodest associationwithsubsequent mortality. Thecontrast\nbetweenhourlyearnings andothermeasures ofeconomicstatus aremost strikingforpre-\nretirement women,suggestingthat familyresources mattermuchmoreforhealththanthe\nwoman’s ownproductivityoftime.\n14\n\nCSES Measures andMortality\nResults forthefinal set ofindicators aredrawnadecadeormorepriortothebeginningof\ntheinterval overwhichmortalityis assessed(Table4). Toenhanceourefforts toassess the\nexogenous effects oftheseSES components,weincludeanadditivecontrol forself-reported\nworklimitations intoall oftheCoxregressions.\nByandlarge,measuringtheeconomiccomponent ofSES inthelate1960s andearly\n1970s weakens but does not eliminatepatterns foundwiththeeconomiccomponents measuredin\nthelate1970s andearly1980s. Householdincome,inthis caseaveragedoverthe1967-1975\ninterval,continues tohavestrongerassociations withsubsequent mortalityforwomenthanmen\nand foryoungerthanoldercohorts,and adjustingincomeforfamilysizeproduces thestrongest\nassociations ofall forwomen. Lowest-to-highest quintileriskratios forthesewomenare3.26\n(CI=1.19,8.88)forfamilyincomeand5.15(1.72,15.4)forsize-adjustedfamily income. Wage\nratecontinues tohaveonlymodest associations withmorality.\nRiskratios fortheoldercohorts aregenerallyhigherwiththemoredistant thanmore\nrecent SES measures,suggestingthat economicstatus duringthepre-retirement years is more\nimportant forhealththaneconomicstatus duringretirement. Thefact that theriskratios are\nneveras strongfortheolderas fortheyoungercohorts suggests that someofthehealtheffects of\nSES maytaketheform ofsurvival until age65.\nDISCUSSION\nWehavesought toenumeratealternativemeasures ofSES andtoassess theirassociations\ntomortalityusingprospectivedatafrom anationallyrepresentativesurvey.

As the depository’s cost of funds\nincreases with interest rates, the proportion of total mort-\ngages held in lenders’ portfolios declines because the rel-\native attractiveness of Treasury securities rises (top panel,\nFigure 1).

Thus, the traditional-only lender is substituting\nTreasuries for traditional mortgages, while the nontradi-\ntional lender is substituting Treasuries for both traditional\nand nontraditional mortgages, and also is substituting tra-\nditional for nontraditional mortgages. As shown in the B.

We also conducted simulations using return parameters based on\nlong-run historical data from 1926 to 1991. (See Laderman and Pass- C. DESIREDMORTGAGE-TO-ASSETRATIO\nmore 1998.) These simulations showed responses that were qualitatively\nsimilar to the simulations based on the more recent data.\n11. Note that the level of the nontraditional mortgage-to-asset ratio is\nusually very small relative to the level for the traditional mortgage-to-\nasset ratio. There is little empirical evidence about the level of nontra-\nditional mortgages. For a brief time, the OTS collected information\nfrom savings associations on the amount of mortgages they made with\ngreater than 80 percent loan-to-value ratios and with no private mort-\ngage insurance. This type of mortgage often is extended to nontradi-\ntional borrowers. Many of the institutions had less than 5 percent of\ntheir mortgages in this category.\n12. Note that the desired amount of mortgages can be negative or can\nexceed 100 percent, depending on their relative return. If the institution\nhas the ability to “short” mortgage securities or Treasury securities, it\nmight pursue these strategies.

(But a nonnegative rela-\ntionship between income and the mortgage-to-asset ratio,\nor one that is only slightly different from that experienced\nby traditional lenders, is also possible.) As will be seen be-\nlow, the possibility of a non-zero response is a key dis-\ntinction in our effort to separate lenders who provide a\ncommodity-like mortgage product from those who serve\nmarkets with nontraditional borrowers.

These disparities have persisted despite changes in\nlaws, policies, and programs meant to remove barriers and prevent discriminatory practices [6].\nMost strikingly, many of the gaps in outcomes cannot be explained by observable measures of talent\nor skill, meaning that as of now gender and race remain meaningful predictors of labor market\noutcomes in our economy [1].\nThese facts have long been recognized as unfair and inconsistent with the ideals of opportunity\nand meritocracy that define the American narrative. But there is growing awareness that they are\nalso costly, not just to those that experience them, but to society and the economy as a whole [7], [8].\nThe persistence of systemic disparities and inequitable opportunities by race, gender, socioeconomic\nstatus, and a myriad of other indicators results in a misallocation, or complete sidelining of talent,\nthat ultimately bridles economic growth [9], [10], [11], [12].\nIn this paper, we focus on disparities by race and gender. We document gaps in opportunities\nand labor market outcomes, and their evolution over time, using data from the Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) from 1990 to 2019. We find that gaps in employment, hours worked, educational\nattainment, educational utilization, and occupational allocation have remained relatively constant\nsince 1990. With these facts in hand, we ask: how much have persistent gaps in measured outcomes\nhindered U.S. economic growth? To answer this question we apply a simple growth accounting\nframework that allows us to estimate the total aggregate economic losses over time, and decompose\ntheselossesintothecomponentsthatdrivethem: employment, hoursworked, andlaborproductivity.\nWe estimate these costs using standard shift-share techniques.\nWe find significant aggregate economic losses associated with persistent disparities; losses\nmeasured in trillions of dollars and several tenths of a percentage point on GDP growth. Decom-\nposing these losses we find differences in employment and educational attainment make the largest\ncontributions by race. Differences in returns on these variables also contribute materially to the\ntotal costs. Differences by gender are primarily driven by gaps in employment and hours.\nLooking ahead, given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the labor market outcomes\nof women and people of color, as well as the fact that the U.S. population is increasingly racially\ndiverse, the costs of disparities will likely increase. Simple tabulations based on Census population\n1\n\nprojections, suggest that without significant progress to close these gaps, disparities in labor market\noutcomes by group could be a major restraining factor on U.S. growth over the next 20 years.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we briefly summarize the\nrelated literature. In Section 3 we discuss the historical gaps in the labor market outcomes and\neducational attainment by race and gender. In Section 4 we describe our framework, data, and\nmethodology. We present the results in Section 5 and provide a concluding discussion in Section 6.\n2 Related Literature\nA growing research literature demonstrates that the persistent inequities in opportunities and\noutcomes impose significant costs on the U.S. economy [8]. This is true across a wide variety of\nmeasures including employment, earnings, wealth, and innovation. We summarize the key findings\nof this literature here and provide a more detailed summary in Appendix Table A1.\nStarting with employment and earnings, Hsieh et al. [9] estimate that improving the allocation\nof female and black talent in the economy accounted for between 20% and 40% of growth in U.S.\nmarket GDP per person between 1960 and 2010. Turner [11] similarly estimates that closing the\nracial earnings gap associated with disparities in health, education, incarceration and employment\nopportunities by 2050 would increase GDP by 22%, for a corresponding gain of $8 trillion. Finally,\nTruehaft, Scoggins, and Tran [12] estimate that closing racial income gaps in 2012, by way of both\nincreased wages and employment among people of color, would have increased GDP by 14%, or $2.1\ntrillion, that year.\nLooking across a broad array of factors that influence wealth, Peterson and Mann [10] estimate\nthatclosingracialgapsinkeyareassuchaswages,highereducation,homeownership,andinvestment\nwould have generated significant additional income for saving, investing, and consumption, leading\nto a significant increase in aggregate output. Their bottom line estimate is a boost to GDP of $16\ntrillion over the past 20 years, and an additional $5 trillion over the next five years. Noel et al.\n[13] similarly estimate that closing the racial wealth gap by 2028 across dimensions such income,\ntangible investments, and stock-market investments would increase aggregate output by 4-6%.\nStudies also demonstrate that systemic inequities cost the economy by holding back innovation.\nBell et al. [14] estimate that the U.S. could have many more inventors if women, people of color, and\nchildren from low-income families were exposed to innovation at an early age. Cook and Yang [15]\n2\n\nestimate that removing barriers for women and blacks in patenting and commercialization would\nincrease per capita GDP. Cook (2014) [16] demonstrates that the rise of hate-related violence against\nAfrican Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries depressed patent activity among African\nAmericans. Collectively, these studies imply that disparities are limiting the potential growth of the\nU.S. economy far more the simple closing of current gaps would suggest.\nAlthough we do not investigate the causes of persistent gaps in race and gender outcomes,\nwe recognize that a long literature has linked these gaps to the presence of structural factors\nembedded in the institutions and practices of society. For example, explicitly racialized policies\nsuch as Jim Crow laws and redlining have had long lasting effects on residential segregation and\nwealth accumulation [17], [18], [19], which continue to create inequitable economic opportunities\nacross racial and ethnic groups. These “opportunity gaps” influence a range of outcomes such as\neducationalattainmentandemploymentthatultimatelyshapelabormarketdisparities. AsWilliams\nand Wilson [2] demonstrate, even when black workers do attain a college degree, they are more\nlikely than their white counterparts to work in jobs that typically do not require a college degree,\nmeaning their talent is systematically underutilized. We recognize that while hard to measure\nindividually, a range of macro and micro systems have greatly contributed to the racialized outcomes\nwe observe. Gee and Ford [20], building on the work of Powell [21], define this collection of forces\nas structural racism or, “macro-level systems, social forces, institutions, ideologies, and processes\nthat interact with one another to generate and reinforce inequities among racial and ethnic groups.”\nNotably, structural racism has been codified by policy, custom, and practice, therefore it perpetuates\ninequities whether or not racism occurs at the interpersonal level [22]. But in fact, numerous studies\ndocument ongoing labor market discrimination at the individual level, including Bertrand and\nMullainathan [23] and Pager, Bonikowski, and Western [24], suggesting that both structural and\ninterpersonal racism influence labor disparities.\nA long literature also has demonstrated disparate labor market outcomes by gender, including\ndifferences related to occupational segregation, labor force participation, and wages [25], [4], [26],\n[5]. There are many factors that contribute to these differences, including structural impediments to\nfull economic participation, such as limited policies for paid parental leave and a lack of affordable\nchild care. These impediments have significant implications for broader economic growth [27].\nImportantly, the intersection of race and gender creates compounding labor market challenges\n3\n\nfor women of color, particularly black and Hispanic women, who face discrimination associated with\noverlapping socially marginalized identities, as evidenced by a growing body of literature [28], [3],\n[29], [30]. For example, in an exploration of the wage gap between black women and white men,\nPaul et al. [31] estimate that the unexplained portion of the wage gap is larger than the sum of the\ntwo individual penalties of gender and race, suggesting the intersection of these identities creates\na wage penalty greater than the additive components of measured race and gender penalties in\nisolation. In the context of COVID-19, Gezici and Ozay [32] find that after controlling for education,\nage, and industry and occupation effects, women are more likely to be unemployed compared to\nmen, and black and Hispanic women are more likely to be unemployed than white women.\n3 Outcome and Opportunity Gaps\nTo get a sense of the potential gains to the economy from closing labor market outcome and\nopportunity gaps it is useful to review a few illustrative examples of the differences by race, ethnicity,\nand gender. Figure 1 plots the employment to population ratios (EPOP) from 1990-2019 for black,\nwhite, and Hispanic and individuals ages 25-64 (left panel) and for men and women (right panel).\nSeveral things stand out in these charts. First, whites and men have higher employment rates\nthan other groups throughout the sample. The average gap between whites and blacks is about\neight percentage points. The average gap between whites and Hispanic individuals is just over five\npercentage points. The gaps by gender are larger, averaging about 14 percentage points over the\nsample. The second thing to notice is the cyclicality of EPOP for all groups. EPOP goes down\nduring and after recessions, and comes back up as the economy recovers and expands. Finally, while\nthere is some evidence that gaps narrow during expansions, particularly for blacks and Hispanics,\nthe narrowing is insufficient to close gaps completely [33].\n4\n\n(a) Employment to Population Ratio, Race (b) Employment to Population Ratio, Gender\nFigure 1: Trends in Employment (25-64)\nOne of the key inputs to labor market success is educational attainment. Figure 2 shows the\npercent share of working-age individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher by race and ethnicity\n(left panel), and gender (right panel). Again, several things stand out in these plots. A far larger\nshare of whites have a BA or more than do blacks or Hispanics. These gaps have grown over time.\nIn 2019, the share of whites with a BA or higher was 45.6, compared to 32.3 for blacks, and 21.0 for\nHispanics. The patterns by gender are quite different. In the early part of our sample, educational\nattainment was nearly equivalent for men and women. This changed in the early 2000s when the\nshare of women with a BA or more began to rise steadily. In 2019, 44.7 percent of women had a\nBA or more compared to 36.6 of men. Notably, we find these patterns are insensitive to the age\nrange of the sample (not shown), suggesting that these facts are not the result of differences carried\nforward by older cohorts.\n5\n\n(a) Share of population with a BA or higher, Race (b) Share of population with a BA or higher, Gender\nFigure 2: Trends in Educational Attainment (25-64)\nResearch has shown that even when women and people of color acquire a BA degree, they are\nnot always in jobs that fully utilize their skills [2]. This results in an under utilization of resources\nfor these individuals and for the economy as a whole. Figure 3 plots the degree to which worker\nskills are utilized by group, following the classification used by Williams and Wilson [2]. The figure\nshows the share of BA degree holders who are in BA jobs by race and gender. Several things stand\nout. First, over the course of the sample, utilization rates are always higher for whites. Second, the\ngaps in utilization between whites, blacks, and Hispanics have grown over time. In 2019, the last\nyear of our sample, the utilization gap between whites and both blacks and Hispanics stood around\n10 percentage points.\nNotably, the pattern is completely different by gender. Women are consistently better utilized\nthan their male counterparts with the same level of education. The utilization gap between women\nand men has narrowed over time.\n(a) Share of BA+ degree holders in BA+ jobs, Race (b)ShareofBA+degreeholdersinBA+jobs,Gender\nFigure 3: Trends in Educational Utilization (25-64)\n6\n\nThe final gap we highlight is in the differences in employment opportunities across industries\nand occupations by race and gender. Since capital input and productivity vary by industry and\noccupation, these disparities matter, showing through to gaps in earnings. Figure 4 shows the\nshare of whites, blacks, and Hispanics and men and women who have a professional occupation in\nthe durable manufacturing sector. In the manufacturing sector these are among the highest paid\nworkers. As the figure shows, whites and men are much more likely to hold these jobs than are\nblacks, Hispanics, or women. In 2019, for example, whites were more than twice as likely to be in\nthis sector than other racial groups. The gap by gender was even larger; in 2019 the share of men in\nthis industry-occupation category was more than three times that of women.\n(a) Share of prof in durable good manu, Race (b) Share of prof in durable goods manu, Gender\nFigure 4: Trends in Industry - Occupation Allocation (25-64)\nThese trends document large and persistent disparities in the labor market and skill building\nopportunities in the U.S. We now turn to estimating the costs of these gaps to aggregate output\nand growth.\n4 Estimating the Cost of Gaps\nAs highlighted in the literature review, there are many ways to assess the costs of persistent racial\nand gender disparities on the U.S. economy. In this study, we focus on computing the aggregate\ncost over time and then decomposing that aggregate into the specific factors that drive it. We frame\nour analysis through the lens of simple GDP accounting and complete the empirical work using\nstandard shift-share techniques. Our framework, methodology, and data are described below.\n7\n\n4.1 Basic Growth Accounting\nAggregate output in the economy at any point in time can be written as:\nY “ AˆFpK,Lq (1)\nWhere (Y) is aggregate output, (K) is physical capital, (L) is labor input, and (A) is aggregate productivity.\nFor this study we focus only on the labor contributions to aggregate output,1 considering both the\nquantity of labor input and the productivity of labor inputs. Further decomposing labor input into its\ncomponent parts, the labor component of aggregate output Y can be written as:\nL\nˆ ˙\nH\nY “ N ˆ ˆLP (2)\nL N\nWhere N is the number of workers, H is hours worked per worker, and LP is labor productivity. Labor\nN\nproductivity is determined by a number of factors including the skills of workers, the extent to which workers’\nskills are utilized, and the amount of capital workers use in production, which varies by job and industry.\nThese factors can be proxied by educational attainment, the degree to which workers’ jobs utilize their\neducation, and the industry and occupational distribution in the economy. Taking these factors into account\nwe can further expand equation 2 to:\nˆ ˙\nH\nY “ N ˆ ˆFpe,u,ioq (3)\nL N\nWhere (e) is educational attainment, (u) is the degree of skill utilization, and (io) is selected indus-\ntry/occupation groups. This simple expression frames our analysis.\n4.2 Shift-Share Methodology\nTo estimate the costs of disparities to aggregate growth, we imagine a counterfactual world in which gaps\nin labor market outcomes and opportunities do not exist. We conduct these experiments using standard\nshift-share techniques, which allow us to adjust the inputs to growth and calculate the impact the changes\nhave on aggregate output. Applying these techniques, we ask how much larger would U.S. aggregate output\n(Y) have been if racial and gender gaps in labor input and labor productivity were eliminated.\n4.2.1 Computing the data matrix\nWe start by mapping the elements of equation 3 to publicly available data. We use data from the Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS) from 1990-2019. The CPS contains the full set of demographic, educational, and\n1We hold capital fixed at its realized value.\n8\n\nlabor market information required to complete our analysis. We limit our sample to the outgoing rotation\ngroups from the CPS basic monthly files.\nWe focus on non-institutionalized adults ages 25-64 and divide them into mutually exclusive groups\ndefined by age, gender, and race.2 We construct four race groups: white, black, Hispanic, and other, based on\nself-reported designations. Because we need our groups to be mutually exclusive we assign race such that all\nnon-Hispanic white individuals are classified as white, all black individuals are classified as black, regardless\nof their Hispanic ethnicity, all non-Hispanic Asian individuals are classified as Asian, all Hispanic white or\nHispanic Asian individuals are classified as Hispanic, and all other groups are classified as other. For the\npurpose of this analysis we combine Asian and other individuals into a single group labeled other. We use 10\nyear age groups given by: (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64). This leaves us with 32 analysis groups for a baseline\nsample. The next step in our analysis is to compute the input variables that make up equation 3, for each of\nour 32 groups. We briefly describe them here and provide a full data guide in Appendix C.\nStarting with the quantity of labor input, we define employment (N) using responses to the CPS\nmonthly question: were you employed last week, either at work or off. We aggregate these responses over our\nsample and compute the average number of employed individuals by group on an annual basis. We define\nhours worked (H{N) as usual weekly hours worked over all jobs, and similarly average this value over our\nsample and on an annual basis. We exclude individuals who have zero, negative, or missing hours, regardless\nof their employment status. This leaves us with two labor input variables for each of our 32 groups: the\nfraction employed and average usual hours worked. These variables are computed separately for each year of\nour sample.\nWith labor input in hand we turn to labor productivity. We measure educational attainment for each\nof our sample members using four distinct categories: high school degree or less, associates degree, bachelors\ndegree, and graduate degree. We then compute the fraction of individuals in each of our 32 groups who fall\ninto these education categories in each year. This gives us the distribution of educational attainment for each\nage/gender/race group.\nNext we confront aspects of labor productivity related to how workers are utilized and allocated in the\neconomy. We first consider how well worker skills are utilized. Following Williams and Wilson [2], we use the\nCPS data to compute the educational requirements for each 4-digit occupation category. Specifically, we\nexamine whether 50 percent or more of people in that occupation have an associates degree, or less education.\nIf they do, we mark that occupation as requiring those degrees. All remaining occupations are characterized\nas requiring more education. We then compare the educational attainment of each individual to what is\nrequired and determine whether their skills are appropriately or under-utilized. Using this methodology we\ncompute the shares of each of our 32 groups that are appropriately or under utilized.\n2For the remainder of this paper we will use the term race to characterize both race and ethnicity\n9\n\nFinally, we complete our calculations of the determinants of labor productivity by considering how\nworkers’ skills are allocated in the economy. Previous studies have shown that barriers to entry for women\nand people of color have resulted in a misallocation of talent across industry and occupation [9], [4]. This\nmiss-sorting matters because different jobs have different levels of labor productivity, primarily related to\nthe amount of capital that workers use in production. To quantify how misallocation impacts aggregate\nlabor productivity we divide the economy into 24 industry-occupation job types and compute the industry-\noccupation distribution for each of our 32 groups. These 24 industry-occupation pairs were constructed from\ncombining 11, 2-digit occupationcodesand 14, 2-digitindustry codesinto 4occupation groupsand 6industry\ngroups. A more detailed description of how we constructed these groups can be found in Appendix C. We\nexclude individuals who are not employed and those who do not list an industry and/or occupation.\nSo far we have described the determinants of the quantity of labor input and labor productivity as\ngiven in equations 2 and 3. We need one final element, average hourly earnings (AHE), to compute the value\nof (Y ). Following previous research, we use (AHE) as a measure of the productive value of a single unit of\nL\nlabor input.\nWe define AHE for each individual as usual weekly earnings divided by usually weekly hours, averaged\nover the year. A well known fact in doing analysis on AHE with CPS data is that the top-coded value has\na large, discrete jump in 1998. To address this, we re-calculate top-coded earnings in each year using a\nlognormal distribution following methods developed by the Center for Economic Policy Research [34]. To\nreduce noise in our sample, we remove the top and bottom 1% of earnings after we top-code the data. We\nadjust the earnings value for inflation using the PCEPI deflator. Values are in 2019 dollars. We exclude\nindividuals who have zero, negative, or missing AHE, regardless of their employment status. Finally, we\ncompute measures of AHE for all the separate groupings we use in the analysis. These include: AHE for the\nentire sample; AHE by age, race, gender, and education; AHE by age, race, gender, and utilization; AHE by\nage, race, gender, and industry-occupation, and finally AHE by age, race, gender, education, utilization, and\nindustry-occupation.\nThis leaves us with a complete data matrix that is 32x447x30, reflecting the 32 age, race, and gender\ngroups required to perform a complete shift-share analysis for equation 3, for each of the 30 years in our\nsample. Table A4 provides an illustration of our analysis data set for year 2019.\nIt is important to recognize that equipped with our constructed data matrix and the equation 3\nwe can recover the actual labor contribution to aggregate output. This would entail summing over our\nage/gender/race groups the elements of the equation relating to the labor input, and computing the group\nshare weighted average of the labor productivity inputs from equation 3.\nBelow we describe how we use this data matrix and method to perform our counterfactual analyses.\n10\n\n4.2.2 Counterfactual analysis\nWith the data matrix in hand we turn to the specifics of our shift-share counterfactual exercises. Here we\nwill describe our counterfactual exercises in which we shift by race and gender. In section 5 we will show\nresults adjusting for race and gender individually as well as adjusting for race and gender simultaneously. We\nstart by asking what would happen to the quantity of labor input if women and people of color had the same\nemployment and hours opportunities as white males. White males are the default group in our analysis as\nthey have historically faced fewer systemic barriers in the labor market and as a result have had better labor\noutcomes relative to women, blacks, and Hispanics.3\nGiven our data matrix this is straight forward to compute. We simply replace the employment rates\nand hours worked of women and people of color with those of white males for each of our age groups and\nrecompute labor input using the following equation:\n˜ ¸\nÿ H C\nY C “ N C ˆ a,g,r (4)\nH a,g,r N C\na,g,r a,g,r\nWhere (Y C) is the counterfactual quantity of labor, or total hours worked per week across all workers,\nH\n(N C ) is the total number of workers in a given age, gender, race group, and (H C {N C ) is usual weekly\na,g,r a,g,r a,g,r\nhours worked for a given age, gender, race group. The difference in the actual output and this counterfactual\noutput is the economic gain from having a more equitable distribution of employment and hours by gender\nand race.\nWe next turn to labor productivity again asking how much larger would it be if women and people\nof color had the same opportunities for educational attainment, skill utilization, and industry-occupation\nallocation as white males. While slightly more complicated than our calculation for adjusted employment\nand hours, given our data matrix, this is also straight forward to compute.\nWe begin by simply giving women and people of color the same distribution (shares) of educational\nattainment, utilization, and industry-occupation of white males. For now, we assume that only the shares of\nopportunities change, holding the returns on the opportunities, AHE, constant at the prevailing rate for\neach age/gender/race/labor productivity group (e.g., the share of black college educated men out of black\nmen would change to be the share of white college educated men out of white men, but black educated men\nwould still maintain the AHE for college educated black men).\nThefollowingequationmapsthislogicandillustratesourcalculationforeliminatinggapsineducational\nattainment.\n3Our analysis only adjusts groups when they are worse off than white males. This primarily affects adjustments for\nthe “other” group, where employment and educational attainment are frequently higher for Asian Americans than\nfor white males.\n11\n\nÿ “ `\nY C,Educ “ α α C,hsˆAHEhs `α C,acˆAHEac `\nLP a,g,r a,g,r a,g,r a,g,r a,g,r\na,g,r (5)\n˘‰\nα C,baˆAHE ba `α C,gdˆAHE gd\na,g,r a,g,r a,g,r a,g,r\nWhere (Y C,Educ) is the contribution of labor productivity to overall output, (α ) is the share of the\nLP a,g,r\npopulation that belong to a given age, gender, race group, (AHEhs q is the average hourly earnings for\na,g,r\nindividuals with a high school diploma or less in a given age, gender, race group, and (α C,hs) is the share of\na,g,r\nindividuals with a high school diploma in a given age, gender, race group, etc. The difference in the actual\noutput and this counterfactual output is the economic gain from having a more equitable distribution of\neducational distribution across gender and race.\nWe can perform a similar exercise for our utilization and industry-occupation variables by repeating\nthis exercise by shifting utilization shares and industry-occupation shares for women and people of color to\nthat of white males.\nPutting this all together, we complete the shares part of this exercise by defining very fine groups that\nadjust simultaneously for educational attainment, utilization, and industry-occupation. This is equivalent to\nadding rows to our baseline data matrix. Again, we hold AHE at the value of the treated group.\nOur final experiments consider changes in the returns on opportunity, or AHE, by group as well\nas by changes in the shares. Looking back to equation 5, these experiments change the AHE values by\nage/gender/race to be the counterfactual values, which in our experiments are the values for equivalent white\nmales. We do two separate experiments. The first holds the returns of opportunities constant, changing only\nthe shares. The second changes both the shares and the returns. We compute these experiments for each\nlabor productivity variable separately and for them all together.\n5 Results\nIn this section we report on the results of our experiments. We begin by discussing the impact of making\nlabor market opportunities more equal. We then turn to examining the impact of making returns to those\nopportunities more equal.\nThroughout this section we display tables showing our counterfactual inputs of labor, calculated from\nchanges to shares as well as changes to returns for our age/gender/race groups. We also include tables\nshowing overall counterfactual labor output constructed from these inputs for each decade in our sample\n1990-2019. Each table contains first a row with the actual value of the given variable we are adjusting, then\nthe counterfactual when adjusting by race only, then the counterfactual when adjusting by gender only, and\nthen the counterfactual when adjusting by race and gender. Given recent research focusing on the costs\nof systemic barriers for black Americans we also compute results considering changes in opportunities and\nreturns for blacks alone [10].\n12\n\n5.1 Equalizing Shares\nWe start by showing how each of the individual components of labor output in equation 3 change through\nour shift share analysis, and then relate this to its effect on labor output gaps.\n5.1.1 Labor Input\nWebeginbyaskinghowmuchmoreoutputwouldtheU.S.economyhavehadifhistoricalgapsinemployment\nand hours opportunities by race and gender had been closed.

For each experiment we show the impact on measured labor productivity\n(AHE) from changing education alone and education, utilization and allocation simultaneously. The key\nthings to note from table 3 are that changing the determinants of productivity changes aggregate AHE only\nslightly. This is true whether we consider race, gender, or race and gender together. This owes in part to the\nfact that people of color make up a smaller share of the population than whites and the gaps in education are\n6This exercise, for example gives black females age 25-34 the EPOP of white males age 25-34.\n7Recall from Section 4.2.1 we value the gains to output by multiplying our adjusted labor input quantities by labor\nproductivity (measured as group specific AHE) as described in equation 2.\n14\n\nnot existent by gender, ie., by 2019 the gains from equalizing education by gender are zero.

Inparticular,\ndifferences in the rates of return AHE earned by individuals vary by race and gender in ways not fully\nexplained by differences in skills, utilization, industry-occupation other measurable variables [6].\nTo account for these differences our final experiments keep the determinants of productivity fixed at\nactual values and adjust the returns earned by race and gender. For example, when adjusting by race only,\nwe hold the distribution of educational attainment at its actual values and substitute the wages of white\nequivalents into the calculation of productivity.8\nWe report the results in table 5. The findings are striking. Eliminating the gaps in returns earned by\nwhites versus people of color and women versus men on measured skills, utilization, and industry-occupation\nallocation would have increased aggregate economic output in 2019 by 0.94 trillion 2019 dollars. This is over\n5 times the impact of adjusting the determinants while leaving the returns at their actual values.\n8For example, for all black women age 25-34 with a BA degree we assign the AHE of white women age 25-34 with a\nBA degree.\n16\n\nEducation ($Trillions) All ($Trillions)\n1990 2000 2010 2019 1990 2000 2010 2019\nActual 4.07 5.54 5.97 6.97 4.07 5.54 5.97 6.97\nAdj by Race 4.19 5.75 6.21 7.28 4.18 5.73 6.19 7.26\nGain by Race 0.12 0.21 0.24 0.31 0.11 0.20 0.22 0.28\nAdj by Gender 4.51 6.12 6.51 7.58 4.48 6.10 6.51 7.58\nGain by Gender 0.44 0.58 0.54 0.61 0.41 0.56 0.54 0.60\nAdj by Race Gender 4.68 6.40 6.83 7.97 4.63 6.35 6.77 7.91\nGain by Race Gender 0.60 0.86 0.86 1.00 0.56 0.81 0.80 0.94\nBlack only:\nAdj by Race 4.13 5.62 6.06 7.10 4.12 5.61 6.05 7.09\nGain by Race 0.06 0.08 0.09 0.13 0.05 0.08 0.08 0.11\nAdj by Race Gender 4.19 5.70 6.14 7.20 4.18 5.69 6.12 7.18\nGain by Race Gender 0.11 0.16 0.16 0.23 0.10 0.15 0.15 0.21\nTable 5: Adjusted Output by Labor Productivity Returns\nNote: Alladjustmentsusegranularage/gender/racegroupsandareshiftedbythegrouplistedinthe leftmost\ncolumn. i.e. Adjusting by race holds age and gender groups constant.\n5.3 Putting it All Together\nTo return to our original question: what are the economic gains from equity, our final experiment closes all\ngaps: those in labor inputs, determinants of productivity, and returns on those determinants. The results are\nreported in Table 6.\nThe bottom line from our analysis is that the U.S. economy would have had about 2.6 trillion 2019\ndollars more output in 2019 if gaps in labor market opportunities and returns were eliminated. The table\nalso shows that the gains to eliminating gaps have been rising over time as the U.S. population becomes\nmore racially diverse while disparities remain.\nAdding the costs up over the length of the sample, we estimate the gains to equalizing labor market\nopportunities is 34.4 trillion 2019 dollars. If we equalize labor market opportunities and returns we estimate\ngains of 70.8 trillion 2019 dollars. This is similar in magnitude to findings by Truehaft, Scoggins, and Tran\n[12] who estimate that raising the average incomes in 2012 of people in each major racial/ethnic group to\nthe average incomes of non-Hispanic whites would generate an additional $2.1 trillion in GDP annually, and\nPeterson and Mann [10] who estimate that closing black-white gaps in wages, housing, higher education, and\nbusiness investment would have added $16 trillion to GDP over the past twenty years.\n17\n\nShares ($Trillions) Returns ($Trillions) Total ($Trillions)\n1990 2000 2010 2019 1990 2000 2010 2019 1990 2000 2010 2019\nActual 4.07 5.54 5.97 6.97 4.07 5.54 5.97 6.97 4.07 5.54 5.97 6.97\nAdj by Race 4.24 5.79 6.39 7.43 4.24 5.81 6.27 7.36 4.41 6.06 6.68 7.82\nGain by Race 0.17 0.25 0.42 0.46 0.17 0.27 0.30 0.38 0.33 0.52 0.71 0.84\nAdj by Gender 4.81 6.34 6.68 7.80 4.73 6.35 6.71 7.82 5.48 7.15 7.42 8.65\nGain by Gender 0.74 0.81 0.71 0.83 0.66 0.81 0.74 0.84 1.40 1.62 1.45 1.67\nAdj by Race Gender 5.01 6.63 7.12 8.24 5.00 6.75 7.15 8.33 5.94 7.84 8.30 9.60\nGain by Race Gender 0.94 1.09 1.15 1.27 0.93 1.21 1.18 1.36 1.87 2.30 2.33 2.62\nBlack only:\nAdj by Race 4.15 5.64 6.12 7.13 4.15 5.65 6.09 7.13 4.23 5.75 6.25 7.29\nGain by Race 0.08 0.10 0.15 0.15 0.08 0.11 0.12 0.16 0.16 0.21 0.28 0.31\nAdj by Race Gender 4.22 5.72 6.19 7.20 4.26 5.77 6.23 7.28 4.41 5.96 6.44 7.51\nGain by Race Gender 0.15 0.19 0.22 0.23 0.18 0.24 0.26 0.31 0.33 0.42 0.47 0.54\nTable 6: Labor Output Adjusted by All Terms: Changing Shares and Returns\nNote: Alladjustmentsusegranularage/gender/racegroupsandareshiftedbythegrouplistedinthe leftmost\ncolumn. i.e. Adjusting by race holds age and gender groups constant.\nIn addition to output loss from 1990 - 2019, it is important to consider future gains if opportunity\ngaps along race and gender were closed. We first calculate what actual labor output would be in 2029 if no\nimprovements were made in closing race and gender gaps. We do so by first using Census Bureau population\nprojections for 2029 [35], and then extending the trend of the combined education utilization and allocation\nshares and average hourly earning by education from 1990 to 2019, for each age/gender/race group. We hold\nemployment to population ratios and hours constant as these are both acyclical. Using these projected inputs\nand the same methodology as that used for our main sample, we calculate actual labor output in 2029. With\nthis we predict labor output would be 7.65 trillion 2019 dollars in 2029. If we were to match shares, this\nwould increase labor output to 9.12 trillion 2019 dollars. Last, if we match shares and returns, this would\nincrease labor output to 10.77 trillion 2019 dollars. We find that the slope of output when only shifting by\nshares is greater from 2019 to 2029 than that of output when shifting by shares and returns, pointing to\npotential larger future gains from shares as compared to returns.\n18\n\n6 Conclusion\nThe opportunity to participate in the economy and to succeed based on ability and effort is at the foundation\nof our nation and our economy. Unfortunately, structural barriers and embedded inequities in policies and\npractices have persistently disrupted this narrative for many Americans.\nWe have shown that the resulting disparities in economic opportunity constrain our national economic\noutputandleavethetalentsofmillionsofAmericansunderutilizedoronthesidelinesalltogether.

Introduction\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) is a nationwide federal assistance program for aged, blind,\nand disabled individuals with low incomes. SSI was enacted in 1972 and began paying benefits in 1974,\nreplacing a patchwork of state-run programs entitlement programs created under the Social Security Act\nof 1935 and its Amendments in 1950. SSI began as a relatively small program providing benefits to a\nlargely elderly population. Since that time SSI has grown to become the largest federal means-tested\ncash assistance program in the U.S., with a caseload dominated by children and working-age adults with\ndisabilities. In 1999, an average of 6.3 million people—the vast majority under age 65—received SSI\nbenefits and federal and state expenditures totaled $34 billion.\nRapid program growth and the changing composition of SSI beneficiaries, as well as recent\nefforts to devolve fiscal and administrative responsibility for social programs from the federal to the state\ngovernments and to integrate a variety of traditional “non-workers” into the labor market all have raised\nquestions about the role that SSI plays in the broader United States social welfare system. The\nestablishment of SSI was the culmination of a four-year debate over a more overarching welfare reform\nproposal—the Family Assistance Plan (FAP)—intended to extend the federal social safety net to all low\nincome Americans. While Congress eventually rejected the universality of FAP, it passed SSI, a\ncategorical welfare program based on the same negative income tax principles as FAP but targeted on a\nsubset of low-income individuals not expected to work—the aged, blind, and disabled.\nSSI passed when FAP did not largely because Congress believed that providing guaranteed income\nassistance to individuals not expected to work was likely to have a much smaller negative impact on\nwork than a universal negative income tax program.\nIn 1972, those not expected to work included individuals aged 65 and older, the blind, and people\nwith disabilities. While these categories were always somewhat arbitrary and difficult to establish and\n-1-\n\nassess—particularly with regard to disability—since 1972, social expectations regarding who should\nwork and who should be entitled to income transfers have changed dramatically. These changes have\nrenewed the debate over what populations a program like SSI should serve. On the one hand, individuals\nare living and working longer and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has granted people with\ndisabilities a legal right to equal access to employment, suggesting that the aged, blind, and disabled may\nbe better able to work than in the past. On the other hand, the normal retirement age for Social Security\nbenefits is increasing, welfare reforms have placed limits on the number of years single mothers with\nchildren may receive benefits in lieu of working, and poverty rates among children remain high despite a\nlong and robust economic expansion, suggesting that income maintenance programs like SSI will remain\nan important component of the social safety net. All these factors will impact on the politically\ndetermined boundaries of the only remaining federal cash-based means-tested entitlement program\nwithout time limits available to both adults and children.\nIn this chapter we provide the basic information necessary for SSI policy makers to make\ninformed choices about its future. We present a description of SSI, discuss the original rationale for the\nprogram and examine the cultural and political factors that have affected its mission over time. We then\nsummarize the economic issues raised by the existence and structure of the program, review the empirical\nevidence on the behavioral effects of SSI, and discuss current policy issues and areas of future research.\nIn Section II we review the program’s history and describe the structure and evolution of program rules.\nIn Section III we provide expenditure, caseload, and program recipient statistics. In Section IV, we\nsummarize the primary economic issues related to the SSI program, and in Section V we review the\nempirical evidence regarding these issues. In Section VI we discuss current policy issues surrounding\nSSI and discuss likely future policy concerns. We summarize our findings in Section VII.\n-2-\n\nII. History and Structure of the SSI Program\nThe Supplemental Security Income program is a nationwide Federal assistance program\nadministered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which pays cash benefits to low-income\nindividuals who are 65 years of age or older or who are blind or disabled. SSI was enacted in 1972 and\nbegan paying benefits in 1974 replacing the state Old-Age Assistance, Aid to the Permanently and\nTotally Disabled, and Aid to the Blind Programs created by the Social Security Act of 1935 and its\namendments in 1950. In this section we review the history of the SSI program, describe current program\nstructure, eligibility criteria, and benefit levels, and discuss how the program’s goals and rules have\nevolved over time.\nOriginal Rationale and Program Goals\nThe establishment of a federal income maintenance program for the aged, blind, and\ndisabled—SSI—was the culmination of a four-year debate that began with a more overarching welfare\nreform proposal—the Family Assistance Plan (FAP)—proposed by President Nixon on August 8, 1969.1\nFAP was the first serious attempt to institute a federal negative income tax program equivalent to those\nproposed by Stigler (1946), Friedman (1962, 1968), and Tobin (1968). FAP departed from existing\nwelfare policy in three important ways: (1) it was universal rather than categorical, with low income and\nassets as the only eligibility criteria; (2) it was run through the federal tax system rather than\nadministered by state and local governments; and (3) it had a low benefit reduction rate, in keeping with\nthe notion that low tax rates provide desirable work incentives.2\n1See Burke and Burke (1974) and Smeeding (1994) for a more detailed historical discussion of\nhow SSI became the nation’s first negative income tax program.\n2The key features of most NIT proposals are universality, federal benefit administration, and low\nbenefit reduction rates. For a fuller discussion of the origins of NIT policy see Burkhauser and Finegan\n(1989, 1993).\n-3-\n\nCongress eventually rejected the idea of an income maintenance program for all Americans with\nlow income, but on October 17, 1972 created the Supplemental Security Income program, a categorical\nwelfare program targeted on the subset of the poor who were aged, blind, or disabled. SSI passed when\nFAP did not largely because Congress believed that providing income assistance to needy individuals not\nexpected to work was likely to have a much smaller negative impact on employment than a universal\nnegative income tax program. In 1972, those not expected to work included individuals age 65 and older,\nthe blind, and people with disabilities, subgroups of the population that already were targets of state-\nbased assistance programs.\nIn keeping with some of the themes of FAP, the new SSI program federalized benefit\nadministration, set minimum benefit standards, imposed uniform eligibility criteria, and set low benefit\nreduction rates on labor earnings. Legislative records suggest that SSI was intended to reduce variability\nin the types of individuals allowed onto the rolls and in the amount of assistance they received, to make\neconomic resources the only determinant of eligibility for those meeting the categorical requirements,\nand to provide beneficiaries incentives to work to supplement their income and move towards\nrehabilitation (U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, 1971).3,4 Thus, under SSI, Congress\nfederalized benefit administration, set minimum benefit standards, imposed uniform eligibility criteria,\nand set relatively low benefit reduction rates on labor earnings. In addition to adopting some of the\nadministrative mechanisms of FAP, the SSI program began to blur the traditional ability-to-work\nstandard for determining who should be entitled to public welfare payments. By extending SSI benefits\n3Most legislative models of the NIT, including FAP and SSI, impose both an income and asset\ntest. Throughout this chapter we refer to income and assets as economic resources.\n4Under the former state-run programs the amount of assistance could vary from recipient to\nrecipient according to an individual’s assessed needs, age, and living situation.\n-4-\n\nto the needy families of children with disabilities, Congress expanded the social safety net to include\nfamilies headed by adults who were “employable”.5,6\nAlthough the goals of the SSI disability program have not changed since its inception in 1974, its\nstructure has been subject to numerous legislative, administrative, and court actions. Table 1 provides a\nhistory of the major federal SSI legislation. These actions primarily have focused on making the\ndisability criteria more target effective and on enhancing incentives aimed at returning recipients to the\nworkforce. For the child disability component of the program, changes have focused on providing an\nappropriate vocational criteria for children that does not unduly discourage rehabilitation and school\nsuccess. Notably, there have been few changes to the means test criteria and no adjustment for inflation\nin these criteria, meaning that over time, the income threshold for eligibility has fallen in real terms.\nFinally, other legislative efforts have centered on limiting the eligibility of non-citizens. The legislative\nhistory of SSI shows that the primary mechanisms used by policymakers to alter the coverage and the\ngenerosity of SSI have been changes in the categorical eligibility criteria, rather than changes in the size\nof SSI benefits.\nSSI Eligibility Criteria\nSSI eligibility is a function of three program-based categorical criteria–age, disability, or\nblindness—as well as more general requirements associated with income and asset limits, and citizenship\nand residency rules. Figure 1 provides a summary of the application process for SSI benefits. Citizens\nand residents qualifying for SSI on categorical grounds are next required to meet the income and asset\ntests. Qualifying individuals who do not meet the means test may maintain their categorical eligibility\n5Poor children with disabilities had previously been included in state AFDC programs.\n6A final category of people allowed onto the SSI rolls, despite their potential to find alternative\nprivate support, were noncitizens. By law, legal immigrants had to show income sponsorship before\nimmigrating to the United States. Largely due to the definition of income in the SSI means test, the 1972\nlegislation allowed sponsored immigrants who were poor to apply for SSI. This primarily affected the\nSSI aged program.\n-5-\n\nfor up to 12 months. The Social Security Administration is responsible for screening applicants and\nmaking awards for SSI. Table 2 lists the criteria used to determine eligibility for SSI benefits in 1999.\nCategorical Eligibility Criteria. Individuals with limited income and assets may qualify for SSI\nbenefits based on three categorical criteria: age, blindness, or disability. Applicants need only meet one\nof the three criteria, although some applicants fit multiple categories. The categorical program\nrequirements for the aged and the blind are straightforward. Individuals are categorically eligible for SSI\nbased on age if they are age 65 or older. Individuals may receive SSI benefits for the blind if they have\n20/200 vision or less with the use of a correcting lens in their better eye, or if they have tunnel vision of\n20 degrees or less. These objective standards make for relatively easy and uniform screening of aged and\nblind SSI applicants at offices of the Social Security Administration across the United States.7\nIn contrast, the disability screening process is more complex. First, there is no simple definition\nof disability.8 The most common measures of disability in the economics literature are built on a\nmethodology developed by Nagi (1965, 1969a,b, 1991) that distinguishes three components of disability.\nThe first component is the presence of a pathology—a physical or mental malfunction, or the interruption\nof a normal process, or both. This leads to a second component, an impairment, which Nagi defines as a\nphysiological, anatomical, or mental loss or abnormality that limits a person’s capacity and level of\nfunction. The final component of disability is defined as an inability to perform, or a limitation in\n7Although the measurement of these “objective standards” is relatively straightforward, the\njustification for using them as standards for “inability to work” is less so. A literature exists which\nargues that categorical age is not a useful measure of ability to work. A parallel literature exists which\nsuggests that functional ability rather than medical conditions are superior criteria for determining\n“ability to work” (Library of Congress 1998; National Research Council 2000).\n8Mashaw and Reno (1996) argue that the appropriateness of any definition of disability depends\non the purpose for which it is used. They document over 20 definitions of disability used for purposes of\nentitlement to public or private income transfers, government services, or statistical analysis. In the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment\nthat substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being\nregarded as having such an impairment. LaPlante (1991) provides a useful discussion of alternative\ndefinitions that can be used to estimate this population.\n-6-\n\nperforming, socially expected roles and tasks. For men and, increasingly, for women of working age,\nmarket work is a socially expected role. Hence, those who are unable to perform or are limited in their\nability to work are considered disabled.\nThe disability determination process for SSI incorporates some of the reasoning put forth in\nNagi’s disability definition. Applicants for disability benefits move through a multi-step process in\nwhich their pathology, impairment, and level of functioning are judged. Applicants thought to be unable\nto engage in any substantial work become eligible for benefits. Below we describe the process of\ndisability determination for both adults and children applying for SSI disability benefits.\nLike the aged and blind, persons seeking disability benefits also apply at an office of the Social\nSecurity Administration. Once the federal officials and the applicant have gathered sufficient\ninformation to complete the application, it is submitted to a state agency for determination of disability.\nState disability examiners, working with vocational and medical consultants, act as the primary\ngatekeepers of both SSI and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).9 Disability decisions are made\nby state agencies, acting under contract to the federal government. Therefore, although disability\neligibility criteria are uniform across the country, the interpretation of these criteria, and hence the\ndisability determination process itself, can and does systematically vary from state to state and over time.\nTable 3 shows differences in mean allowance rates (initial acceptances to initial applications), by state\nbetween 1974 and 1993. As the table indicates, mean allowance rates vary considerably across states,\nranging from lows of 28 in Louisiana and New Mexico to highs of 48 in Delaware, New Jersey, and\nRhode Island.\n9SSDI is a social insurance program that provides payments to individuals who have paid social\nsecurity taxes for the appropriate number of quarters and who are judged to be disabled under the SSA\nguidelines. Unlike SSI it is not means-tested. However, it does have restrictions on labor earnings\nconsistent with its criteria for disability eligibility. See Bound and Burkhauser (1999) for a fuller\ndiscussion of this program from an economic perspective.\n-7-\n\nDisability Screening for Adults. SSA defines adult disability as the inability to engage in\nsubstantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is\nexpected to result in death or last at least 12 months. Applicants must be unable to do any work that\nexists in the national economy for which they are qualified by virtue of age, education, and work\nexperience. The United States does not award federal disability benefits for partial disability.10\nAs a practical matter, SSA asks the state disability determination offices to follow a five-step\nprocedure in their initial disability determination.11 First, the examiners check to see if applicants are\ncurrently working and making more than the “substantial gainful activity” (SGA) amount—$700 a month\nin 1999. If so, their application is denied. As can be seen in Figure 2, almost no cases are rejected in this\nmanner, since presumably the SSA field offices have already checked to see if applicants are working\nbefore they send applications to the disability determination office.12 Second, the state disability\nexaminers determine if the applicant has a severe impairment that is expected to last 12 months or result\nin death. If not, the application is denied. About 26 (18 + 8) percent of all applicants were denied at this\nstep in 1994. Third, the state disability examiners look to see if the impairment meets the medical\nlistings. If the impairment is listed, applicants pass the categorical screening for disability. If the\nimpairment is judged to be equivalent to one of the medical listings then applicants also meet the\ncategorical requirement for benefits. Most recipients who pass the disability screening do so at this stage\n10However, as will be shown later, in some instances the SSI program allows individuals with\ndisabilities to exceed the earnings limit and continue to receive SSI benefits, making it a type of partial\ndisability insurance. Most other western industrialized countries provide partial disability benefits to\ntheir working-age populations. For a discussion of disability program rules in other western\nindustrialized nations see Aarts, Burkhauser, and DeJong (1996).\n11Our discussion of the adult disability determination process draws heavily on Bound and\nBurkhauser (1999).\n12The percentages denied in Figure 2 are based on outcomes from initial SSDI applications, the\ndata available from published sources. However, there is no reason to believe that the patterns for SSI\nwould be significantly different.\n-8-\n\nbecause their impairment either “meets” or “equals” one on the medical listing (21 percent of all\napplicants were approved at this step in 1994).\nFourth, if a decision cannot be reached on medical factors alone, applicants are evaluated in\nterms of residual functional capacity. If they are found to be able to meet the demands of “past relevant\nwork” their claim is denied (20 percent of all applicants were denied at this step in 1994). If individuals\nare deemed unable to do past relevant work, examiners determine if the impairment prevents the\napplicant from doing any other work. Here vocational factors are considered. If, for example,\napplicants’ maximum sustained work capacity is limited to sedentary work and they are at least age 50 to\n54, with less than a high school education and no skilled work experience, then they would be considered\ndisabled and pass the categorical screening. In contrast, if applicants’ previous employment experience\nincludes skilled work, then they would not receive benefits. At this stage, 11 percent of all applicants\nwere determined eligible for benefits and 22 percent were denied benefits in 1994.\nApplicants who are denied benefits can ask for a reconsideration. Their file will then be\nreviewed by a second team of examiners. If they are rejected after reconsideration, individuals may\nappeal the case to an administrative law judge. It is at this stage that applicants will for the first time\ncome face-to-face with a gatekeeper. Individuals denied benefits at this stage may appeal the decision to\nthe Social Security Appeals Council and then to the District Courts. A substantial minority of appealed\nclaims get past the initial hearing (33 percent in 1996), with a smaller portion getting as far as an\nadministrative law judge (23 percent in 1995) (U.S. House of Representatives 1998).13 For the claimants\nwho are either allowed benefits at the initial level or who don’t appeal, the application and decision\nprocess usually takes a few months. For those who appeal to the administrative law judge, the process\ncan take a year or more.\n13There is some evidence that the proportion of claimants who appeal and the proportion of\ndecisions that get reversed rise and fall with the percentage of initial denials (Lando, Cutler, and Gamber\n1982).\n-9-\n\nDisability Screening for Children. Screening children for disability eligibility has proven to be\nmore complex and contentious than adult disability screening. When the SSI program was originally\nconsidered, Congress recognized the potential difficulties of applying the standard SSA disability\ndefinition to children. Thus, under the original legislation, Congress wrote that a child should be\nconsidered disabled if “he suffers from any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of\ncomparable severity” to a disabling impairment in an adult (SSA 1997). In practice, children originally\nqualified for SSI if they had “a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which results in\nmarked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death, or which has\nlasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.” Between 1974 and\n1989 the child disability determination process did not include a functional assessment or take into\naccount the equivalent of adult vocational factors. See Figure 3 for a comparison of the child and adult\ninitial disability determination process.\nThis changed in 1990, when the Supreme Court decided the case of Sullivan vs. Zebley. The\nCourt ruled that in order to meet the standard of equal treatment, a functional limitation component\nparallel to that of adults must be included in the initial disability determination process for children. In\nresponse, SSA added two new bases for finding children eligible for benefits: (1) functional equivalence,\nwhich was set at the medical listing level of the disability determination process; and (2) an individual\nfunctional assessment (IFA), which was designed to be parallel with the functional and vocational\nassessment provided for adults. By allowing applicants who did not meet the medical listing to be found\ndisabled if their impairments were severe enough to limit their ability to engage in age-appropriate\nactivities, such as attending school, the IFA lowered the level of severity required for children to be\neligible for SSI benefits (GAO 1994, 1995).\nIn 1996, as part of welfare reform, Congress modified the definition of disability for children.\nLegislators replaced the comparable severity (to adults) criteria with a definition of disability that is\n-10-\n\nunique to children. Under the new definition, a child’s impairment—or combination of\nimpairments—are considered disabling only if it (they) results in marked and severe functional\nlimitations, is expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last at least 12 months (SSA\n1996).” The new focus on assessing the severity of impairments among children was reflected in\nchanges in the evaluation process. The legislation removed the IFA, replacing it with a criterion based\non functional equivalence or evaluations of the extent to which impairments create medical listing-level\nseverity. The revised rules defined medical listing-level severity for functional limitations as: (1)\nmarked limitations in two broad areas of functioning, such as social functioning or personal functioning;\nor (2) extreme limitations in one area of functioning, such as inability to walk (SSA 1997). In practice\nthese changes meant that although functional limitations continued to include behavior-related\nlimitations, they no longer covered the same breadth of functioning included in the IFA. For example,\nCongress specifically removed maladaptive behavior disorder from the functional listing criteria. Thus,\nthe post-1996 standard represents a broader measure of disability than originally applied to children, but\na narrower standard than the one used between 1990 and 1996 (see Figure 3).\nEconomic Resources Criteria. In addition to the categorical requirements—aged, blind, or\ndisabled—applicants must also satisfy income and resource tests. To be eligible for SSI, an individual’s\ncountable income must be less than the federal benefit rate (FBR)—$500 per month ($6,000 per year) in\n1999—and countable resources must be less than $2,000.14 For couples, the amounts are 150 percent of\nthe individual limits: countable monthly income of $751 per month ($9,012 per year) and $3,000 in\nresources. Not all income received by individuals or couples is countable. Exclusions include a $20\nmonthly income disregard for all forms of income with the exception of means-tested income and an\n14The SGA and the means-test values for SSI eligibility may differ. The SGA limits are set\noccasionally, while the SSI FBR changes yearly with the CPI.\n-11-\n\nadditional $65 monthly disregard for any labor income.15 After these disregards, for every $1 in labor\nearnings a worker loses $0.50 in SSI benefits. Therefore, after all income disregards, an SSI recipient\nfaces a 50 percent implicit tax on labor earnings.16 In-kind assistance from government programs like\nFood Stamps and public housing are not counted as income against the individual’s overall SSI benefit.\nAll other benefits from government programs are taxed at 100 percent. Countable resources include\nresources other than the home a person lives in, a car (depending on use or value), and limited amounts\nof life insurance and burial funds.17 In cases where an eligible individual resides in a household with\nineligible individuals, a portion of the other person’s income is considered when determining the amount\nof the SSI payment. This process, known as “deeming,” applies to married couples with one eligible\nmember, parents of child applicants, and U.S. sponsors of noncitizen applicants. The deeming rules are\nstraightforward; if an individual or couple is living in another person’s household and is receiving both\nfood and shelter from the person in the household, the federal benefit rate is reduced by one-third.\nAlthough the federal benefit rate—and thus, the monthly income test—rise with inflation each\nyear, the monthly income disregards, the asset limits, and the value of allowable assets (e.g., car,\nhousehold effects) are not indexed, and thus have fallen substantially in real terms since SSI began. The\nreal decline in the income disregards and asset limits over time effectively has eroded the value of SSI\nbenefits and narrowed the population of potential recipients relative to 1974 levels. Consider first the\ndisregards of $20 on all income and $65 on labor income set in 1972. Valued in 1999 dollars, these\ndisregards would be $80 and $259, respectively. Adjusting the asset limits for inflation discloses the\n15In certain cases, impairment-related expenses may be deducted from this total. Also, income is\ndisregarded when it is used for Plans for Achieving Self Support (PASS).\n16As we will discuss below, for those SSI beneficiaries receiving other means-tested program\nbenefits the effective marginal tax on work can be much higher.\n17In 1999, the dollar value on disregards on assets include up to $4,500 for a car or medical\ntreatment, life insurance valued at less than $1,500, and personal property and household furnishings\nvalued at less than $2,000.\n-12-\n\nsame pattern. Valued in 1999 dollars, asset limits would be $5,978 for an individual, and $8,968 for a\ncouple, compared to the $2,000 and $3,000 limits currently in place. Thus, compared to when it began in\n1972, SSI now covers a narrower and less economically advantaged portion of the income distribution.\nOther Eligibility Criteria. In addition to meeting one of the three categorical requirements and\nthe economic resource criteria, individuals also must meet residency and citizenship requirements. To be\neligible for SSI an individual must be a resident of the United States and a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national,\nor a “qualified alien” in an SSI-eligible noncitizen category.18 The current SSI-eligible noncitizen\ncategories generally can be characterized as covering individuals who were lawfully in the United States\nas of August 22, 1996, individuals who are refugees or in refugee-like situations, and individuals who\nhave contributed to the country either by service in the military or through extended periods of work.\nLike the disability criteria for children, the relatively restrictive allowances for noncitizens were\nimplemented under 1996 welfare reform (PRWORA), and were a direct response to concerns that newly\narrived noncitizens with immigration sponsors were increasingly applying for, and receiving, SSI\nbenefits. The SSI provisions in the 1996 welfare reform act generally excluded these individuals from\nreceiving SSI by mandating that the income of the noncitizen’s immigration sponsor be considered in the\nmeans test.\nSSI Benefits\nFederal Benefit Levels. In general, SSI beneficiaries with no countable income receive the\nmaximum monthly federal benefit rate (FBR), $500 in 1999 ($751 for jointly eligible couples). The FBR\nis adjusted automatically each January by the cost-of-living index used to adjust all Social Security\n(OASDI) benefits. Although the original objective of the SSI program was to guarantee an income at the\npoverty level, from the beginning, the federal minimum SSI benefit was set below the official Bureau of\n18The term qualified alien is defined in section 431 of P.L. 104-193, as amended by P.L. 104-208\nand P.L. 105-33. See Parrot, Kennedy, and Scott (1998) for a complete listing of the qualifying criteria.\n-13-\n\nthe Census poverty line. Excluding state supplementation, SSI payments represent about 75 percent of\nthe poverty threshold for an eligible individual, and about 90 percent of the threshold for an eligible\ncouple; these percentages have remained relatively constant over time (U.S. House of Representatives\n1998).19\nSSI recipients are required by law to apply for every government program for which they may be\neligible. In most states, recipients receive state supplemental payments and become eligible for Medicaid\nand Food Stamps without making a separate application.20,21 Since 1986 SSI benefits and eligibility for\nMedicaid have been continued for those who earn above the SGA; this is known as 1619(b) status.22 In\ngeneral, the special eligibility test for Medicaid applies if the individual has earnings over the level that\noffsets their SSI benefits, but is still lower than a threshold amount established in the state in which they\nreside.23 Adult SSI recipients with disabilities also are eligible for federally-funded, state-administered\nvocational rehabilitation.24\n19This difference arises in part because the SSI program and the U.S. poverty thresholds assume\ndifferent economies of scale. The SSI program assumes that a single person needs 67 percent of the\ncouple benefit to be equally well off; the U.S. poverty threshold assumes that a single person needs 80\npercent of the couple benefit to maintain an equivalent standard of living.\n20We discuss states’ latitude in determining Medicaid eligibility for SSI recipients later in this\nsection.\n21In most cases, individuals who are eligible for SSI are categorically eligible for Food Stamps.\nThe exceptions to this general rule are SSI beneficiaries living in households where other members do\nnot receive and are not applying for SSI. These individuals must apply for Food Stamps at the local food\nstamp office and meet the household income test to obtain food stamp eligibility.\n22In 1995, only about 46,000 (1.3 percent) of the 3.5 million SSI disability recipients were in\n1619(b) status (Mashaw and Reno 1996).\n23In making this determination, the SSA takes the average expenditures on Medicaid and SSI\n(including state SSI) and compares this amount to an individual’s earnings.\n24The Ticket to Work/Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 expanded the eligible pool of\nvocational rehabilitation providers available to disabled SSI recipients, by allowing beneficiaries to\nreceive vocational rehabilitation services from not-for-profit and for-profit vendors.\n-14-\n\nState Supplementation. There are two types of state supplementation in SSI: mandatory and\noptional (see Table 4).25 Under mandatory supplementation, states whose Old-Age Assistance and Aid to\nthe Permanently and Totally Disabled benefits were greater than the federal minimum had to make up the\ndifference in mandatory state supplements.26 All but a few states were subject to mandatory\nsupplementation requirements in 1972 (column 1, Table 4).27 States offering supplements can follow the\nsame rules as the federal SSI program and have the program administered by SSA, or they can administer\ntheir own program and use a state-specific eligibility criteria.28 In 1999, 43 states and the District of\nColumbia provided optional supplemental benefits (column 2, Table 4).\nAlthough a majority of states have optional supplementation programs, a number of factors\nminimize the importance of these programs. First, only 23 states provide supplements to the vast\nmajority of SSI recipients living independently in their own households (column 3, Table 4).29 In the\nremaining states with optional programs, supplements are paid only to the minority of SSI recipients\nliving in institutions (column 4, Table 4).30 Second, because state supplements are not annually adjusted\n25For a detailed description of state supplementation see Ponce (1996).\n26Mandatory state supplements applied to individuals receiving benefits in December 1973.\n27Since mandatory supplementation applied only to individuals receiving benefits under pre-SSI\nprograms, the prevalence of such payments has declined over time. In December 1996, approximately\n2,800 recipients or less than 0.1 percent of all recipients were still receiving payments based on the\nmandatory supplementation rule (U.S. House of Representatives 1998).\n28Despite the apparent cost-advantage to federal administration, states have increasingly opted\nfor state administration of supplemental payments. Since 1974, seven states have shifted from federal to\nstate administration (U.S. House of Representatives 1998). In 1999, 15 states and the District of\nColumbia currently contract with SSA to administer their SSI supplementation programs\n29Over 90 percent of SSI recipients live in their own households (U.S. House of Representatives\n1998).\n30One explanation for the ongoing supplementation of SSI recipients living in institutions is that\nsupplementary SSI payments provide states with a mechanism of supporting such facilities.\n-15-\n\nfor inflation, the real value of the median state supplemental payment to individuals living independently\ndeclined by about 60 percent between 1975 and 1997.31\nIn addition to supplementing federal SSI payments, states also have latitude in determining\nMedicaid eligibility for SSI recipients (see columns 5-7, Table 4). States may elect among three options:\n(1) have SSA automatically grant SSI recipients Medicaid eligibility without separate application; (2)\nprovide Medicaid eligibility for all SSI recipients, but only if the recipient completes a separate\napplication with the state agency that administers the Medicaid program; or (3) impose Medicaid\neligibility criteria more restrictive than the federal SSI criteria, known as the “209(b) option.”32\nAdministration and Financing\nAs a federal income maintenance program, SSI is funded from general revenues and is\nadministered by the Social Security Administration. Although, as discussed earlier, many states\nsupplement federal benefit levels, over time the share of supplemental benefits paid by states has\ndeclined. In 1975, state SSI expenditures accounted for approximately 27 percent of total SSI payments.\nIn 1998, state supplemental payments amounted to about 13 percent of annual SSI expenditures (SSA\n1999).33 Because the Federal government pays for the bulk of SSI benefits (100 percent in some states),\nwhile states pay for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (previously AFDC) states have an\nincentive to move individuals from state-financed welfare programs to federally funded SSI. This\nfiscally-based incentive may, in part, explain the active role state welfare agencies play in SSI outreach\nprograms.\n31Over time some states have even reduced the nominal value of supplemental payments.\n32The criteria applied cannot be more restrictive than the state’s approved Medicaid state plan in\nJanuary 1972.\n33The numbers reported reflect the average for all states. Looking across states, in January 1999,\nthe federal share of the maximum SSI benefit ranged from 58 percent in Alaska and 74 percent in\nCalifornia to 100 percent in the eight jurisdictions without a supplemental program (CRS 1999).\n-16-\n\nIII. Program Statistics\nTrends in Expenditures, Caseloads, and Benefits\nThe SSI program has grown substantially in both recipients and expenditures since it first paid\nbenefits in 1974. However, its growth has varied over time (Figure 4). Between 1974 and 1982,\ncaseloads fell by 4.5 percent and real federal expenditures declined by about 15 percent. This decline\ncaused concern among policymakers that too few potentially eligible recipients were enrolling (Menefee,\nEdwards, and Schieber 1981). After this slow start, the number of SSI beneficiaries increased steadily\nuntil 1996, growing from roughly 3.9 million in 1982 to 6.6 million in 1996, a 70 percent increase.\nFederal payments for the program rose even faster during this period with the greatest growth between\n1989 and 1992. Valued in 1998 dollars, total annual payments increased from $15.3 billion in 1982 to\n$29.9 billion in 1996, an increase of about 95 percent. Between 1996 and 1998 (the last year of data\navailable) caseloads have fallen slightly and expenditures have risen by less than 2 percent. Despite\ngrowth in SSI over time, SSI expenditures as a percentage of total federal outlays have remained\nrelatively stable at 1.9 percent since the program began in 1974.\nTrends in Characteristics of Recipients\nOriginally considered a program for the elderly, SSI is now dominated by adults and children\nwith disabilities. Figure 5 shows the age composition of SSI beneficiaries between 1974 and 1998. In\n1974, the majority of the SSI caseload was over the age of 65. The number of aged beneficiaries peaked\nat 2.5 million in 1975, gradually dropped to around 2 million in 1982, and remained at about that level to\n1998. In contrast, the number of blind and disabled adults (aged 18-64) on SSI has more than doubled\nsince 1974, with the most rapid growth occurring after 1982.34 In December 1998, 3.6 million adults\nreceived SSI benefits, nearly 2 million more than in 1982. The number of blind and disabled recipients\n34This growth is almost entirely due to increases in the number of disabled beneficiaries. The\nnumber of working-age SSI recipients eligible due to blindness has remained relatively constant over\ntime (Annual Statistical Supplement, SSA, various years).\n-17-\n\nwho are under age 18 also has grown rapidly in recent years.35 Between 1974 and 1989 the child\ncaseload increased to about 185,000. Following the Zebley decision in 1990, the number of blind and\ndisabled children rose rapidly, reaching 955,000 by 1996. Since then, child SSI rolls have declined\nslightly, falling to 887,000 in 1998. Hence, although blind and disabled adults and children comprised\nonly 40 percent of the SSI population in 1974, their share in the SSI population had grown to 70 percent\nby 1998.\nAs the basis for eligibility and the age composition of SSI recipients have changed, so have a\nnumber of other key demographic characteristics. Table 5 reports on trends in a number of recipient\ncharacteristics from 1974 to 1996. The first section of the table shows the gender, racial, and citizenship\ncomposition of all SSI recipients. Since 1975, the proportion of males and non-whites has increased. In\n1976, more than two-thirds of SSI recipients were female and about 64 percent were white. In 1996,\nabout 60 percent of SSI recipients were female and the proportion of white recipients had fallen to 52\npercent. Another notable change in the composition of the SSI population has been the rapid increase in\nthe number of noncitizens receiving benefits. In 1982, the first year for which records on citizenship\nwere kept, a little over 3 percent of all SSI recipients were noncitizens. In 1994, two years before\ncitizenship became a requirement for new applicants, about 12 percent of all SSI beneficiaries were\nnoncitizens. This percentage fell slightly once the citizenship restrictions were imposed, but noncitizen\nbeneficiaries remained a sizeable component of the SSI population—11 percent in 1996.\nThe second section of Table 5 shows trends in the three main qualifying diagnostic\ncategories—physical impairments, mental retardation, and mental impairments other than mental\nretardation—for SSI recipients with disabilities (adults and children) In the early years of the program,\nless than one-quarter of SSI beneficiaries qualified on the basis of mental impairments other than mental\nretardation. Following expansions in the eligibility criteria for mental impairments in both adults and\n35Again the growth is almost entirely explained by increases in the number of disabled children.\n-18-\n\nchildren, the number of adults and children qualifying for SSI on the basis of a mental impairment began\nto grow. As a result, in 1998, more than 30 percent of all SSI recipients qualified on the basis of mental\nimpairments other than mental retardation.\nSSI Participation\nAn important policy concern with respect to all public assistance programs is the degree of\nparticipation among eligible individuals. That is, of the people who meet the categorical, economic\nresource, and citizenship tests, what proportion are receiving SSI benefits. It is relatively straightforward\nto make such calculations for those aged 65 and older and a literature exists on this question.\nUnfortunately, the difficulties of establishing and assessing disability for adults and children not only\nmakes if difficult for policymakers and administrators to accurately determine SSI eligibility for those\nwho apply, but also for researchers to calculate program participation rates that require some estimate of\nthe eligible disabled population that does not apply for benefits. Existing nationally representative data\nsources either lack sufficient information on economic characteristics or health characteristics to generate\nprecise estimates of the population eligible for the disability components of SSI. As a result, there is\nalmost no research on SSI participation rates among the eligible population with disabilities.36\nIn Table 6 we provide a preliminary approximation of “take-up rates” for SSI that we believe is\nuseful in establishing broad trends. We use the official U.S. Bureau of the Census poverty calculations\nand show the share of SSI recipients in age-based poverty populations. This method was used in the\n1998 Green Book for the population aged 65 and older. On the one hand, because our estimates do not\naccount for citizenship, assets, and most especially disability status, they will understate program\nparticipation among those in the poverty population who are eligible. On the other hand, since those\neligible for SSI may have household incomes above the official poverty line, our approximations may\n36It is possible to estimate the population with some level of disability using national data sources\n(see Bound and Burkhauser 1999 for examples). It is much more difficult to isolate the sub-population\nwithin this broader category that would meet the medical listing or vocational criteria for SSI eligibility.\n-19-\n\noverstate program participation among all eligible households. Nonetheless, the trends in Table 6 are\nrevealing of how SSI is being used by low income persons.\nAs the first column of Table 6 shows, the participation rate among the poor elderly declined from\naround 79 percent in 1974 to about 54 percent in 1982. Since then, participation rates have fluctuated\nfrom year to year, but have remained well below the highs recorded in the early years of the program. In\ngeneral, no more than two-thirds of elderly individuals living in poverty receive SSI benefits. More\ncomplete measures of participation suggest that take-up rates among the elderly are lower than the gross\nmeasures indicate. Researchers consistently find the participation rate among persons eligible for SSI\naged benefits at between 45 and 60 percent (Menefee, Edwards, and Schieber 1981; Warlick 1982; Coe\n1985; Shields et al. 1990; McGarry 1996).\nThe remaining columns in Table 6 show SSI participation rates for poor adults age 18-64 and\npoor children. Consistent with the caseload growth highlighted in Figure 5, participation rates among\npoor working age adults and children have risen over time. Participation rates among poor adults rose\nfrom about 15 percent in 1974 to more than 20 percent in 1998, with the most rapid increases occurring\nduring the 1990s. Recipiency rates for poor children also increased rapidly during the 1990s, rising from\n2 percent in 1989 to 6.6 percent in 1998. As column four shows, the prevalence of disability has not\nrisen since 1980 which suggests that the increase in SSI take-up rates among the poor is not a function of\nincreased disability.\nMultiple Program Participation among SSI Beneficiaries\nA large fraction of SSI beneficiaries participate in other government programs. Table 7 shows\nthat in 1995, almost 40 percent of all SSI recipients also received Old Age, Survivors, and Disability\nInsurance (OASDI), either for retirement or disability. All SSI recipients were eligible for Medicaid and\nabout 30 percent were eligible for Medicare. One-half lived in households receiving Food Stamps and\nthree in ten lived in a household receiving Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or reduced price meals.\n-20-\n\nFinally, about one-quarter of SSI recipients lived in public or subsidized housing. Over time, the\npercentage of SSI recipients receiving Social Security and Medicare has been declining, while the\npercentage of recipients receiving Food Stamps, WIC, free or subsidized meals, and public housing has\nbeen rising (U.S. House of Representatives 1998.)\nThe fact that a growing share of SSI recipients receive benefits from multiple means-tested\nprograms suggests that the work incentives faced by the typical beneficiary are increasingly complex.\nSSI beneficiaries face multiple implicit taxes in the form of reduced benefits from SSI and any other\ntransfer programs, plus the regular assortment of federal, state, and local taxes, as well as the loss of\nmedical insurance for those not meeting the 1619(b) provisions. As others have shown, the cumulative\nmarginal tax rates for individuals receiving multiple programs can be quite high (Giannarelli and Steurle\n1994; Keane and Moffitt 1998).\nAlthough the empirical literature on the effects of changes in these various marginal tax rates\nwill be discussed later in this chapter, it is useful to lay out the tax circumstances SSI recipients\npotentially face. Figure 6 (from Burkhauser and Wittenburg 1996) shows how a single male’s 1994 net\nincome changes with each additional dollar of his labor if he is eligible to receive the federal SSI benefit\nof $458 and the average cash value of Medicaid insurance for SSI disability of $540 per month. With no\nlabor earnings, this person would receive $998 per month in SSI benefits and Medicaid insurance.\nAs the figure shows, the interaction of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and federal taxes as\nwell as Food Stamps, which one-half of all SSI beneficiaries receive, significantly alters the marginal tax\nrates faced by recipients with various amounts of labor earnings. The EITC phase-in subsidy to work\noffsets social security (FICA) taxes, but because the food stamp program subtracts 24 cents in Food\nStamps for every dollar of labor earnings, the net tax on the first dollar of labor earnings is 23.85 percent.\nThis tax rate continues to the SSI disregard level of $85 per month. At this point the 50 cent loss in SSI\nbenefits per dollar of labor earnings interacts with the food stamp program taxes on work, resulting in a\n-21-\n\nnet tax of 58.85 percent. When the EITC plateau begins, the net tax on labor earnings rises to 66.5\npercent and when the EITC phase-out tax begins, the net tax on labor earnings rises to 74.15 percent.\nWhen the federal income tax standard deduction level is passed and federal income tax starts, the\nmarginal tax rate rises to 89.15 percent. Marginal tax rates only begin to fall after Food Stamps and\nEITC break-even points are reached. The final increase in tax rates occurs just before SSI benefits phase\nout, when all Medicaid benefits are lost because earned income now equals the Medicaid special\neligibility plateau. The reduction of such cumulatively high marginal tax rates via a single universal\nincome support program was one of the arguments made in support of President Nixon’s original FAP\nprogram.\nIV. Review of Economic Issues\nAlthough economic analysis of social programs frequently takes the goals of the program as\ngiven, with SSI the motivation for the program is itself an important determinant of how we view the\nbehavioral reactions to it. In this section we first discuss the economic rationale behind a federal income\nfloor for the subset of the poor who are aged, blind, or disabled. Next, we review the theory related to\nindividual responses to the existence and structure of SSI including takeup, work, savings, and disability-\nreporting behavior. Finally, we consider the equity goals of SSI and discuss attempts to evaluate\nprogram effectiveness.\nPublic Income Provision for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled\nAs noted earlier, SSI was born out of a failed effort to provide a guaranteed income floor under\nall Americans—FAP. Hence, while the motivation for providing an income floor to the subset of the\nadult poor who are aged, blind, or disabled is primarily distributional, it also rests on a political\ncompromise that offered this entitlement only to categories of individuals not expected to work. While\nthis compromise allowed SSI to pass in 1972, social expectations regarding work have changed over time\nfor the three groups targeted by SSI—the aged, blind, and disabled. Individuals are living and working\n-22-\n\nlonger; the normal retirement age for Social Security benefits has been raised; and the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA) has granted people with disabilities a legal right to equal access to employment.\nAlthough work expectations have risen for the aged, it is people with disabilities who have\nexperienced the largest shift in public attitudes. In 1990, people with disabilities successfully argued that\nunequal access to jobs—rather than an impairment—is the primary barrier to employment opportunities.\nAs a result, people with disabilities gained legal rights to accommodation under Title I of the ADA.\nSome disability advocates even have argued that there is no such thing as a disabled worker; rather, there\nis only a society that does not provide the appropriate accommodations for such individuals. In a world\nof full accommodation, the disability-transfer population should be zero. Such attitudinal changes raise\nbasic questions about how society should treat people with disabilities. Most fundamental of these\nquestions being, should people with disabilities categorically be expected to work or not?\nThese types of cultural changes potentially shift the boundaries of the population not expected to\nwork and hence eligible for a categorical guaranteed income floor based on age or disability. As the\nopportunities for employment and the demand for the productivity of people with disabilities and those\nover age 65 increase, the clear categorical lines drawn between them and other groups with similar\ndifficulties finding work, such as low-skilled or less-educated younger persons, or single mothers facing\nwelfare limits, are increasingly blurred.\nThe original political compromise that made the families of disabled children eligible for SSI\nwas slightly different, and represented a departure from the not expected to work criteria applied to the\naged and to adults with disabilities. Some argued that SSI benefits for disabled children replaced the\nearnings of parents forced to reduce their work effort in order to care for their newly disabled child.\nOthers argued that SSI-children benefits indirectly offset extra disability-related household expenses. In\nboth cases, SSI-children benefits were intended to offset lost income and partially return the family to its\nprevious level of economic well-being. (See NASI 1995 for a fuller discussion of these issues.)\n-23-\n\nSSI and Behavioral Change\nIf the aged and disabled adults are neither able or expected to work, then many of the\ndisincentives discussed in regard to other means-tested transfer programs are irrelevant. In such a world,\ncumulative marginal tax rates could approach 100 percent with no change in work behavior and SSI\ncould provide relatively high income guarantees and still maintain relatively low break-even points (the\nincome level at which a person is no longer eligible for benefits). Moreover, to the degree that age and\nwork disability are clearly defined and immutable categories, differences in the guarantees, time-limits,\nor funding mechanisms for SSI and other programs would have little effect on SSI allowances and\ncaseloads. In such a world SSI program participation is purely a function of the prevalence of health\nlimitations in the low income population. Below we suggest that none of these premises hold with\nrespect to the disability component of SSI. Thus, SSI policymakers must take behavioral changes on the\npart of potential SSI recipients and state and local governments into account when establishing program\neligibility criteria and considering future program rules.\nPropensity to Apply for SSI. Disability is neither a static or precise concept. Responses to the\nonset of health conditions depend not only on the severity of the impairment, but also on the social\nenvironment that people with health impairments face—including the availability of employment, the\navailability of accommodation, rehabilitation and retraining, the presence of legal supports or\nprotections, and the accessibility and generosity of SSI and other government transfer programs. The\npropensity for individuals to apply for SSI benefits depends on the probability the place on their health\nimpairment and vocational circumstances being sufficient to meet the SSI disability eligibility standards\nas well as on their employment potential and the generosity of SSI relative to other forms of public\nassistance. The latter comparison is particularly relevant in light of 1996 welfare reform (PRWORA)\nthat restricts the access to, and generosity of, alternative public assistance programs. If low-income\n-24-\n\nadults have health conditions or have children with health conditions, the relative generosity of SSI to\nother alternatives may induce individuals to apply for benefits.\nProgram Participation and Work Incentives. The economics of program participation and labor\nsupply for individuals potentially eligible for SSI mirrors the analyses of these issues in programs such as\nAFDC and TANF. Thus, to understand the work disincentives embodied in the SSI program, we turn to\nthe framework used for other categorical welfare programs. Moffitt (1983) provides a discussion of the\nbasic economic issues. In these models individuals make choices that depend on the income gained from\nthe program and the costs of participating, including the time and money costs associated with applying\nfor and maintaining eligibility for benefits.\nTo see how this works in the case of SSI, consider the conventional labor-leisure model\ndiagramed in Figure 7.37 Figure 7 compares the budget constraint of an SSI program with a 50 percent\nmarginal tax rate, (t=0.5) and one with a marginal tax rate of 100 percent (t=1.0). Segment ACDE of the\nfigure represents the budget constraint of those not categorically eligible for SSI. The line has a slope\nequal to the hourly wage rate, w. Segment ABCDE applies to those same individuals if they are\ncategorically eligible and they face a marginal tax rate of 100 percent. Benefits are taxed one dollar for\neach dollar earned and phased out at the break-even level (point C). That is, even though they are\ncategorically eligible for benefits, their labor earnings offset all SSI benefits at hours levels greater than\npoint C. Segment ABDE applies to those same people but now they face a marginal tax rate of 50\npercent. Benefits are taxed at a rate of 50 cents per dollar earned and the break-even hours point is D.\nUnder this model, categorical eligibility for SSI benefits unambiguously reduces work effort relative to\nnot being categorically eligible. There is an income effect associated with the guarantee (AB), and a\nsubstitution effect associated with the marginal tax rate (BC or BD). The income and substitution effects\n37This discussion draws from the expositions in Moffitt (1986), Hoynes and Moffitt (1995), and\nMoffitt’s review of the AFDC/TANF program in this volume. This discussion is made primarily in the\ncontext of adults with disabilities.\n-25-\n\nwork in the same direction, and hours of work among participants fall. Only those whose optimal hours\nworked prior to program eligibility were beyond the break-even hours point may not be affected and even\nthen it will depend on the shape of their indifference curve (i.e., some would be willing to accept less\nincome by substantially reducing work and living on program benefits).\nThe next question to ask is what happens if the marginal tax rate is reduced. Here the\nanswer is unclear; the net effect of a reduction in t, from 100 percent (BC) to 50 percent (BD), is\nambiguous. The arrows in the Figure 7 show the various responses that could occur following a\nreduction in the marginal tax rate (represented by a shift from segment BC to BD). For individuals\ninitially receiving SSI benefits and not working (i.e., initially at point B), a reduction in the tax rate may\nencourage participants to work more, represented by Arrow 1. At the same time, a reduction in t expands\nthe range of individuals eligible for benefits, and brings some portion of those categorically eligible but\nnot previously receiving SSI onto the rolls. As these individuals move onto SSI their work effort is\nreduced, as shown by Arrow 2. Arrow 3 shows that some categorically eligible individuals who continue\nto earn too much under the lower tax rate may be motivated to reduce their hours of work enough to\nbecome eligible for benefits, thereby combining work and SSI benefits. Finally, it also is possible that a\nreduction in t will increase payments by enough to induce previously eligible persons on earnings\ngrounds but not on categorical grounds (segment AC) to risk entry onto the rolls.\nTaking each of these possibilities into account, the net effect of a lower marginal tax rate on\nwork effort is ambiguous. The only thing that is clear is that lower marginal tax rates increase caseloads.\nA lower tax rate makes more categorically eligible individuals eligible for the program on income\ngrounds and, given positive takeup rates, unambiguously boosts the number of individuals on the rolls.\nMoreover, by lowering the costs associated with staying on the rolls, lower marginal tax rates reduce exit\nrates from the program, thereby increasing caseloads. Finally, lower marginal tax rates may induce those\n-26-\n\non the margin of categorical eligibility on health grounds to apply for benefits since the gains to program\nacceptance have increased.\nUnlike SSI benefits for the elderly, where categorical age eligibility is easily demonstrated and\nbenefit receipt is automatic if one meets the means test, categorical eligibility for SSI benefits is more\ndifficult to demonstrate. Thus, eligibility for benefits is not certain and models of SSI application must\ntake this risk of non-acceptance into consideration. In general, those considering applying for SSI will\nvalue disability benefits with a probability of less than one. Holding the underlying health condition\nconstant, the probability of acceptance onto the rolls will depend on the disability screening process.\nConditional on the same impairment, tighter eligibility criteria are likely to increase the probability of\ndenial and reduce the expected value of applying. In contrast, looser criteria increase the probability of\nacceptance and increase the expected value of applying.38 In either case, individuals facing uncertainty\nsurrounding acceptance, informational hurdles, or stigma associated with benefit receipt, may be induced\nto participate by the increase in benefits associated with the lower marginal tax rate.\nIf those categorically eligible for benefits on health grounds are completely unable to perform\nany substantial gainful activity under any circumstances then there is no need to lower the marginal tax\nrate on SSI, since those on the program are neither expected or able to work. However, to the extent that\nwork is both possible and expected for people with disabilities who meet the other eligibility criteria,\npolicy discussions with respect to trade-offs between tax rates, guarantees, and break-even points become\nmuch closer to those taking place for other income maintenance programs.\nThe same model also incorporates stigma and other fixed program costs. As in other income\nmaintenance programs, the presence of stigma and other program costs associated with applying for\n38Weathers (1999) develops a multi-period model of the SSDI application process in which the\noptimal time of application following the onset of a disability is a function of the opportunity cost of lost\nwages versus the gain in SSDI, adjusted for the probability of acceptance. A similar model could be used\nto predict the timing of SSI-disability applications.\n-27-\n\nbenefits explains why some categorically eligible individuals are observed on segment ACD. As fixed\nprogram costs and stigma decline, participation among this group will rise. What the model in Figure 7\ndoes not show are potential program interaction effects. As discussed in Figure 6, the actual budget\nconstraint facing those categorically eligible for SSI benefits is more complex, with more nonlinearities\ndue to the cumulation of taxes from multiple programs. In like manner, multiple program eligibility will\ncause complications for those interested in the behavioral effects of other transfer programs. Burkhauser\nand Smeeding (1981) show the incentives to accept actuarially reduced Social Security benefits (OASI)\nat younger retirement ages are increased for those who would be eligible for both SSI and OASI at age\n65, since OASI benefits are taxed on a dollar for dollar basis by SSI.\nFinally, one can also use the model in Figure 7 to think about the labor-supply behavior of\nparents of children with disabilities. If a child is judged eligible for SSI benefits, then an able-bodied\nparent faces the same marginal tax rates, guarantees, and break-even points shown in Figure 7. Stigma,\ninformation costs, and reduced program benefits (adjusted for the probability of acceptance) also apply.\nOne additional issue that affects parents of children with disabilities is how benefit receipt will influence\nthe future well-being of the child.\nSavings Behavior. The presence of asset testing in the eligibility criteria for SSI may reduce\nsaving among those meeting other eligibility criteria. This point is made generally about means-tested\nprograms. Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995) argue that when eligibility is tied to assets, individuals\nmeeting the income test have incentives to reduce their savings in order to qualify for benefits. Among\nthose applying for SSI benefits, the most likely group to be affected by the asset test is the elderly, who\nmay have accumulated savings over their lifetime.\nBalancing Efficiency and Equity Concerns\nOur discussion above has focused on the behavioral effects of the SSI program. This focus on\nthe efficiency costs of SSI induced behavioral change ignores the social benefits of SSI and may may\n-28-\n\nlead some to conclude that a socially optimal SSI program would have no behavioral impact on benefit\napplications, work, or savings. This conclusion is inappropriate for two reasons. First, even if actual\ndisability status were perfectly observable, society would probably still want to target some level of\nbenefits on disadvantaged low income workers and their families even if it resulted in some efficiency\nlosses. Hence the more important question is not whether there are program related behavioral changes\nbut whether they are small relative to the social gains from redistributing income to less advantaged\npersons. Analyses of the welfare implications of the SSI program should focus on this second and more\nimportant question.\nSecond, in a world where the socially appropriate eligibility standard for SSI is difficult to\nassess, some individuals will be denied benefits who are less capable of work than is socially acceptable.\nIn such a world, a more lenient eligibility criteria will involve a trade-off between the reduction of type II\nerrors on the one hand and the additional costs of type I errors on the other. The issue is: in the presence\nof uncertainty, do the social benefits outweigh the efficiency costs arising from increasing the probability\nof guaranteeing an income floor to those below some minimum level of work capacity at the cost of also\nproviding these funds to some who are more capable of work. In both cases, it is appropriate to assign\nsome value to SSI as a mechanism for providing social protection against the economic consequences of\naging and disability for disadvantaged workers. To do otherwise would be to hold too narrow a view\nfrom a social policy perspective. See Bound, Cullen, and Schmidt 2000 for a fuller discussion of these\nissues.\nV. Review of the Evidence\nIn the previous section we reviewed the potential consequences on application, work, and savings\nbehavior of SSI program rules and showed that if the aged or disabled adults are capable of work, the SSI\nprogram rules could their influence behavior. We also discussed how SSI program rules could affect the\nwork behavior of the parents of children with disabilities. In this section we review the empirical\n-29-\n\nliterature on the effects of the existence and structure of SSI on behavior. Despite the size and\nimportance of the SSI program, the empirical literature on its behavioral effects is relatively small.\nMoreover, almost without exception, empirical studies focus on only one of the three groups SSI targets.\nFor this reason, the empirical evidence on the behavioral effects of SSI for each target population group\nwill be discussed in turn.\nSSI and Adults with Disabilities\nWork Effort of Adults with Disabilities.39 To understand the relative importance of SSI to the\npopulation with disabilities, it is useful to focus on how successfully people of working-age with\ndisabilities are integrated into the labor force. Table 8 uses data from the 1989 Panel Study of Income\nDynamics (PSID) response-nonresponse file (columns 1-4) and the 1990 Longitudinal Survey of Income\nand Program Participation Microdata (SIPP) file (columns 5-8) to measure labor force participation and\ntransfer receipt of people with disabilities prior to the passage of the ADA. Although work is less\ncommon among the working-age population with disabilities than among those without disabilities, it\nstill is an extremely important activity. Among working-age men with disabilities in 1988, two of every\nthree men worked in the labor market and 43 percent worked full-time.\nThe importance of work in the population of disabled adults is confirmed by the SIPP data.40\nAlthough the percent working (54.8 percent) is lower in the SIPP than in the PSID, as is the percent\neither working full-time or self-employed (41.1 percent), work is still highly prevalent among men with\ndisabilities. Part of the reason for the difference in work reported in these two data sets is related to the\ndifferent years in the business cycle captured in the data. The year 1988 was near the peak of the 1980s\n39This discussion draws from Bound and Burkhauser (1999).\n40The SIPP values in Table 8 come from Wittenburg (1997), who used a definition of disability\nsimilar to that of Burkhauser and Daly (1996). Because of the staggered nature of the SIPP panel, the\nwave 3 and wave 6 data used will capture a calendar year for respondents somewhere between October\n1990 and January 1992.\n-30-\n\nbusiness cycle and represented the sixth straight year of economic growth. In contrast, the SIPP data\ncenter around 1991, the trough year of the 1990s business cycle. As a number of authors have shown, the\nemployment of people with disabilities is sensitive to the business cycle (Burkhauser, Havemen, and\nWolfe 1990; Daly 1994; Burkhauser, Daly, and Houtenville 2000).\nTable 8 does not suggest that pathologies cannot result in serious employment limitations, or that\nhealth never prevents work. Even using the PSID data, approximately one-third of working-age men and\nalmost one-half of working-age women with a disability had no labor earnings in 1988. Among this\nnonworking subgroup of the population with disabilities, nearly 70 percent of men and 43 percent of\nwomen received a disability transfer payment in that year. In the recession period captured in the SIPP\ndata, the percent of the male population with disabilities not working is even larger—45.2 percent—and\nnearly three men in four in this nonworking population receive some form of government transfer.\nHowever, the fact that a significant fraction of the population with disabilities works raises questions\nabout the justification for providing benefits to disabled SSI recipients based on an expectation of no\nwork.\nFactors Affecting SSI Participation. While application for SSI disability benefits is a function of\nhealth, it also is influenced by program rules and benefits. These include eligibility criteria and the\ngenerosity of benefits relative to work, the comparative generosity and availability of other means-tested\nwelfare and social insurance programs, macro economic conditions (national, state, and local), and\napplicants’ education and job skills. During the 1990s, considerable attention was devoted to\nunderstanding the link between these non-health factors and SSI caseload growth. The following\ndiscussion reviews the evidence on determinants of SSI caseload growth, looking first at the relationship\nbetween caseload dynamics and screening stringency (benefit supply), and then at factors affecting the\ndemand for SSI benefits, including ease of benefit access, benefit generosity relative to work and other\nprograms, and economic conditions.\n-31-\n\nSSA began modifying its disability determination process in the mid-1970s. Concerned that state\noffices were not consistently and uniformly applying the residual functional capacity (RFC) and\nvocational standards in adult disability determinations, in 1979 SSA published regulations specifying\nwho was to be classified as disabled, essentially tightening the eligibility criteria. SSA also tightened its\npolicy towards benefit terminations in continuing disability reviews (CDRs) by state Disability\nDetermination Services (DDS), permitting benefit termination without proof of medical improvement.\nThis policy resulted in a three-fold increase in the number of cessation decisions on continuing reviews\nby state agencies (The Lewin Group 1999). Consistent with the tighter standards, the yearly allowance\nrate (initial acceptances divided by initial applications) of adult SSI disability applications began to fall\nin 1976 (Table 9).\nThe Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 continued the trend of tightening the\ndisability determination and review process. Importantly, the 1980 law changed both the frequency and\nnature of medical eligibility reviews done on disability beneficiaries.41 Before 1980, the only\nbeneficiaries targeted for medical eligibility review were those who had conditions that were likely to\nimprove over time. The new law stipulated that all beneficiaries periodically should receive continuing\ndisability reviews, and that all but those deemed to have permanent disabilities should be reviewed every\n41The 1980 law tightened Social Security Administration control over the state disability\ndetermination services. In particular, SSA previously had reserved the right to review initial\ndeterminations before they were transmitted to the applicant, but during the 1970s it reviewed only 5\npercent. The 1980 amendments required that SSA review two-thirds of successful applications. To\nenforce administrative control over administrative law judges, the secretary of Health and Human\nServices was empowered to appeal administrative law judge rulings that were favorable to the applicant.\nPrior to 1980, the law provided that disability determinations be performed by state agencies\nunder an agreement negotiated by the states and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The 1980\namendments required that disability determinations be made by state agencies according to regulations of\nthe Secretary. It also required the Secretary to issue regulations specifying performance standards to be\nfollowed in the disability determinations, and if the Secretary found that a state agency was failing to\nmake disability determinations consistent with regulations, then the Secretary was required to terminate\nthe state’s authority and assume federal responsibility for the determinations.\n-32-\n\nthree years. The 1980 law made permanent the practice of using the same standards in CDRs that were\napplied when initially evaluating claimants. In addition to tightening the disability adjudication and\nreview process, the 1980 law established two key work incentives: (1) the 1619(b) provision; and (2) the\ndeduction of impairment-related work expenses (IRWEs) from earnings when determining the SGA. As\nnoted earlier, the 1619(b) provision authorized a three-year demonstration project, allowing for the\npayment of special SSI benefits (and the retention of Medicaid coverage) for SSI recipients who\nexceeded the SGA level. Section 1619 became permanent in 1986.\nAs could be expected, the 1980 law had a discernible impact on administrative practice. As\ndemonstrated in Table 9, the yearly allowance rate for adult SSI disability recipients fell from a high of\n52.6 percent in 1975 to 26.6 percent in 1982. The number of recipients fell from 1.75 million in 1978 to\n1.66 million in 1982. This decrease occurred despite the economic recession of 1980-1982. This\nremoval of individuals from the rolls generated a major political response. Most of the people removed\nfrom the rolls appealed the decision, requesting a hearing before an administrative law judge and causing\na huge backlog of cases. As a result, some state governors instructed their DDS service not to terminate\nanyone from the disability rolls unless that person’s conditions had improved.42\nIn 1984, in response to concerns that federal disability policy had become too restrictive, the\nSocial Security Administration agreed to a moratorium on CDRs pending the enactment and\nimplementation of revised guidelines. The 1984 law had profound effects on the standards used to\nevaluate a person’s potential eligibility for SSI. When reviewing existing beneficiaries, the burden of\nproof was shifted back to the SSA to show that a beneficiary’s health had improved sufficiently to allow\nhim or her to return to work. A moratorium was imposed on re-evaluations of the most troublesome\ncases—those that involved mental impairments or pain—until more appropriate guidelines could be\ndeveloped. Finally, benefits were continued pending the outcome of an appeal.\n42For a fuller discussion of disability policy in this period, see Berkowitz and Burkhauser (1996).\n-33-\n\nThe 1984 law substantially increased the weight given to source evidence (i.e., evidence\nprovided by the claimant’s own physician) by requiring that it be considered first, prior to the results of\nan SSA consultative examination. SSA also was required to consider the combined effect of all\nimpairments, whether or not any one impairment was severe enough to qualify a person for benefits.\nPerhaps most important, the SSA substantially revised its treatment of mental illness, reducing the weight\ngiven to diagnostic or medical factors, and emphasizing the ability of an individual to function in work or\nwork-like settings.\nTable 9 shows that the dip in the SSI adult disability population which occurred between 1978\nand 1982 was reversed thereafter, and rose about 4 or 5 percent a year during the economic growth years\nof the later 1980s. When the next economic downturn came in the early 1990s, conditions were ripe for a\nsurge in applications and in the number of people on the SSI disability rolls. The increases in the\ndisability transfer population in the early 1990s exceeded anything seen in SSI since the start of the\nprogram. The annual acceptance rate for SSI adult disability benefits was almost 45 percent in 1992, the\nhighest since 1976. Economic recovery and Congressional action with respect to SSI disability eligibility\nhave slowed the growth in the working-age adult SSI population, but acceptance rates remain well above\nthose in the 1980s, suggesting that a future downturn in the economy could result in an increase in the\nrolls.43\nThe legislative history underlying the disability screening process highlights how the supply of\nbenefits has changed over time. Figure 8 shows that demand for SSI disability benefits also has\nfluctuated. Fluctuations in applications have been as large as changes in the SSI disability rolls. To\n43As part of more general welfare reforms in 1996, Congress removed drug and alcohol addiction\nas allowable conditions for SSI eligibility. In 1995, there were about 135,000 SSI recipients whose\ndisability was based solely on drug addiction or alcoholism. The Congressional Budget Office estimated\nthat about 65 percent of these individuals would be eligible for SSI based on other sufficiently disabling\nconditions. For a full discussion of these reforms and their impact see U.S. House of Representatives\n(1998).\n-34-\n\nsome extent these fluctuations have mirrored changes in eligibility standards, contracting when eligibility\nstandards were tightened in the late 1970s and early 1980s, rising after the relaxation of eligibility\nstandards in 1984, and falling again following the tightening of standards in the mid-1990s. However,\nother factors including local economic conditions, outreach efforts by both SSA and state governments to\nsearch for eligible candidates, and the generosity of SSI relative to other programs all are likely to have\ncontributed to the variability in applications over time.\nA number of scholars have estimated the link between local economic conditions and SSI\napplication rates. The fact that SSI is a national program restricts the extent to which regional variation\nin benefits can be used to identify the effect of the program on applications. However, in recent work\nBlack, Daniel, and Sanders (1998) used regional variation in economic conditions to identify the effect of\nfinancial incentives on the decision to apply for SSI (and SSDI) disability benefits. In particular, they\nexamined the impact of the coal boom during the 1970s, and the coal bust during the 1980s on the\nnumber of SSI beneficiaries. Using panel data on 186 counties in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and\nWest Virginia they estimated an elasticity of program payments with respect to local area earnings of\nbetween -0.5 and -0.7 for SSI recipients. While these results lend some support to the notion that labor\nmarket conditions in an area affect the decision of individuals to apply for disability benefits, the point\nestimates are hard to interpret. Black, Daniel, and Sanders interpret the estimated coefficient on the local\nearnings variable as reflecting the effect of changes in the financial attractiveness of disability benefits.\nHowever, given the nature of the specification used, it is possible that the earnings variable is picking up\nthe effect of general economic conditions rather than the relative financial attractiveness of SSI.44\nFurthermore, their estimates reflect the short-run effect of changes in the local economies in Kentucky,\nOhio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia on the number of disability beneficiaries. Given the fact that the\n44As will be discussed shortly, the evidence that recessions lead to increases in the number of\napplications for SSI is strong.\n-35-\n\ntypical SSI spell is lengthy in duration, long-run effects likely will be substantially larger than short-run\neffects.\nA considerable amount of government-sponsored research has attempted to explain the dramatic\ngrowth in the SSI population in the early 1990s. A useful summary of this work can be found in Rupp\nand Stapleton (1995). Much of this analysis has used the considerable variation in state-level\napplications and awards to test their models. Using cross-state data from 1988-1992 Stapleton, Coleman,\nand Dietrich (1995) find convincing evidence that the recession of the early 1990s contributed to the\nrapid rise in the number of applications for SSI benefits. They estimate that a 1 percentage point rise in\nthe unemployment rate was associated with a 2 percent rise in applications for SSI. The effects on final\nawards were somewhat lower. Finally, they found that the changes in the unemployment rate had a\nsmaller effect on benefit awards than on applications, suggesting that recessions induce those with less\nsevere disabilities to apply for SSDI and SSI benefits.\nStapleton, Coleman, and Dietrich also provide strong, if indirect, evidence that recent changes in\nscreening stringency played a central role in explaining program growth. Indeed, the very fact that award\nrates were rising at the same time that application rates were rising would seem to suggest an important\nrole for changes in screening stringency. They find that changes in the unemployment rate, together with\nother factors they include in their models, could explain almost all of the growth in applications for\nimpairments related to conditions of internal organs, but could account for much less of the growth in\napplications for impairments related to musculoskeletal or mental health conditions. These patterns\nsuggest that regulatory changes such as the increased weight given to pain and other symptoms, the\nincreased reliance on source evidence, and the broadening of the standards used for those with mental\nimpairments all have contributed importantly to the recent surge in applications for SSI.\nWhereas the 1990s recession seems to be part of the explanation for the rapid rise in applications\nfor SSI benefits that occurred during the first part of the 1990s, no such rise occurred during the severe\n-36-\n\nrecession of the early 1980s. A reasonable interpretation of these patterns is that the tightening of\neligibility standards that occurred during the early 1980s counteracted the effects of the 1980s recession.\nDuring the mid-1980s, when eligibility standards were relaxed again, the booming economy slowed any\nimmediate response. However, when the 1990s recession hit, applications grew rapidly.\nResearchers studying the increases in SSI caseloads have found evidence that an important factor\nexplaining the growth in SSI over the 1990s has been efforts by states to shift individuals off state-funded\nprograms such as general assistance and onto SSI. States that cut general assistance benefits experienced\nabove-average growth in the application for SSI benefits (Lewin-VHI 1995a). Using monthly\nadministrative data from Michigan, Bound, Kossoudji, and Ricart-Moes (1995) find that the increase in\nthe application for SSI benefits exactly coincided with the end of general assistance in Michigan.\nHowever, they also find that general assistance benefits typically are less generous than are SSI benefits.\nThis finding is surprising within the context of a simple labor supply model that ignores the relative costs\nof application for these two types of benefits. The fact that many potentially eligible people did not\napply for the more generous SSI benefits suggests that applying for disability benefits may be difficult\nand onerous. There is also considerable anecdotal evidence that states and third parties often act as\nintermediaries to facilitate the SSI application process (Livermore, Stapleton, and Zeuschner 1998;\nBound, Kossoudji, and Ricart-Moes 1998).\nBrown, Hoyt, and Scott (1999) approach a similar question using county-level data on SSI and\nAFDC participation rates. They find that prior to 1996 welfare reform, variation in AFDC programs\nacross states explains little of the variation in SSI participation. They also find that program and\neligibility variables explain more of the county-to-county variation in SSI participation than in AFDC\nparticipation, suggesting that SSI is a more tightly targeted program than AFDC. Still, they conclude that\ngiven the significant changes in welfare programs embodied in the transition from AFDC to TANF, SSI\nparticipation rates likely will be affected.\n-37-\n\nIncreases in the value of Medicaid benefits for individuals on SSI also may have contributed to\nthe recent growth in applications for both programs. Yelowitz (1998) uses cross-state variation in\nMedicaid benefits to estimate the effect of changes in their value on participation in SSI. In particular, in\nresponse to court orders, many states increased Medicaid benefits in 1991. Using these changes,\nYelowitz estimates that increases in the value of Medicaid which occurred over the late 1980s and early\n1990s can explain about 20 percent of the increase in the working-age population receiving SSI benefits.\nHowever suggestive Yelowitz’s results are, they do not seem to be very robust. Stapleton and his\ncolleagues (Lewin-VHI 1995b) used Yelowitz’s methodology to look at the effect of changes in the value\nof Medicaid on the application for SSI benefits and found no measurable effects. Given the expectation\nthat increases in the value of Medicaid initially would have a proportionately bigger effect on the number\nof applications (a flow) than on the beneficiaries (a stock) this non-result is surprising. While it is hard\nto imagine that eligibility for Medicaid benefits does not make SSI more attractive, finding statistical\nevidence of this effect has proven to be quite challenging.\nEffects of Work Incentives and Disincentives. Because the United States has few program\nalternatives that offer long-term benefits to working-age persons who are not working, the relatively\ngenerous benefits and imperfect screening mechanisms in SSI could pose significant work disincentives\nfor persons with disabilities who are considering applying for benefits. Additionally, the high marginal\ntax rates for those on the program could discourage exit from it and entry into the labor force.\nA large empirical literature has tried to estimate the magnitude of moral hazard effects. Some of\nthat literature has examined the net effect of SSI (and SSDI) on labor force participation rates, such as\nhow much higher participation rates would be were it not for these programs. However, this literature\nhas primarily focused on estimating the disincentive effects of SSDI program parameters, benefit\ngenerosity, or screening stringency. For a complete review of this literature see Bound and Burkhauser\n(1999). While it is tempting to look to the SSDI literature to gain some insights into how the SSI\n-38-\n\nprogram affects the behavior of low-income adults with disabilities, doing so is problematic. First,\nwhereas both programs use the same inability to perform substantial gainful activity criteria with respect\nto establishing categorical eligibility, the benefit structures of the two programs are quite different.45\nSecond and perhaps more important, the typical SSDI applicant has much different socio-economic\ncharacteristics than the typical SSI applicant. SSI applicants and recipients are younger, are more likely\nto have functional limitations related to mental conditions, have lower household income, have less\neducation, have fewer work skills and less experience in the marketplace, and are more likely to come\nfrom an ethnic or racial minority than are SSDI applicants and recipients.\nThe empirical research on the work disincentives of welfare programs consistently finds that\nrecipients are unresponsive to changes in marginal tax rates (for reviews of this literature see Moffitt,\n1986 and Hoynes and Moffitt, 1996). This literature provides little evidence that individuals\nparticipating in means-tested programs respond to financial incentives by working more. Research on the\nextent to which individuals with disabilities have the same income and substitution elasticities of\nparticipants in other programs would be an important step in determining whether the results discussed\nare applicable to the SSI population.\nThe small amount of research that does exist on the work efforts of SSI recipients suggests that,\ndespite special allowances for SSI recipients who receive earnings (e.g., 1619(a) and (b) status), only a\nsmall percentage of disabled adult SSI recipients work.46 In 1976 only 3.4 percent of all disabled adult\n45For example, SSDI is an insurance-based (non-means-tested) program with its benefits based\non past individual earnings history, while SSI is a flat rate means-tested welfare program. SSDI provides\nrecipients Medicare benefits after they are on the program two years and restricts its recipients to labor\nearnings up to $750 per month for a limited period, after which they face a significant program “notch”\nand lose all SSDI benefits. SSI provides it recipients with immediate access to Medicaid and, once on\nthe program, allows them more generous work options compared to SSDI.\n46Section 1619 (Public Law 96-265) became law in 1986. These provisions dramatically altered\nthe earnings opportunities for SSI disabled adults. Section 1619(a) allows recipients to maintain their\nSSI (and Medicaid) benefits even when their earnings exceed SGA. Section 1619(b) extends Medicaid\ncoverage to workers whose earnings make them ineligible for SSI cash payments.\n-39-\n\nbeneficiaries worked. Since that time, the percentage of disabled SSI recipients with earnings has nearly\ndoubled but, at 6.2 percent, remains quite low. A somewhat more optimistic picture comes from work by\nMuller, Scott, and Bye (1996), looking at the work history of SSI recipients. They find that among a\nsample of SSI beneficiaries coming onto the rolls between 1976 and 1988, approximately one-quarter\nworked during the time they received benefits.\nIn response to the low number of SSI recipients who work, the Social Security Administration\nhas conducted two large-scale return-to-work demonstration projects to study the effectiveness of\nproviding rehabilitation and employment services to SSI beneficiaries. The first, the Transitional\nEmployment Training Demonstration (TETD) project, which operated between 1985 and 1987, focused\non SSI beneficiaries whose primary condition was mental retardation. The second, Project Network,\noperated between 1992 and 1995 and included SSDI and SSI beneficiaries with a wide range of\ndiagnoses. The two demonstration projects were run in a similar fashion. Eligible beneficiaries in\nselected cities were invited to participate in the two projects. Volunteers were then randomly assigned to\ntreatment and control groups. The treatment groups were provided with rehabilitation and employment\nservices, while the control group was not. Using both survey and administrative data, the effectiveness\nof the rehabilitation and employment services could then be studied by comparing outcomes of the\nexperimental and control groups.\nAnalysis of the impact of the TETD project suggests that the employment and rehabilitation\nservices provided to SSI beneficiaries significantly increased earnings for participants over the six years\nthey were observed (earnings of the treatment group were close to 70 percent higher than the control\ngroup (roughly $4,000 in 1996 dollars) but the program only had a small impact on average SSI payments\n($870 per participant). This small reduction in SSI payments was not nearly sufficient to cover the\naverage costs of transitional employment services for program participants (Thornton and Decker\n-40-\n\n1989).47 However, when the employment and earnings gains for program participants are weighed\nagainst the costs of providing the employment services, the program may very well have produced a net\nsocial benefit. Similar results were obtained from Project Network. Analyses of the program (Kornfeld\nand Rupp 2000) show that during the first two years of operation Project NetWork produced modest net\nbenefits to persons with disabilities, as earnings gains among participants more than offset reductions in\nSSI and SSDI benefits. However, the small gain in earnings was not nearly sufficient to offset the costs\nof administering Project NetWork. Moreover, data for a third year follow up on about 70 percent of the\nsample show earnings gains declined to about zero, suggesting that the increase in earnings may have\nbeen temporary.\nImportantly, in both cases the fraction of program eligibles who volunteered for either TETD or\nProject Network was small—roughly 5 percent in each experiment. This suggests that, however\nbeneficial it might be to those who participate, the provision of transitional employment services to those\non SSI who volunteer for services is unlikely to have much of an impact on the overall SSI population.\nThis is hardly surprising. Beneficiaries go through a long process to establish that they have medical\nconditions that prevent them from performing substantial gainful activity. At least at the time they apply\nfor SSI benefits, applicants would appear to have put substantial energy into becoming eligible for\nprogram benefits—benefits that must more than compensate applicants both for any loss of income\nassociated with moving onto SSI as well as for the costs associated with applying for benefits.48 For the\ngreat majority of those awarded benefits, their health is unlikely to improve over time and their labor\n47The net effect of the transitional employment services is harder to evaluate and depends\ncrucially on the extent to which the services provided by the project substitute for other services paid for\nby the government (Thornton and Decker 1989).\n48As will be discussed later in this chapter, the cost of applying for SSI disability benefits for the\naverage applicant may be lower today than in previous periods. To the extent that welfare reform has\nchanged the SSI applicant pool, individuals may not be making a choice between work and benefits but\nrather between other welfare and SSI. Moreover, in response to both welfare reform and state financing\nissues, state governments may engage in more SSI outreach and lower the applicant’s cost of applying.\n-41-\n\nmarket opportunities are probably deteriorating. Moreover, those who return to work may be subject to\nhigh marginal tax rates.49 Under such adverse conditions it is not surprising that voluntary returns to\nwork are rare.\nSSI and Families of Children with Disabilities\nAs noted earlier, the primary justification for awarding cash benefits to poor families containing\na disabled child is that the families of disabled children face additional economic burdens associated with\ntheir child’s poor health (see NASI 1996). These economic burdens may include lost earnings from a\nparent who provides care for the disabled child and medical and nonmedical expenses related to the\nchild’s specific disability. However, SSI child benefits are not based on an earnings replacement or\nexpenditure offset formula, but, rather are means-tested against current income. It is difficult to know a\npriori whether beneficiary families experience dramatic drops in labor earnings or increases in net-of-\ndisability-expenditures in family income. In fact, it is equally possible that recipient families have low\nincomes prior to the onset of the child's disability, and that the additional burdens placed on families with\na disabled child are not the root cause of their current financial situation.\nAs with the adult SSI program, the child SSI program faces the problems related to moral\nhazard—incentives for parents to have their children become and remain eligible for SSI. The degree to\nwhich this potential moral hazard causes behavioral changes with respect to gaining and maintaining\neligibility depends, to some degree, on the pre-disability economic circumstances of the covered families.\nIf the typical family is a middle-income family that experiences a dramatic decline in their economic\nwell-being at the onset of their child's disability, but in all other ways has the market and social\ncharacteristics necessary to attain middle-income status, then cash programs that only partially offset\n49The evidence we have on the extent of work activity by those who have been awarded SSI\nbenefits comes mostly from the analysis of Social Security Earnings data. Anecdotal evidence suggests\nthat some fraction of those on SSI are actually working, but are working “off the books.” Research\ntargeted on such “off the books” work by SSI beneficiaries along the lines of that done by Edin and Lein\n(1997) on welfare recipients would be valuable.\n-42-\n\nthese losses are unlikely to lead to major disincentives for labor market participation or the child's\nrecovery. However, if the typical family that comes onto the SSI rolls is already economically vulnerable\n(e.g., family members have few market skills, one-parent family, etc.) prior to the onset of their child's\ndisability, eligibility for SSI is likely to have much greater economic importance. Poor families who\nhave a child with a disability may be able to completely replace or even increase their family income if\ntheir child's disability results in the receipt of SSI benefits. Thus, pre-disability differences in economic\nwell-being alter the replacement rate of SSI among families of children with disabilities and make the\nmoral hazard of behavioral change much greater among pre-disability low income families than among\nmiddle- or high-income families.\nFactors Affecting SSI Participation. As is true for the adult disability determination process, the\ndisability determination process for children has undergone substantial revision. As noted earlier, the\nmost important change came in 1990 when the Supreme Court required SSA to significantly broaden the\neligibility criteria for childhood disability. The same year as the Zebley decision, the SSA also released\nregulations revising the procedures used to evaluate mental impairments among children. The new rules\nexpanded SSA’s medical listings for childhood mental impairments by adding such illnesses as attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and by incorporating functional criteria in the listings. Similar to\nthe changes made in the adult process, the SSA modified the types of evidence used to judge the damage\nof mental illness; less emphasis was placed on the testimony of medical professionals and more weight\nwas given to the information parents, teachers, and counselors provided about the child’s condition. As\nwith the Individual Functional Assessment (IFA), the new mental impairment regulations focused on how\ndisabilities affected a child’s performance in school.\nFollowing these changes the child SSI caseloads grew rapidly. Data from the Social Security\nAdministration show that between 1989 and 1996, the number of children under 18 receiving SSI more\nthan tripled, from 265,000 to 955,000. Applications increased from 132,000 in 1989 to 541,000 per year\n-43-\n\nin 1994, and awards more than quadrupled. The yearly allowance rate on applications rose from 39\npercent in 1989 to a peak of 58.1 percent in 1992. In 1992, the number of children on SSI grew by 40\npercent (GAO 1998).\nIn response to rapid caseload growth and a burgeoning concern that the disability determination\nprocess was allowing too many children without serious medical problems onto the disability rolls,\nCongress narrowed the criteria for childhood disability in 1996. In addition, Congress mandated SSA to\nredetermine the eligibility of children on the rolls who might not meet the new eligibility criteria because\nthey received benefits on the basis of the former, more lenient, standards.50 In 1997, the number of SSI\nrecipients under age 18 fell by 7.9 percent and increased only slightly in 1998.\nEconomic factors also influence the decision of families to participate in SSI. Evidence suggests\nthat a large fraction of the children coming onto the rolls in the 1990s previously participated in the\nAFDC program. Daly and Burkhauser (1998), using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of\nYouth (NLSY), calculate that two-thirds of children found eligible for SSI in the early 1990s were in\nfamilies already receiving some type of welfare assistance. Other things equal, families eligible for\nmultiple programs are likely to select those programs that provide the highest net benefit to them.\nAlthough additional costs are associated with SSI (e.g., more stringent application rules, greater stigma\nrelated to receiving benefits, etc.), as the benefit difference between SSI and other programs increases,\nmore families will be willing to incur these costs to improve their economic situation.\nKubik (1999) tests the empirical significance of this prediction. He finds that AFDC recipient\nfamilies who successfully qualify a child for SSI benefits can increase family income substantially.\nTable 10 (taken from Kubik, 1999) shows how a family’s income can change when a child moves from\nAFDC to SSI. The analysis is for two states, Maryland and Connecticut, and demonstrates two points:\n50SSA originally identified 288,000 children as potentially affected by changes in the eligibility\ncriteria. In 1998, SSA scaled back their estimates; new estimates suggest that fewer than 100,000\nchildren will become ineligible for SSI (GAO 1998).\n-44-\n\n(1) families can significantly improve their economic well-being if someone in the family qualifies for\nSSI; and (2) the generosity of SSI relative to AFDC has grown over time, implying that the incentive to\ntransfer to the SSI program has grown. Table 10 shows that a family of three living in Maryland in 1990\ncould have increased monthly family income by over $3,500 if one child transferred to the SSI rolls. By\n1994, this advantage had grown to almost $4,400. Since other in-kind benefits, such as Medicaid and\nFood Stamps remained constant, the family experienced a net gain in income if the child moves from\nAFDC to the SSI rolls.\nA small number of empirical papers have examined the responses of AFDC participants to\nchanges in the SSI program, including the post-Zebley broadening of the childhood disability criteria,\nand increases in the relative generosity of SSI benefits during the 1990s (see Rand (1998) for a thorough\nreview of this literature). Garrett and Glied (2000) examine the impact of the Zebley decision on SSI and\nAFDC caseloads using the Zebley ruling as a “natural experiment,” representing an exogenous increase\nin the supply of SSI benefits (i.e., eligibility criteria are relaxed and more families are allowed onto the\nSSI program). They exploit the state-level variation in the difference between SSI and AFDC payments\nto test whether families are responsive to increases in net benefits. Their findings suggest that families\nare responsive to differences in program generosity. They found that in low AFDC states, where the\ndifference between AFDC and SSI payments would be largest, about 53 percent of the new post-Zebley\nchild SSI cases switched from the AFDC program; nationally, only about 43 percent of new SSI child\ncases came from the AFDC program.\nAlong the same lines, Kubik (1999) examines the incentives for families to identify children as\ndisabled when SSI benefits are more generous than AFDC benefits. Using data from the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS) and changes in the difference in SSI and AFDC benefits, Kubik finds that\nreported disabilities—particularly mental impairments—were higher in low AFDC benefit states than in\n-45-\n\nhigh AFDC benefit states.51 Using data from the Current Population Survey on household SSI receipt, he\nalso finds that relatively generous SSI benefits (relative to AFDC payments) affect SSI participation.\nKubik estimates that a 10 percent increase in SSI benefit generosity increases the probability of SSI\nparticipation among families with low education by 0.39 percentage point—a five percent increase in SSI\nparticipation. Overall, Kubik finds a significant and positive relationship between the marginal value of\nSSI benefits and the prevalence of disability, and receipt of SSI, among children.\nEffects of SSI on Work Effort of Families. SSI support for families potentially affects the labor\nmarket effort of parents. However, there is not a large empirical literature on this relationship. Garrett\nand Glied (2000) estimate that the Zebley decision had a significant impact on the employment of\nunmarried women without a high school education. Kubik (1999) finds similar results; examining\nbehavior after Zebley, Kubik finds that increases in SSI benefits lowered the probability that low-\neducation household heads work. He estimates that a 10 percent increase in SSI benefits decreases labor\nforce participation of low-education household heads by about 2 percent. The empirical evidence on the\neffects of SSI benefit levels on parental work effort after Zebley suggest that, in addition to responding to\nthe particular health needs of a child, mothers also respond to the income effect present in the guarantee\nas well as to the high marginal tax rates placed on their labor earnings.\nSSI and the Behavior of the Aged\nFactors Affecting Participation. Researchers have offered a number of hypotheses to explain the\nlow enrollment in SSI among the elderly, including lack of knowledge about the program and eligibility\ncriteria, prohibitively expensive application costs (e.g., time cost or cost of learning), and unobserved\ncosts of receiving benefits (e.g., welfare stigma). Early work on this topic focused primarily on the roles\n51To account for state-specific factors that may affect the prevalence of disability, Kubik\nexamines this relationship before and after Zebley. Thus, he measures the change in the prevalence of\nreported disability and compares it to the change in the difference between SSI and AFDC benefits by\nstate.\n-46-\n\nof welfare stigma and program knowledge on the decision to apply. Coe (1985) reported that of the SSI\nnonparticipants classified as eligible (48 percent of all eligible individuals), a significant fraction were\nnot aware of the program or did not think they were eligible. Coe also found that benefit levels were\npositively and significantly related to participation, with each $10 in additional benefits resulting in a 2.4\npercentage point increase in the probability of participation. This is consistent with the notion that\nrelatively high benefit levels would outweigh any noninformational barriers to participation, such as\naccess costs. However, Coe notes, noninformational barriers accounted for only 25 percent of the\nnegative effect of low benefits on participation. The primary reason lower benefit levels decreased\nparticipation was that eligible individuals facing low benefit levels were more likely to believe that they\nwere not eligible to participate. Warlick (1982) also concluded that program information and the\ndifficulty of the application process were the primary reasons for low participation rates among the\neligible elderly.\nRecent work by McGarry (1996) draws a slightly different conclusion. McGarry extends\nprevious research by using detailed asset and income information from the 1984 SIPP to more accurately\nclassify eligibility by accounting for differences in benefit levels introduced by state supplementation,\nand by explicitly controlling for measurement error in the estimation process. McGarry concludes that\nthe participation decision is primarily determined by the financial situation of eligible individuals. She\nfinds that although all persons eligible for SSI are poor, the probability of participation declines as the\nnumber of alternative resources increases. Similar to Coe, she finds that the elasticity of the expected\nbenefit is about 0.5 and that, after controlling for size of the SSI payment, those with greater resources\nare less likely to participate.52\n52Coe’s measure of other resources includes only the home ownership variable. McGarry uses a\nmore extensive set of resource measures, including home and other asset ownership, labor earnings over\nthe year, and income-to-needs ratio.\n-47-\n\nMcGarry departs from previous research in finding little evidence that welfare stigma or\ninformational program costs affect participation. However, as she notes, her results must be interpreted\nwith caution. The estimated model is a reduced-form version, which includes variables likely to affect\nparticipation through more than one path. If a variable operates in opposite directions on different\nfactors, its importance may be obscured. Thus, while she argues that the negative coefficient on years of\nschooling implies that lack of information does not deter participants, this result can just as easily be\ninterpreted as evidence of stigma associated with receiving benefits (e.g., more educated individuals feel\nmore stigma associated with receiving benefits).\nIn general, the low SSI participation rates among the elderly remain somewhat of a mystery.\nAlthough there is reason to believe that some individuals are uninformed about the program or their\neligibility for benefits, there is not much evidence that a large fraction of the elderly poor in need of\nassistance are constrained by transactions costs. What does appear to be the case is that eligible\nindividuals who are close to the margin on the means test are less likely to participate in the program. As\nCoe (1985) argued, this may be due to individuals misunderstanding the income disregards and other\nprogram rules that determine eligibility. Thus, unless individuals are sufficiently below the means test\nguidelines, they believe that they will be ineligible, and thus, do not apply. This interpretation is\nconsistent with McGarry’s simulation of responses given a change in benefit levels. McGarry examined\nhow raising the federal income guarantee to the U.S. poverty line impacted the participation of those\npreviously, and newly eligible for benefits. She finds that raising the benefit level increases the\nparticipation rates of those previously eligible by 16.5 percentage points, from 0.534 to 0.699. In\ncontrast, she finds that less than 30 percent of those newly eligible under the increased income limit\nparticipate in the program.\nSavings Behavior. Although it is well recognized that means-tested programs create incentives\nfor potentially eligible individuals to alter their behavior to ensure qualification, few studies have\n-48-\n\nrigorously reviewed the incentives facing elderly individuals close to the age and resource tests for SSI.\nYet, it is likely that SSI program features create disincentives for working and saving as individuals\napproach the age of eligibility. Neumark and Powers (1998) focus on the relation between saving\nbehavior and SSI receipt among the elderly. They argue that SSI’s influence on the savings patterns of\nelderly individuals should vary with the expected level of their benefits and the likelihood of receiving\nthem. In practice, individuals with low lifetime earnings living in high-benefit states should reduce\nsaving more than high lifetime earners living in low-benefit states. Neumark and Powers use state-level\nvariation in the generosity of supplemental SSI payments to identify the effects of SSI on the savings\nbehavior of the elderly. They find that SSI reduces the saving of men and women nearing the age of\nretirement who are likely participants in the program.\nVI. Future Challenges\nChanging Demand for Benefits\nAlthough SSI is an income maintenance program narrowly targeted on the aged, blind, and\ndisabled, many of those eligible for SSI also are eligible for other transfer programs. Program\ninteractions and the behavioral incentives such interactions produce depend in large part on the size of\nthe group eligible for multiple programs and on the fluidity of boundaries defining who is and who is not\neligible. When the dividing lines separating the working-age adult and child populations eligible for SSI\nfrom those eligible for other income-based benefits are imprecise, as with disability, policy changes in\nother welfare programs likely will affect SSI caseloads.\nOur review of the literature provides some evidence that families of adults and children with\ndisabilities are moving from other welfare programs to SSI. Table 11 documents the prevalence of\nvarious income sources among the poor and shows that as the receipt of public welfare benefits has\ndeclined, receipt of SSI has increased. This has occurred for both households of children under age 18\nand adults age 18-64. Poor households increasingly are relying on SSI for some portion of their income.\n-49-\n\nMoreover, as shown in Table 6, for adults age 18-64, the increase in SSI receipt has occurred without a\nchange in the prevalence of self-reported disability.\nWith respect to the aged population, the expansion of private pensions and social security\ncoverage significantly reduced the number of older persons receiving SSI benefits (Table 11). However,\nthis pattern may not hold in the future. The normal retirement age for receiving social security benefits is\nscheduled to increase from 65 to 67 over the next 15 years and financial pressures on the Social Security\nsystem may lead to further increases in the normal retirement age or to reductions in benefit levels. To\nthe degree that OASI benefits for older persons are diminished it is likely to produce increased demand\nfor SSI benefits.\nPermanent versus Temporary Support\nAs the population on SSI changes and the group of those not expected to work narrows, the\nstructure of SSI comes into question. As we have shown, the SSI population has dramatically shifted\nover time. It is now dominated by children and young adults with disabilities. To date, despite some\nattempts to offset the negative work incentives in SSI—Section 1619—exits from SSI to employment,\neven among this younger population, have been rare. As shown earlier in this chapter, for individuals\nand families receiving SSI and other transfer program benefits the marginal tax rates can go from 50 to\nnear 100 percent at relatively low earnings levels. While such high tax-rates and relatively generous\nguarantees make sense for populations not expected to work, in a population where work is possible,\nthey seriously discourage work. Hence, for those with a capacity to work, SSI, together with eligibility\nfor other programs, can become the “poverty trap” that the original supporters of Nixon’s single universal\nFAP program were trying to avoid. The work disincentives embodied in SSI will soon be highlighted by\nthe nearly one million post-Zebley children who are now on the SSI-children rolls. Given the broad\ncommitment to integrating people with disabilities into the workforce that led the to enactment of the\n-50-\n\nADA and other pro-work programs in the 1990s, major initiatives to integrate these children into the\nworkforce rather than onto adult SSI-disability rolls likely will be considered.\nVII. Summary and Conclusions\nThe enactment of the Supplemental Security Income program in 1972 was the culmination of a\nfour-year debate over a much more overarching welfare reform—a federally-funded minimum income\nguarantee for all Americans. Unlike Nixon's FAP proposal, SSI was targeted on the sub-group of low-\nincome individuals \"not expected to work.\" Since then, SSI has grown dramatically. Moreover, the\ncomposition of SSI beneficiaries has changed and in 1999 was dominated by adults and children with\ndisabilities.\nHow one views the increases in the SSI disability population largely is influenced by one's view\nof the social purpose of SSI. For those who see SSI as an incomplete substitute for a universal\nguaranteed income program like the NIT, expansions in the SSI program are seen as appropriate because\nthey bring the United States more into line with most Western European countries that provide such a\nuniversal minimum social safety net for all their citizens. However, for those who are worried about the\nlong-term effects of a life-time on government transfers, the rise in the prevalence of disability transfer\nrecipients—particularly among poor children and younger adults—is of more concern.\nSupport for civil rights-based legislation like the ADA, for instance, is based on the idea that\npeople with disabilities should have equal access to employment. Supporters of this type of legislation\nview unequal access to jobs to be a greater impediment to employment than a health impairment.\nFurthermore, they ask that social policy focus on altering workplace institutions to more fully\naccommodate people with disabilities. Hence, in a world of full accommodation, they argue the\ndisability-transfer population should be zero. Fundamentally, the current policy debate over expanding\nSSI transfer rolls hinges on the role people with disabilities should play in society. Should people with\ndisabilities be expected to work or not? If yes, then policies targeting people with\n-51-\n\ndisabilities—particularly the young—would be better focused on education, rehabilitation, job training,\nand accommodation than on increasing or expanding transfers. Likewise, for children with disabilities,\ninvesting more time, energy, and resources toward enhancing their education and development, rather\nthan focusing solely on supplementing the income of their households, might be more desirable.\nTwo factors are likely to cause the debate surrounding SSI to intensify over the next decade.\nFirst, the protracted period of economic growth that the United States has experienced since 1992 cannot\nlast forever. And, as we have shown, applications for SSI are sensitive to the business cycle. A downturn\nin the economy will increase applications and heighten efforts to broaden the categorical definition of\ndisability. This will be even more the case since the welfare reforms of 1996 have made it less likely that\nlow-income people will be eligible for other programs. Second, demographic forces are increasing the\npercentage of the population aged 50 and over. Given that the prevalence of disability rises sharply at\nthese ages, applications for SSI likely will rise. These demographic changes are magnified by the fact\nthat in 2000, the age of full eligibility for social security retirement began to increase to age 67. The\nincrease in the normal retirement age will increase the relative value of SSI benefits for those who wish\nto leave the labor market prior to age 67.\nIn general, our examination in this chapter suggests that in the absence of a universal guaranteed\nincome program for all Americans, the operational flexibility of the categorical eligibility criteria for SSI\nhas made the program sensitive to both downturns in the business cycle and to increases in the pool of\nvulnerable people. Recent legislative changes and ongoing demographic movements suggest that another\nmajor round of program expansion is likely in the future.\n-52-\n\nReferences\nAarts, L., R.V.

    "text": "FINAL\nClimate Risk and the Fed: Preparing for an Uncertain Certainty\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nPeterson Institute for International Economics1\nJune 22, 2021\n11:00 AM EDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nEconomies are, in many ways, perpetually evolving; adapting to new\nconditions and moving from one steady state to another. As these transitions\noccur, the path forward is often hazy. We can see the world shifting around us,\nbut we’re not completely sure where we’ll end up. All we know for certain is\nthat change is on the horizon.\nSociety has faced many of these uncertain certainties: industrialization,\nglobalization, the digital revolution. It’s increasingly clear that climate change\nis another one. While the severity and scope remain unclear, the consensus is\nthat a changing climate poses a significant risk to the global economy and\n2\nfinancial system. And we know from experience that ignoring these risks or\nfailing to prepare for them will make the transformation more turbulent and\nthe destination less hospitable.\nAs monetary policymakers, our job is to navigate this uncertainty. We\nneed to anticipate the changes before us and understand their implications.\n1\nI am grateful to Stephie Fried and Fernanda Nechio of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco for assistance in preparing this text.\n2\nSee, for example, USGCRP (2018), Auffhammer (2018), Hsiang and Kopp (2018), Hsiang et\nal. (2017), Brunetti et al. (2021), Rudebusch (2021). See also Brainard (2021) for related\n1\ndiscussion.\n\nFINAL\nToday, I will talk about how the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and\nthe Federal Reserve more broadly think about climate risk and its\nimplications for the economy.\nBut before I go any further, it’s a good time to remind you that the views\nI will express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone\nelse within the Federal Reserve System.\nPreparing for Uncertainty\nNow,at this point, most people understand that their future, and the\nfutures of their children and grandchildren, will be affected by climate\n3\nchange. Indeed, in a 2019 Pew Research survey, 62 percent of Americans said\n4\nthat climate change is having at least some effect on their local communities.\nBut the future is a far-off place. And as humans, it can be tempting to\ndiscount or simply ignore it. Unfortunately, that makes the path to change\nmore treacherous. The better we understand the challenges and opportunities\nof climate change, the better we’ll be able to manage them.\nFor many people, that future is already here. Drought and wildfires in\nCalifornia and the Pacific Northwest, ice storms in Texas, floods in the\nMidwest, and hurricanes in the South have already cost lives, destroyed\n3\nDefined as the current and projected trend toward higher average temperatures and the\nenvironmental shifts that result, such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent\nsevere storms, and changes in the pattern and predictability of rainfall (IPCC 2020, USGCRP\n2018).\n4\n2\nFunk and Hefferon (2019).\n\nFINAL\n5\nproperty, and displaced communities, sometimes permanently. Assessing\nclimate risk means understanding the likely frequency and severity of these\nkinds of physical disruptions.\nBut physical risks are only part of the story. A complete picture has to\nrecognize the preparations—precautionary or proactive—that individuals,\nbusinesses, and governments are making to manage the expected risks. These\nare especially uncertain since they depend on the awareness and reactions of\nindividuals, communities, and societies.\nEarly data tell us that adjustments are already under way. As the\nfrequency of climate-related events has increased, insurers and financial\ninstitutions have taken notice. They’re much less likely to shake off storms,\nfires, and floods as occasional or “freak” occurrences. Instead, they’re\nrecognizing them as indicative of a recurrent pattern that demands higher\ncompensation or different treatment.\nThe economic impact is tangible. It’s already harder and more expensive\nto insure real estate in risk-prone areas like Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and\n6\nCalifornia. Individuals and businesses in those areas are increasingly on the\nhook for property damage. This limits their ability to get loans or attract\ninvestors, curtails production, and affects decisions about the location of\ncurrent and future operations. It also leaves property owners and the banks\nthat hold their mortgages with stranded assets: real estate investments that\ncan no longer deliver their projected rate of return.\n5\nFor research on extreme events and their economic effects, see Aylward and Oliveira\n(2020), Bakkensen and Barrage (2020), Gallagher (2014), Tran and Wilson (2020),\nDeryugina (2017), and Fried (2021).\n6\n3\nSee, for example, Flavelle (2019), Grimaldi et al. (2020), Sheehan (2020).\n\nFINAL\nThese dynamics aren’t limited to businesses and households in areas\nprone to destructive weather events. We’re seeing them in parts of the\ncountry facing less conspicuous climate effects, like prolonged extreme\ntemperatures and unpredictable rainfall. The outcomes may seem less acute\nthan fires or hurricanes, but they affect business operations in equally crucial\nways—for example, by influencing which crops can be grown or how may\nmonths of the year people can work outside. These kinds of shifts are already\n7\nbeing factored into businesses’ and insurers’ assessments of risk.\nAll of this highlights an important reality. The risks from climate change\naren’t an isolated problem relevant only to a few sectors or parts of the\ncountry. Large swaths of the nation and a wide range of industries are\n8\nvulnerable to disruption.\nOf course, nowhere are these risks more acute than in the sectors of the\neconomy that produce and use carbon-based energy. The global and\nincreasingly domestic momentum to “go green” is prompting consumers and\nbusinesses to decarbonize and shift to more environmentally neutral forms of\n9\nenergy. These changes can lead to mispriced assets or misallocated capital,\nespecially for entities operating globally. We’re already seeing corporations\ntake notice. A growing number of them are including climate risk assessments\nin their daily business planning and financial disclosures. In many cases, this\n7\nBrunetti et al. (2021).\n8\nThese industries include the agricultural and resource sectors, leisure activities, various\nmanufacturing industries, and the financial institutions that support their operation.\n(USGCRP 2018).\n9\n4\nFried, Novan, and Peterman (2021).\n\nFINAL\nis happening in the absence of regulatory requirements or government\n10\nmandates.\nMany sectors are feeling the strain, including energy, automobiles, and\nconstruction. Firms in these carbon-heavy sectors could see declines in asset\n11\nprices, income, and profitability. Understandably, communities and\nbusinesses that rely on these industries are worried; they’re thinking about\nfalling production, stranded assets, and, ultimately, stranded people.\nTheir fears aren’t unfounded. We don’t have to go back very far in our\nhistory to see the devastating impact economic shifts can have on whole\nsegments of society. Think back to the 1980s wave of globalization. The view\nof most economists, including me, was that freer trade would be an\nunqualified win for the aggregate economy, raising output, driving growth,\n12\nlowering inflation, and ultimately delivering higher GDP per capita. And\n13\nglobalization has led to many good things—just not across the board.\nIndustries that had once been at the heart of the U.S. economy became\nless profitable and less viable. Workers displaced from downsized and closing\nbusinesses found it hard to transition to alternative employment with similar\npay. Some remained idle for the rest of their working lives. While new jobs\nand industries emerged, they often went to other people, in other places, far\nfrom the communities hardest hit by globalization. Thirty years later, many of\n10\nSee the work by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\n(https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/) and CDP (https://www.cdp.net/en/climate).\n11\nRudebusch (2021), Brunetti et al. (2021).\n12\nAlston, Kearl, and Vaughan (1992).\n13\nSee, for example, Broda and Weinstein (2006), Ebenstein et al. (2014), Caliendo and\n5\nParro (2015), and Hummels, Munch, and Xiang (2018).\n\nFINAL\nthese communities still bear the scars, having never fully recovered from the\n14\neffects of the transition.\nClimate change could bring similar economic upheaval, boosting\ninnovation, output, and jobs in green sectors, while reducing them in carbon-\nintensive ones. While the evolution of these patterns is uncertain, it is clear\nthat where we end up will be different than where we’ve been. And the lesson\nfrom past experience is that how we manage these shifts will shape not just\nthe climate, but also the trajectory of the economy and the individuals,\nfamilies, and communities that make it up.\nClimate Risk and the Fed\nSo, what does all of this mean for the Fed? Well, like all other risks to the\neconomy, it’s incumbent on the Federal Reserve to understand the likely path\nof climate change and the transitions that could be part of this evolution. At\nthis juncture, when both the path of change and the eventual new equilibrium\nare so uncertain, our role is to listen, study, and adjust to whatever comes our\nway.\nAnd we’ve already needed to do this. Over the past several years, severe\nweather and wildfires have frequently distorted headline employment and\ngrowth numbers, making it more challenging to decipher the true state of the\neconomy. This has prompted us and others throughout the Federal Reserve\nSystem to look at weather as a regular explanatory factor in economic\n14\nRegarding persistent trade impacts on U.S. employment, see, for example, Autor, Dorn,\n6\nand Hanson (2013) and Autor et al. (2014).\n\nFINAL\nperformance—a necessary response to the increased frequency and impact of\n15\nclimate events.\nBut the Fed and all central banks also need to be forward looking,\nresponding to the risks we see today, while anticipating those that have yet to\nunfold. This need has prompted many central banks to formally consider\n16\nclimate risk in the regulation and supervision of financial institutions. The\nFederal Reserve is thinking about these risks, too. Earlier this year, we created\na new Supervision Climate Committee to ensure the resilience of financial\n17\nfirms under our supervision.\nOf course, there are also risks to the economy that we don’t yet fully\nunderstand—the known but unknown risks. One of those is the response of\nbusinesses and households to living in a more unpredictable world. As\nuncertainty rises, so does the desire for precautionary savings that can be\nused to offset or hedge against possible future losses. While such behavior is a\nprudent response to greater risk, a change in saving behavior of a large\nnumber of individuals, both here and abroad, would contribute to a lower\n18\nneutral rate of interest, or r-star.\n15\nWilson (2019), Boldin and Wright (2015). This is different than simple seasonal\nadjustment, which assumes the local and national patterns of weather are broadly similar\nfrom year to year.\n16\nFor example, this month the Bank of England launched an “experimental” climate risk\nstress test of major U.K. banks and insurers (Bank of England 2021). The European Central\nBank includes climate risk in its supervisory guidance to financial institutions (European\nCentral Bank 2020).\n17\nThe FedSeuraple rRveisseiornv ea nBdo Raredg uisl aatlisoon e Rsetapbolristhing a Financial Stability Climate FCionmanmciitatle e to\niSdtaenbtiliiftyy, Rasespeosrst, and address climate-related risks to financial stability. The Federal\nReserve’s (Board of Governors 2020a) and\n18 (Board of Governors 202 0b) discuss these issues from microprudential and\nmacroprudential perspectives, respectively. See Brainard (2021) for additional discussion.\n7\nDietrich, Muller, and Schoenle (2021).\n\nFINAL\nA similar downward force on r-star may arise from a reduction in labor\nproductivity, as rising temperatures impede outdoor work or skill demand\noutstrips skill supply, limiting growth. This would only add to the structural\nfactors currently depressing the neutral rate of interest and further curtail the\n19\nFed’s ability to cut rates to combat economic downturns. Of course, there\ncould also be offsetting pressure on r-star from increased investments to\nmove to a more sustainable economy. In other words, there’s a lot of\nuncertainty.\nAnother known but unknown risk is how much and how rapidly the\nstructure of the economy will change. If the journey occurs abruptly, the\ntransition could put considerable pressure on both employment and prices.\nFor example, an abrupt shift from older, less green technologies to greener\nones could leave workers in declining sectors unprepared, lacking the skills to\nsmoothly transition. We could also see prices jump in emerging sectors and\nfall in declining ones, as supply responds to changes in demand. Without\nadvance preparation to help industries transform and the workforce adapt,\nthe transition costs could be large and long-lasting. As monetary\npolicymakers, we will need to watch these developments closely and prepare\nfor any and all scenarios.\nSo how do we do this? How do we watch for developments and assess\nrisks when so many have yet to fully develop? At the San Francisco Fed we\nhave taken a very direct approach. We are working intentionally and\ndeliberately with our communities, other public institutions, and the private\nth\nsector to catalog the risks and how they are playing out in the 12 District, the\n19\nFor examinations of the structural factors depressing r-star see Carvalho, Ferrero, and\nNechio (2016), Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\n8\n\nFINAL\nnation, and across the globe. These data collection efforts are multifaceted and\ninclude formal surveys, listening sessions, and targeted meetings with CEOs to\nbetter understand how climate risk affects decision making and resiliency\nplanning.\nWe are also convening the best academic thinking on these topics,\nhosting conferences and sponsoring a virtual seminar series on climate\n20\neconomics that features a range of research on the issues we are facing.\nFinally, consistent with our history, we have assembled a team to study how\nthese issues are likely to impact the Federal Reserve’s mandates in the future.\nThis team allows us to leverage our strength as students of the economy to\n21\nprepare for the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead.\nThe Transition We Choose\nFuture occurrences, especially when uncertain, are easy to push off. But\ndoing so leaves a mark.\nI saw this myself. As a teenager growing up in Missouri, I witnessed\nfactory after factory move away, or simply shutter. Each one of them left\npeople behind.

For example, previous groups\nhave focused on the IT revolution, emerging Pacific Basin economies, and quantitative\n9\nassessment of financial vulnerability.\n\nFINAL\nsaw the same thing in Syracuse, where I got my PhD. Carrier air conditioning\nclosed, and the community struggled. Drive anywhere in America and you can\nsee vestiges of a similar story.\nNow, it’s tempting to blame globalization. And so many do. But the real\nmiss was a lack of acknowledgement. Acknowledgement that, while the\neconomy would be better off in the end, the end is a long way off and the\ntransition would not benefit everyone equally. In fact, there could be collateral\ndamage.\nSo, what do we learn from this? The key lesson is that transitions\nmatter. And how they play out is our choice. On the cusp of an economic\ntransformation that will likely be even more far-reaching, we have an\nopportunity to do things differently.\nOur future is uncertain: no one really knows the severity and scale of\nclimate change, where and who will be most affected, or the nature, extent,\nand duration of our response to the risks. But one thing is certain—the\neconomic ground is shifting. And we have a window of opportunity to\nprepare; to choose the degree of hardship we will endure.\nEconomic transitions are inevitable, but the degree of pain they inflict is\nnot. In the end, preparation gives us agency. It is our duty to use it.\nThank you.\n10\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAmerican Economic Review\nAlston, Richard M., J.R. Kearl, and Michael B.

    "text": "Resolute and Mindful: The Path to Price Stability\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSpeech to Orange County Business Council\nIrvine, California\nNovember 21, 2022\n10:00AM PST\nThese days, I am often asked how I think about monetary policy decisions. And that makes\nsense. Especially now, when the tradeoffs that many people fear—high inflation or hard\nrecession—seem so severe. My answer is this: I am resolute and mindful. Resolute in achieving\nour goals. And mindful about how we do it.\nNow to some, it may seem like there is a conflict. They worry that resolute means “at any cost.”\nOn the other side, people hear mindful and they worry we won’t go far enough—that we’ll stop\nshort of getting the job fully done.\nBut resolute and mindful are complementary principles. And today, I will share how they inform\nmy decisions as we strive to deliver low and stable prices and an economy that works for all.\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that the remarks I make are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nFrom Low to High Inflation\nI’ll start by talking about where we are and how we got here. Because this, of course, sets the\nstage for what lies ahead.\nAs many of you know, Congress gave the Federal Reserve two mandates: price stability and\nmaximum employment. Right now, we are only meeting one of those goals. The labor market is\n1\n\nvery strong and well aligned with our employment objective. In contrast, inflation is\nunacceptably high and has been that way for almost two years.\nHigh inflation feels unfamiliar to many of us. Before the pandemic, the United States had\nenjoyed almost four decades of low and stable prices, with inflation fluctuating only modestly\nbetween expansions and downturns. In fact, after the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal\nReserve and other central banks struggled with persistently low inflation, which could leave the\neconomy vulnerable to deflationary pressures and slower longer-run growth.1 Clearly, a\ndifferent problem.\nThen COVID-19 hit and plunged the United States and the world into a steep downturn. The\nFederal Reserve cut interest rates, purchased long-term assets, and opened lending facilities—\nall in an effort to bridge the economy through the worst of the pandemic.2 U.S. fiscal agents\ntook equally aggressive action, eventually putting about $5 trillion in federal spending into the\neconomy.3\nThese unprecedented efforts worked. U.S. economic growth bounced back rapidly. By the\nsecond half of 2020, demand was growing and the labor market was on track to recover.\nSupply chains were lagging, but with vaccines coming online, there was hope that production\nwould quickly return to full capacity.\nUnfortunately, this did not occur. Global production and distribution continued to lag. And by\nearly 2021, price pressures were starting to build—first in a few sectors directly affected by the\npandemic, and then more broadly, as imbalances between robust demand and limited supply\nspread throughout the economy.4\nBy the fall of that year, inflation had risen further and looked to be gaining momentum. In\ncontrast, unemployment was steadily declining and heading back to its historically low pre-\npandemic level. In response, the Fed needed to remove accommodation and tighten policy\nmuch more quickly than it had previously signaled.\n1 See Daly (2019) and references therein. At that time, the concern was that the FOMC could not get inflation up to\nthe 2 percent target. See also Williams (2017) and Powell (2018). For related research, see for example Kiley and\nRoberts (2017) and Mertens and Williams (2019).\n2 Board of Governors (2020) and Hoops and Kurtzman (2021).\n3 Parlapiano et al. (2022).\n4 Shapiro (2022).\n2\n\nPolicy Rebalancing\nBut there was a key challenge. At the time, most market participants, businesses, and\nhouseholds expected the Fed to maintain near-zero interest rates until late 2022 or even 2023.5\nMoreover, while the asset purchase program had begun to wind down that November, it was\nnot expected to conclude until the middle of 2022.6\nA long history suggests that surprising people with abrupt changes to policy can be costly,\npotentially disrupting financial intermediation and leaving lenders and borrowers unprepared.\nAnd because people have come to expect that the Fed will be transparent about its projected\npolicy actions, catching people off guard can also erode hard-won trust. So, FOMC participants\ncommunicated that policy could change earlier than previously thought. In December 2021, the\nFOMC announced it would phase out its asset purchase program more rapidly and be prepared\nto raise rates as early as March 2022.7\nThis and other forward guidance provided throughout that fall had an immediate impact.\nAlmost overnight, financial conditions tightened. Market participants began pricing in expected\nfuture rate hikes, and businesses and households started readying themselves for a new\ninterest rate landscape, pulling forward real estate purchases, restructuring debt obligations,\nand locking in longer-term fixed-rate loans. In other words, before we ever raised the federal\nfunds rate, tighter financial conditions were already working their way through the system\n(Figure 1). Indeed, by the time of the first official rate hike of 25 basis points in March 2022,\nmortgage interest rates had risen three-quarters of a percentage point and broader financial\nconditions had tightened almost a full percentage point.\n5 Just before the September meeting when the FOMC signaled likely reductions in the pace of asset purchases,\nfederal funds futures markets were projecting liftoff in late 2022 or early 2023.\n6 Board of Governors (2021a).\n7 Board of Governors (2021b, c).\n3\n\nFigure 1\nEffective federal funds rate, 30-year mortgage rate, and GSFCI\nThe responsiveness of financial conditions to our communications was notable and helpful. It\ngave us a head start on adjusting policy and mitigated the costs of an abrupt and unexpected\nchange to the policy rate.\nBut of course, the job was far from done. Inflation was still on a troubling upward climb, and\nbusinesses and families were feeling the pain. Left untamed, inflation can also distort\ninvestment decisions, exacerbate economic inequalities, and reduce confidence in the Fed’s\nability to achieve its goals, all of which can bridle longer run growth.8 The pain of so many\nAmericans coupled with the potential for long-term damage to the economy prompted the Fed\nto take aggressive action.\nWe began raising rates more quickly—expeditiously—moving the fed funds rate up in 75 basis\npoint increments. This allowed us to swiftly withdraw accommodation and bring policy more in\nline with prevailing economic conditions. As of our last meeting just a few weeks ago, the target\nrange of the federal funds rate stands at 3.75 to 4 percent, modestly restrictive relative to the\nneutral rate of interest. And we have signaled that there is more work to do.\n8 See Daly (2022) and references therein.\n4\n\nThis resolve has some people worried. They are concerned that resolute means unwilling to\nstop until the economy breaks or inflation hits 2 percent.\nBut that is not how I think about policy, nor is it the path communicated by the FOMC in its last\nstatement.9 Resolute does not mean heedless. This is especially important as we move into the\nnext—and in many ways more difficult—phase of policy tightening.\nFinding Sufficiently Restrictive\nAs we work to bring policy to a sufficiently restrictive stance—the level required to bring\ninflation down and restore price stability—we will need to be mindful. Adjusting too little will\nleave inflation too high. Adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn.\nSo, what specifically do we need to be mindful of? Many things, of course. But in our November\nFOMC statement, we mention three in particular: the cumulative tightening in place, the lags in\nmonetary policy, and the evolution of the data.\nLet’s start with cumulative tightening. Historically, we’ve used progress on the federal funds\nrate and where it stands relative to its neutral value as a gauge for policy restrictiveness. But in\ntoday’s world, that is only part of the picture. The funds rate does not capture the impact of the\nother tools in our tool kit, including the reduced asset holdings associated with balance sheet\nroll-off and the forward guidance we’ve provided about the future path of policy. It also misses\nthe fact that central banks across the globe are tightening policy as well, likely amplifying the\neffects of our own rate hikes.\nA more comprehensive way to gauge the actual level of tightening is to look at financial market\nconditions.10 Several researchers have done this and found that the level of financial tightening\nin the economy is much higher than what the funds rate tells us. As the figure shows, this has\nbeen true for a while now (Figure 2). In fact today, while the funds rate is between 3.75 and 4\npercent, financial markets are acting like it is around 6 percent.\n9 Board of Governors (2022a, b).\n10 Choi et al. (2022); monthly updates are available on the San Francisco Fed’s Proxy Funds Rate data page.\n5\n\nFigure 2\nEffective federal funds rate and proxy rate\nAs we make decisions about further rate adjustments, it will be important to remain conscious\nof this gap between the federal funds rate and the tightening in financial markets. Ignoring it\nraises the chances of tightening too much.\nOf course, we also have to account for the fact that, while financial markets react quickly to\npolicy changes, the real economy takes longer to adjust. Overlooking this lag can make us think\nwe have further to go when, in reality, we just have to wait for earlier actions to work their way\nthrough the economy. There is a large literature on the lags in monetary policy. And while there\nis no clear consensus on exactly how long they are, there is broad agreement that it’s not\nimmediate and likely takes at least several quarters.11\nThis is consistent with what we have seen in the data. The Fed started tightening policy close to\na year ago. Interest-sensitive sectors like housing started to cool very quickly. As mortgage rates\nrose, home sales, construction activity, and the pace of house price gains slowed. Labor\nmarkets remain solid but are showing early signs of cooling. Job openings are down about 10\npercent from their March high and job growth is slowing from its rapid pace last year. And\nalthough one month of data does not a victory make, the latest inflation report had some\nencouraging numbers, including a long awaited decline in goods price inflation.\n11 Romer and Romer (2004) and Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n6\n\nLooking ahead, I will be watching for further calming in these areas, as well as signs that\npandemic-related imbalances between supply and demand are continuing to subside. I will also\nbe in continuous dialogue with business leaders, workers, and community members in my\nDistrict. Policy decisions also require that we look forward. Real-time conversations yield\ninsights about how people are faring and how the economy is changing before they ever show\nup in the published data.\nAs we navigate back to price stability, we will need to pay attention to all of these things and\nadjust policy accordingly. And because the economy is dynamic, we will need to do this on an\nongoing basis. We have to constantly calibrate our stance of policy to meet evolving conditions.\nA Job Fully Done\nWhile resolute and mindful are not in conflict, there is a tension. And that’s what we want in\npolicymaking.\nWe want to go far enough that we get the job done. That’s the resolute part. But not so far that\nwe overdo it. And that’s the mindful part.\nSo, we will march unwaveringly toward our goals. Resolute and mindful, until the job is fully\ndone.\nThank you.\n7\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2020. “Monetary Policy Report.” June 12.\nBoard of Governors. 2021a. “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.” November 3.\nBoard of Governors. 2021b. “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.” December 15.\nBoard of Governors. 2021c. “Chair Powell’s Press Conference.” December 15.\nBoard of Governors. 2022a. “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.” November 2.\nBoard of Governors. 2022b. “Chair Powell’s Press Conference.” November 2.\nChoi, Jason, Taeyoung Doh, Andrew Foerster, and Zinnia Martinez. 2022. “Monetary Policy Stance Is\nTighter than Federal Funds Rate.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2022-30 (November 7).\nDaly, Mary C. 2019. “A New Balancing Act: Monetary Policy Tradeoffs in a Changing World.” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2019-23 (September 3).\nDaly, Mary C. 2022. “The Singularity of the Dual Mandate.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2022-27 (October 3).\nHavranek, Tomas, and Marek Rusnak. 2013. “Transmission Lags of Monetary Policy: A Meta-Analysis.”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking 9(4), pp. 39–75.\nHoops, Matthew, and Robert Kurtzman. 2021. “Accounting for COVID-19 Related Funding, Credit,\nLiquidity, and Loan Facilities in the Financial Accounts of the United States.” Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors FEDS Notes, July 30.\nKiley, Michael T., and John M.

Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nAmerican Bankers Association\n2025 Conference for Community Bankers\nPhoenix, Arizona\nFebruary 18, 2025\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n1\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nIntroduction\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be here in Phoenix and an honor to be speaking to so many\ncommunity bankers. I should also say, welcome to the Twelfth Federal Reserve District. We are\ndelighted to have you!\nI am really looking forward to a great discussion. To get us started, I will provide a few opening\nremarks, reflections from my vantage point as a Reserve Bank President.\nAs presidents, my colleagues and I occupy a unique place in the conversation about banking and\ncommunity banks. We don’t have a role in regulatory or supervisory policy, nor a direct role in the\nexecution of these programs. These responsibilities reside with the Board of Governors.\nBut that doesn’t mean we don’t have insights. Reserve Banks house many of the teams that do\ndirect supervision. And Reserve Bank presidents spend considerable time talking to bankers and their\ncustomers as part of our economic and community outreach. All of this gives us perspective on the\nchallenges and opportunities for all banks, especially community banks.\nReflecting on these insights in preparation for this conference, a consistent theme emerges. And\nthat is the growing gap between how we talk about community banks—often extolling their virtues and\nimportance—and the environment we create for them through regulatory and supervisory frameworks.\nOf course, we all want a safe and sound banking system. Something we have here in the United\nStates. But we also want a banking system that supports innovation and growth, where banks, businesses,\nand households can thrive. To do both takes balance, ensuring that regulatory and supervisory practices\nmatch the risks to and the aspirations for our financial system.\nThat is the subject of my remarks today. Now before I go any further, it’s a good time to remind\nyou that the views I share today are my own and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\n2\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nA Growing Gap\nThe U.S. banking system is one of the most vibrant and diverse in the world. We have more than\n4,500 FDIC-insured institutions of varying sizes, geographies, focuses, and footprints.1 This creates a rich\nfinancial ecosystem that enables households and businesses to gain access to a broad array of financial\nservices, including credit.\nCommunity banks play a crucial role in this ecosystem, supporting almost every geography in\nAmerica.2 I see countless examples of how they are woven into the fabric of cities, towns, and\nneighborhoods across the Twelfth District and beyond. You can also see this in the data on community\nbanks, which consistently show the important role you play in providing essential financial services,\nparticularly to small businesses.3,4 Most notably, perhaps, community banks are there in good and\nchallenging times. The COVID response is a good example. Community banks stepped in to ensure that\nbusinesses new and old received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program.5,6 I know firsthand how\nimportant this lifeline was for many businesses.\nBut acknowledging importance is not enough to guarantee the future of community banks. We\nalso need a regulatory and supervisory framework that fits their size, complexity, and risk.\nMore and more we are hearing this is not the case. The 2024 Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors Survey of Community Banks7 found that concerns over regulatory burden remained elevated,\nand were nearly as high as concerns over the cost of funds. Looking at the data, you can see why banks\n1 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2024).\n2 There are over 4,000 community banking organizations in the U.S. with roughly $2.8 trillion in assets. Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (2024).\n3 Barca and Hou (2024).\n4 Holod, Peek, and Torna (2024)\n5 The Federal Reserve in concert with the U.S. Treasury also administered the Paycheck Protection Program\nLiquidity Facility (PPPLF). The Paycheck Protection Program and PPPLF aided the liquidity positions of\ncommunity banks and encouraged lending to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lopez and Spiegel\n(2023).\n6 James, Lu, and Sun (2021).\n7 Conference of State Bank Supervisors (2024).\n3\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nare feeling the pressure. A 2020 FDIC study showed that from 2008 to 2019, federal financial regulators\nissued 157 final rules and programs applying to community banks, an average of one every 28 days.8\nAll this adds up to an environment where community banking has become harder. Between\nincreased competition, compressed margins, and the growing costs of complying with regulation, it has\nbecome more challenging to become or stay a community banker.\nBalancing the Tradeoffs\nSo what do we do? I want to start with how I think about the tradeoffs in banking regulation.\nAnd here, I am going to look through the lens of my training as an economist.\nThe first thing to know is that the right answer is usually somewhere in the middle. The range of\ntradeoffs between a lot and a little regulatory oversight fall along a continuum. On one end, we can let\nbanks do whatever they want, with no constraints on behavior or risk taking. In theory, that would spur\ninnovation, encourage competition, and promote at least short-term growth. But it could also impose\nsignificant risks on customers, taxpayers, and the broader financial system. On the other end, we can try\nto regulate the risk out of the system. But that would bridle innovation, lending, and dynamism—things\nthat have made the U.S. financial system one of the best in the world.\nPublic commentary often focuses on these binary choices at the extremes. But that’s not where\nthe answer lies. The goal of regulation is not to remove all risk, but rather to ensure that banks manage it\nwell. The middle ground. To find the right place, you need a set of principles, and that is where I will\nfocus the rest of my time. These principles are not about banks per se, but rather about regulation and\nrisk.\nThe first principle is that the job of getting this right is never done. It’s a continuous process of\nevaluating and changing when necessary. That doesn’t mean we change things every second or every\n8 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2020).\n4\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nmonth, but rather that we recognize the world is a dynamic place, and we must adjust. This principle\nunderlies the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act.9 But it really is an ongoing\nprocess. Regulation is only as effective as our commitment to evaluating it.\nThe second principle is that the cost-benefit ratio for any regulation must pencil out. Every rule\nhas costs and benefits.10 That much we know. The question for policy makers is, does the benefit make\nthe cost worthwhile?\nAnd here, it is important to look beyond the average. Cost of compliance, and the benefits of any\nrule, will likely vary by bank size, complexity, and risk profile. Taking that heterogeneity into account\nensures that we get what we intend from regulatory policy and that we do so fairly, without unduly\nadvantaging or disadvantaging any single institution or group of institutions. This is the essence of\ntailoring and an essential element of right-sizing rules.\nAnd this brings me to the last principle. It is the sum of regulation that matters. To accurately\nmeasure the costs and benefits, we have to account for the cumulative impact. Rules and regulations are\nmade individually, but their effects are felt as a whole. This is particularly salient for community banks.11\nGetting it right in terms of costs and benefits requires this holistic view of how regulations add up.\nThese principles are not a playbook. They are a framing device to help us think about where we\nshould land along the regulatory continuum for banking.\nRegulations are tools. They need to balance protection of the consumer and the financial system\nagainst costs to financial institutions, innovation, and economic growth. And they need to recognize that\nnot all banks are the same. Carefully considered and appropriately tailored rules, that evolve as the\neconomy does, can ensure that banks of all sizes take appropriate risks and continue to thrive.\n9 The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (12 U.S.C. § 3311) requires agencies, with input\nfrom the public, to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify any outdated or otherwise\nunnecessary regulatory requirements applicable to their supervised institutions. Federal bank regulatory agencies will\nhold their next public outreach meeting on March 6, 2025.\n10 In talking about costs and benefits, I am abstracting from whether they accrued to the bank, the customer, or the\npublic.\n11 Dahl, Meyer, and Neely (2016).\n5\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nSumming Up\nRegulatory policy is meant to set guardrails. It should not pick winners and losers. That is the job\nof the marketplace.\nNo community banker I have ever spoken with wants a special deal, they just want a fair one. The\nonus is on us—those in the room, Reserve Bank presidents, regulators, and the public—to be sure that we\nmatch our practices with our ideals. The future of community banking depends on it.\nThank you and I look forward to our discussion.\nReferences\nBarca, Alaina, and Harry Hou. 2024. U.S. Bank Branch Closures and Banking Deserts.

    "text": "Price Stability Built to Last\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNational Association for Business Economics\nWashington, DC\nFebruary 16, 2024\n12:45 PM ET, 9:45 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThe day after the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, just a few\nmonths back, a man came up to me in the dry cleaner. He told me that he and his wife had\ngone to dinner the night before, partly to celebrate the end of the Fed’s rate tightening cycle,\nbut mostly to mark the end of the long, hard battle to bring inflation down. He felt the worst\nwas behind us, and that he and his family could finally take a breath.\nThe relief he described is not unique. I hear it everywhere. Businesses, communities, and\nfamilies exhaling, just a bit, as they see inflation falling without the economy breaking.\nThere is no doubt things are better. But progress is not victory, and we, the FOMC, need to\ndeliver more than a few fleeting moments of relief.\nOur goals are sustainable price stability and full employment, working together in a balance\nthat will last. There is more work to do to deliver on that commitment.\nToday, I will discuss the progress we have made, the risks we face, and what we will need to\ndo to finish the job.\n1\n\nAs always, let me remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nSignificant Progress\nSo, let’s start with progress. Relative to a year ago, the economy is in a very good place.\nInflation is heading down, the labor market is rebalancing, and many of the post-pandemic\ndisruptions are dissipating.\nThe inflation progress has been remarkable. In the latest personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation release,1 prices were up just 2.6 percent compared to a year ago. Still not price\nstability, but a lot of improvement from its peak of 7.1 percent back in June of 2022.\nA big part of the story on inflation has been supply. Global production, warehousing, and\ndistribution networks have largely returned to normal. Bottlenecks, wait times, and price\npressures have followed.2\nThese things aren’t surprising. They’ve just finally happened. And they’ve helped ease goods\nprice inflation substantially, bringing it back to near pre-pandemic levels.\nThe supply-side “surprise,” if you will, has been the positive news on labor and productivity.\nDefying all the pessimists, U.S. workers in the prime of their working age came back to work\nlast year, including women and mothers. This drove prime-age participation to its highest level\nin two decades.3 At the same time, we saw a surge in immigration.4 Both of these\ndevelopments boosted labor availability.\nBut we didn’t just have more workers, these workers also became more productive.\nProductivity growth picked up notably last year, surpassing its pre-pandemic trend.5\nTogether, these supply developments eased labor market tightness and helped to bring wage\ninflation closer to a level consistent with our 2 percent inflation target.6\n1 As of December 2023.\n2 See the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index for the latest data, and Liu and Nguyen (2023) for\nanalysis.\n3 See, for example, Prabhakar and Valletta (2024). Labor force participation surged for prime-age workers through\nmid-2023, reaching a historical high for women and reattaining the pre-pandemic peak for men.\n4 The share of foreign-born people in the U.S. labor force reached a new high in 2022, at 18.1 percent (Bureau of\nLabor Statistics 2023).\n5 Productivity growth in 2023 was 2.7 percent. By comparison, estimated trend productivity growth prior to the\npandemic was between 1 and 1¼ percent (Fernald and Li 2019).\n6 That level is estimated to be about 3½ percent. See, for example, Almuzara, Audoly, and Melcangi (2023).\n2\n\nBut perhaps the best news about the decline in inflation is that supply wasn’t the only story.\nImprovement also has come from a gradual slowing in demand, the portion that monetary\npolicy directly affects.\nWe hear this from our contacts and see it in surveys, but we can also quantify it using analysis\ndeveloped at the San Francisco Fed.7 The researchers focus on the PCE index and separate\nindividual price changes into those driven by demand, where prices and quantities move in\nthe same direction, from those driven by supply, where prices and quantities move in opposite\ndirections. Their analysis shows that about two-thirds of the decline in core inflation in 2023\ncame from the demand side. Demand played less of a role for headline PCE, where supplies of\nfood and energy drive a lot of the inflation dynamic.8\nPutting all of this together, it is clear that things changed in 2023. Supply bounced back, tighter\nmonetary policy gained traction, and inflation came down rapidly. For households and\nbusinesses, the treadmill of persistently high and rising inflation slowed down. All without a\nsignificant decline in growth or employment.\nThis is unequivocally good news, and real progress.\nMinding the Risks\nThe question is, should we expect it to continue. The modal outlook of many professional\nforecasters seems to say yes.9 The median of the December FOMC Summary of Economic\nProjections portrayed a similar view.10\nMost striking perhaps is the confidence that households, businesses, and markets show for\ncontinued progress on inflation. Among households, once elevated year-ahead inflation\nexpectations have fallen substantially and are now near pre-pandemic levels.11 Business\ninflation expectations have also improved. According to the Atlanta Fed Inflation Project,\nbusinesses see prices in the coming year rising just slightly above 2 percent, about the norm for\n7 Shapiro (2022a, b).\n8 For the full analysis and regularly updated series see Supply- and Demand-Driven PCE Inflation. See also Shapiro\n(2022a, b). Similarly, Guerrieri et al. (2023) argue that the rise and fall of energy prices in both the United States and\nthe euro area played an important role in shaping observed inflation patterns after the pandemic.\n9 See, for example, the February 2024 Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\n10 Board of Governors (2023).\n11 In the Michigan survey, year-ahead inflation expectations eased to 2.9 percent in January, the lowest value since\nDecember 2020 and within the 2.3 to 3.0 percent range reported during the two years prior to the pandemic. In the\nNew York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, one-year inflation expectations were 3.0 percent in January,\nsimilar to their level in 2018 through early 2019.\n3\n\nthat series.12 Financial markets have similar expectations—inflation around 2 percent at the\nend of the year.13\nOf course, projections and expectations are just that: views about what we think will happen.\nWe need more time and data to be sure that they will be realized. And we need to monitor\nrisks that could get in the way, especially since uncertainty is so high.\nThere is a myriad of risks to consider, but I will focus on two: slower inflation progress and\nfragilities in the labor market.\nOn inflation, there is a risk that the positive supply developments we saw last year might be\nhard to sustain. Labor force participation for prime-age workers is close to historical highs,\nand with the labor market cooling and wage gains slowing, we might not see additional\noutsized contributions coming from this group.14 The large influx of foreign-born workers also\nmay slow, further limiting labor force growth.15 I always bet on workers, but at this point, it is\nhard to predict, and it does pose a risk to further rapid reductions in inflation.\nThe same is true of productivity growth. It’s highly uncertain whether we will continue to see\nthe strong numbers of last year. There are many reasons to be optimistic, but productivity\ntrends are notoriously hard to forecast, and at this point, we just can’t be sure.\nAnd of course, we live in a dynamic world, and there are always new shocks, like disruptions in\nthe Red Sea and Panama Canal, to disrupt supply. I know this was a concern you mentioned in\nthe NABE survey.16 Although not currently binding, these challenges may impair goods\ndistribution and push up costs in the future.\nOn the demand side, momentum remains a risk, especially among consumers. We’ve\nrepeatedly expected spending to slow, only to be wrong. Ongoing economic momentum that\noutstrips available supply remains a risk to the inflation outlook.\nBut slower progress on inflation is not the only risk we face. On the other side of our mandate,\nthe labor market could falter.\n12 See the Atlanta Fed’s Business Inflation Expectations survey.\n13 Based on updated analysis from Mertens and Zhang (2023).\n14 Prabhakar and Valletta (2024).\n15 For example, the Congressional Budget Office (2024) expects immigration flows to be little changed in 2024 and\nthen decline somewhat in 2025-26, returning to historic averages after that.\n16 See NABE Economic Policy Survey: February 2024.\n4\n\nLet me be clear. We do not see that right now. So far, labor market conditions have eased\nwithout a rise in unemployment. In technical terms, we’ve been sliding down the steep portion\nof the Beveridge curve, where changes in labor demand reduce vacancies without reducing\njobs and pushing up unemployment.17 As the vacancy rate gets closer to its pre-pandemic\naverage, these favorable conditions could end, and the tradeoff between falling labor\ndemand and unemployment could be more stark.\nOf course, with employment growth as strong as it has been, this seems like a distant risk. But\ngiven the speed at which labor market pivots historically occur, it’s a risk we must keep in mind.\nFinishing the Job\nSo that’s the landscape. The economy is healthy. Price stability is within sight. But there is\nmore work to do.\nTo finish the job will take fortitude. We will need to resist the temptation to act quickly when\npatience is needed and be prepared to respond agilely as the economy evolves.\nThis is not a new situation for the Fed or any central bank. Uncertainty is a fact of life. The\neconomy rarely signals exactly where it is headed.\nThe constant in our changing environment is our goals. They are always sustainable price\nstability and full employment for a healthy economy.\nAnd these are more than just words, a fact I’m reminded of nearly every day.\nAfter the dry cleaner last December, I went to the hardware store. I was standing in line\nbehind a dad and his college-age daughter. When the total rang up, the dad asked the\ncashier why it was so high.

Indeed, the Current Population Survey (CPS) is the only national data\nsource that offers detailed work and income questions and consistently asked measures of\ndisability over a 20-year period. Despite its widespread use in the literature, the CPS and surveys\nlike it have come under attack of late, with critics discounting the results of any research obtained\nfrom such data. We put these criticisms in perspective by systematically examining what the CPS\ndata can and cannot be used for in disability research. Based on comparisons with the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS), a data set with much more information on health than the CPS,\nwe find that the work limitation-based definition of disability available in the CPS underestimates\nthe size of the broader population with health impairments in the NHIS, but that the employment\ntrends in these two populations in the NHIS are not significantly different from one another. We\nthen show that the trends in employment observed for the NHIS population defined by self-\nreported work limitation are not statistically different from those found in the CPS. Based on\nthese findings, we argue (1) that the CPS and other nationally representative employment-based\ndata sets can be used to monitor trends in outcomes of those with disabilities and, (2) that the\ndramatic decline in the employment of people with disabilities we describe in the CPS during the\n1990s is not an artifact of the data.\n\nSelf-Reported Work Limitation Data: What They Can and Cannot Tell Us\nThe aging of the population and the growing number of individuals supported on public\ndisability programs has made the accurate monitoring of the population with disabilities an\nimportant research and policy issue. Indeed, a large body of research has developed documenting\ntrends in disability prevalence and active life expectancy (see for example Bound and Waidman\n1992, Crimmins, Saito, and Ingegneri 1997, Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito 1994, Hayward and\nHeron 1999, Kruse 1998, Lakdawalla, Bhattacharya, and Goldman 2001, McNeil 1993, 2000,\nand Verbrugge 1984). Other research has linked disability status to various social and economic\noutcomes such as labor force participation and retirement (Hayward and Grady 1990, Stern 1989,\nParsons 1980) and disability benefit usage (Burkhauser and Daly 1996, Bound and Burkhauser\n1999). Most recently, information on disability status has been used to examine the effectiveness\nof public policies targeted towards those with disabilities, e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(ADA) and the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income\nprogram (SSI) (see especially Acemoglu and Angrist 2001, Autor and Duggan 2001, Bound and\nWaidmann 2002, Burkhauser, Daly, and Houtenville 2001, DeLeire 2000).\nInformation on disability status used in such studies typically comes from questions based\non whether a health limitation prevents individuals from working or limits their ability to work full\ntime or to do certain jobs. Numerous scholars have questioned the validity of such data for\nmeasuring disability, arguing that it is subject to idiosyncratic variations due to differences in\nskills, attitudes, and the environment (see Bound and Burkhauser 1999, and Moore 2001 for\nreviews of this literature). Others have argued that work limitation questions neither capture the\n-1-\n\nactual population with disabilities (Hale 2001) nor its employment trends (Kaye 2002, Kirchner\n1996, Kruse and Schur 2000, McNeil 2000). Kirchner (1996) hypothesized that changes in\ncultural perceptions over time likely bias trends in disability status obtained from such measures.\nFinally, some researchers have pointed out that even if the questions are valid, their effectiveness\nin obtaining accurate disability information may differ depending on the design and intent of the\nsurvey. For example, a work limitation question in a health survey may illicit different answers\nthan a work limitation question in an employment survey (Hardy and Pavalko 1986).\nIn this paper we examine the usefulness of work limitation measures of disability. We\nbegin by investigating whether work limitation questions can be used to monitor trends in\ndisability, using as a benchmark some more precise measures of health status available in the\nNational Health Interview Survey (NHIS). We then examine whether the same work limitation\nquestion is equally effective when it appears in the employment-oriented Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) as when it appears in the health-oriented NHIS. We test the effectiveness of work\ndisability data on two fronts, first in its ability to track the prevalence of disability and second in\nits ability to track employment—an important measure of social and economic well-being for the\npopulation with disabilities. We find that although work limitation questions underestimate the\nsize of the broader population with health impairments they can be used to monitor trends in\noutcomes, such as employment, for those with disabilities. Thus, we conclude that the dramatic\ndecline in the employment of working-age people with disabilities captured by the work\nlimitation-based disability questions in the CPS is not an artifact of the work limitation question or\nof the CPS data, but is consistent with trends found in the NHIS using both work limitation-based\nand impairment-based definitions of disability.\n-2-\n\nDefining and Measuring the Population with Disabilities\nDefinitions of Disability\nEvaluation of the population with disabilities must start with a definition of that\npopulation. Unfortunately, unlike age or gender, which are relatively straightforward and easily\ndetermined demographic characteristics, disability has proven to be a far more controversial\nconcept to define and measure. Although there is no universal agreement on the most appropriate\ndefinition of the population with disabilities, it is possible to place the various definitions used in a\ncommon conceptual framework. The most frequently applied model of disability comes from\nNagi (1965, 1969, 1991). In the Nagi model, disability is a dynamic process in which an\nindividual’s pathology interacts with the socioeconomic environment.1 The dynamic nature of the\ndisability process is represented by the movement through three stages: pathology, impairment,\nand disability. The first stage, pathology, is the presence of a physical or mental condition that\ninterrupts the physical or mental process of the human body. An example is deafness. This leads\nto the second stage, impairment, which Nagi defines as a physiological, anatomical, or mental\nloss or abnormality that limits a person’s capacity to function. For example, deafness limits the\nability to interpret sound. The final stage, disability, is an inability to perform or a limitation in\nperforming roles and tasks that are socially expected. For example, a person with deafness is\nunable to use the telephone. Under the Nagi model, those with a pathology that causes a physical\nor mental impairment that subsequently limits one or more life activities—such as work—but who\n1The World Health Organization (WHO) has a model of disability very similar to that of Nagi.\nThe key to both of these definitions is the recognition that individuals move from the presence of a health\ncondition to a point where it begins to impinge on activities that are socially expected of them and that this\nmovement is related to the environment in which individuals live. See Jette and Badley (2000) for an\nexcellent comparison of the Nagi and WHO models.\n-3-\n\nnevertheless work would not be considered to have a work disability.2 (This is the case whether\nwork was possible though changes in the work environment, access to rehabilitation, or individual\nadaptability.)3\nTracking the Population with Disabilities Using National Survey Data\nThe NHIS and CPS Data\nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is an annual cross-sectional survey of\napproximately 100,000 non-institutionalized civilians conducted by the U. S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. Useful and comparable data are available from 1983 through 1996; the\nNHIS was changed substantially in 1997, making time-series comparisons after 1996\nquestionable. The NHIS contains a standard work limitations question: \"Does any impairment or\nhealth problem now keep [person] from working at a job or business? Is [person] limited in the\nkind or amount of work [person] can do because of any impairment?\" A person with an\naffirmative response to either question is considered to have a work limitation. This type of\nquestion is consistent with the Nagi framework of disability developing from a pathology that\nlimits a social activity—work—but may systematically miss people with pathologies and\nimpairments who are nevertheless working and do not consider themselves to be work-limited.\nThis question has been used by numerous researchers to study trends in disability and active life\nexpectancy (see, for example, Crimmins et al. 1989, 1997, Verbrugge 1991, Hayward and Heron\n1999).\n2This measure closely resembles what Verbrugge (1990) calls social disability, or the intersection\nof an individual’s physical impairment (e.g., deafness) and the environmental challenges of the activities\nrequired by a social role, such as work.\n3For example, a person with deafness who is accommodated at the workplace with a TTY machine\nthat permits him or her to use the telephone.\n-4-\n\nIn addition, the NHIS contains detailed impairment-specific information (e.g., \"deaf in\nboth ears,\" \"blind in both eyes,\" etc.) on a subset of survey respondents. Individuals in this NHIS\nsubsample are asked directly about specific impairments. This allows us to capture a random\nsample of the population with a given set of impairments including those who, despite their\nimpairment, report that they do not have a work limitation. These data also have been used in\nstudies of health and disability.\nLike the NHIS, the CPS is a large annual cross-sectional survey; the CPS annually surveys\napproximately 50,000 households (about 150,000 non-institutionalized civilians). Unlike the\nNHIS, the CPS was not designed specifically to follow health trends in the U.S. population, but\nrather is the main source of official employment and income statistics in the United States. In\n1981 the March Demographic Supplement of the CPS began to ask a question about work\nlimitations: \"Does anyone in this household have a health problem or disability which prevents\nthem from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do? [If so,] who is that?\n(Anyone else?)\" The work limitation question appears as one of the screeners for the non-\ngovernment disability income questions.\nAlthough the CPS is a cross-sectional survey, it does interview respondents over the\ncourse of a year. Specifically, the CPS follows housing units over a four-month period and then\nreturns eight months later to follow them for another four months. This allows for matching of\nhousing units and multi-period analysis. A subsample of the households administered the March\nSupplement are asked the work limitation question in two consecutive years (March to March).\nWe use these individuals to construct a “matched” CPS sample and define those with work\nlimitation-based disabilities as those who respond positively to the question in March of two\n-5-\n\nconsecutive years. We use the CPS matched sample to check the robustness of the CPS cross-\nsectional results based on single-period disability.\nIn both the NHIS and CPS analyses we restrict our sample to adults between the ages of\n25 and 61, inclusively. This restriction reduces the risk of noise (due to entry from school or exits\nto retirement) in the employment variable we use to compare disability measures across data sets\nand over time. Throughout the paper we refer to our sample as working-age adults.\nEmpirical Relationships among Tractable Disability Populations\nDifferences in Levels across Disability Populations. To begin to assess whether the\npopulation with disabilities defined by the self-reported work limitation question is a reasonable\nproxy for the population with significant impairments, we focus on the relationship between the\nbroad population that reports having an impairment and the subset of this population that reports\na work limitation. This analysis relies on the two components of the NHIS survey described\nearlier.4\nTable 1 shows the prevalence of self-reported work limitations among working-age men\nand women with various impairments using a pooled NHIS sample (1983-1996) of these\nindividuals.5 (See Houtenville 2001 for a detailed description of the NHIS data used in our\nanalysis.) The first cell in column one indicates the percentage of men and women who report\nhaving any of the impairments in the list. The remaining cells in column one show the percentage\n4It should be noted that there is some debate about whether self-reported pathology and\nimpairment-based measures of disability accurately identify the true population with disabilities (Baker,\nStabile, and Deri, 2001).\n5The NHIS comparisons are based on a representative one-sixth subsample of respondents for the\nyears 1983-1996. Because the prevalence of specific impairments is very low in any given year, we must\npool the NHIS data over a number of years to establish a sample size sufficient for analysis.\n-6-\n\nof men and women who say they have that specific impairment. Columns three and five show the\npercentage of those with the listed impairment(s) who report having (column 3) or not having\n(column 5) a work limitation.\nIn general, these results show that the population with impairments is substantially\nunderstated by estimates based on the work limitation question in the NHIS. While the severity of\nthe impairment explains much of the variance in work limitations in columns 3 and 5, it does not\nexplain all of it. For example, among those who report being deaf in both ears or blind in both\neyes—impairments many would expect to be work limiting—only 38 (69) percent, respectively,\nalso report being “unable to work or to be limited in the kind or amount of work they do.” This is\nconsistent with the notion that the self-report of a work limitation may be influenced by the work\nenvironment, rehabilitation opportunities, or the inner capacity of individuals to overcome both\ntheir impairments and the barriers to work.\nTo investigate whether this misestimation of the level of disability translates to outcome\nmeasures, Table 1 also shows employment rates for the three groups. Column 2 reports the\nemployment rates of men and women who say they have one of the impairments on the list.\nColumns 4 and 6 show the employment rates of those with an impairment who report having\n(column 4) or not having (column 6) a work limitation. As illustrated in the first row, controlling\nfor having an impairment, those who say they are not work limited are much more likely to be\nemployed (employment rate of 83.4%) than those who say they are work limited (employment\nrate of 41.5%). Returning to the specific examples of those deaf in both ears or blind in both\neyes, those who report these impairments but report no work limitation are 2.07 (4.0) times more\nlikely (ratio of column 2 to column 3), respectively, to be employed than such persons who do\n-7-\n\nreport a work limitation. This suggests that using a work limitation question to define the\npopulation with disabilities systematically excludes individuals with significant impairments who\nare sufficiently integrated into the workforce that they do not report a work limitation. These\nresults suggest significant bias from using work limitation data to measure the level of\nimpairments in the overall population or the employment rates of the population with impairments\nDifferences in Trends across Disability Populations. Having established that there are\nsignificant and systematic differences in population and employment levels of those self-reporting\nimpairments and work limitations we now turn to an examination of the trends in these variables.\nFigure 1 compares the trends in the prevalence of impairments and the prevalence of work\nlimitations in the NHIS between 1983 and 1996 for men (women). Note that in this analysis we\nfocus on two separately identified populations. The first is the population of working-age men\n(women) who report having any of the impairments listed in Table 1. The second is the group of\nworking-age men (women) self-reporting a work limitation; these men (women) may or may not\nreport a specific impairment.\nFigure 1 shows that although the trends in impairment- and work limitation-based\ndisability prevalence in the NHIS exhibit some of the same movements, they do not always follow\neach other. For example, in the 1990s the prevalence of impairments was falling while the\nprevalence of work limitations remained relatively stable. To test whether these differences are\nsignificant we regress disability prevalence rates (pooled sample across measures) on an indicator\nvariable (indicating whether the prevalence estimate comes from the impairment or work\nlimitations question), a higher-order polynomial time-trend, and the interactions of the time trend\nand the indicator variable. We then test the joint significance of the interaction terms using an F-\n-8-\n\ntest. Based on this method, we find no significant differences between the time-trends in disability\nprevalence for men. However, we fail to accept the hypothesis that the trends for women are the\nsame across the two measures. (A fuller discussion of the tests used here and elsewhere in this\npaper together with the actual results can be found in Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville, and Nargis\n2001.)\nWhat should we make of these findings? First, based on our statistical analysis, we cannot\nsay the trends in prevalence of impairments and work limitations for men are different, suggesting\nthat while the work limitation question cannot capture the level of impairment-based disability, it\ndoes track the trend over time. The same cannot be said for women. However, as Figure 1\nshows, the divergence in the two measures goes in a direction opposite the one in which critics of\nwork limitations measures focus (e.g., Kirchner, 1996). Namely, during the 1990s, the prevalence\nof work limitation-based disability moved closer to the prevalence of impairment-based disability,\nsuggesting that the work limitation-based measures may be capturing a greater, rather than a\nsmaller, share of the population with significant impairments.\nAs a final test for trend differences in our two NHIS disability populations, Figure 2\ncompares the employment rates of those self-reporting impairments with those reporting a work\nlimitation over the period 1983-1996. Again, the employment patterns across the two measures\nmirror each other, although with notable divergences from year to year. Most importantly for the\ncurrent debate over the employment trends of working-age people with disabilities (see Acemoglu\nand Angrist 2001, Bound and Waidman 2002, Hale 2001, Kaye 2002), the decline in employment\namong men and women during the 1990s is observed in both the impaired and the work-limited\n-9-\n\ndisability populations. Testing for differences in employment trends between the two populations\nwe find no significant differences in their estimated trends.\nDifferences in Trends across Data Sets. In this section we move away from comparisons\nof prevalence and employment of those with disabilities across measures and consider trends in\nthese variables across data sets. Figure 3 compares trends in the work limitation-based disability\nprevalence among working-age men (women) in the CPS, the matched CPS sample, and the\nNHIS. As the figure shows, the NHIS work limitation-based prevalence estimates are higher than\nthose from the CPS and the CPS-matched sample for men (women) in every year. The average\nannual prevalence of work limitation-based disability (1983-1996) among men was 8.1 percent in\nthe CPS-based estimates and 10.3 percent in the NHIS. The average annual prevalence of\ndisability among women over the same period was 7.4 percent in the CPS and 10.4 percent in the\nNHIS. The prevalence rates for the CPS-matched sample were smaller than for the CPS. These\ndifferences are statistically significant based on a t-test in most years of our study.\nThe main purpose of the CPS is to determine the employment and income of the U.S.\npopulation. The main purpose of the NHIS is to determine the health characteristics of the U.S.\npopulation. The difference in focus may explain part of the level of differences in self-reported\nwork limitations in the two data sets (Hardy and Pavalko 1986). To the extent that individuals\nalready focused on questions about their health would be more apt to disclose a work limitation\nthe NHIS would pick up a higher rate of reported disability. Likewise, to the extent that\nindividuals who are not in the labor force for other reasons do not consider themselves work-\nlimited, the question placement in the NHIS may elicit a greater response.\n-10-\n\nAgain, we also are interested in the extent to which the trends in prevalence observed in\nthe CPS are similar to those observed in the NHIS. Using the same test procedure applied earlier,\nwe find significant differences between the trends in the work limitations-based prevalence of\ndisability in the NHIS and the two CPS samples. Of the four comparisons, only the trends for\nmen in the NHIS and CPS-matched sample are not statistically different. The differences in trends\nin the prevalence of work limitations-based disability across our three data sources is somewhat\nsurprising and suggests that more data are needed to decide which source is best for accurate\nmonitoring of disability levels or trends.\nAlthough the prevalence trends clearly are different across the two data sets, we primarily\nare interested in whether the CPS can be used to follow employment trends for those with\ndisabilities. Figure 4 shows employment rates for men and women with work limitation-based\ndisabilities in the NHIS, CPS, and CPS-matched sample. As the figure shows, there is a much\ncloser relationship between employment rates for those with disabilities than was true for the\nprevalence rates. We find no significant differences in the employment trends (1983-1996) for the\nwork limitation-based populations of men (women) with disabilities in the NHIS and two CPS\nsamples.\nThus, despite significant differences in the level of self-reported work limitations between\nthe two data sets, the trends in employment found in the two CPS work limitation-based disability\npopulations are not significantly different from those found in the NHIS work limitation-based\ndisability population.\n-11-\n\nWhat Do Current Data Tell Us?\nTrends in Employment among Those with Disabilities in the 1980s and 1990s\nWe now focus on the current debate over the employment trends of working-age people\nwith disabilities. Table 2 shows the sensitivity of employment rates to economic fluctuations over\nthe past twenty years for working-age men and women with and without disabilities. To trace\neconomic outcomes of people with disabilities over the business cycle we focus on three years\nrepresenting peak or near peak points—1980, 1989, and 1999—and two years representing\ntrough points—1982 and 1991. An ideal analysis would make peak-to-peak comparisons (1979,\n1989, and the next business cycle peak). However, data constraints limit the choice of years\ncompared to 1980 (the first year of data with disability information), 1989 (the peak of the 1980s\nbusiness cycle), and 1999 (the latest year of data available). As the table shows, during the 1980s\nthe employment of men with and without disabilities was procyclical, falling with recession and\nrising with recovery. In 1980, the first year the economy began to slow, employment rates of men\nwith and without disabilities were relatively high—42.6 percent and 96.7 percent, respectively.\nEmployment for men with and without disabilities declined as the economy moved through a\nrecession, declining by about 2 percent for each group. Economic recovery once again boosted\nemployment rates among men, particularly those with disabilities. Between 1982 and 1989, the\nemployment rate among men with disabilities rose 5.1 percent, surpassing the 1980 peak. Tests\nfor differences in the levels and trends of employment between men with and without disabilities\nduring the 1980s show a significant difference in the level of employment, but no significant\ndifference in the trends.\n-12-\n\nIn the 1990s, the employment experiences of men with and without disabilities began to\ndiverge. For men without disabilities, the familiar procyclical pattern continued; employment fell\nas the economy moved into recession in the early 1990s but rebounded over the next seven years\nof economic growth (1992 to 1999). By 1999, the last year of available CPS data, the\nemployment of men without disabilities was near its 1989 peak level. In contrast, the employment\npattern of men with disabilities was quite different over the 1990s. Employment rates among men\nwith disabilities fell as the economy moved into recession, but then continued to fall during the\nexpansion, when job growth was substantial and the employment of men without disabilities was\nrising. By 1999 the employment rate of working-age men with disabilities not only had failed to\nreturn to its 1989 level but also was substantially below its 1992 trough year level. Overall,\nbetween 1989 and 1999, the employment rate of men with disabilities fell from 44.0 to 34.0\npercent, a decline of more than 25 percent. Tests for differences in the trends in employment\nduring the 1990s show a significant difference in the employment trends between men with and\nwithout disabilities, unlike during the 1980s (see Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville, Nargis 2002 for\ncomplete results from these tests).\nThe story for women is similar. The employment of women with and without disabilities\nwas constant in the early recession years of the 1980s business cycle and then increased\nsubstantially through the growth years that followed. However, as was the case for men, over the\n1990s business cycle the employment experience of women with and without disabilities began to\ndiverge. For women without disabilities, employment remained near its 1989 peak through the\nrecession years of the early 1990s and grew thereafter. In contrast, the employment rate of\nwomen with disabilities fell as the economy moved into recession and continued to fall, even over\n-13-\n\nthe recovery period. Statistical tests confirm that while there is a significant difference in the level\nof employment rates over the entire period, there is no significant difference in the employment\ntrends for women with and without disabilities in the 1980s. In contrast, and as for the sample of\nmen, there is a significant difference in employment trends in the 1990s (see Burkhauser, Daly,\nHoutenville, Nargis 2002 for complete results from these tests).\nTo test for the possibility that changes in the composition of the population reporting a\nwork disability are driving the results, we perform a simple shift-share analysis, controlling first\nfor changes in age, race, education, and household size, and then controlling for these\ndemographic changes and changes in employment rates. We find that if the composition of the\npopulation with disabilities was the same in 1999 as it was in 1980 or 1989 (in terms of age, race,\neducation, and household size), the economic outcomes for those with disabilities would be worse\nthan the ones actually found in the data (see Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville, Nargis 2002 for\ncomplete results from these tests). This suggests that our results are not an artifact of\ndemographic shifts, but rather the result of changing outcomes for those with disabilities.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nUsing data from the NHIS we show that a substantial share of working-age people who\nreport serious impairment do not report having a work limitation. We further show that those\nwith impairments who also report having a work limitation are far less likely to be employed than\nare people with the same reported impairment who do not report having a work limitation. This\nsuggests that work limitation questions like those in the CPS are likely to understate the\nprevalence of disability in the working-age population based on a broad impairment-based\nconceptualization and to understate the share of that population that is employed.\n-14-\n\nHowever, we also find that the employment trends in these two distinct conceptualizations\nof the working-age population with disabilities are not significantly different from one another.\nUsing NHIS data we find that the employment trends of this work limitation-based disability\npopulation are not significantly different from the employment trends of the larger impairment-\nbased population. Moreover, we find that while disability prevalence and employment rates found\nin the CPS data for this work limitation-based disability population are significantly different from\nthose found in the NHIS data, there is no significant difference between the trends in employment\nfound in these data sources. Based on these findings we argue that work limitation-based\nquestions are not the ideal way to identify the size of the working-age population with disabilities.\nHowever, we also argue that nationally representative employment focused data sets like the CPS\ncan be used to monitor trends in the employment outcomes of the working-age population with\ndisabilities.\nWith that in mind and using the work limitation-based measure of disability in the CPS, we\nfind that during the 1980s and the 1990s, employment outcomes for those without disabilities\nwere procyclical, falling during recessionary years and rising during years of expansion. While\nthis also was the case for working-age men and women with disabilities during the 1980s, it failed\nto hold for working-age men and women with disabilities in the 1990s. During the 1990s,\nemployment of men and women with disabilities fell continuously, declining in both recessionary\nand expansionary periods. These results suggest that recent studies using the work limitation-\nbased disability population in the CPS to examine the decline in the relative employment of men\nwith disabilities in the 1990s cannot be dismissed out of hand.\n-15-\n\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D. and J.

We\nexamine whether suicide risk is related to others’ income, holding own income and other\nindividual and environmental factors fixed. We estimate models of the suicide hazard using two\nindependent data sets: (1) the National Longitudinal Mortality Study and (2) the National Center\nfor Health Statistics’ Multiple Cause of Death Files combined with the 5 percent Public Use\nMicro Sample of the 1990 decennial census. Results from both data sources show that,\ncontrolling for own income and individual characteristics, individual suicide risk rises with\nothers’ income.\nKeywords: Relative income, interpersonal comparisons, interdependent preferences, suicide,\nhappiness, Keeping Up with the Joneses.\nJEL Codes: I31, D6, H0, J0\n-3-\n\nRelative Status and Well-Being: Evidence from U.S. Suicide Deaths\nI. Introduction\nDespite popular acceptance and growing empirical support, the idea that individuals\nassess themselves relative to others has been slow to diffuse into mainstream economic theory.\nA potential reason for the reluctant adoption is that the data used to illustrate the presence and\nimportance of interpersonal comparisons—classroom or laboratory experiments and subjective\nsurveys of happiness or life satisfaction—are themselves the subject of considerable debate.\nExperiments, by their nature, are contrived and frequently limited to very small samples. Self-\nreported happiness surveys, while capturing much larger samples, elicit responses that are\nsubjective and may be difficult to compare across individuals and over time. These criticisms of\nexperimental and happiness data have limited the acceptance of research findings on\ninterpersonal comparisons.\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative source of data, suicide deaths, for identifying the\nimportance of interpersonal comparisons and relative status. Treating suicide as a choice\nvariable regarding current life satisfaction and assessed value of future life, we examine the\nrelationship between suicide risk and own and others’ income using data from two independent\nsources: (1) the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) and (2) data from publicly\navailable death certificates combined with the 5 percent Public Use Micro Sample (PUMS) of\nthe 1990 decennial census. Consistent with data from experiments and happiness surveys, we\nfind that local area (county) median income, holding own income constant, is positively and\nsignificantly correlated with suicide risk. This result is robust to alternative specifications of the\n-4-\n\nempirical model and to attempts to reduce the impact of the relative income variable through\ncontrols for its potential correlates including geographic variation in the cost of living, access to\nemergency medical care, and errors in suicide reporting. We argue that additional omitted\npathways through which county income might affect suicide risks (e.g., better mental health care\nservices in higher income counties, endogenous mobility of individuals to counties where their\nrelative income is higher, and county income shocks that are correlated with unobserved non-\nincome shocks (as suggested in Luttmer 2005, for example) are more likely to reduce than\nincrease suicide risk, making our estimates an underestimation rather than overestimation of the\ncorrelations.\nHaving established the robustness of our baseline result, we exploit the richness of our\ndata and consider the association between relative income and suicide risk along two additional\ndimensions. First, we examine whether the relative income association holds for individuals\nacross the income distribution. Our results suggest that suicide risk rises with median county\nincome both for high-income and low-income individuals, although the effect appears to be\nsomewhat larger for the latter. Second, we consider whether relative income comparisons are\nlimited to individuals’ local geographic area, defined by county. The results indicate that age, in\naddition to local area, is a particularly relevant factor. In contrast, the broader geography of state\ndoes not appear to be a relevant comparison group.\nWe interpret our findings as consistent with the idea that relative income matters for\nmeasured happiness (unhappiness). Although our analysis is not able to rule out the possibility\nthat omitted variables are driving the association we find, the robustness of the results and the\nfact that it aligns with previous studies of relative income using experimental data and self-\n-5-\n\nreported happiness, lead us to conclude that suicide data are a reasonable source of information\nfor studies of interpersonal comparisons.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the empirical\nwork on relative income and utility and discuss how information on suicide fits into and expands\nthe literature. We lay out our theoretical motivation and describe our empirical strategy in\nSection 3. The data sets we construct and use are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we\npresent our main results and assess their robustness. A summary of our findings and the path for\nfuture work are laid out in Section 6.\n2. Previous Research\nFollowing early recognition of the importance of relative comparisons by Adam Smith,\nseveral economists have composed fuller treatments of the issue, including Veblen (1899),\nDuesenberry (1949), Easterlin (1974), Abel (1990), Galí (1994), Kahneman and Tversky (1996),\nFrank (2000), Becker and Rayo (2007), and others. These models of interdependent preferences\ngenerally posit that individuals care about both their own socioeconomic status (generally\ndefined by income, consumption, or wealth) and that of others. A growing empirical literature\non the subject has found evidence consistent with this view. Empirical investigations generally\ncan be grouped into two types. The first set consists of controlled experiments designed to elicit\nparticipants’ reactions to imposed hierarchies. In these experiments, performed on human and\nprimate subjects, researchers have looked for the subjects’ negative reactions to the extent of a\nhierarchy, i.e., “inequality aversion,” and for reactions to subjects’ relative placement within a\n-6-\n\nhierarchy, i.e., “interdependent preferences” (Engelmann and Strobel 2004; Brosnan and de\nWaal 2003; Alpizar, Carlsson, and Johansson-Stenman 2005). Although such experiments\nconsistently find that inequality and relative income matter, the relatively small sample sizes and\nartificial environments of these experiments make their results difficult to generalize. Moreover,\ntheir contrived nature frequently makes it difficult to distinguish inequality aversion from\nrelative income concerns.\nA second vein of the literature on interpersonal income comparisons comes from research\non responses to questions from subjective well-being (happiness and/or life satisfaction) surveys.\nA number of researchers have used the responses from these surveys to study the extent to which\nself-reported happiness or satisfaction is correlated with relative position, holding other factors\nsuch as own income constant.1 For example, Clark and Oswald (1996) use data on 5,000 British\nworkers to investigate whether worker satisfaction rates are inversely related to relative wages.\nA similar examination is done in Brown, et al. (2008), focusing on relative rankings of workers’\nwages rather than the relative wage ratio. Both studies find evidence that relative income matters\nto self-reported satisfaction. Along the same lines, several papers have expanded the potential\nreference group to which individuals are compared by combining individual data on happiness\nand income with variables on local, regional, and national income (Helliwell 2003; Luttmer\n2005; Tomes 1986; and Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2005). In general, these papers have found empirical\nsupport for the interpersonal income comparisons hypothesis.\nStill, serious concerns have been raised about the quality of data on self-reported\nhappiness (see, e.g., Brekke 1997, Osmani 1993, and Wilkinson 2007; see Bertrand and\nMullainathan 2001 for a broader critique of subjective survey data). Such concerns include\n-7-\n\nlanguage ambiguities (respondents may not all agree on the exact meaning of terms like\n“happiness” and “life satisfaction”), scale comparability (one person’s “very satisfied” may be\nhigher, lower, or equal to another person’s “satisfied”), ambiguity regarding the time period over\nwhich respondents base their answers, respondent candidness, and the difficulty of drawing\ncardinal inferences from ordinal survey responses. In addition, Diamond (2008) argues that\nhappiness data may be inappropriate for answering the relative income question in particular\nsince the question itself could be a relative one.2\nTherefore, although the results from subjective surveys and experimental studies seem to\nconfirm a role for theories of interdependent preferences, concerns about how representative the\nunderlying data are have hindered broader acceptance of the results. The suggestive findings\ncoupled with concerns about experiments and self-reported measures of happiness suggest that\nadditional methods of addressing the role of relative income are needed.\n3. Suicide Data as an Alternative\nWe propose that suicide data provide an alternative measure of happiness (unhappiness)\nwith several advantages over experiments and happiness surveys.3 First, suicide can be thought\nof as a revealed choice made by individuals who have examined the value of continuing to live\nversus not.4 In studies of consumer choice, using observed choices to infer preferences has long\nbeen considered preferable to relying on individual self-reports of preferences. Second, suicide\ndata are comparably measured across individuals and regions and over time. Third, in the United\nStates at least, data on suicides are publicly available and complete, covering the universe of\n-8-\n\nreported suicides by year.5\nThere is also a long history in sociology and economics of relating suicide patterns to\nmore universal social phenomena. The most complete example of such efforts is Durkheim’s\ndetailed empirical study of suicide. Durkheim’s (1951) Suicide: A Study in Sociology, originally\npublished in 1897, was a careful attempt to analyze the societal influences that affect suicidal\nbehavior and unhappiness more generally. More modern treatments in economics have also\ntreated suicide as a potentially social phenomenon, affected by both societal and individual\nfactors. Examples of this work include Hamermesh and Soss (1974), who develop an economic\ntheory of suicide and, using cross-country and cross-state data, find that suicide risk is\nsignificantly related to unemployment and decreases in permanent income. More recently,\nRuhm (2000) considers suicide as one of several causes of death and finds that, unlike other\nnegative health outcomes that decline during times of recession, suicide risk is either increased\nor unaffected. In other work, Helliwell (2007) investigates the empirical association between\nsubjective well-being and suicide rates using cross-country panel data and finds a strong negative\nrelationship.6 In a related survey article on happiness and economic factors, Oswald (1997)\nnotes that many variables positively (negatively) associated with reported happiness are\nnegatively (positively) associated with suicide risk.7 To our knowledge, though, we are the first\nto use information on suicide risk to study the existence and nature of interpersonal comparisons.\nDespite the above-mentioned advantages of using suicide data to address questions on\nindividual well-being and utility, and the demonstration of its usefulness from prior studies, there\nstill are a couple of potential concerns with using such data. First, it is possible that suicide\ndecisions are largely idiosyncratic and not systematically related to the variables that affect\n-9-\n\nhappiness or life satisfaction. While this concern cannot be eliminated a priori, it is testable: if it\nis binding then we should find no correlation between relative income (or other variables) and\nsuicide risk.\nSecond, and more importantly, suicide victims presumably are at the extreme tail of the\ndistribution of life satisfaction over the population, and their preferences may not reflect the\npreferences of the non-suicide population. Conceptually, we posit that suicide relates to\npopulation happiness as described in Figure 1, which is reproduced from Daly and Wilson\n(2009). The figure shows the happiness continuums for two individuals, i = A, B, as well as\ntheir suicide thresholds θ. As the schematic illustrates, our maintained hypothesis is that factors\ni\n(the vector X) affecting utility (U) have the same marginal effects (the vector β) on suicide risk\ni i\nas they do on happiness, but that thresholds (θ) for suicide differ across individuals. That is,\ni\nsuicide victims and the general population have the same β’s but different θ’s. Given this\nassumption, uncovering the marginal effects of variables on suicide then informs us about how\nthese variables affect happiness for the rest of the population. While the vast majority of the\npopulation never commits suicide, this theoretical construct suggests that factors that affect an\nindividual’s suicide risk also affect his or her overall happiness/unhappiness. In particular, we\ncan use data on suicide deaths to test hypotheses related to interpersonal comparisons.\nAdmittedly, without empirical examination one cannot know whether individuals who\ncommit suicide differ only in θ or in both θand β. To move toward this goal, Daly and Wilson\n(2009) conduct a cross-validation exercise using subjective well-being data and suicide and find\nevidence supporting the idea that β’s are the same between those who commit suicide and those\nwho do not. Specifically, they find that the relative risks of suicide along a host of dimensions\n-10-\n\n(such as education, income, age, marital status, and employment status) closely match the\nrelative risks of reported unhappiness. Based on these results we proceed as if the description in\nFigure 1 is reasonable and estimate an empirical model implicitly embedding these assumptions.8\nBefore turning to the results, in the next section we describe the data and report basic\ndescriptive statistics regarding suicide and its correlations with demographic, economic, and\ngeographic variables.\n4. Data, Sample, and Descriptive Statistics\n4.1 Data Sources\nTo analyze the relationship between relative income and suicide, we draw on two\ndifferent individual level data sets. Our primary data source is based on the National\nLongitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) augmented with data on county and state income from the\nU.S. Census Bureau. The NLMS data come from a confidential, restricted-use database\ndeveloped and maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau to facilitate research on the effects of\ndemographic and socioeconomic factors on mortality (see U.S. Bureau of the Census 2005).9\nThese data have been used extensively by epidemiologists and public health experts to study, for\nexample, cancer and heart disease, though they have been used less frequently by economists.\nThe NLMS consists of a set of cohort files, primarily from Current Population Surveys (CPS),\nmatched to the National Death Index (NDI), a national database containing the universe of U.S.\ndeath certificates since 1979. The cohort files included in our analysis – those with sufficient\ninformation on income – are March CPS files from 1979 to 1998, plus CPS files for February\n-11-\n\n1978, April 1980, August 1980, and December 1980. The matching process appends to\nindividual CPS records (1) whether the person has died within the follow-up period, (2) date of\ndeath (if deceased), and (3) cause of death (if deceased).10\nOur second source of data, which we use as a check on the results from the NLMS data,\ncombines the Multiple Cause of Death Files (MCD) for years 1989-1992, with data from the\n1990 5 percent Public Use Micro Sample (PUMS). We will refer to this data set as the MCD-\nPUMS data. The public use MCD files, compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics\nand available from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR),\nfor a given year are essentially the data from all death certificates recorded in the United States\nin that year (see U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1992). For the years 1989-\n1992, we extract the records where suicide is the cause of death (i.e., International Classification\nof Death, Rev. 9 (ICD9) codes E950-E959) and combine them with the individual records from\nthe PUMS 5 percent sample of the 1990 decennial census (Ruggles et al. 2004), which we treat\nas non-suicide observations. We extract suicides for 1989-1992, rather than just 1990, to\nmaximize the number of suicide observations, given that suicide is a relatively infrequent event.\nFor sparsely populated counties, the PUMS do not identify the county but instead identifies a\n“public use micro area,” or PUMA, that is an aggregate of counties (or, in some cases, parts of\ncounties). The final merged data set has over 500 geographic areas (counties or aggregates of\ncounties) spanning the entire U.S., though about 100 of those are dropped from our regressions\nbecause they have no reported suicides (in the nonhispanic 20 – 64 year old age range).\nBoth data sources have advantages and disadvantages. The NLMS data have a much\nsmaller sample of suicide and non-suicide records from which to draw inferences but contain\n-12-\n\nactual reported income and have no limitations on geographic coverage. In contrast, the MCD-\nPUMS data have the advantage of containing a very large number of observations from suicide\nvictims (as well as from the general population), but do not include household income and do not\nidentify county of residence for individuals from sparsely populated counties (i.e., those with\npopulations less than 100,000). We consider the NLMS data the preferred and main source for\nour examination, but use the MCD-PUMS to check key results and perform robustness checks\nnot available in the NLMS data. For one such robustness check (checking whether results are\nrobust to including county fixed effects), we additionally construct a balanced panel data set by\ncombining 1990 and 2000 MCD records with 1990 and 2000 5% PUMS records. Because the\nPUMAs in the 1990 PUMS are not defined the same as the 2000 PUMAs, the panel excludes\ngeographic areas that do not uniquely identify a county. (That is, it excludes PUMAs that are\naggregates of multiple small counties.)\n4.2 Sample and Analysis Variables\nTo correspond to previous research on interpersonal comparisons we restrict our analysis\nto working-age adults (20-64), for whom relative income concerns are likely to be most relevant.\nAlthough we make every attempt to match the sample and variables across data sets, such\nprecision is not always possible. Below we describe the exact selections for each data source and\nnote where differences emerge.\nIn the NLMS data, we restrict the sample to non-Hispanic working-age adults. Following\nstandard practice in NLMS research, we exclude Hispanics because of definitional changes in the\nHispanic status variable over time and concern that a nontrivial share of Hispanic CPS\n-13-\n\nrespondents may have moved out of the United States prior to the end of the follow-up period, in\nwhich case their deaths would not be observed.11 However, for completeness, we also run results\nwithout this exclusion and report them in the results section. The final data set, after excluding a\nrelatively small number of records with missing values for key variables, contains 957,939\nindividual records, including 74,929 non-suicide deaths and 1,544 suicide deaths within the\nfollow-up period (the remainder were still alive as of December 31, 1998).\nWe merge onto the NLMS data a number of geographic aggregates, most notably mean\nfamily income by county-year. The construction of these geographic aggregate variables is\ndescribed in Appendix A.\nThe variables jointly available in the MCD and the PUMS are age, race, sex, county of\nresidence (for counties with population above 100,000), marital status, education, and Hispanic\nstatus. Income, on the other hand, is not recorded on death certificates. We therefore estimate\nincome by matching suicide records in the MCD to individuals or groups of individuals in the\nPUMS data, where income is available. The matching procedure works as follows: (1) for each\nsuicide record, find all matching observations in the PUMS, matching on county, age, race, sex,\nHispanic status, education, and marital status; (2) calculate average family income for this\nmatching cell; and (3) assign this average income to the suicide observation. This procedure\nprovides a reasonably accurate estimate of income: over the 7,202,093 working-age observations\nin PUMS, county, age, race, sex, Hispanic status, education, and marital status jointly explain 24\npercent of the individual level variation in family income.12 A variance decomposition (not\nshown) reveals that county, education, and marital status (in decreasing importance) have the\ngreatest explanatory power, together accounting for 16 percent of the variation.\n-14-\n\nWith this matching procedure, we are able to estimate family income for 57 percent of\nU.S. working-age suicide records from 1989-1992 (and 76% of suicide records among counties\nwith population over 100,000), totaling 50,328 suicides.13 We use the same matching procedure\nto generate an analogous predicted income variable for the non-suicide records; this is the “own\nincome” variable used in our regression analyses. (Because the PUMS contains few missing\nvalues for the income-estimation variables, the match rate for non-suicide records from\nidentifiable counties is near 100%.) The final data set has 4,360,747 observations.\n4.3 Descriptive Statistics\nNational statistics show that the U.S. suicide rate has been relatively constant since 1950,\naveraging about 12 per 100,000 persons (see WHO 2005).14 Table 1 reports suicide risk overall\nand by our model variables for the NLMS and MCD-PUMS samples. Recall that both samples\nexclude Hispanics and cover only working-age adults. The overall suicide rates in the NLMS\nand MCD-PUMS are quite similar to each other, at approximately 13 per 100,000, and are\ncomparable to the national statistics. Furthermore, national data indicate considerable variation\nin suicide risk by gender, age, and race. These patterns are mirrored in the NLMS and MCD-\nPUMS samples. For example, suicide rates are far higher for males than for females and higher\nfor whites than for other races. Suicide rates decline slightly with age according to the MCD-\nPUMS while having no clear age trend in the NLMS sample, which may simply be due to the\nrelatively small sample size of the NLMS. In both samples, married individuals have a lower\nsuicide rate on average relative to those who are single/never married or divorced/separated.\nSuicide rates generally fall, though not monotonically, with educational attainment. Although\n-15-\n\nrudimentary, these categorical suicide rates suggest that the two data sources used in our analysis\nproduce patterns consistent with the stylized facts regarding suicide reported in the\nepidemiology/public health, psychology, and sociology literatures.\nThe key variables in our analysis are own and reference group income. To assess the\nextent to which preferences of the general population can be inferred from the revealed\npreferences of suicide victims, it is helpful to first compare these two populations along the key\ndimension of income. Figures 2 and 3 plot the distribution of predicted family income for\nworking-age suicide victims in our two samples against the income distribution for the general\nU.S. working-age population. Figure 2 shows the distributions of reported family income\n(adjusted to 1990 dollars) for the total sample and for the subset of those who eventually commit\nsuicide, according to the NLMS data. Note that the NLMS data are survey reports reflecting\nincome at the time the individual was surveyed rather than income at the time the suicide was\ncommitted. The income distribution of suicide victims is slightly left of that for the general\npopulation. That said, the bulk of the suicide population has income in the middle range of the\ndistribution. We take this as supporting evidence for the notion that suicide victims are broadly\nrepresentative of the general population, at least in terms of income (though the distribution for\nsuicide victims is somewhat more skewed). This will aid us when we offer an interpretation for\nour later findings.\nFigure 3 reports income figures for the MCD-PUMS sample; the figure shows the\ndistribution of estimated family income (estimated as described in Section 4 above) of suicide\nvictims compared to estimated family income of the general population.15 The distributions\nsuggest that the modal suicide victim sits slightly to the left of the modal member of the general\n-16-\n\npopulation, but overall the two distributions are quite similar. Importantly, there is little\ndifference in the lower tail of the income distribution and overall the shapes for the two\npopulations are roughly similar.16 The fact that the MCD-PUMS data show a pattern similar to\nthe NLMS data suggests that our estimated income data in the MCD-PUMS data set are\nreasonably accurate.\nTurning to county income, suicide risk has a strong negative correlation with county\nincome. One can see this in Figure 4 which shows a scatterplot of county suicide rates (from the\nMCD) and county income per family in 1990 across the 3,150 counties in the data. Each circle\nin the plot represents a single county and the size of the circle is proportional to the county’s\npopulation. The unweighted correlation is −0.07 and the population-weighted correlation is\n−0.29; both are significant at well below the 1% level. Note we also have confirmed that this\nnegative (unconditional) correlation between suicide risk and county income is present in the\nNLMS sample with a simple proportional hazards model of suicide risk regressed on county\nincome alone (results available upon request). Thus, it is clear that the positive effect of county\nincome on suicide risk that we find later in our multivariate results is not what one would expect\na priori.\nDescriptive statistics for other model variables are reported in Tables B1 (NLMS) and B2\n(MCD-PUMS) of Appendix B. Again, the key variables in our analysis are of similar\nmagnitudes and have similar patterns in both data sets.\n5. Empirical Model Specification and Results\n-17-\n\n5.1 Empirical Strategy\nBased on the intuition summarized in Figure 1 and the data described above, we estimate\na reduced form model of suicide risk and own and others’ income that closely matches those\nestimated using self-reported data on happiness. For the NLMS data, we estimate Cox\nproportional hazards models of suicide risk–i.e., the hazard rate of suicide in a given period–as\nan exponential function of own income, reference-group income, and a set of controls. We use\ntime-since-interview as the duration variable in our models.17 The estimated proportional\nhazards model is the suicide hazard (probability of suicide at time t given it has not already\noccurred) over the interval from 0 to T, where T is the maximum duration in the sample,\nconditional on individual covariates recorded at period 0.18 The structure of the NLMS means\nthat the vast majority of observations (individuals) are censored; the proportional hazards model\naccounts for this.19\nAnother approach would be to estimate a logit regression. In fact, the hazard regression\nis similar to a cross-sectional logit regression but with the advantages of accounting for\ncensoring and allowing the effects of the explanatory variables to decay over time. This decay\nallows for the fact that the values of an individual’s explanatory variables at the interview date\nwill be imperfect measures of the values of those variables at time t, the potential date of death,\ndue to the passage of time. For instance, the discrepancy between a CPS respondent’s income at\nthe time of the CPS and her income at the time of her death is likely increasing (in absolute\nvalue) in the duration between the two dates. A logit analysis, on the other hand, would treat as\nequivalent a suicide soon after the measurement of income (and other variables) and one long\nafter the measure of income. As a robustness check, we also estimate logit regressions where the\n-18-\n\ndependent variable is 1 if the individual ever commits suicide and 0 otherwise. As we show later\nin the paper, the results are qualitatively similar to those from the Cox proportional hazards\nmodel.20\nFor the MCD-PUMS data we estimate logit models. Because the Cox proportional\nhazards and logit both have exponential functional forms, it is straightforward to compare the\nresults between the two types of regressions.\nIn all regressions, standard errors are based on a variance-covariance matrix that is robust\nto heteroskedasticity and clustering within state. In the NLMS regressions we include time\n(survey year) fixed effects to capture any macro/aggregate factors that might affect suicide and\nbe correlated with own or others’ income. The inclusion of time fixed effects also allows us to\ninterpret the results as evidence of a cross-sectional correlation between suicide risk and the\nmeasured variables.21 Since the MCD-PUMS data is a single cross-sectional data source, time\neffects are not possible.22\n5.2 NLMS Baseline Regression Results\nThe estimated coefficients and standard errors for our baseline NLMS models are\nreported in Columns 1 – 4 of Table 2. Columns 1 – 3 are identical but for the income variables\nthat are included. Column 1 has (log) own family income measured as a single continuous\nvariable. Column 2 replaces this variable with income bracket indicator variables to allow for\nnon-linear income effects. Column 3 adds (log) county income per family. Column 4 adds\ncounty population shares by age category and race, to control for any correlation between county\nincome and county demographics. Before turning our attention to the estimated effects of\n-19-\n\nincome variables, we briefly discuss the relationship between suicide and our control variables;\nthe results are reported in panel C of the table. These results are similar across the four columns.\nConsistent with the raw categorical suicide rates in Table 1, being female or nonwhite lowers\nsuicide risk, while being divorced or widowed, separated, or never married raises suicide risk\n(relative to being married). Veterans are found to be more likely to commit suicide than\nnonveterans. There is little evidence of a conditional age profile to suicide risk, though the point\nestimates suggest perhaps a weak inverted-U age profile. Controlling for these other factors as\nwell as income, educational attainment lowers suicide risk.\nConsistent with previous findings on suicide risk and labor market status, we find that\nbeing unemployed or out of the labor force, for any reason, raises suicide risk relative to being\nemployed.23 Specifically, those who are unable to work have the highest suicide risk, followed\nby the unemployed, retired persons, and those who are employed but not currently working (e.g.,\npersons on furlough). In terms of magnitude, the estimated coefficient on unemployment of\n0.541 (from Column 1) implies a hazard ratio of 1.72 (e0.541), meaning that holding other factors\nconstant, suicide risk for an unemployed person is 72% higher than that of a person who is\nemployed and working. The patterns among the control variables vary little across different\nspecifications of the model. Thus, for the remainder of the paper, we confine our discussion to\nthe relationship between suicide risk and own and others’ income, the key variables in our\nanalysis.\nThe results of the income variables are reported in the upper portion of the table,\nbeginning in Panel A. The first column shows the importance of own family income, measured\nin logs. Own income is statistically significant and negative, implying that higher own income\n-20-\n\nlowers suicide risk. The coefficient on log own income of -0.087 suggests that a 10% higher\nincome is associated with 0.87% lower suicide risk. In column 2, we allow income to affect\nsuicide risk non-linearly, and find evidence of important differences across the income\ndistribution. In particular, individuals with family incomes below $20,000 in 1990 dollars\n(which, by way of reference, is equivalent to about $34,000 in 2010 dollars, based on the CPI-U)\nare significantly more likely to commit suicide than those with incomes above $60,000\n($102,000 in 2010 dollars). In contrast, suicide risk for those with incomes between $20,000 and\n$60,000 is not statistically significantly different than that of individuals with family income\nabove $60,000.24 The point estimates of the coefficients on the categorical income variables\nimply hazards ratios of 1.50, 1.43, 1.10, and 1.02, respectively, for income categories $0 -\n$10,000, $10,000 - $20,000, $20,000 - $40,000, and $40,000 - $60,000. The hazard ratio of\n1.50, for instance, means that an individual with family income less than $10,000 (in 1990\ndollars) is 50 percent more likely to commit suicide than an individual with income above\n$60,000 (the omitted income category). The hazard ratios decline monotonically, but at a\ndiminishing rate, toward 1.0 as income approaches the omitted top category (for which the\nhazard ratio is implicitly 1.0). This pattern is consistent with the standard assumption of\ndiminishing marginal utility of income/consumption, and also qualitatively consistent with recent\nfindings in the subjective well-being (SWB) literature such as Kahneman and Deaton’s (2010)\nresult that daily mood increases with income up to $75,000 (2008-2009 dollars) and then is flat.\nGiven this evidence of a non-linear income gradient for suicide risk, we use this model going\nforward.\nColumn 3 of the table displays results of adding reference group income. Following\n-21-\n\nprevious work on interpersonal income comparisons, we use county of residence to define\nreference group income. The results show that county income has a positive effect on suicide\nrisk controlling for own income. Our estimated coefficient of 0.453 on log county income\nimplies that, holding own income constant, a 10% higher county income is associated with about\na 4.5% higher suicide hazard relative to the baseline hazard (conditional mean hazard).25\nThough the results on own income point to a non-linear income gradient, this\nspecification of own income does not allow for a natural comparison of the magnitudes of the\ncounty income effect and the own income effect. In a separate regression not shown here\n(results available upon request) containing the single log own income variable and log county\nincome, we find the county income coefficient to be larger than that of own income (in absolute\nvalue).26 However, this comparison is probably misleading as the coefficient on own income is\nlikely biased downward due to measurement error in income and the inclusion of other variables\nwhich are highly correlated with income. 27 Later in the paper, we confirm this finding using the\nMCD-PUMS sample which is less prone to the potential bias in income since the own income\nmeasures is by construction a fitted value from a first-stage estimation using PUMS data.\nIn the next column, we add controls for county demographic composition that might be\ncorrelated with both increased suicide risk and higher county income. The findings are\nqualitatively equivalent, although including these controls increases the magnitude of the\ncoefficient on county income to 0.596.28 The final two columns of Table 2 check the robustness\nof the results to the exclusion of Hispanics from the sample and suicide misclassification.29 In\nneither case does the change affect our baseline findings. Including Hispanics in the sample\nreduces the magnitude of the coefficients on all income variables slightly but does not change the\n-22-\n\npattern or statistical significance of these variables. Broadening the measure of suicide to\ninclude deaths from “injuries of undetermined cause” (ICD9 codes E980-E989), which some\nscholars have suggested may capture suicides that were not correctly classified as such, has no\nnotable impact on the coefficients of own or county income.30\nThe findings in Table 2 imply that controlling for other factors, including own income,\nindividuals living in higher income areas face greater suicide risk than those living in low\nincome areas. This finding is consistent with results of studies using happiness survey data\nwhich suggests that a loss of relative position leads to a reduction in individual happiness (see\nLuttmer 2005). Still, several other explanations or pathways for county income affecting suicide\nrisk are possible; we examine these alternative explanations in the next section.\n5.3 Alternative Explanations for NLMS Results\nCost-of-living differences.\nOne potential alternative explanation for the results reported in Table 2 is that the positive\neffect of county income on suicide risk is explained by county income simply being a proxy for\ncost of living, so that, conditional on nominal own income, individuals are made worse off by\nliving in areas with higher costs, especially costs on nontradables such as housing. We control\nfor this alternative explanation in two ways: state fixed effects and controls for county-level\nhouse prices. The results of these tests are reported in Table 3; for convenience of comparison,\nour preferred model from Table 2 is repeated in column 1.\nThe first test is to add state fixed effects to our baseline regression. The logic is that\n-23-\n\nregional differences in cost of living, associated with location, tax structures, etc., will be\ncaptured at the state level and pulled out in the state fixed effect. To the extent that these cost of\nliving differences are driving our results, the coefficient on county income should fall or become\ninsignificant. The coefficient on county income falls, from 0.596 in the baseline, to 0.390 when\nstate fixed effects are included, but remains statistically significant. The coefficients on own\nincome are qualitatively unchanged.\nThe second test exploits the fact that the cost of housing is likely the most important\ncomponent of cost of living differences across areas. Column 3 reports results from adding a\ncounty quality-adjusted house price index (described in Appendix A) to our baseline regression.\nGiven the quality adjustment, this index reflects the average cost of land in a county (in a given\nyear) as well as any differences across counties in construction costs. The inclusion of the index\ndrives up the coefficient on county income, while the coefficients on own income remain\nqualitatively unchanged. The coefficient on the index of housing costs is negative, suggesting\nthat suicide risk is lower in counties with higher housing costs, perhaps because these costs\nreflect positive area amenities capitalized in local land values.31 Based on these checks we\nconclude that our results are not driven by disutility of higher costs of living.\nCounty Income and Mortality.\nTwo other potential explanations of the positive correlation between county income and\nsuicide are that it reflects a relationship between county income and the quality of local\nemergency medical care or a more general relationship between county income and mortality.\nThe results in columns 4 and 5 are designed to address these concerns. Column 4 reports results\n-24-\n\nfrom a regression in which heart attack risk (acute myocardial infarction, ICD9 code 410)\nreplaces suicide risk as the dependent variable. The use of heart attack deaths is meant to test\nwhether our results on suicide risk owe to differential quality of or access to emergency room\ncare or paramedical care, rather than to behavioral reactions to relative income. Research has\nshown that heart attack deaths are strongly correlated with time to treatment (e.g., proximity to\nemergency rooms). If our results on suicide are due to unequal access to emergency rooms such\nthat attempted suicides more frequently end in death, then we should see the same pattern for\nheart attack deaths. This is not the case. Indeed, while the mortality hazard from heart attacks\nfalls monotonically with own income, as with suicide, it also falls with county income, contrary\nto suicide. The final column of the table repeats this analysis using all causes of mortality. Our\nfindings concur with the standard result in the literature (see, e.g., Miller and Paxson 2006 and\nGerdtham and Johannesson 2004): mortality falls monotonically with own income and is\nunaffected by relative income.\nBased on these results, we conclude that our finding of a positive effect of local area\nincome on suicide, after controlling for own income, likely reflects a behavioral response to\nunfavorable interpersonal income comparisons.32 These individual level results are consistent\nwith earlier, semi-aggregate results for suicide risk (Daly and Wilson 2006) and with recent\nempirical analyses using self-reported, subjective well-being survey data (Luttmer 2005).\n5.4 NLMS Extensions\nHaving established a robust relationship between suicide risk and own and others’\nincome, we now turn to extensions of the baseline specification and the interpersonal income\n-25-\n\nliterature more generally. Table 4 displays the results of these extensions; for convenience, the\nfirst column repeats the results from our baseline specification. We first consider whether\ncounty of residence is the more relevant reference group than state of residence. 33 The results\nshow that state family income has no significant effect on suicide risk. Next, we ask whether the\nrelative income effect varies over the income distribution. To do so, we interact the categorical\nincome variables with county income. The results are shown in the third column of the table,\nPanel B. While the small sample size limits the statistical power in this regression, the higher\npoint estimates of the interactions involving the lower income categories are suggestive of a\nstronger effect for those at the bottom of the income distribution than for those at the top.\nFinally, we consider whether the relative income effect differs by gender and race. To do\nso, we interact log county income with gender dummies and race dummies. These results are\nshown in the final two columns of the table, respectively. The results suggest that women are\nmore responsive to relative income than men and that whites are more responsive than nonwhites\n(though these differences are not statistically significant at conventional levels).\n5.5 MCD-PUMS Baseline Regression Results\nAlthough the NLMS results provide consistent evidence of the effect of county income\non suicide risk, one might still be skeptical of this result given the relatively small number of\nsuicides in the NLMS data. To try to address this issue, we turn to an alternative data source, the\nMCD-PUMS described earlier. As noted, the MCD-PUMS data combine suicide records from\ndeath certificate data with individual records from the PUMS 5% sample of the 1990 decennial\ncensus. Using these data, we estimate a set of regressions that are as analogous as possible\n-26-\n\n(given the data available in the MCD-PUMS) to the NLMS models.\nWe estimate logit models of the probability of committing suicide as a function of (log)\nestimated own family income, (log) county income per family, and various controls, including\nstate fixed effects. These models include the same control variables as those in the NLMS\nregressions except education, labor market status, veteran status, and county characteristics (i.e.,\ndemographic population shares and population density). Labor market and veteran status are not\nrecorded on death certificates and hence are unavailable in the MCD-PUMS data set. We omit\neducation to avoid multicollinearity with predicted income, given that, after county (PUMA) of\nresidence, we find education to have the most explanatory power in our income estimation. If\nwe included education, there would be little independent variation with which to identify the\ncoefficient on own income.34 Our strategy in these regressions thus amounts to treating\nestimated income as a summary statistic for socioeconomic status.\nTable 5 gives the baseline results for the MCD-PUMS logit regression. As in the earlier\nNLMS results, the standard errors shown are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustering within\nstate.35 Column 1 shows results where own family income is measured as a continuous variable.\nIn Column 2, income is measured by a set of income bracket indicators. To enhance\ncomparability with the NLMS results, we defined these brackets using the same cut-off values as\nthose used in the NLMS. Column 3 adds (log) county income per family.36 Column 4 adds\ncounty demographic shares to ensure that any county income effects are not driven by a\ncorrelation between county income and county demographic composition.37\nAs in the earlier NLMS regressions, we find in Column 1 that suicide risk falls with own\nincome, at least when income is measured as a continuous variable. Columns 2 and 3 reveal less\n-27-\n\nevidence of a non-linear income gradient for own income and suicide risk than in the NLMS\nregressions. It is possible that the estimation of income for the MCD-PUMS data results in less\nprecision across narrowly defined categories at the lower end of the income distribution and thus\nmasks the clear gradient evident in the NLMS results. In addition, whereas there are similar\nnumbers of observations in each of the income brackets in the NLMS, this is not the case in the\nMCD-PUMS. We have also estimated this MCD-PUMS regression replacing these dollar-level\nincome brackets with income quintile dummies, ensuring equal coverage in each category\n(results available upon request). The coefficients on these quintile dummies reveal a similar\npattern to that found in the NLMS: suicide risk falls with income, but at a diminishing rate.\nThe key result of Table 5, however, is that the MCD-PUMS data confirm the pattern seen\nin the NLMS data that county income has an independent effect on suicide risk holding other\nvariables, including own income, constant. Based on the specification underlying Column 3, the\nestimated coefficient on log county income per family suggest that 10% higher county income\nper family is associated with 3.2% higher suicide risk. As with the NLMS regressions, the\npresence of a non-linear income gradient hampers the ability to directly compare the magnitude\nof the county income effect and that of own income. However, though the linear own income\nspecification may be a misspecification, we have estimated such a specification with county\nincome included. We find that the own income effect is somewhat larger, suggesting that an\nincrease in aggregate income would reduce aggregate suicide risk.38\nIn Column 4, we show the results of including county level demographic shares as a\ncheck on whether the positive county income effect is being driven by correlation between\ncounty income and county demographics. As was the case for the NLMS hazards regressions\n-28-\n\n(see Table 2), the addition of these population shares increases the positive effect of county\nincome. Specifically, the coefficient goes from 0.317 to 0.680 (both are statistically significant\nat the 95% level or above).\nColumns 5 and 6 shows the results when we allow the coefficient on county income to\ndiffer by gender (Column 5) or by race (Column 6), as we did with the NLMS regressions in\nColumns 4 and 5 of Table 4. As in the NLMS results, the positive county income effect is larger\nfor females than for males, though the difference here is not statistically significant. In terms of\nrace, other races have the largest county income coefficient followed by whites. This differs\nfrom the NLMS results in which only whites had a statistically significant county income effect.\nThe difference is likely due to the small number of observations in the NLMS for non-whites,\nresulting in very large standard errors for the county income effect for non-whites.\n5.6 MCD-PUMS Robustness Check and Extensions\nHere we report the results of few robustness checks on the baseline MCD-PUMS results.\nTo assess whether the MCD-PUMS results could be prone to omitted variable bias due to the\nomission of some of the important control variables that we included in the NLMS regressions\nbut did not have available for the MCD-PUMS regressions, we also estimated a parallel NLMS\nregression containing the same set of variables that are available in the MCD-PUMS. The side-\nby-side results of our baseline MCD-PUMS logit regression and the parallel NLMS Cox\nproportional hazards regression are shown in Table 6. Both regressions contain dummy\nvariables for income brackets (defined using the same cut-offs in terms of 1990 dollars); dummy\nvariables for sex, race, age, and marital status; and state fixed effects. The NLMS regression\n-29-\n\nalso includes year fixed effects; the MCD-PUMS sample is a 1990 cross-section, so the intercept\ncaptures any 1990 fixed effect. Both samples exclude Hispanics (for reasons discussion earlier).\nLooking at columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 one sees that the coefficient on (log) county\nincome is positive and significant in the regressions from both data sets. The MCD-PUMS\ncoefficient of 0.680 is somewhat higher than that from the parallel NLMS regression (0.345),\nthough it is not outside the range of county income coefficients found in the NLMS regressions\nshown in Table 3 and is similar to the point estimate we obtain in our preferred NLMS\nspecification of 0.596. Turning to the details, both data sets indicate that suicide risk is\nsignificantly lower for females and non-whites. Both indicate that individuals under 35 years old\nhave lower suicide risk than those over 55, but the NLMS points to a monotonic reduction in\nsuicide risk with age, while the MCD-PUMS suggests an inverted-U age profile.39 Both data\nsets also indicate that suicide risk is lowest for married persons, followed by single or never-\nmarried, and then divorced or widowed (which are combined in the NLMS due to data\nconstraints).\nAnother possible concern with the cross-sectional MCD-PUMS results is that, while they\ndo control for county demographic characteristics and state fixed effects, they cannot control for\nunobserved county characteristics that possibly could be correlated with county income.\nTherefore, as mentioned in Section 4, we constructed a pooled 1990 and 2000 MCD-PUMS\npanel data set covering the subset of geographic areas in the 1990 cross section that are counties\n(as opposed to aggregates of multiple counties) and hence have the same boundaries in 1990 and\n2000. The constructed panel thus consists of only 308 counties, though these counties represent\nover 75% of the nation’s population.40 This panel data set allows us to control for county fixed\n-30-\n\neffects, thus identifying the county income effect on suicide rates from variation in the 1990-\n2000 change in county income.\nThe results of controlling for county fixed effects are shown in columns 3 and 4 of Table\n6. The regression in column 3 specifies own income non-linearly, as in columns 1 and 2, while\nthat in column 4 includes log own income. The coefficients obtained from the 1990-2000 MCD-\nPUMS panel with county fixed effects are strikingly similar to those based on the (more\ngeographically comprehensive) 1990 MCD-PUMS cross-section. In particular, the coefficient\non county income of 0.65 is quite close to that from the baseline coefficient of 0.68, though the\nformer is much less precisely estimated, perhaps because of the much fewer number of counties\n(and hence variation in county income) in the panel data set. The lack of statistical significance\nin column 3 appears to be partly due to how own income is specified. Column 4 shows that\nwhen own income is represented simply by log income, the county income is found to be\nsignificant at the 10% level. All in all, the panel results suggest that the baseline MCD-PUMS\ncross-sectional results are robust to controlling for unobserved county characteristics.\nThe final component of our analysis exploits the greater detail and sample size in the\nMCD-PUMS to consider the importance of more narrowly-defined reference groups for relative\nincome comparisons. Table 7 reports results from introducing different reference income values\ncomputed over various reference subgroups. Column 1 repeats the baseline results from Table 5.\nColumn 2 replaces the log of income per family within the same county with the log of income\nper family within the same county and the same age group. Column 3 uses log of income per\nfamily within the same county and the same race. The results suggest that, while others in one’s\ncounty or others of the same race in one’s county are relevant reference groups, others in the\n-31-\n\nsame age range in one’s county may be the most relevant reference group.\n6. Additional Considerations and Future Research\nUsing individual level data on suicide risk, we find compelling evidence in support of the\nidea that individuals care not only about their own income but also about the income of others in\ntheir local area. This finding is obtained using two separate and independent data sets,\nsuggesting that it is not an artifact of the particular sample design of either data set. Importantly,\nthe finding is robust to alternative specifications and we are not able to explain it by geographic\nvariation in suicide misclassification, cost of living, or access to emergency medical care.\nIt is also worth noting that other plausible stories of potential bias that we cannot test or\nrule out with our data generally imply a downward bias on our key county income variable. For\ninstance, previous research has shown that psychiatric services are positively correlated with\ncounty income (Zimmerman and Bell 2006). This positive correlation combined with the\npossibility that the quality of local mental health care negatively affects suicide hazard implies a\npossible downward bias on county income’s effect on suicide. Another possibility is that\nindividuals are mobile and endogenously select their county of residence in response to their\nincome relative to the county’s average (assuming, perhaps unrealistically, that individuals can\nobtain the same income when they move). This would suggest that suicide outcomes\nunderestimate the true relevance of interpersonal income comparisons because individuals are\nable avoid the negative utility impact of low relative income by simply moving to a location\nwhere they have higher relative income. Another possible story is that county income shocks\nmay be correlated with unobserved non-income county shocks that reduce the general well-being\n-32-\n\nof county residents and hence increase suicide risk. For instance, a local plant closing might\nboth reduce average household income in the county and lead to other negative county-wide\noutcomes (reduced local tax revenues and public services, reduced social capital, etc.) that are\nunobserved and reduce utility of individuals in the county, hence increasing suicide risk.\nLuttmer (2005) investigates this possibility in the context of reported happiness by instrumenting\nfor actual county income with county income predicted from national trends and county level\noccupation and industry composition. He finds very little difference between the OLS and IV\nresults, suggesting such unobserved county shocks are not quantitatively significant. More\ngenerally, any story involving classical measurement error in our reference group income\nmeasures (relative to the unobserved true reference income) will imply attenuation bias (toward\nzero).\nFinally, regarding the proportional hazards estimations, a common concern in such\nsurvival analysis is attenuation bias from unobserved individual heterogeneity. The concern is\nthat individuals with especially negative individual effects (“frailty” in the parlance of survival\nanalysis)–i.e., the θ term in our theoretical model–are more likely to exit the sample early via\ni\nsuicide; since there are no observations from these individuals for the remaining years of the\nsample, they receive less weight than survivors in the estimation, hence underestimating the\neffects of all variables on exit probability. Again, though, this bias only argues that the true\neffect of reference group income is in fact larger than what we find.\nOur results confirm those obtained in semiaggregate analysis (Daly and Wilson 2006) on\ngroup suicide risk and income dispersion and also are broadly consistent with results using\nhappiness surveys. The finding that suicide risk, holding own income constant increases in\n-33-\n\nreference group income, is found for reference groups ranging from near neighbors, or those who\nclosely resemble the individual, to simple geographical definitions such as county of residence.\nState appears to be too broad as a measure of reference group. This finding is notable since\nmany previous papers investigating relative income or relative deprivation have been forced to\nrely on state- or higher-level aggregates as reference groups (e.g., Blanchflower and Oswald\n2004; Kennedy, et al. 1996; and Kaplan, et al. 1996).\nThis paper has focused on static interpersonal income comparisons. Models of this kind\nare known by various names such as “external habit formation” and “Keeping Up with the\nJoneses”. Future research using suicide data may consider dynamic models of preferences such\nas “internal habit formation” or “Catching Up with the Joneses”. The evidence in this paper\nregarding the usefulness of suicide data for evaluating the nature of the utility function and\npreferences suggests that such research could indeed be fruitful.\n-34-\n\nReferences\nAbel, Andrew B, “Asset Prices under Habit Formation and Catching up with the Joneses,”\nAmerican Economic Review 80:2 (1990), 38-42.\nAlesina, Alberto, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert J.

Construction of Geographic Aggregates\nThis appendix describes the construction of the geographic aggregate variables used\nin this study.\nThe county income data are based on the Census Bureau’s Summary Table Files,\nSF-3, from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses. Note that income values reported\nin the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses refer to income levels in 1979, 1989, and\n1999, respectively. We measure county income for non-census years using the following\ninterpolation procedure: (1) For each state and year, calculate the percentage deviation\nbetween that year’s growth rate in Gross State Product (GSP) and the average (annualized)\ngrowth rate from T to T+10, for T = 1979, 1989, 1999; (2) Compute the average growth\nrate in county income from T to T+10; (3) Compute an estimated growth rate in county\nincome as this 10-year average plus the percentage deviation from average in the county’s\nstate, as computed in step (2); (4) starting with county income in year T, compute county\nincome in years T+1,...,T+9 using this estimated annual growth rate. This method\npreserves county differences in average growth over each decade but forces each county in\na state to have parallel time series deviations from its decadal trend. Lastly, these nominal\nincome levels were deflated to constant 1990 dollars using the CPI-U price index.\nIn some regressions, we control for county-level cost of housing. Quality-adjusted\nhouse price indices are not available at the county level, so we constructed a hedonic house\nprice index using data from the 1990 and 2000 PUMS data. The PUMS contains\nhousehold-level data on house market value and numerous housing characteristics. The\nfinest level of geographic detail in these data is the household’s “Public-Use Microdata\nArea” (PUMA). Using the 1990 sample, we regressed log house value on PUMA fixed\n-- 43 --\n\neffects and a rich array of dummy variables covering all possible values of the housing\ncharacteristics variables, for all owner-occupied housing.41 The estimated PUMA fixed\neffects represent a constant-quality house price index for 1990. We used the estimated\ncoefficients on the housing characteristics, each of which represents the percentage effect of\nthe characteristic on house values, and the 2000 PUMS data on housing characteristics to\nobtain out-of-sample predicted house values for the 2000 PUMS observations. Averaging\nthe difference between actual and predicted house value across households within PUMA\nyields a constant-quality house price index for 2000. The 2000 values are converted to\n1990 dollars using the CPI-U. We use 1990 and 2000 PUMA-to-County mapping files\nfrom the Census Bureau to convert the real house price index from PUMA-level to County-\nlevel.42 We obtain values for years 1979 to 1998 (the NLMS sample range) via linear\ninterpolation and extrapolation from the 1990 and 2000 values. (Since the index represents\nthe logarithm of real constant-quality housing values, linear interpolation amounts to\nassuming a constant within-county growth rate.)\nFinally, we merge in data from the Census Bureau’s Summary Table Files on shares\nof county population by race (white, black, other) and by broad age group (<20, 20-64,\n65+).\n-- 44 --\n\nNotes\n1There also is a recent cross-national literature using surveys of happiness. These studies\ncompare average reported happiness to average income across countries. They generally\nfind little correlation (Di Tella, MacCulloch, Oswald 2001; Alesina, Di Tella, and\nMacCulloch 2004; Easterlin 1973, 1995; Oswald 1997), though an exception is Stevenson\nand Wolfers (2008b) who find strong evidence of a positive correlation.\n2Diamond states: “How should we interpret answers to the question ‘How happy are you\nthese days?’.... If people answer whether they are satisfied with their lives in terms of their\nperceived relative position in happiness, that does not necessarily mean that happiness is\nbased on relative position, rather that the question being answered by the respondent is a\nrelative happiness question…. Some exploration has been done of the impact on reported\nhappiness of the...incomes of neighbors. But such studies may not shed light on the\nquestion of how much well-being depends on one's relative standing and how much the\nrespondent looks to relative standing in order to answer the survey question.”\n3As Oswald (1997) puts it, “Suicides represent choices in response to (un)happiness that are\nintrinsically more compelling than replies made to happiness survey questions, and data\nthat, by their nature, cannot be generated in a laboratory experiment.”\n4We recognize that the actual choice may be suicide attempt rather than completion.\nHowever, data on attempts are quite limited and, moreover, a large share of attempts may\nreflect “cries for help” rather than true attempts to commit suicide.\n5Reported suicides may undercount all true suicides; many experts believe that a significant\nshare of true suicides are misclassified as accidents or “undetermined injuries” (see Moyer,\n-- 45 --\n\nBoyle, and Pollock 1989; Rockett and Smith 1999; and Mohler and Earls 2001). We\naddress this possibility in our empirical analysis.\n6Similarly, Koivumaa-Honkanen, et al. (2001) find that individual self-reports of life\nsatisfaction have significant predictive power for suicide over the subsequent 20 years.\n7Other recent examples of economists trying to explain suicide behavior include Cutler,\nGlaeser, and Norberg (2000), Brainerd (2001), Marcotte (2003), Stevenson and Wolfers\n(2008a), Chuang and Huang (1997), Huang (1996), Kimenyi and Shughart (1986),\nHamermesh (1974), and Schapiro and Ahlburg (1982-83). There have also been a number\nof recent studies in the psychiatry and public health literatures exploring the empirical links\nbetween suicide and socioeconomic factors (see, e.g., Blakely et al. 2003, Lewis and\nSloggett 1998, and Kposawa 2001).\n8 At the end of the analysis we conduct a series of checks designed to test the\nreasonableness of our maintained hypothesis that suicide and happiness span the same\ncontinuum.\n9 There is also a public-use version of the NLMS, however it does not include county of\nresidence or other geographic identifiers.\n10The mortality follow-up (i.e., the matching to the NDI) from the cohort files covered\ndeaths occurring from January 1, 1979 through December 31, 1998.\n11 This problem is well-known among researchers using the NLMS data and NLMS\nresearch staff at the Census Bureau recommend the approach we have taken in this analysis.\n12 Including occupation and industry in the income estimation would modestly improve the\nmodel fit to 28 percent. However, less than half of the suicide records report occupation\n-- 46 --\n\nand industry (as many states do not include them on death certificates). Therefore, we omit\nthese variables from the matching procedure.\n13 The main constraining factors here in terms of coverage are county of residence and\neducation. Education is simply unknown or unreported on many death certificates. For\nconfidentiality reasons, county of residence (or occurrence) is not identified on the public-\nuse MCD data if the county has a population below 100,000. This occurs for roughly a\nquarter of U.S. counties in 1990, covering slightly more than a quarter of all suicides. It\nshould also be noted that some death records include occupation and industry of the\ndeceased, but not enough records contain this information for us to include these variables\nusefully in our matching procedure.\n14 From 1950 to 2000, the overall U.S. suicide rate has fluctuated within the narrow range\nof 10.4 to 13.5 per 100,000. The typical rate for the working-age adult population is\nsomewhat higher, around 12 to 15 per 100,000.\n15 Recall that both the suicide and general populations in the MCD-PUMS sample exclude\nindividuals from counties with population under 100,000, since such counties are not\nidentified in the data for confidentiality reasons.\n16 We also did this matching using education alone and obtained similar results. Full details\nof both estimation strategies are available from the authors upon request.\n17 The Cox proportional hazards model in terms of time-since-interview is the standard\nsurvival analysis approach used by NLMS researchers because it conveniently handles left-\nand right-censoring and does not require specifying the distribution of the disturbance term.\nHowever, an alternative approach often used in survival analysis is to use a parametric\n-- 47 --\n\nfailure-time model in terms of time-since-birth (age) with an assumed distribution for the\ndisturbance. As a robustness check, we estimated our baseline models using the latter\napproach and obtained results consistent with those found using the Cox model. (Results\navailable upon request.)\n18 In the NLMS, T is 7,633 days, which is the difference between December 31, 1998, the\nend of the NLMS follow-up window, and February 1, 1978, the date of the earliest CPS\nresponse in the sample.\n19 Observations can be left-censored either due to non-suicide death prior to the end of the\nfollow-up period or to participating in a CPS survey later than February 1978.\nObservations can be right-censored due to the individual still being alive at the end of the\nfollow-up period.\n20 As another robustness check, we also have estimated the proportional hazards model\nusing time-since-birth (age) as the duration variable instead of time-since-interview. The\nresults are virtually equivalent to those based on time-since-interview.\n21 Since there is a time difference between the interview date and the death or right\ncensoring date, there is a valid concern that the variation we pick up in our regressions is\nrelated to unmodeled time series movements rather than cross-sectional correlations\nbetween our key variables. By including the time dummies we account for these effects.\n22 We explored constructing a MCD-PUMS panel but the PUMS data are spatially\norganized according to public use microdata areas (PUMAs) which are not fixed over time,\ninhibiting matching from one decennial census to the next.\n23 The high relative risk of suicide for unemployed individuals has been found previously\n-- 48 --\n\nusing similar data (Kposawa 2001, Blakely, et al. 2003).\n24 Previous research on the individual effects of own income on suicide is inconclusive.\nSimilar to our finding, Kposawa (2001), using an earlier version of the NLMS, found that in\na multivariate regression, suicide risk decreases with income. Lewis and Sloggett (1998)\nand Blakely et al. (2003), however, using British and New Zealand data, respectively, found\nno significant effect of income after other determinants of socioeconomic status had been\ncontrolled for.\n25 The proportional hazards function is h(t)h(0)eln(y)eX, where y is county income and\nX is a vector of all other model variables. The elasticity of the hazard with respect to\ncounty income is then: dlog(h(t)) dlog(y)dlog(y). We estimate ˆ = 0.453.\n26 The point estimates on county income and own income are 0.55 and -0.09, respectively,\nand both are significant at below the 1% level.\n27 We have also estimated a 2SLS version of this regression where we instrument for own\nincome by predicting it with a model that includes state of residence dummies and all the\nother independent variables included in the model. In this specification, the negative own\nincome coefficient is larger in absolute value than the other income coefficient, implying\nthat if own and others income rose by the same percentage, the aggregate suicide rate would\nfall. This result is similar to that in Luttmer (2005). He also found that in the absence of\ninstrumenting for own income, its coefficient was somewhat smaller in absolute value than\nthat of others’ income.\n28 The county demographic shares are generally insignificant, except for the share of the\npopulation black, which is found to be positively associated with suicide risk. We find a\n-- 49 --\n\nsimilar positive effect of this variable in the MCD-PUMS regressions below. It is possible\nthat this variable is correlated with some county amenity or other characteristic that tends to\nincrease suicide risk.\n29 An additional robustness check we performed was to estimate the same specification as\nthat underlying Column 3 of Table 2 but using a logit model instead of the Cox proportional\nhazards model. We obtain very similar results. In particular, the estimated coefficient on\nlog county income is 0.593.\n30 One other minor robustness check we perform is to assess whether the results are\nsensitive to the presence of outlier, high-suicide-rate counties. We have estimated the\nbaseline regression (Table 2, Column 4) after having omitted individuals from counties\nwith suicide rates above the 99th percentile (45.448). There turned out to be just 1138\nobservations (0.12% of the sample) from those counties and just 1 suicide observation\n(0.06% of 1544 suicide observations in the sample). Thus, the results are virtually\nunaffected by dropping these observations.\n31 Interestingly, in a regression with both state fixed effects and the county house price\nindex included, the coefficient on the house price index is close to zero and statistically\ninsignificant, suggesting that the variation in cost of living is primarily state level.\n32 One might worry that our results are reflecting unmeasured correlation between county\nincome and unobserved county characteristics, such as mental health services, that are also\ncorrelated with county income. While we cannot rule this out completely, we note that\nconcerns along these lines likely would produce a downward bias on the county income\neffect. For instance, previous research has shown that psychiatric services are positively\n-- 50 --\n\ncorrelated with county income (see, e.g., Zimmerman and Bell 2006).\n33 Consideration of reference groups at a finer disaggregation than county is not possible\nwith our NLMS sample due to lack of income data availability over time. We do, however,\ninvestigate narrower reference groups below with our MCD-PUMS sample, which requires\nreference group income data only for 1990, a decennial census year.\n34 We confirmed this point by running a regression equivalent to that in Column 2 of Table\n6 but that additionally included education and marital status dummies. As expected, the\neffects of own income were essentially unidentified (i.e., the standard errors were extremely\nlarge).\n35 In robustness checks not shown here we adjusted a subset of the models for the fact that\nincome is an estimated variable using the technique developed by Murphy and Topel\n(1985). In each of the cases we tried, the adjustment had a negligible effect and made no\nmaterial difference in our findings.\n36 With the MCD-PUMS data set we are able to consider alternative measures of\ncounty/PUMA income, including median family income, mean and median household\nincome, and mean and median individual income. The results are robust to these alternative\nmeasures.\n37 County population shares are defined over the working age (20-64) population. This is\nconsistent with our measure of local area income.\n38 The estimated coefficients on county income and own income are 0.25 and -0.37,\nrespectively, and both are significant at below the 5% level. The full results of this\nspecification are available upon request.\n-- 51 --\n\n39 It is worth noting that studies using subjective survey data have tended to find that\nsubjective well-being is U-shaped in age (e.g., Blanchflower and Oswald 2004), consistent\nwith the inverted-U age profile for suicide found in the MCD-PUMS.\n40 A concern with this panel data set is that, unlike the 1990 cross section, it generally\nexcludes rural counties and so may not be representative of the entire U.S. population. It is\npossible that local area income has different effects on suicide risk in rural counties than in\nurban and suburban counties.\n41 The housing characteristics were property acreage, condo status, kitchen status, number\nof rooms, plumbing status, age of building, number of units in building, and number of\nbedrooms.\n42 Counties that contain multiple PUMAs got the population-weighted average of those\nPUMAs’ index values; counties that shared a PUMA with other counties were all assigned\nthat PUMA’s fixed effect.\n-- 52 --",

    "text": "Landing Softly Is Just the Beginning\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNew York University Stern School of Business\nNew York, NY\nOctober 15, 2024\n11:30 a.m. ET\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nINTRODUCTION\nGood morning.\nIt’s great to be in New York again and to have the opportunity to speak with you about the\neconomy and monetary policy. I very much appreciate the invitation, and I look forward to a\nlively discussion.\nNow, instead of starting with monetary policy, I’m going to begin with a story.\nLast week, I was walking in my neighborhood. A young father, with a stroller, a toddler, and a\ndog called out to me. He had a question. “President Daly, are you declaring victory?”\nI immediately said no. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) won’t be satisfied until\ninflation is at our 2 percent goal.\nBut as it turns out, that wasn’t what he meant.\nWhat he wanted to know was that we wouldn’t stop there. He wanted low inflation, a healthy\nlabor market, and a durable expansion. He wanted a chance to catch up and then advance. A\nchance to recoup what high inflation took from him. And an opportunity to build his career,\nfamily, and community. An opportunity to be better off.\nAs a policymaker, that has always been my objective—to deliver the foundations for that type\nof economy. And with inflation easing and the economy back on a sustainable track, that\nobjective can be our focus.\n1\n\nToday, I will discuss the progress we’ve made in bringing inflation down and the importance of\nlooking beyond a “soft landing.” Aspiring to a durable expansion with sustained price stability.\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nA MORE BALANCED ECONOMY\nLet me start with where we are right now. The economy is clearly in a better place. Inflation\nhas fallen substantially, and the labor market has returned to a more sustainable path. And the\nrisks to our goals are now balanced. This is significant improvement from just two years ago.\nThis figure makes the point (Figure 1). Since March of 2022, when the FOMC began raising\ninterest rates, inflation has declined from over 7 percent at its peak to just over 2 percent in the\nmost recent readings. Inflation expectations—what people believe about the future—have\ncome down as well, confirming that households, businesses, and markets see the progress and\nbelieve the disinflationary process will continue.1\nAt the same time, the labor market has cooled. Most labor market indicators are now at or near\ntheir pre-pandemic values, and the unemployment rate is hovering around a level judged to be\nsustainable over the longer run.2 All this means that the labor market has largely normalized\nand is no longer a major source of inflation pressures.3\n1 Bundick and Smith (2024). The most recent data also show muted inflation expectations for the near term and\nlonger term; see, for example, the Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations data page\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations.\n2 See the FOMC’s September 2024 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) (Board of Governors 2024). The\nSeptember unemployment rate of 4.1 percent was a touch below the SEP median estimate of the natural\nunemployment rate of 4.2 percent.\n3 Lansing and Petrosky-Nadeau (2024; update pending for late October). See also Powell (2024).\n2\n\nFigure 1: Inflation and unemployment since January 2021\nRECALIBRATING POLICY\nOf course, as conditions improve, policy needs to adjust.\nRemember, during the fight to bring inflation down, the FOMC raised rates aggressively and\nkept monetary policy tight, historically so.4 And then each month that inflation and inflation\nexpectations fell, policy became tighter in real terms.\nSo, the FOMC needed to recalibrate, and did so at the September meeting. I see this\nrecalibration as “right-sizing,” recognizing the progress we’ve made and loosening the policy\nreins a bit, but not letting go. Even with this adjustment, policy remains restrictive, exerting\nadditional downward pressure on inflation to ensure it reaches 2 percent.\n4 The recent federal funds rate peak maintained from July 2023 through mid-September 2024 was at the highest\nlevel in over 20 years, since early 2001.\n3\n\nMaking these adjustments to match the economy we have is crucial. It prevents the mistake of\nover-tightening and ensures we are supporting both of our goals.\nContinued progress is not guaranteed. We must stay vigilant and be intentional, continually\nassessing the economy and balancing both of our mandated objectives: fully delivering on 2\npercent inflation while ensuring that the labor market remains in line with full employment.\nThat is a soft landing.\nBEYOND A SOFT LANDING\nBut as the dad in my neighborhood reminded us, this is only part of what people need. What\nhouseholds, businesses, and communities really want is a durable economy, with sustained\ngrowth, a good labor market, and low inflation.\nHigh inflation chipped away at real incomes and purchasing power, intensifying the challenges\nof overcoming pandemic disruptions.5 Everyone felt it. But the burden fell particularly hard on\nlow- and moderate-income families, who spend a disproportionate share of their resources on\nshelter, food, and fuel, where price increases have been especially large.6\nBusinesses have also struggled, especially small- and medium-sized firms that have been\nsaddled with back-to back challenges of pandemic closures, supply bottlenecks, labor shortages,\nand high inflation.7\nA durable and sustained expansion allows both families and businesses to recoup their losses\nand rebuild incomes and wealth that raise their economic well-being.8\nAnd all of this helps communities, which depend on households and businesses to thrive.\nSo, is a durable expansion possible?\nHistory says yes.\nAgain, the data tell the story (Figure 2). Compared to recent history, the current expansion is\nstill relatively young.\n5 Guerreiro et al. (2024), Stantcheva (2024).\n6 Klick and Stockburger (2024).\n7 See Chamber of Commerce (2023) and Federal Reserve Banks (2024).\n8 Real wages and incomes have been rising, but most households are yet to fully make up the earlier losses. See\nGuzman and Kollar (2024) and usual weekly earnings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\n(https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswktabs.htm).\n4\n\nFigure 2: Length of expansions\nI’ve had the benefit of working at the Federal Reserve during the two longest expansions on\nrecord—the 1990s and the pre-pandemic period. During both, remarkable things occurred.\nBusinesses thrived, workers got jobs, and gains in household earnings, income, and wealth were\nwidely shared.9\nThe expansion just prior to the pandemic was especially impressive: nearly 11 years, 10 years\nand 8 months to be precise, the longest on record. And I saw firsthand what the data tell us—\nsustainable growth with low inflation delivers opportunities.10\n9 For the details of the 1990s expansion, see various chapters in Krueger and Solow (2001).\n10 See Daly (2020) for details and a broader discussion in the context of long-term inequality trends and the role of\nthe Federal Reserve.\n5\n\nRobust labor markets brought a broader group of workers into jobs.11 More and more\nAmericans entered or reentered the labor force, wages and incomes rose, and inequality fell.12\nEven wealth gains were widely shared, with low net-worth families generally seeing the largest\ngrowth in their holdings.13 All of this meant better conditions for households and businesses\nacross the country.\nWe’ve already seen some of the same patterns play out in our current expansion. Labor force\nparticipation for prime-age workers has reached new highs.14 Earnings gaps between high- and\nlow-wage workers have closed somewhat.15 And after rising initially during the pandemic,\nhousehold income inequality has fallen back down more recently.16\nThe bottom line: sustained expansion helps all Americans.\nTHE ECONOMY WE DESERVE\nIn the coming months and years, there will almost certainly be economic bumps, disturbances,\nand scares. And the Federal Reserve cannot fully prevent shocks from having an impact. But\nbarring such events, and with the right monetary policy mix, we can help create the conditions\nfor enduring growth.\nThe most important trait in a central banker is the ability to look ahead. To keep an eye on\ntoday and an eye on tomorrow.\nThe work to achieve a soft landing is not fully done. And we are resolute to finish that job.\nBut that cannot be all we’re after.\nUltimately, we must strive for a world where people aren’t worried about inflation or the\neconomy. A world where people have time to catch up, and then to get ahead.\nThat, as I told the young father, is my version of victory. And that’s when I will consider the job\ntruly done.\n11 Aaronson et al. (2019).\n12 Aaronson et al. (2019), Robertson (2019), Guzman and Kollar (2024).\n13 Bhutta et al.

    "text": "FINAL\nA New Balancing Act: Monetary Policy Tradeoffs in a Changing World\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nInflation Targeting – Prospects and Challenges\nSponsored by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\nand the International Monetary Fund\nWellington, New Zealand\nAugust 29, 2019\n9:30AM NZT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nGood morning, and thank you for the opportunity to participate in this\nconference. This is my first trip to New Zealand, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed\ntouring about. I had the double bonus of seeing our good friends from\nCalifornia – New Zealanders actually – who returned home to Christchurch\nabout four years ago. In my travels so far, I can see why New Zealand is on\neveryone’s bucket list!\nI’m also delighted to be here in my capacity as president and CEO of the\nth\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco – and to help mark the 30\nanniversary of New Zealand’s commitment to an explicit inflation-targeting\nregime. It was the first of its kind and has influenced central banks around the\nworld.\nBut to be effective, monetary policymaking must continually evolve. We\nlive in a dynamic world that demands we remain humble about what we know\n– and curious about what we might learn.\n1\n\nFINAL\ndual\nNew Zealand is a great example of this. You haven’t been complacent\nand\nduring the past 30 years. Indeed, you recently moved to an explicit\nmandate – one that requires both price stability full employment.\nThis is a framework we have a lot of history with in the United States. So\nyou might think I will be providing some lessons from our experience with\nbalancing these two objectives.\nAnd I’d like to. But the situation isn’t that simple. The world has changed\nsince we first took on a dual mandate more than 40 years ago. And things are\ndifferent. In the United States, here in New Zealand, and in countries around\nthe world, a new – and less familiar – economic environment has emerged.\nOur collective futures now include slower potential growth, lower long-\nterm interest rates, and persistently weak inflation. This new landscape\ndemands we think differently about how to balance and achieve our price\nstability and full employment objectives.\nSo today, I will share how I’m thinking about these issues from my seat\nat the San Francisco Fed. But before I begin, let me say that the remarks I\nmake today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone\nelse within the Federal Reserve System.\nA New Economic Environment\nTo understand the new environment we face, we first have to look back\nto the past. And here I will use the United States as an example.\nWhen I started working at the Federal Reserve in 1996, I learned three\nimportant facts – the “deep” parameters of central banking (Figure 1).\n2\n\nFINAL\nFirst, the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy averages around 3.5\npercent. Second, the real neutral rate of interest – or r-star – also averages\n1\naround 3.5 percent in the United States. Third, unemployment and inflation\nare strongly linked through the Phillips curve.\nFast forward to 2019. These facts – these deep parameters – feel like a\ndistant memory (Figure 2). As of June, participants of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee put longer-run potential growth in the U.S. at about 1.9\npercent. Estimates of the long-run neutral rate of interest were penciled in at\n2\njust 0.5 percent. As for the Phillips curve… most arguments today center\naround whether it’s dead or just gravely ill. Either way, the relationship\nbetween unemployment and inflation has become very difficult to spot.\n1\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimate of real potential growth averaged 3.5 percent from 1949 to 1996\n(https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#11). Based on estimates from Laubach and\nWilliams (2003), the real neutral rate of interest averaged 3.9 percent from 1961 to 1996, with a decline\nevident in the early 1990s (https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar).\n2\nThe median of longer-run GDP growth in the June Summary of Economic Projections was 1.9 percent. The\nmedian of the longer-run real rate of interest was 0.5 p3e rcent. See Board of Governors (2019b).\n\nFINAL\nAlthough the numbers may be a little different, the changes I’ve\ndescribed are not unique to the United States. Global demographic shifts and\nlower productivity gains are tempering growth and reducing long-run interest\n3\nrates in many countries. And a number of central banks are finding that\ninflation is less responsive to labor market improvements than in the past.\nThese trends have important implications for monetary policy. Lower r-\nstar and the zero lower bound mean we’ll have less room to maneuver when\n4\nthe next downturn occurs. And the fainter signal coming from the Phillips\ncurve means we have less direct, real-time feedback about how monetary\npolicy is playing out in the economy.\nIn other words, the jobs of central banks have gotten harder.\nUncertainty and Tradeoffs\nWhen I lay out the backdrop I just described, I’m almost always asked\nt h e s a m e q u e s t i o n s . F i r s t, if inflation isn’t rising, can we run the economy as\n3\nHolston, Laubach, and Williams (2017).\n4\nOne of the lessons learned from the financial crisis and its aftermath is that alternative too ls like forward\nguidance and the balance sheet can be effective at stimulating economies. However, they’re still imperfect\nsubstitutes for the most effective tool at our disposal: t4ra ditional interest rate adjustments.\n\nFINAL\nhot as we want without consequence? And second, does monetary policy\nreally affect inflation anymore?\nLet me tackle the hot economy question first.\nDespite many years of trying, I’ve been unable to find evidence of a “free\nlunch.” Actions always have consequences, and there are always tradeoffs to\nconsider. Some are immediate, and some take time to develop.\nThe question is… what are the tradeoffs in today’s economic\nenvironment? If the normal tension between unemployment and inflation has\nweakened, how do we know whether we’ve achieved our full employment\nmandate?\nAgain I’ll turn to the U.S. experience. Our current expansion passed the\n10-year mark in July – a U.S. record. Unemployment has fallen from 10\npercent at its peak in October 2009 to near historic lows – just 3.7 percent in\nJuly. Other critical labor market indicators have also improved, including\nprime-age labor force participation, job-finding rates, wages, and income.\nThese improvements have been particularly notable for disadvantaged\n5\nworkers who often struggle to get a foothold in the workforce. Recent\n6\nresearch I’ve done with colleagues examines this pattern closely. We looked\ninto whether running a hot economy – compared with just a sustained\nexpansion – provides extra benefits to marginalized groups.\nWe found that, when the unemployment rate drops below what is\nthought to be its long-run sustainable level, the benefits to marginalized\ngroups increase. Said simply, the gains to running a hot economy\nd i s p r o p o r t i o n a t e l y f l o w to groups that are historically less advantaged.\n5\nPetrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n6\nAaronson et al. (2019). 5\n\nFINAL\nThese findings are echoed in the comments we hear from workforce\ndevelopment and community leaders. They tell us that the current hot\neconomy has allowed many of their constituents to get a second look from\n7\nemployers.\nThis outcome is intuitive. When labor markets are tight and firms are\ncompeting for workers, they find new ways to fill jobs. They recruit more\nintensively, adjust hiring standards, and look to a broader pool of potential\n8\nemployees. These conditions create more opportunities for disadvantaged\ngroups.\nAll of this means that assigning too much weight to our projections of\nthe long-run sustainable rate of unemployment – or u-star – risks\nundershooting what the labor market can really deliver. Indeed, central banks\nin the United States and other countries have been marking down their\n9\nestimates of u-star as unemployment rates have fallen. And recent research\nin the United States and here in New Zealand points to non-inflationary rates\nof unemployment that are even lower than current estimates of the natural\n10\nrate would imply.\nBut as I said before… there is no free lunch. There are potential\nconsequences to running a hot economy we need to consider.\nFor instance, an overly tight labor market might encourage businesses\nand workers to make decisions that have negative long-term effects on\n7\nPowell (2019).\n8\nThis insight was originally documented in Okun (1973). This type of behavior is documented more recently\nin Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013), Leduc and Liu (2019 forthcoming), Abraham and Haltiwanger\n(2019), and Modestino, Shoag, and Ballance (2016).\n9\nIn 2012, the FOMC Summary of Econ omic Projections put the longer-run unemployment rate between 5.2\nand 6 percent (Board of Governors 2012). In June 2019, the median estimate of u-star had fallen to 4.2\npercent (Board of Governors 2019b).\n10\nPetrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019), Crump et al. (260 19), and Jacob and Wong (2018).\n\nFINAL\npotential output. Some research has found that persistently strong economic\nconditions can pull young people out of school – a choice that may undermine\n11\ntheir future job prospects and earning potential. And anecdotal evidence\nsuggests that firms may reduce investments in employee training and skill\ndevelopment to reduce the costs of rapid employee turnover.\nWe also have to think about how running the economy hotter affects\nfinancial stability. If interest rates get too low, and borrowing becomes too\neasy, imbalances in financial markets could once again develop. In the United\nStates, I’m closely watching the high level of corporate debt, particularly\namong riskier firms. While I don’t view current corporate indebtedness as\nposing an acute financial stability risk, this vulnerability could amplify the\nmacroeconomic impact of any shocks to the economy.\nSo we need to stay vigilant. But for now, the latest Federal Reserve\nFinancial Stability Report judges that the U.S. financial sector remains\n12\nresilient. And if vulnerabilities were to increase further, there are\ninstruments such as the countercyclical capital buffer that we might want to\nconsider before making monetary policy more restrictive.\nPutting this all together, where do I come out on the tradeoffs of\nrunning a hot economy? Right now, with little inflationary pressure and\nconsiderable uncertainty about the threshold for full employment, I’m biased\ntowards including as many workers as possible in the expansion.\n11\n12\nCharles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo (2018), and Cascio and Narayan (2019).\nBoard of Governors (2019a).\n7\n\nFINAL\nEvery Tenth Counts\nNow let me turn to the second question: Can monetary policy still affect\ninflation?\nLooking at the data does give one pause. Inflation rates in many\ncountries have remained stubbornly below 2 percent for more than a decade.\nThis is despite considerable monetary stimulus and relatively healthy labor\nmarkets.\nNow, some would argue that these misses are not really meaningful –\njust a couple of tenths. But in our new economic environment, every tenth\ncounts. There are a number of difficulties that could arise with persistent\nmisses on our 2 percent goal.\nOne of the most important benefits of inflation targeting was that it\nresulted in well-anchored inflation expectations. Households and firms\nbecame willing to smooth through idiosyncratic price shocks rather than\nincorporate them into wage demands or long-term contracts. This success is\nreflected in the research that shows expectations, rather than past inflation,\n13\nhave become the key determinant of future inflation.\nBut like most things, expectations can cut both ways. If we consistently\nfall short of our inflation target, expectations will drift down. We’re already\nseeing signs of softness in survey- and market-based measures of longer-run\n14\ninflation expectations.\nPersistent misses on inflation will make the public more likely to\nincorporate these delivered outcomes into their plans. The anchor we worked\n13\nJordà et al. (2019) and IMF (2013).\n14\nNechio (2015) and Lansing (2018). 8\n\nFINAL\ntalk\ndeliver\nso hard to achieve will move from the 2 percent target we about to the\nless-than-2 percent inflation we .\nThis is particularly worrisome given the proximity of the effective lower\nbound. Below-target inflation translates directly into less policy space to offset\nnegative economic shocks. In very practical terms, if inflation expectations are\na quarter point below our target when the next downturn arrives – and so are\nnominal interest rates – that’s one less rate cut at our disposal.\nMonetary Policy in a Changing World\nLooking ahead, persistently low inflation presents a new problem for\nmonetary policymakers.\nThirty years ago, central banks around the world needed to tamp down\nrising inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand responded by boldly\nintroducing inflation targeting as a new monetary policy framework. Others\nquickly followed. These flexible inflation-targeting regimes played a large role\nin bringing inflation under control and in anchoring inflation expectations.\nbelow\nToday, we’re fighting a different battle. We’re fighting inflation from\nour target. This final figure (Figure 3) shows how dramatic the change\nhas been.\n9\n\nFINAL\nAs central bankers, we have to ask ourselves: Are we powerless to\nrespond to these new dynamics? Or do we simply need new tools?\nOur current tool, flexible inflation targeting, is by design forgetful. It lets\nbygones be bygones and makes no attempt to make up for past inflation\nmisses. This worked well when inflation shocks were tilted to the upside and\nwe had plenty of policy space to offset unwanted increases.\nIn our new world of low inflation and low r-star, this approach has clear\nchallenges. It runs the risk of repeatedly delivering below-target inflation\nduring expansions, and leaving the economy with even less policy space when\nthe next downturn hits.\nAlternative strategies such as average inflation targeting and price-level\nand nominal income targeting explicitly include a make-up strategy. They\nensure inflation misses balance out over time. While no magic bullet, these\n10\n\nFINAL\nmake-up approaches recognize that we’ll need to be intentional – rather than\n15\nopportunistic – about offsetting inflation underruns.\nOf course, any changes in our monetary policy framework require\ncareful and deliberate thought. The current approach has been effective in\nkeeping inflation low and steady through good times and bad. So the bar for\nchange should be high.\nBut the future looks different than the past. And much like 30 years ago,\nthe world we face today requires us to consider bold action. For now, we must\nfully use the tools we have. And looking ahead, we must adapt our monetary\npolicy frameworks to deliver on the mandates we’re committed to: full\nemployment and price stability.\nConclusion\nThere’s no question that our world has changed tremendously in recent\nyears. And these changes have created challenges that we’re still learning how\nto address. But we’re working from strong foundations. Foundations that the\nReserve Bank of New Zealand helped lay down 30 years ago.\nI look forward to figuring out where we go next with you.\nThank you.\n15 Svensson (1999), Nessén and Vestin (2005), Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019), and Mertens and Williams\n(2019).\n11\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., MBraoroyk Cin. gDsa Plya, pWerisll ioanm E Wcoansocmheicr ,A acntidv iDtyavid W.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nArizona State University Economic Forecast Luncheon Virtual Event\nTempe, AZ\nDecember 1, 2020\n11:15AM MT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nHello everyone. Thank you for the invitation to join you today.\nIt’s safe to say that 2020 has been a year to remember. Twelve months\nago, we were in the midst of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.\nUnemployment sat near historic lows, wages and incomes were rising, and\ninflation was moving gradually back toward our 2 percent target.\nThen COVID-19 hit our shores. And our fortunes changed almost\novernight. To date, more than 250,000 Americans have died and countless\nothers have been sick. People have lost jobs, businesses, and livelihoods, and\nthe burden has fallen most harshly on those least able to bear it. This is an\nenormous human toll.\nAlthough we’ve retraced some of the initial economic losses, the\neconomy remains far below the levels of employment and output we had prior\nto COVID-19. And coronavirus cases are once again surging.\n1\n\nFINAL\nSo today, I will discuss two important questions. What lessons should\nwe take from this difficult year? And what priorities should we focus on in\n2021?\nBut let me first remind you that the remarks I’m delivering today are my\nown, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the\nFederal Reserve System.\n2020 lessons\nLet’s begin by considering the lessons learned from 2020. There are\nmany, but I will focus on those related to the economy and how it functions.\nLessons that can help us build a more prosperous and resilient future.\nThe first lesson is that we are all interconnected. Our fates are tied\ntogether — as individuals, as communities, as states, and as a nation.\nCOVID-19 has exposed this connectivity in stark relief. I think about my\nown community, Oakland, California. So many businesses in my neighborhood\nhave had to shutter to fight the virus. Without income, these businesses\nhaven’t been able to pay their rent. This has passed through to landlords,\nwho’ve then had trouble paying the mortgages on the buildings they own. This\nthen spilled onto banks, who had to cover the forbearance or loss, leaving\nthem with fewer funds to lend to other businesses looking for a lifeline. And\non and on it goes. The circular flow we all learned about in Economics 101 is\nreal.\nBut while we are all interconnected, COVID-19 has reminded us that the\nimpact of economic shocks does not fall equally. That’s the second important\nlesson from this year. Not everyone has the same experiences in our society.\n2\n\nFINAL\nAnd far too often these differences in outcomes trace back to race, ethnicity,\ngender, or socioeconomic position.\nYou can see this in the data on COVID. A disproportionate share of\npandemic job losses have occurred among men and women of color.1 Mothers\nwith children at home have had to leave the labor force altogether to provide\nschooling and child care.2 And low and moderate income communities across\nthe country have seen an outsized decline in income and wealth at the same\ntime that the basic needs of their citizens have risen.3\nOf course, these are not new issues. But the lens of COVID has vividly\nand painfully highlighted their costs.\nAnd this leads me to my third lesson of 2020. We are limiting our\neconomic prosperity. Persistent and pervasive differences in outcomes\nrepeatedly leave talent on the table and cost our economy.4\nLooking only at differences in outcomes by race, a recent report found\nthat aggregate economic output since 2000 would have been $16 trillion\nhigher if Black and white Americans had more equal education and wages. To\nput this in growth terms, the U.S. economy would have grown about two-\ntenths of a percentage point faster every year since 2000 if these gaps had\nbeen closed. 5\nAnd racial differences in education and wages are only some of the gaps\nin our society. Differences in credit, wealth, and occupational and investment\nopportunities by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status cumulate to mean\n1 Gould and Wilson (2020), Kochhar (2020).\n2 Edwards (2020).\n3 Shrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020).\n4 Cook (2020), Bostic (2020), Hsieh et al. (2019), Daly (2019a).\n5 Peterson and Mann (2020).\n3\n\nFINAL\nless innovation, lower productivity, and ultimately slower growth for\neveryone.6\n2021 priorities\nSo what do these lessons imply for policy priorities going forward?\nThere are many to consider, but today I will focus on the ones related to\nmonetary policy and the Federal Reserve.\nSustain the bridge\nAn important precondition for continued economic recovery is that the\nvirus be well contained. Unfortunately, the public health trajectory is very\nworrisome, with COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths trending higher\nacross the country.\nSo the Federal Reserve’s first priority is to use its tools to help bridge\nthe economy across the disruptions caused by the virus. This means keeping\nthe federal funds rate near zero and continuing to perform our lender of last\nresort responsibilities.7\nOur commitment to maintaining this accommodative stance until the\neconomy is back on stable footing lowers borrowing costs for households,\n6 Cook (2014), Cook and Gerson (2019), Hsieh et al. (2019), Matthews and Wilson (2018),\nPeterson and Mann (2020).\n7 The Federal Reserve established a broad set of emergency lending facilities in March 2020\n(Powell 2020). Funding for these programs via the U.S. Department of the Treasury is\nslated to expire at the end of 2020, and the Federal Reserve has announced plans to return\nthe unused portions of the funds allocated to the CARES Act facilities\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/foia/letter-from-chair-powell-to-secretary-mnuchin-\n20201120.htm). As noted there, the Federal Reserve retains additional financing options\nvia the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n4\n\nFINAL\nbusinesses, and state and local governments.8 And so far our policies are\nworking. Interest rate-sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, have\nrebounded sharply in the past six months. Individuals and businesses have\nbeen able to refinance debt, initiate new loans, and make investments, which\nhas kept more workers employed in the economy. This translates into\nstronger income and consumption growth for millions of Americans.\nBut we must stay vigilant. So the Fed will be ready to respond with our\nfull range of policy tools until COVID-19 is behind us.\nReturn to full employment and sustainable 2 percent inflation\nThen the real work will begin. COVID-19 will leave a deep hole, and it\nwill take ongoing monetary policy support to bring us back to full\nemployment and average 2 percent inflation.\nSo what will that look like? The fundamental road map can be found in\nthe FOMC’s new monetary policy strategy announced in late August.9 That\ndocument acknowledged that maximum employment is not a fixed target. It is\na broad-based and inclusive goal that changes as the economy evolves. The\nstrategy also clarified that achieving our price stability goal—average inflation\nof 2 percent—requires a new regime: flexible average inflation targeting. In\npractice, this means we will be willing to accept periods of moderately above\n2 percent inflation, in order to offset sustained periods of below 2 percent\ninflation.\nUsing this strategy document, the FOMC released forward guidance in\nSeptember, saying that we expect to keep the target range for the federal\n8 Board of Governors (2020a, b).\n9 Board of Governors (2020c).\n5\n\nFINAL\nfunds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with maximum employment, and inflation is on track to moderately\nexceed 2 percent for some time. This approach will support the economic\nrecovery and the Fed’s dual mandate goals.\nRemember that our tools are powerful\nSo what could get in our way? History points to one important thing:\ndoubts that our tools are powerful enough to achieve our goals.10\nA full and true recovery from COVID-19 will most likely be protracted.\nAnd it will be tempting, as time passes, to think that monetary policy has done\nall that it can. That we no longer have a role to play.\nWe saw this in the last recovery. There were concerns among some that\nthe Federal Reserve was overstepping its role and using monetary policy to\ninfluence long-standing structural problems like skills gaps and permanent\njob dislocation.11 But the data did not support those fears, and monetary\npolicy remained accommodative. The result was the longest expansion in U.S.\nhistory, a historically low unemployment rate, and a significant narrowing of\nwage, income, and wealth gaps in the economy.12\nThe priority going forward will be to remember. To remember that\nworkers and firms are flexible, people are resilient, and with a strong\neconomy the labor market is more durable and elastic than we think. To\nremember that, by supporting strong and sustained growth, monetary policy\ncan help deliver the full employment outcomes we desire.\n10 Romer and Romer (2013).\n11 Kocherlakota (2010), Lacker (2012), and Phelps (2008). Daly et al. (2012) provide an\nalternative view.\n12 Aaronson et al. (2019), Robertson (2019), Semega et al. (2020), Bhutta et al. (2020).\n6\n\nFINAL\nOf course, the temptation to think we are powerless will be even greater\nfor inflation. After all, we only occasionally brushed against our 2 percent\ntarget in a nearly 11-year expansion. But decades of research have repeatedly\nshown that inflation in the long run is primarily determined by monetary\npolicy—and central banks have the ability to control where it settles.\nOur primary tool for achieving our inflation goal is our credibility. And\nhere the move to flexible average inflation targeting is powerful. It tells\nhouseholds and businesses that we are fully committed to delivering 2\npercent inflation over time and ensures that inflation expectations remain\nwell-anchored around our target.\nGoing forward, we will need to match these statements with our\npolicies. Hitting or exceeding 2 percent inflation for a few months does not\nmean victory. To fully achieve the goal of price stability, we need to see a\nsustained period of moderately above-target inflation. Only then will the job\nbe complete.\nSo again, we will need to remember. Remember that inflation is always\nand everywhere a monetary phenomenon.13 That even when progress is\ngradual the central bank can, with commitment, bring inflation sustainably to\ntarget.\nEnsure that we can finish\nNow the implications of my remarks thus far are that policy rates will\nlikely be lower for longer. This naturally raises concerns about financial\nstability. In such a low rate environment, investors could reach for yield, asset\n13 Friedman (1970), p. 24.\n7\n\nFINAL\nmarkets could inflate, and the banking and broader financial system might\nfind itself ill prepared to cope should the economy falter.\nWhile these risks cannot be dismissed, it is not at all clear that\nconventional monetary policy is the best way to mitigate them. Interest rates\nare a blunt tool. Moving them to combat financial imbalances has limited\nupsides and potentially significant downsides, such as derailing an expansion\nand leaving us short of our maximum employment and price stability goals.14\nOther, better methods include tools directly targeted on the financial\nsystem. Over the past decade, regulators around the globe have developed and\nstrengthened a suite of micro and macro prudential programs designed to\nkeep financial firms well capitalized over the business cycle.15 In the United\nStates, these include capital and liquidity stress-testing and tools like the\ncountercyclical capital buffer and the stress capital buffer. The Fed also has\nthe power to restrict banks from paying dividends or doing share buybacks\nwhen capital could be at risk, as recently executed in response to the\npandemic.\nAll of these policies are built on the recognition that well-capitalized\nbanks are critical to a healthy financial system and that the best capital banks\ncan get is the capital that they already have.\nIn coming years, we will need to continue to build out and strengthen\nour suite of tools to further mitigate risk. The financial system and the\neconomy are constantly changing, and regulatory principles and supervisory\napproaches must evolve to keep pace. It’s easy to see where more may be\nneeded. A growing share of financial intermediation in the U.S. takes place\n14 Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015), Bernanke (2015), Svensson (2015).\n15 Yilla and Liang (2020), Williams (2015).\n8\n\nFINAL\noutside of the formal banking system. Understanding this evolution and how it\nimpacts financial stability is critical.16 The rising frequency of devastating\nweather events also demands attention. It highlights the need for further\nwork on climate risk and how it will affect the financial system and the\nbroader economy.17\nEnsure that our work helps everyone\nFinally, we will need to do more to ensure that the benefits of low\ninterest rates and rising asset valuations can spread widely throughout the\neconomy.\nThe COVID-19 response made it clear that our interest rate policies and\nlending programs do not reach everyone equally. Many businesses and\nhouseholds are outside of the traditional banking system and do not have the\nsame opportunities to refinance or initiate loans.18 We’ve heard repeatedly in\nthe 12th District and across the country that these differences hampered the\npandemic relief, slowing its delivery to many in need.\nTo solve these issues, and increase the reach of the financial\ninfrastructure, we will need to think outside of the traditional banking box.\nThis could mean developing firmer partnerships with Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions and other nonprofit or small dollar\nlenders. These institutions are already connected to low- and moderate-\nincome communities and are innovating to improve their reach among those\nmost in need.

The views expressed in this paper are those of the\nauthors and should not be attributed to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or the Federal\nReserve System.\n\nThe Improving Relative Status of Black Men\nUsing data from the Current Population Survey, we examine recent trends in the relative\neconomic status of black men. Our findings point to gains in the relative wages of black men\n(compared to whites) during the 1990s, especially among younger workers. In 1989, the average\nblack male worker (experienced or not) earned about 69 percent as much per week as the average\nwhite male worker. In 2001, the average younger black worker was earning about 86 percent as\nmuch as an equally experienced white male; black males at all experience levels earned 72\npercent as much as the average white in 2001. Greater occupational diversity and a reduction in\nunobserved skill differences and/or labor market discrimination explain much of the trend. For\nboth younger and older workers, general wage inequality tempered the rate of wage convergence\nbetween blacks and whites during the 1990s, although the effects were less pronounced than\nduring the 1980s.\n\nThe Improving Relative Status of Black Men\nI. Introduction\nPrior to 1990, the evolution of black male wages relative to white male wages could be\ndivided into two distinct periods: (1) 1964 through 1974, when the weekly differential in black-\nwhite wages fell precipitously; and (2) 1975 through 1989, when the differential remained\nrelatively constant and even rose somewhat. Evidence for the 1990s and the early part of this\ncentury indicate that a third period has emerged, with black males again gaining ground relative\nto whites. Between 1990 and 2001, the weekly wage differential between black and white males\nfell at an average annual rate of 0.6 percent per year. Wage convergence among men with less\nthan 10 years of experience was even more rapid, averaging 1.4 percent per year.1 While these\ngains fall short of the pace (of decline) recorded from 1964-1974, they represent a return to a\npattern of relative improvement after a long period of stasis.\nThis recent improvement in the relative status of black men raises questions about the\nfactors driving the change. Past research on the early declines and the subsequent stagnation in\nblack-white wage gaps point to a number of important factors including differences in\nproductivity (observable and unobservable) and employment structure, and changes in economy-\nwide male wage inequality and discrimination (see Altonji and Blank (1999) for a detailed\nreview of this literature). Despite considerable efforts, little consensus has formed about the\nprimary determinants of these trends.\n1The figures cited in this paragraph are based on calculations presented and explained later in the\ntext.\n-1-\n\nWe contribute to the literature in this area by documenting recent changes in the black-\nwhite wage gap and examining the factors contributing to the recent improvement. We begin by\nreviewing the literature on black-white wage gaps, paying particular attention to research focused\non disentangling the effects of changes in skill, changes in discrimination, and changes in\neconomy-wide wage inequality. We then use data from the March Current Population Survey\n(CPS) to document trends in the weekly differential of black-white wage from 1968-2001. Using\nstandard decomposition techniques, we examine the relative importance of productivity\ndifferences, the employment structure, economy-wide male wage inequality, and discrimination\nin explaining the time-series pattern of the black-white wage ratio.\nWe find that greater occupational diversity and reductions in unobserved or residual\ndifferences were important to reducing the black-white wage gap during the 1990s. General male\nwage inequality continued to temper the rate of wage convergence between black and whites.\nThe results raise the possibility that the 15-year stasis between 1975 and 1989 was episodic,\nrather than indicative of a more permanent state.\nII. Identifying the Issues\nConsiderable research has focused on understanding changes in black economic status\nsince 1960. Initial studies focused on separating black economic advancement into the portion\nassociated with changes in skill, including educational attainment, and the portion associated\nwith governmental efforts to combat discrimination, including antidiscrimination policies and\n-2-\n\naffirmative action.2 The key determinants of these apportionments were the relative progress of\nolder versus newer cohorts and the timing of the progress relative to the onset of government\nantidiscrimination policies. The results produced no clear consensus. Smith and Welch (1977,\n1984, 1989), finding that the replacement of older cohorts by newer cohorts was driving the\nimprovement in relative wages among blacks, concluded that skill convergence, rather than\nantidiscrimination policies were responsible for black economic advancement. Brown (1982),\nLeonard (1990), and Heckman and Payner (1989) showing that in periods of intense government\nintervention all cohorts advanced, concluded that government policies (e.g., the 1964 Civil\nRights Act) played a significant role in the convergence of black and white male wages (see\nDonohue and Heckman (1991) for a summary of this debate).3\nAs the rate of convergence in the black-white wage gap slowed, attention turned to\nunderstanding the factors holding down black wages. Several papers attributed the slowdown to\npolitical changes that reduced support (social and financial) for affirmative action (Jaynes 1990;\nLeonard 1990; Bound and Freeman 1992). Others looked to the economy (Welch 2003) or to the\nquality of black education (Card and Krueger, 1992). Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) took a\ndifferent approach and examined the role of economy-wide increases in wage dispersion; they\nconcluded that rising male wage inequality was an important restraint on the advancement of\nblack males relative to whites.\n2Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act forbids discrimination in employment. The Office of\nFederal Contract Compliance, established in 1964, monitors the antidiscrimination and affirmative action\nresponsibilities of government contractors. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 extended protection from\ndiscrimination to black voters.\n3Several of these studies note that economic conditions also play a role. The booming economy\nduring the period from 1960-1970 likely had a positive influence on the improvement of black wages.\n-3-\n\nRecent summaries of relative black progress since 1960 by Heckman, Lyons, and Todd\n(2000) and Welch (2003) suggest that considerable differences of opinion about the importance\nof any particular factor remain. What does seem to be agreed upon is that analysis of trends in\nthe black-white wage gap must recognize the importance of observable and unobservable skills,\nchanges in returns to those skills, changes in economy-wide wage inequality, and changes in\ndiscrimination against black workers. That said, we turn to our analysis which documents recent\ntrends in relative black advancement and the factors contributing to them.\nIII. Data\nWe use data from the March CPS for the years 1969-2002, as administered by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. These files provide information on\nearnings, hours, and related variables for the calendar year prior to the survey date; thus, our\nanalyses apply to income years 1968-2001. In the formal decomposition analysis, we focus on\nthree periods: 1968-1979, 1979-1989, and 1989-2001. These years span our sample and\ngenerally coincide with three business cycles.4\nOur sample consists of black and white males ages 18-64 who participated in the labor\nforce at least 39 weeks, worked at least one week during the year, and usually worked full-time.\nWorkers who are enrolled in school are excluded from the analysis. Throughout the analysis we\n4The official peak of the 1990s expansion was March 2001, so the last year of our sample\nincludes nine months of a national recession. Excluding the data for 2001 does not materially affect our\nresults.\n-4-\n\nfocus on two groups: our full sample and men with less than ten years of potential experience\n(i.e., min[age!education!6, age!18]).5\nOur empirical analysis focuses on weekly earnings, calculated as the ratio of annual\nearnings to weeks worked during the year. Weekly earnings are deflated using the personal\nconsumption expenditure deflator from the National Income and Product Accounts. To avoid\nproblems associated with changes in CPS top-coding procedures over the years, our sample\nexcludes individuals in the top and bottom 1 percent of the weekly earnings distribution.\nThroughout the paper, we refer to the log of deflated average weekly earnings as the wage. All\nanalyses are weighted using the survey weights provided in the CPS.\nIV. Trends in the Black-White Wage Differential\nBasic Patterns\nThe up, down, up progress of black relative wages over the past three decades is\ndisplayed in Figure 1. The figure shows trends in black-white weekly wage differentials\n(unadjusted for differences in measured characteristics) between 1968 and 2001 for all workers\nand workers with ten or fewer years of potential experience. Like previous researchers, we find\nthat among workers at all experience levels, the gap in the earnings of blacks and whites\ndecreased sharply from the late 1960s through the mid-1970s, falling from .50 in 1968 to .30 in\n1976. Similarly, we find little wage convergence between blacks and whites from the mid-1970s\nthrough the end of the 1980s (the period examined most recently by other researchers). During\n5Recent entrants to the labor market arguably are more reflective of current market conditions as\nthey are not hindered by past discrimination or segregation nor helped by their seniority or specific\nhuman capital.\n-5-\n\nthis period the wage gap between black and white males averaged .33, rising to .37 in 1985 and\nnever falling below .31. Since the end of the recession in 1991, however, there have been six\nobservations of the unadjusted wage gap less than .30 (.27 in 1995; .29 in 1997; .27 in 1998; .29\nin 1999; .26 in 2000; and .27 in 2001). These are the smallest weekly wage differentials recorded\nfor black and white males in our sample. Although these are modest reductions for minority\nworkers as a whole, they represent progress in wage convergence following nearly two decades\nof stagnation.\nA similar pattern is observed for the subset of workers with less than ten years of\npotential experience. Again, following fairly rapid narrowing of the black-white wage gap from\nthe late 1960s through the mid-1970s, the pattern reversed during the 1980s, when the gap in\nweekly wages actually increased. In contrast, during the 1990s, the wages of younger black\nworkers rose relative to their white counterparts. Following the recession in 1991, there were six\ninstances of historical lows for the weekly wage gap among workers with less than ten years of\nexperience (.21 in 1994; .12 in 1997; .18 in 1998; .22 in 1999; .18 in 2000; and .15 in 2001).\nWage Gaps and Potential Experience\nAs Figure 1 shows, while both all men and those with less than 10 years of potential\nexperience made gains in the 1990s, the improvement was largest for younger men. To highlight\nthese differences more completely, Table 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the evolution of the\nblack-white wage gap by years of potential labor market experience. The wage gaps reported in\nthe table represent averages over five-year intervals of the CPS data.\nLooking across the rows of Table 1 shows a marked decline in the unadjusted black-white\nwage gap among workers of all skill levels (row percent changes are reported in the final column\n-6-\n\nof the table). For workers at all levels of experience, the unadjusted wage gap declined from.44\nin the interval from 1968 through 1972 to .27 in the period from 1998 to 2001, a decrease of 38\npercent. For the different levels of potential experience listed in the table, the reductions in the\nwage gap range from 25 percent (workers with 26 to 30 years of potential experience) to 53\npercent (workers with six to 10 years of potential experience). The results show that, although\nthe relative economic position of all black males has improved over time, newer entrants to the\nlabor market have fared the best.\nTurning to the diagonals of the table, we compare the movement of different groups of\nmen (measured by potential experience) over time.6 For example, in 1968-1972, workers with\nless than six years of potential experience had an average wage gap of .36; by 1998-2001, when\nthese men had acquired between 31 and 35 years of potential experience, their wage gap had\nfallen to .32, a decline of 11 percent. The most pronounced declines were for men who had\nbetween six and 10 years of potential experience in 1968-1972; these men saw their wage gap\nfall from .40 in the first period of our data to .25 percent in the last period of our data, a 38\npercent decline. Thus, although newer entrants to the labor market fare better than more\nestablished workers, the results point to an overall pattern of convergence independent of age and\nexperience.\n6Potential experience is not equivalent to cohort analysis, which is another standard way of\nmeasuring differential progress of younger and older black males. We rely on potential experience in our\nanalysis for comparability with Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991).\n-7-\n\nV. Trends in Underlying Wage Determinants\nAs noted earlier, several factors have been shown to influence the evolution of the black-\nwhite wage gap. In this section, we document changes in individual characteristics, the sectoral\ncomposition of employment, and overall wage inequality.\nEducation and Occupation\nBasic Trends. Before describing changes in black educational attainment and occupation\ndistribution, it is useful to see why such variables matter for wages.7 Figure 2 shows trends in the\nlog wage ratio for college educated and non-college educated workers, for all workers and those\nwith less than 10 years of potential experience. As the figure shows, higher levels of education\nare associated with greater earnings. This return to education has grown dramatically over the\npast two decades, essentially doubling over the period. Returns to education are highest for\nworkers with less than 10 years of experience. Given the importance of education for wage\ndetermination, especially in recent years, the relative distribution of education between blacks\nand whites likely will be an important determinant of relative improvement or decline.\nAnother important factor for wages is occupation. Figure 3 shows average weekly\nearnings in 2001 for major occupational groups. The figure reveals a sizeable wage premium for\nworkers in professional and clerical occupations, relative to craftsmen and laborers, for example.\nIn 2001, workers in the professional occupation earned two and one half times the wages earned\nby laborers. Analysis not shown here reveals little change in the relative wages by occupation\n7Another potential factor affecting black-white wage gaps is industry distribution. Our analysis\nreveals little difference in the trends in industry distribution between black and whites. Thus, we focus\non occupational distribution, which has changed significantly during our sample period.\n-8-\n\nover time. In other words, the 2001 data accurately summarize the wage premiums paid to\nprofessionals, for example, relative to craftsmen.\nChanges for Blacks. As Figure 2 showed, one of the most important individual\ndeterminants of wages is education. It also is an area where blacks have made enormous gains,\nboth absolutely and relative to whites, over the past 30 years (Table 2). In 1968, 63 percent of\nblack males had not completed high school, nearly twice the percentage for whites. By the last\nyear of our sample, 2001, the percentage of blacks without a high school education had fallen to\n12%, just 1.1 times the percentage for whites. The same pattern of improvement for black males\nis observed for all levels of educational attainment. By 2001, about 41.9 percent of blacks\nreceived a high school degree, 28.2 percent had some college, and about 18 percent had college\ndegrees. This represents considerable improvement over 1968 when 25.6 percent had high\nschool degrees, just 7.4 percent had some college, and only 3.8 percent had college degrees.\nStill, even with these improvements, blacks lag whites in the acquisition of education.8 Finally,\noverall the patterns are similar for blacks with less than ten years of experience (panel B, Table\n2), although the distribution of black men is far more evenly weighted across educational groups.\nThe remainder of Table 2 shows the relative distribution of blacks and whites across one-\ndigit occupational categories. While occupational and industry outcomes potentially reflect both\nchoices and constraints, here we simply display the patterns over time without making a\njudgment about this issue. As with education we find significant convergence in the\noccupational distributions of blacks relative to whites over the past 30 years. In 1968, a black\n8These differentials in educational attainment may reflect different preferences and choices,\nand/or they may reflect pre-market differences in access to education; see Altonji and Blank (1999).\n-9-\n\nmale was 20 percent as likely as a white male to be employed as a manager; 30 percent as likely\nto be employed in sales; and 40 percent as likely to work in a professional occupation. By 2001,\nthese percentages had climbed to 60 percent, 70 percent, and 70 percent, respectively. At the\nsame time the share of black males working as farm and nonfarm laborers fell, both absolutely\nand relative to whites. However, even with such progress, in 2001 black men were more likely to\nwork in occupations requiring less skill and paying lower wages (e.g., clerical and operatives)\nthan whites and less likely to be in occupations reaping the highest returns in the labor market\n(i.e., professional and managerial). Again, the patterns are similar for black men with less than\nten years of experience. In tabulations not shown here, we find similar convergence in the\ndistribution of blacks and whites across two-digit industry classifications.9\nEconomy-Wide Wage Inequality\nAs Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991) point out, another important variable in explaining\nmovements in the black-white wage gap is changes in the level of overall wage inequality. As\nthe authors note, if blacks are disproportionately located in the lower end of the skill distribution\n(measured or unmeasured) then increasing disparity in the returns to skill will hinder black-white\nwage convergence. For instance, given that black males have less education than whites and\ncontinue to be disproportionately located in lower-paying occupations, they will be penalized by\nincreases in the prices of measured skills (i.e., returns to education) and increases in the returns to\nparticular sectors of the economy. In addition, if labor market discrimination or actual\n9A complete set of employment proportions by race and industry are available from the authors\nupon request.\n-10-\n\ndifferences in unmeasured skills of blacks are present, then increasing returns to unmeasured\nskills will put additional downward pressure on the relative wages of blacks.\nTo review the patterns of male wages during the 1970s and 1980s and to document\nchanges in those patterns in the 1990s, Figure 4 displays trends in the distribution of weekly\nearnings for men.10 We display the median, the coefficient of variation, and the Gini and Theil\ncoefficients. After declining almost steadily since 1978, the real median wage of males began to\nclimb in 1993. By 2001, the median had returned to the peak achieved in 1973. The three\nmeasures of dispersion all exhibit nearly monotonic increases between 1968 and 1993, with the\nnet increase ranging from 29 percent for the Gini coefficient to 55 percent for the Theil\ncoefficient. However, each declined a bit between 1993 and 2001, indicating growth in yearly\nmale earnings that was more evenly distributed than it had been in past decades.\nThe measures displayed in Figure 4 show that overall dispersion increased rapidly but\nleveled off and even declined somewhat during the 1990s. Figure 5, panels A and B show a\nsimilar pattern for within-group wage dispersion; the figure displays relative wage trajectories of\ncollege-educated workers and high school graduates at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the\nwage distribution for the 30 plus years in our sample. Each of the series is indexed to zero in\n1968. Looking first at panel A—college graduates—over the past 30 years, workers at the 10th\npercentile experienced wage reductions while those at the 50th and 90th percentiles experienced\nnet wage increases. While it is clear from looking at the figure that the distribution of wages for\ncollege graduates has widened, it is also clear that wages of workers at the 10th percentile of the\ndistribution have recovered sharply since the recession of the early 1990s. Panel B depicts\n10This measure includes individuals whose yearly earnings are zero.\n-11-\n\nsimilar information for high school graduates. Wages at the 10th and 50th percentiles have\ndecreased during the period covered by the sample. Since the recession of the early 1990s, the\nearnings of all groups have been increasing, with the sharpest gains in the last several years\nexperienced by workers at the bottom of the distribution.\nCombined, the trends on economy-wide male wage inequality indicate a potential role for\nchanges in the returns to both observed (measured as between-group wage dispersion) and\nunobserved (measured as within-group wage dispersion) skills. To get a sense of how important\nthey might be, Table 3 shows the position of whites in the black wage distribution. The table\nreports the percentage of whites earning less than blacks at various points in the black wage\ndistribution. For example, the first row of the table shows the percentage of whites earning less\nthan blacks at the 10th percentile of the black wage distribution; equality between blacks and\nwhites would mean that this percentage would equal 10%. The last column of the table shows\nthe averages for all individuals in all years.11\nThe table indicates that, over time, the distribution of black wages has become more like\nthat of whites, although considerable progress has yet to be made before they are equal. For\nexample, in the first year of our sample, 1968, only 7 percent of whites earned less than the\nbottom quarter of black workers. By 2001, 17 percent of whites earned less than the bottom\nquarter of black workers. Similarly, in 1968, 63 percent of whites earned less than the 90th\npercentile of black wages. In 2001, 81 percent of whites earned less than the 90th percentile of\nblack wages.\n11Note that the percentages reported in the last column are not averages of the elements in that\nrow, but averages for the percentile across all years and individuals.\n-12-\n\nThe descriptive evidence suggests that blacks should be gaining relative to whites as they\nmove up through the white distribution of wages. However, given the continued\noverrepresentation of blacks in the lower end of the wage distribution, the increase in economy-\nwide wage inequality, documented in Figures 4 and 5, could be expected to disproportionately\naffect black workers, partially offsetting any gains realized through improvements in observable\nand/or unobservable skill and lessening of labor market discrimination.\nVI. Assessing the Importance of Specific Factors\nAnalytic Methodology\nTo assess the importance of each of the various factors thought to affect the black-white\nwage gap we use a decomposition technique developed by Juhn, Murphy, Pierce (1991),\nhereafter JMP, which extends the now standard decomposition technique proposed by Oaxaca\n(1973). The innovation in the JMP extension is to decompose the “unexplained” or “residual”\nportion of the wage gap from the Oaxaca decomposition into a price and quantity component.\nThis, in turn, allows one to fully partition changes in the unadjusted wage gap into portions\nassociated with measured and unmeasured characteristics and returns to these characteristics.\nThis technique has been used by Blau and Kahn (1992, 1994) to examine gender wage gaps\nand by Rodgers (1997) to look at differences in black-white wage gaps across cities and suburbs.\nOur brief description of the model closely follows that of the cited authors. A very detailed\ndiscussion of this technique can be found Altonji and Blank (1999).\nThe decomposition can be described as follows. Suppose we have a white male wage\nequation for worker I in year t.\n-13-\n\n(1) Y = X β +σθ\nit it t t it\nwhere Y is the log weekly wage; X is a vector of explanatory variables; B is a vector of\nit it t\ncoefficients; 2 is a standardized residual (i.e., with mean 0 and variance 1 for each year); and F\nit t\nis the residual standard deviation of white male wages for that year (i.e., the unexplained level of\nmale wage inequality in year t).12\nThen, following standard decomposition techniques, the black-white log weekly wage\ngap for year t can be written as:\n(2) D ≡Y −Y = ∆X β +σ∆θ\nt wt bt t t t t\nwhere the w and b subscripts refer to white and black averages, respectively, and a ) prefix\nsignifies the average white-black difference for the variable immediately following. Equation (2)\nstates that the wage gap can be decomposed into race differences in measured variables ()X) and\nt\nrace differences in the standardized residual ()2) from the white equation multiplied by the log\nt\nmoney value per unit difference in the standardized residual (F).\nt\nThe difference in the black-white wage differential between two years (0 and 1) can then\nbe decomposed using equation (2) as follows:\n(3) D − D = (∆X − ∆X )β + ∆ X (β − β) + (∆θ −θ)σ + ∆θ (σ −σ).\nt' t t' t t t' t' t' t t' t t t' t' t\nThe expression decomposes the total change in the black-white wage gap between two years into\nfour components. The first term in (3) reflects the contribution of changes in measured\ncharacteristics holding prices fixed. The second term reflects the impact of changing prices for\n12The standard formulation would be Y = X B + :. JMP begin by expressing : as the\nit it it it it\nmultiple of its standard deviation F and a standardized residual, 2,, equal to :/F.\nit it it it\n-14-\n\nobserved variables holding measured characteristics fixed. The third term measures the effect of\nchanging differences in the relative wage positions of blacks and whites after controlling for\nmeasured characteristics (i.e., whether blacks rank higher or lower within the white residual\ndistribution).13 Finally, the fourth term of equation (3) reflects the impact of changes in residual\nmale wage inequality between the two years.14 This term measures the contribution to the change\nin the black-white wage gap associated with changes in the distribution of male residual wages,\nholding blacks’ position in that distribution constant. As JMP note, if earnings inequality is\nincreasing within each observable skill category, as it was during the 1980s, this will adversely\naffect blacks even in the absence of other changes because blacks are already concentrated in the\nlower part of the earnings distribution.\nEmpirical Strategy\nWe implement this decomposition using a model of wage determination that includes\ncontrols for age, education, potential experience, region of residence, whether the individual is a\npublic sector worker, whether the individual is self-employed, as well as dummy variables for\nindustry (two-digit) and occupation (one-digit). The inclusion of occupation and industry in\nthese types of models is a subject of considerable debate. We include industry and occupation in\nour model but separate the effects of education and experience from industry and occupation to\nallow readers to see clearly the contribution that each variable makes. Education is measured as\n13As JMP point out, changes in the rankings of blacks in the white distribution may reflect\nchanges in unmeasured characteristics of blacks or changes in labor market discrimination against blacks.\n14JMP refer to the third and fourth terms as the “gap” and the “unobservable price effect.” The\ngap shows how much of the change in the total residual is due to blacks moving up or down the\ndistribution of whites for any given set of observables. The unobservable price effect shows how much\nis due to general changes in wage inequality that affect blacks more than whites because they are\ndisproportionately located in the bottom of the residual distribution.\n-15-\n\na set of dummy variables representing no high school degree, high school degree, and some\ncollege; college graduates are the omitted group. In addition, we include the total amounts of\nschooling for those with less than a high school degree or some college. Potential experience is\nentered as a quartic. Region of residence is defined by the Census divisions: northeast, north\ncentral, south, and west; northeast is the excluded region in our regressions.\nWhile the first and second terms of equation (3) come easily from a standard regression,\nthe third and fourth terms are obtained more nonparametrically in the following manner.\nFollowing JMP we obtain the third term, ()2 - )2)F, by assigning to each black male in each\ntN t t\nyear a percentile number corresponding to his position in the white residual wage distribution for\nthat year.15 We then compute an imputed tN mean black residual based on the black percentile\nrankings in tN and the distribution of male earnings in t. The difference between the imputed\nblack wage residual in tN and the actual black wage residual in tN allows us to estimate ()2 -\ntN\n)2)F. Again, this term measures movement of blacks through the white residual wage\nt t\ndistribution between periods. If there is no such movement, this term is zero.\nThe fourth term is calculated analogously. Once again, we assign percentiles of the white\ndistribution to each black in year tN, compute what residual that black would have had in year tN\ngiven that position in the white distribution, and subtract that from the actual black tN residual.\nSince the percentile locations of blacks are held fixed in this calculation, the difference in the two\nresiduals reflects only changes in residual inequality for whites.\n15Other useful descriptions of the JMP technique can be found in Blau and Kahn (1992; 1994),\nRodgers (1997), and Altonji and Blank (1999).\n-16-\n\nWe estimate these effects for all years, by comparing a given year tN to the average\nthroughout the sample. We summarize the results across three time intervals: 1968–1979,\n1979–1989, and 1989–2001. For each period we estimate the average annual rate of change in\neach component by estimating a linear spline with break points at 1979 and 1989. We organize\nthe results in two ways, first by the contributions of the measured and unmeasured factors, and\nsecond by the contributions of individual characteristics (i.e., the first and third terms of the\ndecomposition) and the contributions of overall wage inequality (i.e, the second and fourth terms\nof the decomposition).\nResults\nBefore considering the magnitude and statistical significance of each of the four terms in\nequation (3), it is useful to view the time series of the actual and adjusted black-white wage gap.\nFigure 6 shows the total wage gap and the residual wage gap, once differences in observables\n(the first two terms of equation (3)) are accounted for. The vertical difference in the two lines\nrepresent the reduction in the black-white wage differential that would occur if all observable\nfactors included in the regression were equalized across blacks and whites. Over the course of\nour sample period, both the actual and residual gap decline. For the sample of workers with less\nthan 10 years of potential experience, the reduction in the actual gap was slightly more\npronounced than the reduction in the residual gap (i.e., the vertical difference between the two\ngaps narrowed). This implies that for younger workers, the equalization of black and white\nobservable characteristics would reduce the black-white wage gap by less today than 30 years\nago.\n-17-\n\nTable 4 provides a much more detailed description of the trends in Figure 6. The table\nshows the contribution of each factor to the annual percentage point trend in the black-white\nweekly earnings gap, as estimated by our decomposition analysis. Panel A reports results for\nmen at all levels of experience; panel B shows results for relatively new entrants to the labor\nmarket.\nThe first row in panel A, labeled “overall trend,” shows the estimated trend in the\ndifferential, without controlling for education, experience, occupation, and industry, for men of\nall experience levels. Between 1968 and 1979, the differential between black and white wages\ndeclined by an average of 1.2 percentage points per year. During the next decade, the wage gap\nincreased by .24 percentage point per year. During the 1990s, however, the black-white wage\ndifferential began to decline again, falling by .59 percentage point per year between 1989 and\n2001.\nAdding human capital and employment structure variables to this model significantly\naffects the trends in the wage gap, particularly in the 1970s and 1990s. Looking first at the\nhuman capital variables, about 30 percent of the wage convergence observed between 1968-1979\nand 1989-2001 is attributable to changes in education and experience. Decomposing the overall\nhuman capital contribution into separate quantity and price effects, we find different effects in\ndifferent periods. In the first period, changes in the distribution of education and experience\nplayed the largest role. During the 1980s, gains among blacks in education and experience were\nnearly completely offset by the wage penalties associated with increasing returns to skill. In the\n1990s, the stabilization of between-group income inequality and additional gains in education\n-18-\n\nand experience among blacks worked together to reduce the black-white wage differential during\nthe period.\nThe patterns for the employment structure variables are similar, with the largest effects\noccurring in the first and last decades of our sample period. Decomposing the total employment\nstructure effect into the quantity and price components shows that equalization in the\nemployment distribution positively affected the relative wages of blacks between 1969-1979 and\n1989-2001. In the earliest period, these changes in the employment distribution were boosted by\nincreases in the relative pay of occupations occupied by blacks. In contrast, during the 1990s, the\npositive effects of more equal employment distribution were partially offset by the fact that\nblacks continued to be disproportionately located in occupations with falling relative pay.\nEven with the inclusion of a full set of measured characteristics, a sizeable amount of the\nblack-white wage differential remains unexplained, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s.\nBreaking this unexplained portion into its price and quantity components reveals a number of\ninteresting results. First, consistent with other researchers, we find that returns to unobserved\nskills penalized blacks in the 1970s, a period of rising within-group income inequality. This\npenalty was more than offset by convergence in the distribution of unobservable skills and/or the\nlessening of labor market discrimination during the period. In contrast, during the 1980s, prices\nplayed a limited role, and differences in unobserved skills and/or increases in discrimination\nwidened the black-white wage gap. In the 1990s, the pattern appears to have returned to the\nearlier decade, with returns to unobservable skills (within-group wage inequality) exacting some\npenalty, but that being more than offset by convergence in the distributions of unobserved skills\nfor blacks and whites and/or a lessening of labor market discrimination.\n-19-\n\nOverall, for workers at all experience levels, the portion of wage convergence explained\nby measured characteristics has declined over time, although it was higher in the latest period (38\npercent) than in the 1980s (25 percent). Considering the convergence in the context of changes\nin race-specific factors versus changes in the wage-structure, we find that, in general, changes in\nrace-specific factors had a larger impact than changes in the wage structure. That being said,\nwage inequality did exact a considerable toll on black-white wage convergence during the 1980s\nand continued to be a factor inhibiting the closure of the gap during the 1990s.\nAmong workers with less than ten years of labor market experience, the historical pattern\nof change in the total wage gap is similar to that for all workers. Between 1968 and 1979, the\nwage gap converged at an average of 1.33 percentage points a year. During the 1980s, the gap\nwidened at an annual rate of .61 percentage point per year. The rate of convergence during the\n1990s was solid, with the wage gap closing at a rate of 1.19 percentage points per year. In terms\nof the factors influencing convergence, much like the larger group of all workers, equalization of\nthe distributions of employment by industry and occupation (employment structure) explains\n0.34 of the 1.19 percentage points per year decline in inequality. The largest factor influencing\nthe reduction in the wage gap, however, is a decline in the residual, which would account for a\n.84 percentage point reduction in the gap since 1990. Within that decline, the most important\nfactor appears to be an equalization in the quantity of unobservable skills between blacks and\nwhites and/or a lessening of labor market discrimination.\n-20-\n\nVII. Conclusions\nDuring the 1990s and into the new century, the relative status of black male workers\nbegan to improve, marking the end of a long period of stasis and even regression. The rate of\nconvergence of wages among all male workers observed during the period from 1989 to 2001\nwas .59 percentage point per year. The rate of convergence for younger workers was more rapid\nat 1.19 percentage points per year. For both groups, improved educational attainment and greater\nindustry and occupational diversification helped reduce the gap. Greater convergence in\nunobservable skills and/or a reduction in labor market discrimination also played a role in the\nimproved relative status of black men. That said, economy-wide wage inequality continued to\ntemper the convergence in black-white wages, although its impact was less important than in the\nprevious decades.\n-21-\n\nReferences\nAltonji, J. and R.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNational Press Club Virtual Event\nWashington, DC\nJune 15, 2020\n12:30PM EST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nHello, everyone. Thank you for the invitation to join all of you, especially\nat this critical time in our country. Today’s challenges require everyone’s best\nthinking, and dialogues like the ones hosted here play a crucial role in\nnavigating our way toward a better future.\nOf course, our challenges are many right now.\nCOVID-19 has taken a tremendous toll on American life. Just a few\nweeks ago, the United States passed a grim marker – one hundred thousand\nCOVID-related deaths.\nTo mitigate the spread of the virus, large portions of the country paused\nall but essential economic activity for more than two months. The magnitude\nof this sacrifice is unprecedented in our modern history – more than 20\nmillion workers pushed into unemployment, millions more out of the labor\nforce altogether, and countless businesses shuttered, some forever.\nIn both health and economic terms, the costs have fallen most heavily on\nthose who are least able to bear them. Low-income communities have been\n1\n\nFINAL\n1\ndisproportionately burdened by COVID-19. Job losses have been\nconcentrated among those with less than a college education, people of color,\npeople with disabilities, immigrants, and others. And the past three weeks\nhave served as a painful reminder that these are far from the only inequities\nin our country. Tensions and unrest around instances of police brutality,\nstructural racism, and systemic injustice have flared nationwide.\nThree crises – health, economic, and social – are converging into one\ndifficult moment in American history. It forces each of us to reflect and\nconsider who we are, as individuals and as a collective. And it will require\nthose of us in leadership positions to take bold action if we’re going to chart a\ncourse through this turmoil and on to a better future.\nToday, I will primarily discuss our economic challenges and what bold\naction could look like in that space. And while economic equity is only part of\nthe solution we need to craft, it will provide an essential foundation for\nmaking progress on health and social inequities as well.\nBut before I go further, let me give the standard disclaimer: my remarks\ntoday are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.\nBridging the coronavirus\nSo let’s talk first about what the economic challenges we’re facing look\nlike.\nWe began this year in the midst of the longest economic expansion in\nAmerican history. While it felt slow at times and didn’t reach every\n1\nShrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020), Cajner 2e t al. (2020).\n\nFINAL\ncommunity to the same degree, we nonetheless experienced more than 10\nyears of growth. Then the coronavirus reached our shores, and a decade of\neconomic progress was erased in a matter of months.\nIn response to this shock, both monetary and fiscal policymakers moved\nquickly to deliver emergency support to households and businesses disrupted\nby the virus.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we cut the federal funds rate to essentially zero\nand used our lender of last resort powers to provide liquidity to volatile\nfinancial markets. With assistance from the Treasury, we also provided more\ndirect support for households, businesses, and state and local governments.\nThese actions have helped ease market pressures and ensured the smooth\n2\nflow of funding and credit that is so vital to our economy.\nOur decisions were firmly rooted in lessons from history. The measures\nthe Fed took during and after the Great Recession a decade ago taught us how\nto respond even faster and more forcefully to COVID-19.\nLessons from the Great Depression also loomed large. The mistakes\nmade in the 1930s underscore the importance of a rapid and forceful\nmonetary policy response when crises occur. The severe hardship during that\ndecade would have been much less acute had monetary policy been more\n3\naccommodative earlier.\nFiscal policymakers also took swift and bold action. Congress and the\nWhite House approved several rounds of economic relief, collectively worth\nalmost three trillion dollars. The aid was broad-based and included expanding\nand enhancing unemployment insurance, giving cash payments to most\n2\nBoard of Governors (2020), Powell (2020).\n3\nBernanke (2002). 3\n\nFINAL\nhouseholds, and providing direct support to small businesses through a\n4\nforgivable loan program.\nTaken together, these monetary and fiscal measures are helping to\nbridge our people and our economy through the immediate hardships caused\nby COVID-19. And that’s the intent – to provide emergency relief so that we\ncan emerge from the crisis on the best possible footing and expand more\nrapidly when the virus is safely controlled or behind us.\nOf course, no one knows right now if these emergency actions will be\nsufficient, or if more relief will be needed. The virus, and how quickly we are\nable to manage it, will determine the length of the bridge we need to build.\nspeed\nWe’ll need to be flexible and responsive as the situation evolves – and\nCommitment\nprepared to do more, if more is needed. Because of action alone isn’t\nenough. to action over the long term is essential to ensuring a\nsustainable recovery.\nA decade is too long\nThe hardest lesson from both the Great Depression and the Great\nRecession is that it took a decade to dig out. A decade for the economy to fully\nrecover and for the benefits of growth to reach all of those displaced by the\nshock.\nThe Great Depression began in 1929. And in 1939, overall employment\nwas still below its pre-depression peak, leaving many workers and families\nstranded and struggling 10 years later.\n4\nSee Wilson (2020) for a discussion of its pot4e ntial economic impact.\n\nFINAL\nThe employment recovery following the Great Recession was faster, but\nthe gains were uneven. In 2018, household incomes for the bottom 20 percent\nof households were still lower than their pre-recession peak more than a\n5\ndecade earlier.\nWhat do we learn from this? A decade is too long. We can’t wait 10 years\nfor an economic recovery to reach everyone.\nSome people might argue that our ability to reverse these patterns is\nlimited. That in present times, the post-virus economy will be so different that\nnot everyone will be able to adapt. That we should expect some dislocations to\nremain.\nAnd it’s certainly true that many of the recent job losses are likely to be\n6\npermanent. But we heard similar arguments during the Great Recession –\nthat we should expect unemployment to remain permanently elevated well\nabove its prior levels. The thinking was that unemployment approaching 10\npercent was due in large part to permanent or structural factors, rather than\n7\ntemporary cyclical disruptions.\nThe subsequent expansion proved that these arguments were wrong.\nUnemployment approached 50-year lows, while inflation remained subdued.\nWe discovered that the labor market was much more flexible than we thought\n– and that finding maximum employment experientially, rather than\ntheoretically, yields a higher number than almost anyone thought possible.\n5\nSemega et al. (2019).\n6\n7\nBarrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020).\nSee for example Kocherlakota (2010), Lacker (2012), and Phelps (2008). Daly et al.\n(2012) provide an alternative view. 5\n\nFINAL\nMoreover, we found – in the data, and in our conversations with\nbusiness and community leaders – that letting the economy run past what we\nthought was possible has tremendous benefits, especially for less advantaged\n8\ngroups. Individuals who were previously seen as less employable – such as\nthose with less education or experience – were able to get a foothold when\n9\neconomic conditions were sufficiently strong.\nThose same groups – who only lately got a chance to experience the\nbenefits of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history – are now among\n10\nthe hardest hit as we respond to COVID-19. And this is not a new\nphenomenon. As in so many previous economic cycles, those least advantaged\nin the labor market are the first to be let go when conditions deteriorate, and\n11\nthe last to be hired when conditions improve.\nUnless we build the foundations for a sustained and robust recovery, we\nrisk losing these individuals – from the labor force, and perhaps even from the\n12\nmainstream of economic life.\nThis isn’t just about fairness – although that’s clearly important. Low\nemployment risks letting many people sit idle, sidelined from work and\nparticipation in economic life. This limits growth and pulls at the health of our\ncommunities.\nWe have to commit – now – to not letting this happen. Any plan for long-\nt e r m e c o n o m i c r e c o v e r y has to include the people we welcomed into\n8\nSee the discussion of the “Fed Listens” initiative on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-\nmonetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm\n9\nAaronson et al. (2019), Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n10\n11\nCajner et al. (202 0).\nCouch and Fairlie (2010), Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller (2012).\n12\nKrueger (2017). 6\n\nFINAL\nemployment during the expansion. This must be the measuring stick we hold\nourselves to.\nThe path forward\nWith this goal in mind, what should our path forward look like? The\nanswer isn’t simple, and it can’t be achieved by any one institution alone.\nAt the Federal Reserve, I expect our current stance of highly\naccommodative monetary policy to continue until the economy has largely\nrecovered what’s been lost due to the virus. Getting back on track to achieving\nour congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price\nstability is our top priority. And with the current low inflation environment\nexpected to continue, we can once again search for the upside potential of our\nfull employment goal.\nBut monetary policy can’t help the U.S. economy reach its full potential\non its own. We also need fiscal policymakers to commit to sustained\ninvestments in our economic future. The need for this was evident before the\n13\ncrisis, and it’s even more evident now.\nIncreasing investments may sound like a surprising recommendation.\nAfter all, we’ve already spent trillions of dollars in emergency economic relief.\nAnd this has occurred at a time when the federal debt was already at\n14\nhistorically high levels.\nBut the key word there is “emergency.” These actions were taken to\nkeep households and businesses solvent in the midst of the crisis. Much more\n13\nSee Elmendorf and Dynan (2020) for a related discussion recorded before the U.S. virus\noutbreak.\n14\nCongressional Budget Office (2020). 7\n\nFINAL\nwill be needed in order to build a strong economic foundation that will allow a\nfull recovery and sustained expansion.\ncomposition\nNow let me be clear: I’m not just advocating for increased public\nspending and debt. The of spending is crucial. We need to focus\non investments that leverage the talent of everyone and contribute to the\neconomy’s long-term growth prospects. In this case, inclusive growth is faster\ngrowth – and it will pay for itself in the long run.\nAnd now is an especially good time to take on this type of debt. Even\nbefore the crisis, we were in an environment of low interest rates – and that is\n15\nexpected to continue for the foreseeable future. This makes public spending\nrelatively inexpensive and easy to finance.\nThe payoff is potentially huge. Public works programs during the Great\nDepression re-employed many of those hardest hit by the downturn and made\nlasting improvements in the nation’s infrastructure that boosted our\n16\neconomy’s potential output. The GI Bill following World War II helped\n17\neducate a generation and set the stage for rapid postwar growth. And the\nconstruction of the interstate highway system created jobs while laying the\n18\ngroundwork for our modern economy.\n15\n16\nWilliams (2018), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\nSee, for example, Kline and Moretti (2014).\n17\nBound and Turner (2002), Fernald and Jones (2014).\n18\nFernald (1999). See also Leduc and Wilson (2012) for the effects of road spending\nfollowing the Great Recession. 8\n\nFINAL\nOpportunity infrastructure\nSo what should today’s investments look like? The greatest need is for\nwhat I’ll call “opportunity infrastructure” – the building blocks that help\nindividuals maximize their potential.\nFirst, we need to invest in people’s health. The coronavirus exposed\nexisting inequities in both health outcomes and access to health care.\nStructural factors related to race, location, and income have created\ndisparities that leave less advantaged communities more vulnerable to health\nshocks. And when those shocks come, access to health care can be\n19\nprohibitively expensive, or not available at all.\nA healthy economy requires healthy people who can live, and work, and\ncontribute to our society. Investing in health infrastructure, access, and care\nwill both improve individual outcomes and help create a more productive\nlabor force.\nNext, we need to invest in the full life cycle of education. Education is\nthe best form of insurance against unemployment. We’ve seen this in the\nrecent job losses, which were much less severe for those with college degrees.\nEducational investments should begin with early childhood education\nthat helps kids develop and allows parents to pursue employment without\n20\nmaking difficult tradeoffs. We should also focus on making higher education\nmore accessible, and encouraging students to enroll in and complete college.\nOf course, lifelong learning also means bolstering access to schooling and\nskills training to help workers displaced by economic shocks like COVID-19.\n19\nShrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020).\n20\nHeckman, Pinto, and Savelyev (2013), Shrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020), Grunewald\n(2020). 9\n\nFINAL\nThese investments boost employment, labor force participation, and ensure\n21\nour nation’s long-term global competitiveness.\nFinally, we need to invest in digital infrastructure so that we can expand\naccess to opportunity and create more economic resiliency. As shelter-in-\nplace became the norm around the country in March, being able to get online\nwas a crucial determinant of people’s ability to continue engaging in the\n22\nworkplace and in the classroom.\nJobs and education are only going to become more reliant on technology\nin the months and years ahead. And the “digital divide” means those without\nadequate connectivity will struggle to be full participants in our future\n23\neconomy. We need to close this gap in order to maximize our economic\npotential.\nWe can’t afford not to\nThe coronavirus is the largest economic shock most of us have\nexperienced in our lives. It’s taken a tremendous toll on all of us. But the\ninequities it exposed – and often magnified – have been with us for a long\ntime.\nRight now, not everyone gets the same chance to succeed in our\ncountry. And it’s not for lack of trying – it’s for lack of opportunity. Our\nBut we don’t have to accept this.\nsystem, whether we meant it to be or not, is set up that way.\n2\n22\n1\nSee the discussion in Daly ( 2 019).\nGao (2020).\n23\nGoss, Lee, and Gao (2019). 10\n\nFINAL\nOur nation’s economic health, physical health, and societal health are all\nintertwined. And while addressing our economic challenges alone can’t solve\nthe health and social issues we’re facing, it can certainly help.\nWe find ourselves at an inflection point. A moment when crises\nconverge, and a once-in-a-generation opportunity presents itself. The choices\nwe make today will define our future path.\nWe have to choose long-term growth. We have to choose equitable\nopportunity. We have to choose inclusive success.\nWe can’t afford not to.\nThank you.\n11\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C.

By contrast, in recent years more robust statistical methods using larger and\nricher data sources have generally pointed to little or no relationship between inequality and\nmortality. This paper aims both to document how methodological shortcomings tend to\npositively bias this statistical association and to advance this literature by estimating the\ninequality-mortality relationship. We use a comprehensive and rich new data set that\ncombines U.S. county-level data for 1990 and 2000 on age-race-gender-specific mortality\nrates, a rich set of observable covariates, and previously unused Census data on local\nincome inequality (Gini index and three income percentile ratios). Using panel data\nestimation techniques, we find evidence of a statistically significant negative relationship\nbetween mortality and inequality. This finding that increased inequality is associated with\ndeclines in mortality at the county level suggests a change in course for the literature. In\nparticular, the emphasis to date on the potential psychosocial and resource allocation costs\nassociated with higher inequality is likely missing important offsetting positives that may\ndominate.\nKeywords: Inequality, mortality, relative income, health.\nJEL Codes: I31, D6, H0, J0\n-- 2 --\n\nI. Introduction\nRapid growth in income inequality in the United States and other industrialized\nnations over the past three decades has raised numerous concerns among policymakers.\nOne of the more worrisome is the possibility that income inequality might be causally\nrelated to mortality. Prima facie evidence of such a link in the United States comes from\nthe facts that the country’s income distribution is among the most unequal in the\nindustrialized world and its life expectancy lags behind that of most developed nations. The\npotential for such a relationship has generated considerable attention in the media, medical\njournals, and grant-making institutions. It is one of the most studied issues in public health\nand economics.\nEmpirical research examining the causal linkages between inequality and mortality\nhas produced mixed and often contradictory results. Early research across a variety of\ndisciplines, looking across countries, states, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs),\ngenerally has found positive and statistically significant associations between inequality and\nmortality.1 More recent efforts using richer data sources that allow more rigorous statistical\nmethods have found little or no association between inequality and mortality.2 Considering\nover 100 studies of the topic, Clarkwest and Jencks (2003) conclude that (1) there is no\nconsensus among scholars, and (2) the evidence on either side is too weak to decide\nbetween competing claims of a small harmful effect and no effect at all. Similarly, Lynch,\n1 For example, Wilkinson 1992; Ben-Shlomo, White, and Marmot 1996; Kaplan et al. 1996; Kennedy, et al.\n1996a; Kawachi and Kennedy 1997; Kawachi et al. 1997; Lynch et al. 1998; Lobmayer and Wilkinson 2000;\nRoss et al. 2000; Lochner et al. 2001; Lynch et al. 2001; McLaughlin and Stokes 2002; Sanmartin et al. 2003;\nShi et al. 2003.\n2For example, see Judge, Mulligan, and Benzeval 1998; Deaton and Lubotsky 2003; Deaton and Paxson 2001;\nClarkwest and Jencks 2003; and Gerdtham and Johannesson 2004.\n-- 3 --\n\net al. (2004) consider nearly 100 studies on the relationship between income inequality and\nhealth and conclude that “there seems to be little support for the idea that income inequality\nis a major, generalizable determinant of population health differences within or between\nrich countries.” Most recently, Kondo et al. (2009) performed a meta-analysis of the\nestimated effect of inequality on mortality based on 39 distinct estimates from 28 separate\ncohort and cross-sectional studies. About half of the estimates were positive and\nstatistically significant at the 95% confidence level; the remaining estimates were not\nsignificantly different from zero. Only three estimates were negative, and none of these\nwas statistically significant. In addition, they report that the positive effect tends to be\nreduced or eliminated in analyses that control for unobserved local characteristics. This is\nparticularly interesting considering our finding that controlling for unobserved local\ncharacteristics (fixed effects) is critically important for obtaining a negative inequality-\nmortality link.\nThe mixed results in this literature have left the scholarly community at an impasse.\nProponents maintain that a positive causal link exists but is difficult to observe, while\nskeptics point to an absence of robust evidence. In part, the continued debate owes to\nlimitations in the data and associated methods that prevent definitive testing of an effect\nthat is free of spurious correlations with other variables.\nIn general, studies of income inequality and mortality fall into one of three types.\nThe first type is cross-sectional studies across geographic areas (states, counties, or MSAs)\nwithin a country.3 These studies typically use nationally representative data and often\ninclude important local covariates in addition to inequality. However, given their cross-\n3Examples include Kaplan et al. 1996; Kennedy et al. 1996; Kawachi et al. 1997; and Lynch et al. 1998.\n-- 4 --\n\nsectional nature, they cannot control for unobserved local characteristics (fixed effects).\nThey also often lack accurate measures of inequality, relying instead on relatively crude\nmetrics such as the ratio of the mean to the median income. The second type is individual\nlevel longitudinal studies, which typically have rich sets of individual covariates and local\nlevel inequality, but omit important local covariates and do not allow for local fixed\neffects.4 In addition, these studies tend to have small samples that limit the statistical power\nof any analysis. The third type of study is cross-country or cross-state panel studies, which\ncontrol for country/state fixed effects to account for geographic differences in mortality\nrates that are unrelated to income inequality.5 The drawback of these studies is that they\ntend to rely on very limited sets of covariates. Moreover, because health may depend on\nlocal factors, the state or country level may be too large of a geographic area to capture\nthese effects.\nStudies that find significant effects of inequality on mortality frequently are subject\nto methodological criticisms including the failure to control for individual or regional\ndifferences in mortality risk. On the other hand, studies which find no effect generally face\nchallenges of small sample size which reduce the researcher’s ability to precisely estimate\nany effect. These studies most frequently conclude that inequality has no “statistically\nsignificant” effect; however, the lack of precision suggests that this conclusion reflects an\nabsence of evidence for an effect, rather than evidence that there is no effect.\nWhat, then, can researchers do to resolve the impasse in the literature? Clarkwest\nand Jencks (2003) are pessimistic on the issue. They conclude that no available data exist\n4Examples include Lochner et al. 2001; Eibner and Evans 2005; Deaton and Paxson 2001; and Mellor and\nMilyo 2002, 2003.\n5 Examples include Judge, Mulligan, and Benzeval 1998; Mellor and Milyo 2002; and Leigh and Jencks 2007.\n-- 5 --\n\nto sufficiently address all of the empirical shortcomings of previous studies simultaneously.\nThey say, “There is no realistic prospect of getting better data that will settle this debate any\ntime soon. Most observers will therefore continue to base their judgments on their prior\nbeliefs.” We are more optimistic that additional work can be done. As such, we have\nassembled a data set that fills in many of the gaps from previous studies.\nIn this paper, we combine county panel data on group-specific mortality rates, a rich\nset of county observable covariates, and previously unused Census data on county income\ninequality to estimate the effects of inequality on mortality risk. We use these data to\nestimate the effects of income inequality on mortality risk in the United States. To ensure\nconsistency with previous results, we begin by replicating key findings of previous\nanalyses. Specifically, we confirm the strong positive association between inequality and\nmortality in simple bivariate and multivariate regressions. We then show that this\ncorrelation disappears when local covariates and/or state fixed effects are added to the\nregression.\nAfter we demonstrate the consistency of our data with the prior literature, we refine\nour specification of the model to include controls for local, time-invariant unobservables\n(i.e., county fixed effects). In this specification, we show that income inequality is\nnegatively related to mortality risk. This effect is statistically significant and it holds true\nfor both overall inequality and for inequality in the top half and bottom half of the income\ndistribution independently. These results suggest that a new direction in research on\ninequality and mortality may be warranted.\n-- 6 --\n\nII. Theoretical Links between Inequality and Health\nMost explanations for an association between income inequality and mortality fall\ninto two categories: economic and psychosocial. The economic explanations rest on the\npremise that, at the individual level, the relationship between mortality and income is\nnonlinear; that is, if inequality in the income distribution produces unequal access to\nservices such as education, health care, and police protection, the negative effects for those\nat the bottom of the distribution will not be offset by positive outcomes for those at the top\nof the distribution. 6 Moreover, the negative health outcomes of an unequal income\ndistribution may not be limited to the portion of the population with fewer resources.\nDifferential access to resources and services may result in less effective preventive health\ncare (e.g., childhood vaccinations), more costly disease control (e.g., tuberculosis\ntreatments), or higher crime rates, affecting the health and mortality risk of the entire\npopulation.7\nThe psychosocial hypothesis suggests that it is one’s relative income position itself\nthat matters for their health and mortality risk. Under this hypothesis, income inequality\nand mortality risk are linked through the effects of emotional and psychological stress on\nhealth.8 The theory posits that levels of depression, isolation, insecurity, and anxiety,\nwhich are known correlates of mortality, are associated with relative economic position. In\naddition, some argue, inequality inhibits many of the social behaviors that may reduce\nstress and anxiety, such as participation in voluntary organizations or community groups\n6 This argument leads Clarkwest and Jencks (2003) to conclude that, unless income inequality has some type\nof protective effect that operates independently of one’s own income, the impact of inequality must be to\nlower life expectancy or increase mortality.\n7 Kaplan et al. (1996) lay out the reasoning behind the economic pathways between income inequality and\nmortality.\n8 The psychosocial hypothesis is associated with the Whitehall Studies and Wilkinson (1992).\n-- 7 --\n\nand investment in ongoing education and training.\nWhich of these two pathways, if either, connects aggregate income inequality to\nindividual health outcomes is an empirical question that researchers have made little\nprogress in addressing. The bulk of the empirical research on mortality and inequality has\nfocused less on identifying the causal pathway and more on establishing that a statistical\nlinkage between the two exists. For the most part, this paper continues along the latter\ncourse. However, by looking separately at the effects of top-half and bottom-half inequality\nand at the effects of inequality on different causes of death, we also are able to shed some\nlight on the likely pathways underlying the overall statistical linkage.\nIII. Data and Methods\nThe data used in this paper come from two main sources: the Compressed Mortality\nFiles (CMF) from the National Center for Health Statistics, and the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThe CMF data provide by-cause mortality counts and rates (per 100,000 population) by\ngender-age-race-county cells from 1989 through 2002. These data cover all deaths recorded\nin the United States (including deaths for which individual information is not publicly\navailable). We use these data to construct all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates by\ngender-age-race-county cells in 1990 and 2000, measuring age in 10-year reference groups\nand race as white, black, and other. To minimize the frequency of zero mortalities in a\ngiven year at this disaggregated cell level (especially for certain causes), we average the\nmortality rate within each cell over 1989 and 1990 and treat the result as the “1990”\nmortality rate. Likewise, we use 1999 and 2000 averages for the 2000 values. The final\ndata set contains roughly 330,000 cells (approximately 3,100 counties × 3 races (white,\n-- 8 --\n\nblack, other) × 2 genders × 11 age groups × 2 years = 409,200 possible cells, minus around\n80,000 empty cells).\nWe combine the mortality data with data provided from the Census Bureau on\ncounty-level income inequality calculated from household-level data collected in the 1990\nand 2000 decennial censuses. (Data from other decennial census years were not available.)\nTo the best of our knowledge, these data have not been used previously in this literature.9\nWe use four measures of inequality from the data: the Gini coefficient and three income\npercentile ratios: 95/20, 95/50, and 50/20. The Gini coefficient is commonly used in the\nincome inequality literature and is included in our county-level data. One drawback of the\nGini coefficient does not allow one to decompose total inequality into dispersion in the top\nhalf and bottom half of the income distribution. We use the percentile ratios to solve this\nproblem. As the names suggest, these ratios are ratios of the income levels at two\npercentiles of the income distribution. For example, the 95/20 measures overall income\ninequality according to the ratio of the 95th percentile to the 20th percentile. The 95/50 ratio\nmeasures income inequality in the top half of the distribution, and the 50/20 ratio measures\ninequality in the bottom half.\nLastly, we compile data for a host of demographic and socioeconomic covariates.\nFrom the Census Bureau’s USA Counties database, we obtained county-level data for 1990\nand 2000 on the poverty rate (by race within county), the crime rate (number of serious\ncrimes per capita), the share of the population in each educational category (less than high\nschool, high school but no diploma, high school graduate or equivalency, some college but\nno degree, associate degree, bachelor degree, some graduate school but no degree, graduate\n9 These data are available for public use, though they are not published or provided on the Census Bureau\nwebsite.\n-- 9 --\n\nor professional degree), the share of population of each race (white, black, or other), the\nshare of population by age group (less than 20, 20 to 64, 65 and above), average family\nsize, share of population by marital category (by male and female: never married, married,\nseparated, divorced, widowed, other), population density, share of county population on\nsocial security disability, share of population living in institutions, latitude, and longitude.\nFrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we obtained the average annual unemployment rate in\n1990 and 2000 in each county.\nIV. Results\nWe use these data to estimate the effects of inequality on mortality risk. It is useful\nfirst to consider the simple cross-sectional relationship between these two variables. Figure\n1 shows a simple scatter plot of all-cause mortality rates versus income inequality for 1990\nand 2000. We measure income inequality here using the 95/20 percentile ratio; the results\nare quite similar using the Gini coefficient. To ease visualization of the data, we group\ncounties into 313 bins of approximately 10 counties each after ranking counties by their\n95/20 ratios. For each bin, the data point shows the population-weighted mean of the 95/20\nratio on the x axis and the population-weighted mean of the mortality rate (deaths per\n100,000 persons) on the y axis. Figure 1 shows a clear positive raw correlation between\nincome inequality and mortality across counties in both 1990 and 2000.\nWe explore the relationship between inequality and mortality shown in the scatter\nplot more formally using Poisson and negative binomial maximum likelihood estimation.10\nIn all cases, we adjust standard errors for clustering of observations within a county. This\n10 The results presented in the tables in this section are based on the Poisson regressions. The results using\nnegative binomial are virtually identical and, hence, are not shown.\n-- 10 --\n\nclustering allows for correlated observations within a county both across age-race-gender\ncell groups and across years (to allow, for example, for serial correlation between 1990 and\n2000).\nWe begin by considering the county-level relationship between income inequality,\nmeasured by the 95/20 percentile ratio, and the age-race-gender all-cause mortality rate.\nTable 1 shows the results of this analysis for a variety of model specifications. Each\ncolumn heading (1 to 4) denotes a separate regression; we provide coefficients and their\ncorresponding Z-statistics for the key variables of interest.\nWe base the results under column headings (1) and (2) on model specifications that\nare quite restrictive but similar to what has been estimated extensively in previous research.\nColumn (1) reports results for a simple Poisson regression of age-race-gender-year\nmortality rates on age, race, gender, and year dummy variables and the county-level Gini\ncoefficient. Consistent with the simple bivariate scatter plots discussed earlier, this\nregression yields a positive and statistically significant (below the 1% level) relationship.\nColumn (2) shows results of a specification that adds two key conditioning variables: (the\nlog of) median county income and the county-race-specific poverty rate. As expected given\nthe prior literature, the magnitude of the association between inequality and mortality falls,\nbut the estimate remains statistically significant (below the 1% level). The results in\ncolumns (1) and (2) confirm the oft-cited positive association between inequality and\nmortality risk in aggregate cross-sectional data.\nMoving across the table, column (3) shows that adding a richer set of local\ncovariates reduces the estimated inequality effect to near zero. This result is consistent with\nthe findings from much of the recent literature using richer data sources, which report little\n-- 11 --\n\nevidence of a quantitatively meaningful impact of inequality on mortality. Though not\nshown in the table (to save space), the results are similar when state-level fixed effects are\nadded.\nThe final specification in the table (column (4)) departs from previous work by\ncontrolling for time-invariant, local unobservables, i.e., county fixed effects. As the table\nshows, adding county fixed effects to the rich set of time-varying county controls yields a\nnegative effect of inequality on mortality risk that is statistically significant (below the 5%\nlevel). This result is a reversal of prior findings. To visualize the magnitude of this shift,\nFigure 2 plots the coefficient estimates from the model specifications in Table 1. As the\nfigure makes clear, the interpretations move from inequality being deleterious, having a\nlarge positive effect on mortality, to considering inequality as protective, having a negative\neffect on mortality.\nTable 2 repeats the analysis from Table 1 but uses the Gini coefficient as the\nmeasure of inequality. The results are qualitatively similar to those based on the 95/20\nratio, except that the negative coefficient in the full specification is not statistically\nsignificant (at standard levels). Nonetheless, the results show a positive and significant\neffect of inequality in univariate and bivariate models that becomes small or insignificant\nwhen a richer set of controls are included and moves in a negative direction as local fixed\neffects are included.\nIn our final analysis we consider whether these effects persist when inequality is\ndisaggregated into lower-half and upper-half income inequality. The results are shown in\nTable 3. We find that the negative effect of inequality holds much more strongly for top-\nhalf income inequality. The coefficient on bottom-half inequality also is negative, but it is\n-- 12 --\n\nnot statistically significant.\nIn Table 4, we extend the analysis by considering the effects of inequality on\nmortality for specific causes of death. We estimate the same county fixed effects\nregressions as described earlier, with the full set of covariates, separately for each of nine\nmajor causes of death. The coefficient on overall income inequality—measured by the\n95/20 ratio—is negative in all cases. It is statistically significant (at the 10% level or\nbelow) for five of the nine causes (cancer, stroke, accidents, liver failure, and homicide).\nThe results based on the Gini coefficient are broadly similar, though for two causes (heart\nattack and suicide) the coefficient on inequality is positive but statistically insignificant.\nWe find the separate effects of top- and bottom-half inequality, which are estimated\nsimultaneously in the same regression (for each cause), also generally are negative, though\nnot always statistically significantly so. We find top-half inequality has a negative and\nstatistically (at the 10% level or below) significant mortality effect for cancer, liver failure,\nand homicide, while bottom-half inequality has a negative and statistically significant effect\nfor stroke, accidents, and homicide.\nV. Possible Explanations for a Negative Inequality-Mortality Relationship\nOur empirical results point to a robust negative relationship between local-area\nincome inequality and mortality after conditioning on observed and unobserved, but time-\ninvariant, local-area characteristics. There are two potential explanations for this result.\nFirst, unobserved time-varying local factors may be correlated with both local-area\ninequality and local-area mortality in a way that negatively biases the estimated\nrelationship. Note, however, that given the strong positive association we and others find\n-- 13 --\n\nwhen controls are limited, this explanation also requires that the negative bias from\nomitting unobserved time-varying local factors be more than offset by a positive bias from\nomitting a rich set of controls. The second possible explanation is that local-area income\ninequality, or something proxied by inequality, has a causal negative (protective) effect on\nmortality.\nTo formally explore this latter possibility and highlight possible ways income\ninequality might directly affect health, we consider a simple model of community health\nproduction. We think about community health production as an increasing function of\nsocial capital, federal and state government transfers (especially Medicare and Medicaid),\nlocal government health-care spending, local private medical spending (e.g., philanthropic\ngiving), and county socioeconomic and demographic composition. We hypothesize that (1)\nsocial capital is a decreasing function of both top-half and bottom-half inequality, (2)\ngovernment transfers received from higher levels of government (state and federal) are a\ndecreasing function of lower incomes, (3) government medical spending is an increasing\nfunction of local tax revenue, which is an increasing function of top-half inequality (due to\ntax progressivity), and (4) private medical spending is an increasing function of upper\nincomes (i.e., the good obtained from private medical spending is a luxury good).\nTaken together, these hypotheses suggest that inequality in either the top- or\nbottom-half has offsetting effects on health. Top-half inequality harms health by reducing\nsocial capital. However, because higher top-half inequality, holding median income\nconstant, reflects higher upper-tail incomes (95th percentile), it has a countervailing\nprotective effect from increases in both private and government (via taxes) medical\nspending. Moreover, higher local government revenue could increase other public services,\n-- 14 --\n\npartially offsetting the hit to social capital from inequality.\nAnalogously, bottom-half inequality could have a harmful effect from reducing\nsocial capital. However, increasing government transfers provide a protective effect\nbecause higher bottom-half inequality, holding median income constant, implies reduced\nlower-tail (20th percentile) income. For instance, eligibility for Medicaid and the State\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program is determined by family income, so a shift in a\ncounty’s income distribution that pushes more people below these programs’ income-\neligibility thresholds will increase transfers from the state and federal government to that\ncounty. The poverty rate in our regressions will capture some but not all of this protective\neffect because the income thresholds for many government health programs exceed the\npoverty level and hence are closer to the 20th percentile. According to this simple model,\nour regression results can then be explained as follows: An increase in top-half inequality\nreduces social capital but increases public and private medical spending, and the latter\neffect dominates. In addition, the protective effect of a higher 50/20 ratio from increased\ngovernment transfers roughly offsets or slightly dominates its harmful effects from reduced\nsocial capital.\nVI. Conclusions\nOther studies have highlighted the importance of local time-invariant characteristics\non the relationship between economic variables and health. This study pushes a step further,\nfinding that not accounting for time-invariant characteristics not only positively biases the\nestimated effect of inequality on mortality but also obscures an apparent negative effect of\ninequality on mortality. Our finding—that increases in inequality are associated with\n-- 15 --\n\ndeclines in mortality at the county level—suggests a change in course for the literature on\nhealth and inequality. In particular, we find that the emphasis in other research on potential\npsychosocial and resource allocation costs associated with higher inequality may miss\nimportant offsetting positives, and, in fact, these offsetting factors may dominate.\n-- 16 --\n\nReferences\nBen-Shlomo, Yoav, Ian R.

    "text": "Version Two\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of San Francisco School of Management Commencement\nSan Francisco, CA\nMay 17, 2024\n9:15 a.m. PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThis speech is dedicated to Gene and Jane Wagner and everyone who ever helped someone find\ntheir way.\nThank you for your kind introduction. And thank you, Father Fitzgerald, for the invitation to\nspeak here today. It is truly my honor.\nNow before I begin, I want to ask, how many of you missed your high school graduation\nceremony because of the pandemic? Raise your hands.\nI see a lot of hands.\nSo, the very first thing I want you to do is to take a moment to really appreciate that you’re here\nnow, in person, celebrating what you have achieved. You are resilient, and we are so proud of\nyou.\nAnd to all the family, friends, faculty, and everyone else who helped make this day possible.\nThank you. You have done an amazing service for us all.\nToday, I’d like to share two stories. Actually, one story told two ways.\nHere is version 1.\nWhen I was 15, I dropped out of high school to help support my family. I had odd jobs, and my\ngoal was to be a bus driver, because it came with union wages and good benefits. But I got\n\nlucky. I met a mentor, and she encouraged me to think bigger. To get a GED and go to college.\nSo, I did. I got a degree in economics and philosophy and went on to get a Ph.D. In 1996, I got a\njob as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Now, 28 years later, I’m\nstanding in front of you as President and CEO of that very institution.\nThat story is true. It’s meaningful. And it’s comfortable.\nIt’s also incomplete.\nSo, let me try again. And give you version 2.\nWhen I was 15, my family stumbled. My siblings moved in with my grandparents and I moved in\nwith friends. I left high school and got a job—three, actually. I drove a donut truck, worked at a\ndeli, and worked at a Target. I wanted to be a bus driver so I could have one job instead of\nthree.\nI was struggling.\nSo, a friend introduced me to a woman named Betsy. Betsy was kind and practical. She\nencouraged me to get a GED. As it turns out, you can’t be a bus driver without one.\nSo, I said yes.\nBut when I went to take the test, I was nervous, terrified really. I kept sweating on my test\npaper and breaking my pencil lead.\nAll I could think about was failing. Disappointing Betsy. Not being a bus driver. Not being\nanything close to a success.\nI wanted to quit, leave the test. Fortunately, I didn’t.\nNow, I’d like to tell you that with age and experience, fears of failing, disappointing, and\nchanging course go away. But that’s not how life works.\nAfter college, I went straight to graduate school, at the University of Illinois. I didn’t even think,\nI just went. I’d graduated at the top of my economics class and it seemed expected, natural.\nBut after a year, I felt unsure. Unsure if I wanted a Ph.D. Unsure if I wanted to be an economist.\nUnsure if I wanted to be a researcher.\nEvery day, I thought about changing. Switching programs, getting a job, doing anything\ndifferent than what I’d signed up for. Starting again.\nBut the stakes seemed high.\n2\n\nAfter all, the University of Illinois was Betsy’s alma mater. My undergraduate economics\nprofessors were so proud that I had followed in their footsteps to get a Ph.D. And my friends\nseemed confident, on track, and on their way to success.\nChanging my mind, changing course, felt weighty, irreversible, definitely like going backwards.\nBut I pivoted anyway.\nI moved to Chicago. I went to work for a theater and a dance company. I did accounting,\nbusiness, and even some prop and set design. I loved it.\nThen about a year into my new life, I realized it wasn’t perfect. I missed economics. I missed\nresearch and working with others to solve hard problems. I missed gathering evidence and\nevaluating it to inform policy. I missed everything. Because economics, as it turned out, was my\ncalling, my vocation. And I wanted to go back.\nBut that’s where things got really hard. I needed help. And I needed it from the very same\npeople, professors, who had helped me the first time.\nMy heart pounded as I dialed the phone. Gene Wagner, my undergraduate professor and\nmentor, answered. I immediately blurted out my news, stumbled through my explanation,\napologized, twice, and then I waited.\nI heard the rumbling of his voice before he shouted, and then it came: “Jane, come to the\nphone, Mary wants be an economist!”\nYou can imagine how I felt.\nNow, we spent the next hour talking, me, Gene, and his wife Jane. He told me that when he\nwas finding his path, he felt unsure too.\nHe never thought he could get a Ph.D. He worked construction, came from a working‐class\nfamily, and the whole idea felt foreign. But he loved being an economist, loved the direct\nconnection to people and to practice. Every day he went to work he felt joy, and he knew I\nwould feel the same.\nThat day, my professor, and someone I admired, told me version 2 of his story, and it changed\nme.\nThat’s why on this day, your graduation, I’m sharing version 2 of my story with you.\nTo tell you that I’ve been unsure, changed my mind, and thought I couldn’t do it.\n3\n\nBut I have done it. And so can you.\nThe truth is, no one gets to where they are smoothly. Everyone detours, doubts, and pivots.\nThat is human and part of finding your way.\nIt can be hard to know this when you are right in it. It can feel like friends are surging forward,\nand you are falling behind.\nBut that’s just noise.\nYour job, as you move forward in your journey, is to acknowledge the fears, and the\nuncertainty, and then listen.\nWe all have a voice inside of ourselves, telling us what’s next. The challenge is to hear it and\nthen be brave enough to follow its guidance.\nBecause in the end, there are no crooked paths, only your path. So, be yourself. Find your own\nway. And be proud of your version 2.\nThat’s the story, your story, that will change lives and change worlds.\nYou are ready. And we are all looking forward to what you will do.\nCongratulations, Class of 2024!\n4",

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of Missouri- Kansas City Virtual Commencement Address\n“A Pocket Speech”\nKansas City, MO\nMay 15 and 16, 2021\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nCongratulations UMKC graduates. I am pleased and privileged to be part of your celebration and the\nmarking of a fantastic accomplishment in your lives. Of course, I wish I could be with you in person, but I\nhope the virtual me conveys the joy and pride I have for each of you and your accomplishments. I join\nyour friends, family, and professors in giving you a big round of applause.\nNow, when I was young, I spent a lot of time thinking about change. How it happens, how I could be a\npart of it, how my voice could be big enough to be heard. And history books are filled with stories, most\nof them featuring heroes who simply took charge. They knew what to do and when to do it, and in a\nfew simple actions, they altered the course of history, leaving us all better off.\nAs I’ve aged, I’ve learned that these are just stories, told after the fact, that highlight the outcomes and\nendings, with very little sense of the journey. But today, I will tell you that the journey is everything. It’s\nthe true path to change. And here you have what those heroes had. You have agency—the ability to\naffect the world around you with the actions you take every day.\nAt no time in my memory has this kind of agency been more critical. The pandemic has torn away the\ntrappings of our normal lives and let us see more clearly what is really there. Some of the revelations\nhave been hard—disparities, divisions, hate, a sense that there is too little for everyone, so we must\nfight for our fair share. But we’ve also seen brightness, generosity, vulnerability. We’ve pulled down\nthe curtains that separate us, and watched each other navigate work, home, and family, from kitchens,\nbedrooms, and makeshift offices. And time and time again, what we’ve seen is that we are much more\nsimilar than different.\nAnd this is the thing we must pull through and remember from the pandemic. The challenges we face in\nthe world can be solved, but only if we bring our full selves to the task. The parts that lie behind the\nsynthetic divides that have long separated our personal selves from our work selves. The parts that\nreflect who we truly are. The parts of us that are fully human.\n1\n\nFINAL\nAnd here is where you come in. You’ve overcome so many challenges and\npersevered to finish your degrees, all while living through a global pandemic, something that hasn’t\nhappened in a hundred years. It makes you uniquely prepared to help build the post-pandemic future\nyou want, we all want. You bring something beyond your degrees and programs, you bring lived\nexperience.\nAs we move past the pandemic, our minds will draw us back to the familiar. Pulling us to return to the\nway things used to be. But that would be a mistake. You have the power to demand something\ndifferent. To build a world that is better, more generous, more equal, more forgiving, and most\nimportantly, more complete.\nSo, as you begin the next chapter of your lives, embrace the journey that brought you here. The tragedy\nof the pandemic can be your strength, your superpower, the thing that separates you. The thing that\ngives you vision—the vision to see through what is and imagine what can be.\nYour task, of course, will be to use your strength. To find agency in your humanness and help others do\nthe same. But I guarantee this: if you do that, our children’s children will read about you. They’ll wonder\nhow those heroes changed the world. And remember, it will be important to tell them the full story.\nThey did it by being human.\nCongratulations graduates. The future is yours, and I cannot wait to see what you do with it.\n2",

    "text": "Earnings Mobility and Instability, 1969-1995\nMary C. Daly\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nGreg J. Duncan\nNorthwestern University\nAbstract. We study earnings mobility and instability using data from the Panel Study of Income\nDynamics. Our main contribution is to update mobility and instability calculations to include data\nfrom the 1990s, although we also provide a number of tests of robustness across mobility and\ninstability indicators and sample definition. All in all, we find few trends in earnings mobility and\ninstability that persist over the 27-year period we study. As with Gottschalk and Moffitt, we find\nan increase in earnings instability since the 1970s, particularly among younger workers. However,\nwe find no evidence that instability continued to increase throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.\nWith regard to mobility, we find greater upward mobility and less downward mobility of middle-\nincome workers in the 1980s relative to the 1970s. The former trend appears to have reversed\nitself by the middle of the 1990s. Employment-based indicators are consistent with the earnings-\nbased indicators in showing increased employment instability between the 1970s and later periods.\n\nEarnings Mobility and Instability, 1969-1995\nI. Introduction\nCountless studies documenting increases in earnings inequality (reviewed in Levy and\nMurnane 1992) have created a popular impression that individual lifetime earnings patterns are\nchanging. However, much of the research on these trends is based on comparisons of the\ndistribution of earnings in a given year. While such comparisons provide useful information,\ncareful observers have recognized that cross-sectional patterns for the population do not\nnecessarily translate into individual lifetime outcomes and that, even in a cross-section, increases\nin inequality can result from increased dispersion in a static earnings distribution or from increased\nvariability of earnings offers to perfectly mobile individuals.\nThese recognitions have prompted a number of longitudinal studies based on direct\nmeasurement of the earnings trajectories of individual workers. In many cases, these longitudinal\nstudies have yielded wildly disparate results. Among the most optimistic views of individual\nmobility in United States are two investigations of absolute mobility based on data from the Panel\nStudy of Income Dynamics (PSID) (Cox and Alm 1996; The Alexis de Toqueville Institute 1997).\nBoth of these studies, featured on the editorial and opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal and\nNew York Times, examined the absolute mobility of individuals over their lifetimes. Both found\nthat a majority of the individuals who started out in the bottom quintile of the income distribution\nin the mid 1970s ended up in the middle or top income classes by the 1990s. For example, Cox\nand Alm found that only five percent of income recipients in the bottom quintile of the 1975\nindividual income distribution had 1991 incomes below the inflation-adjusted breakpoint of the\n1975 quintile. More surprisingly, they found that over one-half of those in the bottom quintile in\n1\n\n1975 had moved to the top 40 percent of the inflation-adjusted 1975 income distribution by 1991.\nThese initially low-income individuals enjoyed, on average, a 22-fold increase in real income! As\nimprobable as these results seem, a replication and extension of this analysis by Daly (1997)\nshows that, if anything, mobility as measured by the Cox-Alm samples and methodology was\nsomewhat larger than they reported.\nOther studies, using the same data but focusing on relative income mobility have produced\nmore modest estimates of lifetime earnings progression. For example, Condon and Sawhill (1992)\nfound that more than one-half of those who started at the bottom of the income distribution in\n1967 and 1977 remained at the bottom of the distribution ten years later—in 1976 and 1986.\nMoreover, only ten percent of those in the bottom in 1967 and 1977 had moved to the top 40\npercent of the distribution by the end of the ten year period. Most importantly, examining changes\nin quintile transition rates between the two ten year periods, they found no substantial changes in\nthe structure of earnings mobility over time. This finding is consistent with research by\nBurkhauser, Holtz-Eakin, and Rhody (1996) who reported no change in one and five year\nmobility rates during the 1970s and 1980s.\nUntil recently, the fact that the variance in cross-sectional earnings was increasing was\ntaken to mean that the distribution of permanent earnings was becoming more disperse.\nGottschalk and Moffitt (1993,1994) challenged this logic and showed that a significant fraction of\nthe increased dispersion in the earnings distribution is related to transitory shifts in earnings (i.e.,\ninstability) rather than permanent changes in earnings trajectories. They found that during the\nperiod when inequality was increasing, the instability of earnings was also increasing. In fact, their\nresults suggest that between one-third and one-half of the increase in annual earnings inequality\n2\n\nduring the 1980s is attributable to increases in the transitory rather than the permanent component\nof earnings.\nHaider (1997), building on the Gottschalk and Moffitt study, developed a more general\nmethod of partitioning variance into persistent and transitory components. Haider used a model of\nheterogeneous earnings growth that allows individual earnings to differ from the mean earnings\nprofile and for this difference to change over time. Using this model Haider calculated lifetime\nearnings inequality and earnings instability during the period from 1967 to 1991. He found that\nthe largest change in lifetime earnings inequality occurred during the early 1980s. He also found\nthat instability and persistent inequality were equally important in the increase in earnings\ninequality over the period, but that instability was more important during the late 1970s and\npersistent inequality was more important during the 1980s.\nDespite the finding that earnings instability played an important role in the growth in\nearnings inequality during the 1980s comparatively little research on exists on this topic. One of\nthe key components of earnings stability is job stability. As detailed in Marcotte's (1995) recent\nreview, there have been two approaches to addressing the question of trends in job stability. One\nset of studies, recently exemplified by Diebold et al. (1996, forthcoming), Neumark et al. (1997),\nSwinnerton and Wial (1995, 1996), and Farber (1995), all of whom used data from the Current\nPopulation Survey; and Marcotte (1994) and Rose (1995), both of whom used data from the\nPSID; focus on responses to questions regarding job and employer tenure. A second approach is\nto study involuntary job losses directly, as illustrated in Farber's (1993, 1996) studies of job losses\nreported in the retrospective Displaced Worker Survey and Monks and Pizer (1995) study using\ndata on voluntary and involuntary job changes from youth cohorts of the National Longitudinal\n3\n\nSurveys.\nMost of the tenure-based studies agree that job stability has declined for certain labor\nmarket subgroups, in particular the overlapping groups of workers without a college education\nand black workers. These studies disagree on whether declining stability is a more general\ncharacterization of the labor market. The two PSID-based studies (Marcotte, 1994 and Rose,\n1995) and one of the CPS-based studies (Swinnerton and Wial, 1995) suggest such a general\ndecline, while the other two CPS-based studies (Diebold et al., 1994 and Farber, 1995) do not\nsupport the hypothesis of a general decline. An interchange between the latter sets of authors\nreduced the scope of their differences somewhat (Diebold et al., 1996; Swinnerton and Wial,\n1996). Preliminary evidence in Neumark et al. (1997) suggests that CPS-based estimates of job\ntenure may have declined in the 1990s, especially among older and better educated workers.\nWe study earnings mobility and instability using data from the Panel Study of Income\nDynamics. Our contributions are three. First, we update mobility and instability calculations to\ninclude data from the 1990s. Neither Gottschalk and Moffitt nor Sawhill and Condon use data\nafter 1987 and Haider’s analysis stops in 1991. We use data through 1995 and are thus able to\nadd one more business cycle to the PSID's longitudinal coverage. Second, we extend sample\ncoverage and earnings measurement in the Gottschalk and Moffitt study to explore the robustness\nof their finding of greater instability. Third, we explore various mechanisms that might account for\nthe increase in earnings instability.\nII. Methodology\nOur data come from the 1970-96 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which\nprovide data on the earnings, work hours and other employment conditions of a continuously\n4\n\nrepresentative sample from the U.S. population over the period between 1969 and 1995.\nGottschalk and Moffitt (1994) report that earnings data in the PSID track earnings data in the\nCPS reasonably well, while Fitzgerald, Gottschalk and Moffitt (1996) demonstrate no worrisome\nbiases in the weighted PSID sample with regard to a wide variety of intragenerational dimensions.\nAll of our analyses use the PSID's sample weights from the most recent year of the given period\nunder examination. As explained below, we treat the PSID's 29-year longitudinal data as though it\ncame from four 11-year panels covering the periods 1969-79, 1979-89, 1981-91, and 1985-95. In\ndetermining cutpoints of annual distributions, we use PSID data as though they came from 27\nsingle-year cross-sections spanning the years 1969 to 1995.\nMyriad choices regarding samples, time periods and measures of earnings, mobility and\ninstability exist and can have profound effects on the estimated outcomes. The Cox and Alm\n(1996) study provides a good example of the sensitivity of the findings to the definitions chosen.\nIn the Cox and Alm study the baseline (1975) sample consisted of all individuals age 16 and above\nwith at least one dollar of income from earnings, assets or transfers. Thus, by design many of the\nsample members were students, homemakers, or elderly with only marginal attachments to the\nlabor force. Cox and Alm count as mobility any real increase in annual income in 1991 as\ncompared with the 1975 level. Given this framework it is not surprising that many individuals\nsubstantially increased their incomes between 1975 and 1991, but in many cases this increase is\nnot what most people count as true mobility.\nDaly (1997) shows that applying all other aspects of the Cox-Alm methodology but\nrestricting the sample to prime age (25-45) men reduces the fraction of those initially in the\nbottom quintile who moved to the top quintile from 29.3 percent to 17.9 percent. Using a relative\n5\n\nrather than an absolute definition of mobility—defining 1991 quintile position by 1991 as opposed\nto inflated 1975 income—the percentage who moved to the top falls to less than ten percent.\nThese differences in outcomes based solely on differences in sample and mobility definitions\nunderscore the importance of creating a conceptual link between the questions we would like to\nanswer and the methods selected to address them.\nChoice dimensions and decisions taken in the present analysis include:\nEarnings measure. Studies have used both annual and hourly measures of earnings. We\nfocus on annual earnings, although are in the process of replicating our calculations using hourly\nearnings. Since low work hours have a much greater element of choice than low hourly earnings,\nthe welfare implications of hourly earnings are more straightforward than those of annual\nearnings. However, since our analysis is of prime-age male workers, for whom low levels of labor\nsupply are more likely to reflect involuntary factors such as unemployment, the incidence of low\nannual earnings is an important aspect of earnings stability and mobility.\nSample. Two important analytic choices here are of samples used to define a worker's\nposition in the income distribution and the set of workers whose earnings mobility or instability is\nbeing analyzed. In determining percentile cutpoints of distributional position in a given year, we\nuse complete cross sections of the working population, defined as all individuals age 21 to 64 who\nwere not self-employed and worked at least 250 hours in that year.\nFor the sample of individuals whose mobility or instability is being analyzed, we choose\nmen between the ages of 25 and 44 who were not self-employed, had positive annual earnings\nand worked at least 250 hours in the first year of a given longitudinal period. We would have\npreferred to include younger men, but the extensive information we sought on labor-market\n6\n\nearnings, job changes, self-employment status, and extra jobs is available only for PSID \"heads\" of\nhouseholds, and it is only at around age 25 that a substantial majority of men head their own\nhouseholds.\nA second issue with the analytic sample is what to do with zero earners. In the case of\nhourly earnings, an observation with zero earnings is best considered as missing. But in the case\nof annual earnings, zero earners are indeed individuals with no earned income, so, where feasible,\nthey are included in our calculations. (Couch and Lillard, 1996 and Couch and Dunn, 1997 have\nshown that estimates of inter-generational mobility and instability are sensitive to the inclusion and\nexclusion of zeros.) To avoid the difficulties of accurately measuring self-employment earnings we\nset annual earnings to missing in years where the individual reports being self-employed. Finally,\nsince other analysts (e.g., Gottschalk and Moffitt) often opt to exclude zero earners from all of\ntheir analyses, we also report mobility and instability calculations on samples that exclude zero\nearners. Sample sizes are presented in Appendix Table 1.\nLongitudinal time periods. Important considerations for analytic time period include\ntimeliness, macroeconomic conditions, and sufficient duration to produce an acceptable ratio of\nsignal to noise in the mobility measure. We chose two 11-year \"peak to peak\" periods -- 1969-79\nand 1979-89; the 11-year \"trough to trough\" period 1981-91; and the 11-year \"growth to growth\"\nperiod 1985-1995. In the case of the latter interval, data constraints imposed by the \"early-\nrelease\" nature of the labor-supply information from the 1993-1996 PSID interviews make it\nimpossible to provide a complete set of calculations over the 1985-95 interval.\nAbsolute versus relative mobility. Are individuals who enjoy real earnings growth during\ntheir careers \"upwardly mobile\"? In defining end-year quintiles as inflation-adjusted beginning-\n7\n\nyear quintiles, Cox and Alm assume an affirmative response and analyze what amounts to absolute\nearnings mobility. In defining end-year position using end-year relative earnings, Sawhill and\nCondon (1992) assume a negative response and analyze what amounts to relative mobility.\nOur own analyses use measures of both absolute and relative mobility. In the case of what\nwe term absolute mobility, we tabulate year-11 vs. year-1 earnings-quintile transitions where year-\n11 quintile breakpoints are defined by year-1 quintile breakpoints of the entire year-1 working\npopulation inflated to year-11 price levels using the CPI-UX1. In the case of what we term\nrelative mobility, we tabulate year-11 vs. year-1 earnings quintiles where year-11 quintile\nbreakpoints are defined by the entire year-11 working population. As in the case of absolute\nmobility, the year-1 breakpoints are defined by the entire year-1 working population.\nInstability. We employ various measures of instability. Building on Gottschalk and Moffitt\n(1994), we calculate the variance in transitory, permanent and total earnings.1 Less formal\nmeasures of instability/stability include: i) the average of absolute year-to-year percentage changes\nin earnings; ii) the number of years the individual was in his year-1 earnings quintile; and iii) the\nnumber of times that year t+1 earnings were less than 50 percent of year t earnings.\nEmployment conditions. Corroborating evidence on the nature of employment conditions\nfor sample individuals over the 11-year periods is provided by the following measures: i) average\nannual hours of unemployment; ii) number of job changes; iii) number of involuntary job changes;\niv) number of years held extra jobs; v) variance of the transitory component of work hours2; and\nvi) total variance of work hours. As with mobility itself, the number of measures of employment\nconditions available from the 1993-1996 PSID data files is limited.\n8\n\nIII. Results\nEarnings correlations. The simplest summary measure of (im)mobility is the correlation\ncoefficient. By comparing the position of a given set of workers at the beginning and end of some\ninterval, the correlation coefficient is a completely relative measure of mobility. We present in\nTable 1 correlations— for both the log of annual earnings and the level of annual earnings—\ncalculated over three, six and eleven-year intervals for male workers who were between ages 25\nand 44 in the first year of the period. We report the unlogged versions in order to compare the\nsample with and without zero earners. The logged annual earnings correlations are made only for\nthose men with positive annual earnings in each period.\nNot surprisingly, the correlations fall as the time period lengthens, particularly as the\ninterval lengthens from six to eleven years. Also unsurprising are lower correlations for young as\nopposed to older workers, indicating more career developments—perhaps both favorable and\nunfavorable—during early career stages. Correlations do not differ substantially between our two\nsamples.\nKey for our inquiry is whether these correlations change by historical period. Drops in\nfixed-interval correlations from one historical period to the next may reflect a greater degree of\nmobility. But, as pointed out by Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994), mobility measures such as the\ncorrelation coefficient, especially if computed over relatively short time periods, mix together\ngenuine mobility (i.e., long-run changes in position) and instability. If, as they and Haider (1997)\nclaim to find, earnings instability has increased since the early 1970s, then we would expect lower\ncorrelations for that reason alone, especially over the three- and six-year intervals, where the\nrelative importance of transitory variance is greatest.\n9\n\nFocusing on the logged annual earnings correlations, Table 1 shows a decrease in earnings\ncorrelations between the first period under study (1969-79) and the 1979-1989 period. Following\na large drop in earnings correlations between the 1969-79 and 1979-89 period, earnings\ncorrelations actually increased among younger workers (25-34 in year 1). Older workers (35-44\nin period 1) experienced a different pattern. Earnings correlations among older workers have\ngradually declined over the past 25 years.\nSuffice it to say that simple correlations indicate that relative earnings mobility/instability\nappears to have increased between the 1970s and the 1980s, particularly among younger workers.\nThe results in Table 1 also suggest that some of the patterns observed in the 1980s may have\nreversed themselves in the 1990s. However, it is important to note that these patterns are not\nterribly robust across samples or logged and unlogged annual earnings values.\nMobility. We next turn to a common tool of mobility studies—the transition matrix. Table\n2 shows earnings quintile positions for 25-44 year-old male workers in the first and eleventh years\nof the four eleven-year intervals provided by the PSID. An additional sample restriction, relaxed\nfor the data presented in Appendix Table 2, is of positive annual earnings in every one of the\neleven years. Within each time period, year-1 quintile breakpoints are defined by the larger\npopulation of all men and women age 21-64 with positive annual earnings, who were not self-\nemployed and who worked 250 hours or more in that year. The data in Table 2 thus reflect\n\"absolute\" mobility in the sense that the year-11 quintile breakpoints are CPI-inflated values of the\nyear-1 breakpoints. In contrast to the correlation coefficient, general earnings increases due to\neither real macroeconomic growth or life-cycle factors are counted as mobility in the transition\nmatrices defined in this way.\n10\n\nThe first row of the table is based on prime-age men whose 1969 annual earnings placed\nthem in the bottom fifth of all earners in that year. The first entry, 46.3, shows that only half of\nthese men had real earnings 11 years later—1979 in this case—that would have ranked them in\nthe bottom quintile of the 1969 distribution. Although nine times larger than Cox and Alm five\npercent estimate based on 15-year earnings change, the fact that half of workers crossed at least\none quintile threshold is noteworthy and is consistent with what most people would probably\nregard as a considerable degree of mobility. Relatively few (10.5 percent) of these initially low-\nearners ended up in the top 40 percent of the earnings distribution—a fraction less than one-fifth\nthat of the 59 percent estimate of Cox and Alm.\nThe second row repeats these 11-year calculations for initially bottom quintile, prime-age\nmale workers over the 1979-89 period. There are few differences. Differences are more apparent\nin the 1981-91 interval, where only 30 percent of initially low-earning workers in 1981 were in the\nbottom quintile 11 years later. This is particularly surprising in light of the heavy overlap between\nthe 1981-91 and the 1979-89 intervals. We suspect (and provide corroborating evidence below)\nthat it results from business-cycle differences, with the severe recession in 1981 producing an\nunusually high number of transitorily low-earning prime-age males relative to the rest of the\nworking population. Their greater mobility thus reflects an unusually low starting position. This\nsensitivity should serve as a warning on the importance of adjusting for business-cycle conditions\nin mobility comparisons.3\nBefore jumping to conclusions regarding the heightened degree of mobility of initially low-\nearning workers, it is instructive to examine the first four rows of Appendix Table 2, which\nparallels Table 2 in all respects except that the data are based on a sample of prime age men who\n11\n\nmight have had zero earnings for reasons other than self-employment between years 2 and 11.\nThis change increases the sample sizes by roughly ten percent and, more importantly, reduces\nsubstantially the apparent mobility of initially low-earnings workers. The fraction of upwardly-\nmobile bottom quintile workers are five to ten percentage points less than comparable percentages\nin Table 2. In other words, including workers whose earnings fell to zero in at least one year\nsubstantially reduces the estimated degree of upward mobility. For this reason, we include parallel\nanalyses of samples that include zero earners whenever feasible.\nGoing to the other end of the distribution, the bottom set of rows of Table 2 and\nAppendix Table 2 show no important trends in the considerable persistence of high earnings. In\nthis case the treatment of zero earners makes little difference; roughly three-quarters of initially\ntop-quintile earners are still in the top quintile 11 years later across all four historical periods.\nThus, for these prime-age men, earnings \"affluence” is considerably more persistent than earnings\n\"poverty.\"\nThe mobility of the middle class is of great interest. The middle rows of Table 2 and\nAppendix Table 2 provides some evidence that the growing upward mobility of middle-earners\nduring the 1970s and 1980s had reversed itself by the 1990s. In the initial, 1969-79 period, some\n37 percent of initially middle-income men had improved their absolute earnings position\nsufficiently 11 years later to be in one of the top two quintiles. In the two overlapping middle\nperiods (1979-89 and 1981-91), the comparable fraction was much higher —52 to 55 percent,\ndepending on the treatment of zero earners. Over the 1985-95 period, the comparable fractions\nhad fallen back to 31 to 34 percent, which are smaller than the 1969-79 levels. The middle rows\nof Table 3 shows that this pattern of increasing and then falling upward mobility of initially\n12\n\nmiddle-income earners held for both younger and older cohorts of workers.\nBy repeating these calculations for quintile breakpoints defined in all years by the 25 to\n44-year old male workers themselves (as opposed to inflation-adjusted thresholds based on the\nmore general group of all workers), the bottom two rows of Table 3 provide information on the\nrelative earnings mobility of the men. That the upward mobility of initially middle-quintile earners\nis lower in the most recent 1985-1995 period than earlier suggests that the patterns observed for\nabsolute mobility are quite robust to changes in the definition of mobility.\nBreaking down these prime-age middle class men into initially younger (25-34 years old in\nthe first of the 11-year period) and older (35-44 years old) age groups produces other suggestive\nevidence of mobility trends. Most striking is the reduced downward mobility of initially 35-44\nyear-old middle earning men. The 1970s appeared to produce a great deal more downward\nearnings mobility for these older men than in any of the later three periods.\nThe other columns of Table 2 summarize mobility of initially low and high earners. There\nare few trends that are both large and impervious to treatment of zero earners. The\naforementioned remarkable upward mobility of initially low earners over the 1981-1991 interval is\nespecially pronounced among older workers, but disappears completely when, in the bottom two\nrows, the mobility measure switched from absolute to relative. Evidence of greater downward\nmobility among initially high-earning younger workers is based on very small case counts.\nPermanent vs. transitory variance. Switching our focus from mobility to stability, we\npresent, in Table 4, an update of the Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) calculations of permanent and\ntransitory variance in real annual earnings. Since these concepts are defined in terms of log\nearnings, as with Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994), we limit our calculations to men with positive\n13\n\nearnings in all years of the given period.\nGottschalk and Moffitt estimate the permanent earnings variance of 20-59 year-old men\nover the 1970-78 and 1979-87 periods to be .201 and .284, respectively, an increase of 41\npercent. Table 4 shows permanent variance estimates for 25-44 year-old men to be .232 for the\n1969-79 period, .276 for 1979-89, .264 for 1981-91 and .241 for 1985-95. Thus, the increase for\nour more narrowly-defined sample is not as large and, if anything, has fallen since the mid-1980s.\nBoth Gottschalk-Moffitt and we find that permanent variance has grown most among younger\nworkers.\nHaider (1997) presents an alternative method for portioning variance into persistent and\ntransitory components. His estimated time series of lifetime inequality changes little between 1967\nand around 1980, increases steadily until the mid-1980s and then is flat until 1991 — the end of\nhis observation window. When averaged over the four-year period used in our analysis, he\nestimates lifetime variance for 30-44 year-old men to be .323 for the 1969-79 period, .392 for\n1979-89, .425 for 1981-91, and .456 for 1985-91, the most recent year included in his\ncalculations. The continuing increase in permanent variance he finds is thus at odds with our\npattern of increases and then decreases.\nIn the case of transitory variance, Gottschalk and Moffitt estimate values of .104 for 1970-\n78 and .148 for 1979-87. Table 4 shows similar levels but smaller growth in transitory variance;\ntransitory variance estimates for 25-44 year-old men are .081 for the 1969-79 period, .111 for\n1979-89, .100 for 1981-91 and .114 for 1985-95. Thus, virtually all of the growth in transitory\nvariance occurs between the first and second of our four periods.\nHaider’s (1997, Table 5) estimates of earnings instability are .130 for 1969-79, .176 for\n14\n\n1979-89, .184 for 1981-91, and .178 for 1985-91, the most recent data year. Thus, Haider’s data\nalso show that most of the growth in transitory variance occurred between the first and second of\nthe four periods used in our analysis.\nWhat implications do these changing components have for changes in the cross-sectional\nearnings variance? As pointed out by Gottschalk and Moffitt, these permanent and transitory\nvariance components sum to the cross-sectional variance. Since the percentage increase in\npermanent earnings variance between periods I and II (19%) is smaller than the percentage\nincrease between those periods in transitory variance (37%), transitory variance as a share of total\nvariance was somewhat larger in period II than period I (.28 vs. .25 -- 15th and 16th columns of\nTable 4). By the most recent, 1985-95 period, the combination of falling permanent variance and\npersistently higher transitory variance pushed the ratio of transitory-to-total variance to .32.\nThus, transitory earnings variance continue to increase in relative importance over the four\nperiods we studied, but not because earnings instability itself has increased. Rather, the increase in\ninstability appears to have run its course by the mid-1980s. But since permanent earnings variance\nhas fallen since the mid-1980s, the relative mixture of transitory to permanent variance has\ncontinued to grow.\nTo investigate the robustness of these trends in earnings instability, we developed a\nnumber of ad hoc alternative indicators, the results for which are shown in Table 5. Our indicators\ninclude: i) the sample median of the 11-year average absolute value of year-to-year percentage\nchanges in earnings; ii) the number of years that the individual remained in his initial earnings\nquintile; and iii) the number of times the individual's earnings dropped by a very substantial\namount —50% or more. An advantage of these measures is that they can be calculated on both\n15\n\nour positive earner and all-worker samples.\nConsistent with the data on transitory variance, the average year-to-year percentage\nearnings change for the typical male worker increased between the initial, 1969-79 period and the\nsecond, 1979-89 period. This jump is quite apparent among younger male workers but, if\nanything, this measure of earnings instability drops for the older workers in the sample and had\nreverted by the last (1985-1995) period to its 1969-79 levels.\nThe middle columns of Table 5 reveal no discernible trends in instability of quintile\npositions. Younger workers remained in their initial quintile position in roughly four of the\nremaining ten years and older workers stayed put in about half of those ten years. Extreme\nearnings instability is captured by our count of the number of years in which earnings fell by half\nor more. Instability by this measure increased only for younger workers and only between period I\nand II.\nAll in all, these alternative indicators of earnings instability suggest that increased earnings\ninstability has been most apparent for younger workers and that the increase had run its course by\nthe mid-1980s.\nIndicators of employment stability. Underlying these trends in earnings stability are\nchanges in wage rates and in conditions of employment—in particular work hours,\nunemployment, and job tenure and changes. We were able to construct a number of indicators of\nemployment trends from PSID data: i) transitory variance in work hours, which is developed by\nGottschalk and Moffitt and is defined analogously to transitory earnings variance; ii) average\nannual hours of unemployment; iii) average number of annual job changes 4; iv) average number\nof involuntary job changes5; v) the average number of years the individual reported holding a\n16\n\nsecond job; and vi) average end-year job tenure. Data on these measures over the four periods are\nsummarized in Table 6.\nMost of the employment-based measures show an increase in employment instability\nbetween the first and subsequent periods, particularly for younger workers. Period I and II\ncomparisons show greater unemployment, more overall as well as involuntary job changes and a\nreduction in job tenure in the final year of the periods. That second-job holding fell may account\nfor at least part of the curious drop in the transitory variance of work hours observed between the\ntwo periods.\nIV. Discussion\nThe 1980s were a remarkably turbulent time for American workers. Several studies have\ndocumented heightened levels of both permanent earnings inequality as well as earnings instability\nrelative to the 1970s. The smaller number of studies focused on earnings mobility have been less\nconclusive about trends.\nOur study of earnings mobility and instability has extended the time series of mobility and\ninstability measures into the first half of the 1990s. Remarkable in our results is how few trends in\nearnings mobility and instability persisted over the entire period we study. As with Gottschalk and\nMoffitt, we find an increase in earnings instability since the 1970s, particularly among younger\nworkers. However, we find no evidence that instability continued to increase throughout the\n1980s and early 1990s.\nWith regard to mobility, we find a drop in 11-year earnings correlations between intervals\ncentered in the mid-1970s and intervals centered in either the mid-1980s or around 1990. A more\ndetailed examination of transition tables showed greater upward mobility and less downward\n17\n\nmobility of middle-income workers in the 1980s relative to the 1970s. The former trend appears\nto have reversed itself by the middle of the 1990s. Employment-based indicators are consistent\nwith the earnings-based indicators in showing increased employment instability between the 1970s\nand later periods.\nOverall the findings suggest that many of the patterns observed during the 1980s did not\ncontinue into the 1990s. Middle-class mobility, increased earnings inequality and instability, and\nemployment instability appear to have declined in the 1990s. Although in most cases patterns\nhave not returned to their pre-1980s state, the preliminary data on the 1990s suggest that the\ndecade of the 1980s may turn out to be more of an anomaly than the beginning of a new trend in\nearnings movements and patterns.\nFinally, this analysis has underscored the importance of sample and mobility/instability\ndefinitions to the results. In many instances the findings we report are extremely sensitive to\nchanges in the sample under study and to how mobility and instability are defined.\n18\n\nEndnotes\n1. As with Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994), the variance in transitory earnings is defined as the\nmean, across individuals, of:\n)2 = 1/N [ ( N (1/(T - 1)) ( Ti (y - y )2]\n(cid:31) i=1 i t=1 it i.\nwhere I indexes individuals, t indexes year. The variance in permanent earnings is defined\nas:\n) 2 = 1/(N-1) [ ( N (y )2 - ()2 /T*)]\nµ i=1 i. - y.. (cid:31)\nwhere T* is the mean of T over I.\ni\n2. This is defined in the same way as the variance of the transitory component of earnings.\n3. Another spurious possible reason for differences in transition-matrix-based mobility is\ndifferences in the average distance between year-1 earnings and the quintile breakpoints.\nAppendix Figure 1 shows no consistent trends in these distances across the four historical\nperiods we study.\n4. Average number of job changes is calculated using a question from the PSID which asks\n“what happened to your last job”. Individuals who responded to this question were\nidentified as job changers for that year. Job changes were then summed for each\nindividual over the 11 year period.\n5. Involuntary job changes are a subset of total job changes. An involuntary job change is\nrecorded when the respondent reports that the job ended because of layoff or firing, or\nbecause the plant closed or moved.\n19\n\nBibliography\nAlexis de Toqueville Institution. “The American Dream Lives.” The Wall Street Journal, February\n14, 1997.\nBurkhauser, Richard, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, and Stephen Rhody.

Introduction\nThe idea that regional economic performance affects bank condition is intuitive and\neasy to see in the banking data. As Figures 1 and 2 suggest, even regions in close proximity to\none another display quite different time-series behavior in standard measures of both bank\nasset quality and bank performance. Moreover, comparisons of state output growth and\nmovements in non-performing loans suggest a relationship between bank health and regional\neconomic conditions (Figure 3). Despite these patterns in the data, establishing the precise\nnature of the relationship between bank health and regional economic conditions has proven\ndifficult. Overall, the literature on this issue provides a mixed picture of the importance, size,\nand timing of regional indicators in models of bank conditions.\nThe heterogeneity of the empirical results reflects, in part, variation in measures of\nregional economic performance, differences in model specification, and dissimilarities in the\ntime-periods of study. In terms of variable selection, researchers examining the relationship\nbetween regional variables and bank condition have looked for regional measures with the\nsame frequency as the banking data—meaning monthly or quarterly regional indicators. This\nhas limited the set of potential regional indicators to components of gross state product (GSP),\nthe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) analog for states. For instance, researchers have used one\nor more variables such as employment growth, personal income growth, and commercial and\nresidential real estate values, entering these variables contemporaneously, as lagged values,\nand as forecasts. Model specifications also vary in whether variables are entered as levels,\n1\n\nchanges, or deviations of both of these from a national mean. By and large, each of these\nspecifications yields different results, especially in terms of the economic importance of\nregional indicators in models of bank health.\nAlong with differences in variable selection and model specification, heterogenous\nresults have come from differences in the time periods under study. Figure 4 illustrates why\nthe choice of the analysis period might matter; the figure plots the yearly correlations between\nstate output growth and bank non-performing loans as a fraction of total loans. Abstracting\nfrom the volatility in the series, the data show more co-movement between the series during\nthe 1980s than during the 1990s, with especially high negative correlations from 1983 through\n1988. The pattern in Figure 4 suggests that the heterogenous results produced by researchers\nrelating economic performance to bank conditions may reflect changes in the dynamics of\nthese relationships, with the interaction of regional economies and bank conditions varying\nacross states and changing over time.1\nThe failing of any single regional indicator or component of GSP is understandable.\nFor one, national economic downturns may materialize differently across states, reflecting\ndifferences in sectoral composition, dependence on foreign trade, and interstate linkages. As\nsuch, the importance of sectoral indicators—for example, commercial and residential real\nestate activity, industrial production, exports, and interstate trade flows—will differ, possibly\nnetting out in aggregate estimates across U.S. states. The contribution of more general\nmeasures of regional economic strength, such as employment growth, can also vary\n1Later in the paper we show that the decreased correlation between state output growth and state\nnon-performing loan ratios owes to convergence across states in both variables.\n2\n\nsubstantially across states\ndepending on worker productivity.2 In states with relatively high output per worker,\nemployment growth may lag while output growth exceeds that of other states. In such cases,\nthe employment growth variable would be clouded and possibly fail to correlated in bank\ncondition. These measures also can change over time. For example during the early 1990s,\ncommercial real estate conditions negatively influenced bank performance, while in the recent\ndownturn, commercial real estate portfolios have so far placed little stress on banks. Again,\neven more general indicators like employment growth may vary in importance over time as\ngrowth in productivity fluctuates.\nThis paper contributes to the literature on regional indicators and bank performance by\naddressing several of the issues described above. First, it introduces a unique measure of\nregional economic activity that combines a number of individual regional variables into a\nsingle index that is allowed to vary by state. The composite index, or index of coincident\nindicators, is potentially helpful in two ways. For one, it closely matches real GSP, which is\nconsidered a good measure of overall performance of a state’s economy. However, unlike\nGSP, which is produced with a substantial lag and at an annual frequency, the composite\nindex can be produced at the same frequency as our banking data and maintained\ncontemporaneously. In addition to tracking state output growth, the composite index also\ncaptures the interactions between independently entered variables such as employment growth\nand personal income, allowing these interactions to vary across states. Simply stated, it\n2Wilson (2002) finds pronounced differences in productivity by state over the past two decades.\nDaly (2002) shows that productivity growth trends were quite different across states in the U.S. over the\npast two decades.\n3\n\nproxies for a set of state-level economic “unobservables” that may be affecting the credit\nquality of bank loan portfolios as measured by nonperforming loans.\nUsing the composite measure of regional economic conditions, this paper examines\nthe extent to which regional economic conditions help to explain measures of bank-level asset\nquality. We find that the composite index does help explain bank conditions. The analysis\nthen turns to examining whether the composite index improves forecasts of relative risk of the\nbanking sector by state. These results show that the composite index is helpful in forecasting\ndifferences in bank risk by state. Finally, we examine whether interstate banking makes the\ninclusion of regional variables unimportant. Our findings suggest that such a conclusion\ncannot be drawn from the existing data.\nII. Literature review\nWhile it is intuitive that local economic conditions should affect bank health and\nperformance, a large literature on the topic has shown the empirical relationship to be elusive.3\nOn the positive side, Calomiris and Mason (2000) found that several county-level and state-\nlevel economic indicators impacted bank survival rates during the Great Depression. In a\nmore current setting, Avery and Gordy (1998) found that one-half of the change in bank loan\nperformance between 1984-1995 could be explained with a collection of state-level economic\nvariables. Berger, et al. (2000) found evidence that aggregate state-level and regional-level\n3The term “local” economic conditions refers broadly to the county or state in which a bank is\nheadquartered. For this study, the economic variables summarizing local economic conditions will be at\nthe state level, but it is still reasonable to assume that they capture national developments. Specifically,\nCarlino and DeFina (1998, 1999) found that regions, such as New England and the Southeast, and states\nexhibit different degrees of sensitivity to monetary policy changes.\n4\n\nvariables were important contributors to the persistence in firm-level performance (i.e., return\non assets) observed in the U.S. banking industry.\nBut by and large, the statistical link between local economic variables and bank\ncondition fades away when a) economic variables are disaggregated to common local banking\nmarket definitions, and b) when the variables are used for forecasting purposes. Zimmerman\n(1996) and Meyer and Yeager (2001) provide evidence on this first point. Both papers\nfocused on the performance of small banks in the hopes of identifying institutions that would\nbe most vulnerable to economic shocks (i.e., least able to diversify) and could easily be linked\nto a distinct local economy. Zimmerman looked at the performance of California community\nbanks and found that banks operating in southern California performed significantly worse\nthan their counterparts in northern California between 1990-1994. But he could not find a\nlocal economic variable to explain these differences. Meyer and Yeager examined the impact\nof county-level and state-level economic variables on various bank performance ratios.4 They\nfound that the state-level variables significantly impacted bank performance and that county-\nlevel variables did also, but only in the absence of the state-level variables.\nIn terms of forecasting, Nuxoll, O’Keefe and Samolyk (2003) used economic variables\naggregated up to the state level, such as the unemployment rate, growth in personal income,\n4The authors limited their bank sample to small rural banks (i.e., those with less than $300\nmillion in assets located outside of a metropolitan statistical area) in the Eighth District of the Federal\nReserve System. The four bank performance ratios that they examined were the ratio of nonperforming\nloans to total loans, the ratio of net loan losses to total loans, the ratio of other real estate owned to total\nassets, and adjusted return on assets (i.e., net income plus provisions divided by total assets). The county\nand state variables used were unemployment rates, employment growth, personal income growth, and per\ncapita personal income growth. Note that they used a Tobit regression for the first and third bank\nvariables.\n5\n\nand the amount of failed business liabilities, in order to predict bank failures and bank asset\nquality. Their basic result was that economic variables add little information to the forecasts\nof these bank-specific variables. Jordan and Rosengren (2001) investigated whether forecasts\nof regional economic variables had an impact on the supervisory CAMELS ratings assigned to\nbanks.5 They found that contemporaneous measures of regional economic conditions did not\nadd explanatory information over the bank-specific variables already used in bank\nsurveillance models. However, one-year-ahead forecasts were found to be both economically\nand statistically significant in improving the predictive power of the surveillance models that\nassess bank performance out four quarters. Furthermore, they found that these effects were\nmore pronounced during difficult regional economic periods.\nAn important caveat to this analysis and to our data set is that bank deregulation in the\nU.S. has led to consolidation and to banks’ geographic expansion.6 As noted by Morgan and\nSamolyk (2003) in their study of bank geographic diversification, U.S. banks have not only\nbecome bigger during the course of the 1990s, but they have also become wider by expanding\ntheir operations across multiple banking markets. Using a geographic diversification index\nbased on deposits, the authors found important differences across bank size categories and\n5Their dependent variable reflecting bank performance is the supervisory CAMELS ratings. The\nbank-specific variables included in their regressions were the logarithm of total assets, lagged CAMELS\nratings, the ratio of capital to total assets, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total assets, the ratio of net\nincome to total assets, the ratio of liquid assets to total assets, the ratio of C&I lending to total assets, the\nratio of CRE lending to total assets, the ratio of residential real estate lending to total assets, the ratio of\nother real estate owned to total assets, the ratio of long-term deposits to total assets, and the ratio of\nthirty-day past-due loans to total assets. The state-level regional economic variables they used were\npayroll employment growth, residential house price appreciation, and total personal income growth.\n6 See the papers by Jayaratne and Strahan (1996) and Morgan, Rime, and Strahan (2002) for\nresearch on the impact of banking deregulation on local economic variables.\n6\n\nover time. We address this concern only in terms of constructing the regional variables\ncorresponding to the inter-state banks in our sample; see the discussion in the following\nsection.\nIII. Data and Measurement Issues\nRegional Composite Indicators\nTracking the health of regional economies has long been a difficult job. Analogs to\ntraditional measures of national economic performance such as GSP (GDP analog) are\nproduced with a significant lag and only at an annual frequency, limiting their usefulness for\nmost research endeavors. Other measures of performance including employment growth,\ncommercial and residential building permits, or personal income growth, while more current,\nare less complete, capturing only a part of the picture of economic activity in a region. The\nincompleteness of single measures of economic activity is well recognized (Zarnowitz, 1992),\nprompting the NBER to look across many series to date business cycles (Rudebusch, 2001).\nBuilding on the work by Stock and Watson (1989) who develop a coincident index for\nthe national economy, Crone (1994) began developing composite indices of regional\neconomic activity.7 The indices produced proved useful for tracking regional economic trends\nand for dating regional business cycles (Crone (1999)). In 2002, Crone produced a set of\nconsistent economic indexes for the 50 states.8 The indexes are produced at a monthly\n7Crone originally constructed his indices for states based on four monthly data series—the total\nnumber of jobs in nonagricultural establishments, real retail sales, average weekly hours in\nmanufacturing, and the unemployment rate.\n8These series have been made publicly available by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n7\n\nfrequency and cover the period from 1978 through 2002.\nAs constructed by Crone (2002) the coincident indexes for the 50 states include three\nmonthly indicators—nonagricultural employment, the unemployment rate, and average hours\nworked in manufacturing—and one quarterly indicator—real wage and salary\ndisbursements—of regional economic conditions. To ensure consistency, Crone applies the\nfollowing criteria:\n(1) The indexes are constructed from the same set of indicators for each state\n(2) The timing of the index is benchmarked to employment in each state.\n(3) The trend for the index corresponds to (GSP) in each state.\nFigure 5 shows a scatter plot of average annual growth between 1986 and 2000 in GSP and\nthe composite indicator growth for the 50 states. The composite indicators for each state are\naggregated to the annual frequency for comparison with GSP. As the figure shows, the\ncomposite indicator tracks GSP quite well.\nOther Regional Indicators\nBy and large, the literature on bank performance and regional economic conditions has\nrelied on one or more regional indicators including house price appreciation, employment\ngrowth, personal income growth, and the unemployment rate. To tie this paper to previous\nwork in the area and to evaluate the usefulness of composite measures relative to others, these\nvariables are included in the analyses. House price appreciation by state is measured using\ndata from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). OFHEO produces\nan index of home prices by state on a quarterly basis. These indices are used to compute year-\nover-year growth rates for house prices in each state. The personal income data come from\n8\n\nthe Bureau of Economic Analysis and are released quarterly. Again, the quarterly levels are\nused to compute year-over-year growth rates. Data on employment and unemployment come\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data are released monthly. The analysis includes\nyear-over-year changes in these variables at a quarterly frequency.\nBank-Specific Regional Indicators\nA key challenge in this analysis is the problem of correctly identifying the regional\neconomy for an individual bank. An obvious choice is to simply define the state of\nheadquarters as the bank’s region. Such a choice was accurate before the advent of cross-state\nbanking laws in the early 1980s and the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 that opened up the entire\ncountry to bank branches, and is probably still reasonable for the case of small banks (see\nMeyer and Yeager (2001)). For the sample used in this analysis, however, a more complete\nmeasure of banks’ regions is required.\nFor this paper, a bank’s regional economy is defined as a weighted average of the\nstates it operates in; the weight on any given state corresponds to the share of the bank’s total\ndeposits that originate from that state. The bank-specific weights are constructed based on the\nbranch-level data available from the Summary of Deposits (SOD) data collected and\nmaintained by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).9 The SOD database\ncontains deposit data for more than 85,000 branches/offices of FDIC-insured institutions.\nSOD information is required for each insured office located in any state, the District of\n9Further information on and access to the SOD data is available at\nhttp://www2.fdic.gov/sod/index.asp.\n9\n\nColumbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any U.S. territory or possession such as\nGuam or the U.S. Virgin Islands, without regard to the location of the main office. For SOD\npurposes, a branch/office is any location, or facility, of a financial institution, including its\nmain office, where deposit accounts are opened, deposits are accepted, checks paid, and loans\ngranted. Some branches include, but are not limited to, brick and mortar locations, detached\nor attached drive-in facilities, seasonal offices, offices on military bases or government\ninstallations, paying/receiving stations or units, and Internet and PhoneBanking locations\nwhere a customer can open accounts, make deposits, and borrow money. This definition of a\nbranch should very accurately gauge the cross-state activities of a bank.10\nAll the regional variables and the composite index are weighted by the deposit shares\nto define bank-specific regional economic conditions. Data are collected annually, hence the\nbank-specific weights are only updated once every four quarters.\nBanking Variables\nThe banking data are collected from the quarterly Reports of Condition (the Call\nReports) that commercial banks file with their bank regulators. The data set consists of all\ncommercial banks with domestic charters between 1983.Q3 and 2002.Q3. As is well-\ndocumented in the literature, changes in regulation and competitive pressures spurred a\nremarkable degree of consolidation in the banking industry. These changes are apparent in the\n10For SOD purposes, the FDIC collects deposit balances for commercial and savings banks as of\nJune 30 each year. For insured commercial banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks, the definition of\ndeposit is the same as in the Consolidated Report of Condition. The definition relates to domestic\ndeposits held, or accepted, by the reporting bank in its main office and in any branch located in any State,\nthe District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any U.S. territory or possession which\ninclude but are not limited to Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n10\n\ndata set used in this paper (see Figure 5). At the beginning of the period there are 13,288\nunique bank entities in the banking database; by the end of the sample period, this number had\ndwindled to 7,620 banks.\nBank condition is measured here as the ratio of total nonperforming loans to total\nloans, where non-performing loans are defined as all loans past due thirty days or more but\nstill accruing interest and non-accruing loans. Bank-level control variables include the natural\nlog of assets to control for the many differences between large and small banks, the share of\nthe loan portfolio assigned to commercial and industrial (C&I) lending, consumer lending, and\nresidential and nonresidential real estate. The banking variables are summarized in Table 1.\nIV. Evidence of a Relationship\nBefore specifying a model of the relationship between bank conditions and regional\neconomic performance it is useful to pin down their association using simple Granger\nCausality tests. Specifically, for each state we test whether annual growth in the coincident\nindicator Granger-causes the state-level of nonperforming loans ratio, and vice versa.\nAggregating across states, we also test whether the variance in states’ annual growth rates of\nthe coincident indicators Granger-causes the variance across states non-performing loan ratios.\nWe use 8 lags of both the dependent and independent variables in the tests. The results of\nthese tests are reported in Table 2.\nThe results provide mixed evidence of the importance of regional indicators in\npredicting bank condition at the state level, with growth in the coincident indicator Granger-\ncausing the nonperforming loan ratio in 12 states. Importantly, there is less evidence that the\n11\n\nrelationship works the other way; nonperforming loan ratios Granger-caused growth in just 5\nstates.\nA much clearer picture emerges for the relationship between the cross-state variance in\ngrowth in the coincident indicator and the non-performing loan ratio (final row of Table 2).\nThe variance in annual growth of the coincident indicator across states Granger-causes the\nvariance in non-performing loan ratios across states, but the reverse does not hold. There is\nno evidence of feedback from nonperforming loans to regional economic growth.\nThese results suggest a role for regional indicators in models of bank condition,\nespecially in modeling differences across states over time. Based on these findings we turn to\nestimating a reduced form model of bank performance that includes bank specific variables\nand regional economic conditions.\nV. In-Sample Importance of Regional Variables\nThe Model\nBy and large, the literature on the impact of regional economic performance on bank\nconditions relies on a basic model specification that regresses individual bank condition\nvariable on a set of bank-specific variables and regional indicators. This type of model is\nfollowed in this paper.11 The estimated model takes the following form:\n(1) y =α+βx +θz +ε ,\nijt it−4 jt−4 ijt\n11An alternative specification would be to do the estimation in two stages, in which the first stage\nregresses bank nonperforming loans on bank-specific variables and 50 state dummies for each quarter,\nand the second stage regresses the state dummies on regional economic indicators (Card and Krueger\n1992; Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor 1996). The model in equation (1) was chosen to be consistent with\nthe previous literature and to permit interactions between bank-specific variables and regional indicators.\n12\n\nwhere y is the nonperforming loan ratio for bank I operating in region j at time t, α is the\nijt i\nintercept term, x is a vector of bank-specific variables, and z is a vector of region-specific\ni j\nvariables, including the composite index. The explanatory variables are lagged four quarters\nunder the assumption that changes in bank characteristics and regional economic condition\nwill take several quarters to appear in the performance or asset quality variables. All\nregressions are estimated with state dummies and robust standard errors to account for the\nnon-independence of multiple observations on the same bank over time. The regression\nresults are reported in Tables 3-5. Note that the five specifications of the model used\nthroughout the paper are: (I) bank-specific variables only; (ii) bank-specific variables plus\nregional variables excluding the composite index; (iii) bank-specific variables and all regional\nvariables; (iv) bank-specific variables and just the composite index; and (v) all the prior\nvariables plus the composite index interacted with the bank’s portfolio shares.\nAll Banks\nThe results for all banks are reported in Table 3. The findings point to a strong impact\nassociated with the inclusion of the lagged value of the nonperforming loan ratio in all of the\nspecifications. Invariably, the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is approximately\n0.66 and is statistically significant. In addition, including this variable in the specification\nincreases the regression R2 from approximately 4% to 50% in most of our regressions. Also,\nconsistent with many other studies in banking, the size control is statistically significant.\nLarger banks tend to have lower nonperforming loan ratios than smaller banks.\nThe inclusion of economic variables yields somewhat promising results (column 2 of\nTable 3). However, the counterintuitive sign on personal income growth is an example of\n13\n\nsome of the difficulties researchers have had in pinning down the influence of regional\neconomic conditions on bank condition. We would expect positive changes in this variable to\nbe associated with decreasing problem loan ratios, all else being held equal. Overall, the\ncoefficients on the change in house prices and the employment variables all have the predicted\nsigns and are statistically significant.\nIn column 3 of Table 3, the composite index is added to the model along with the other\nregional variables. All coefficients on the observable economic variables remain statistically\nsignificant, although their magnitudes are somewhat diminished when the composite index is\nincluded. This is particularly true for the employment growth variable, which declines in\nimportance by an order of magnitude. The coefficient on the year-over-year change in the\ncomposite index, meanwhile, is estimated to be -0.046, which has the largest magnitude of\nany of the coefficients on economic variables. A more parsimonious specification that drops\nall the observable economic series and includes only the control variables and the composite\nindex is shown in column 4 of the table. Again, the estimated coefficient on the composite\nindex is sizeable (-0.044) and statistically significant at the conventional levels.\nThe final column of Table 3 shows a specification of the model that includes\ninteractions with the bank’s loan portfolio. The interaction terms are meant to examine\nwhether banks with particular loan concentrations are more/less susceptible to regional\nshocks. The findings indicate that the largest impact of the composite index is for banks with\nlarge concentrations of non-residential real estate and C&I loans. This result seems consistent\nwith both the greater volatility in the commercial sectors and the ability of banks to more\n14\n\neasily diversify their risk on residential and consumer loans.12\nIntrastate and Interstate Banks\nGiven the national deregulation of interstate banking that occurred during the 1990s,\nwe chose to extend the analysis by examining inter- and intrastate banks separately. The\nresults are presented in Tables 4 and 5. The separate analysis focuses on whether banks that\neventually become interstate banks differ from those that remain intrastate banks. The\ncomposite index as the sole economic variable, the coefficient on the composite index is\nvirtually the same across interstate and intrastate banks.\nThat said, there is an interesting difference between the intrastate and interstate\nregressions. The interactions between loan shares and the composite index are insignificant in\nthe interstate regressions. This contrasts with the intrastate regressions where the effect of the\ncomposite index on nonperforming loans was significantly greater for banks with relatively\nlarge commercial real estate and commercial lending portfolios. This finding suggests that the\ngeographic diversification by interstate banks may translate into diversification of risk on all\nloans, not just residential and consumer.\nIn-Sample Results Summary\nThe results from our reduced form models point to a clear link between regional\nindicators and bank performance. The linkage appears most robust for the composite index\nmeasure of regional economic performance. This is consistent with other work showing\npositive and consistent results for GSP variables and more mixed results for other regional\n12The Table 3 analysis was repeated including bank fixed effects. Except the growth in personal\nincome, all coefficients on the economic variables have the same expected signs and are statistically\nsignificant at conventional levels. Results are available from the authors upon request.\n15\n\nindicators. The results from the inter- and intrastate banks suggest that regional conditions are\nimportant explanatory factors for both types of entities, although interstate banks appear more\nable to diversify away portfolio risk more than intrastate banks.\nVI. Out-of-Sample Importance of Regional Variables\nThe in-sample results point to the usefulness of regional indicators for explaining bank\ncondition. A next logical step is to see whether such regional indicators could help in\nforecasting bank conditions out-of-sample. Previous attempts to forecast bank performance\nusing regional economic variables have been unsuccessful, as discussed in the literature\nreview. Similar calculations based on our dataset also provide little evidence that including\nregional variables improves the forecasts of individual bank condition.\nHowever, this outcome need not imply that regional variables cannot be used to\nunderstand broader trends in banking sector conditions. To examine this alternative\nperspective, we focus on forecasting the relative rankings of bank risk, measured as\nnonperforming loan ratios, by state. Such rankings are useful to both bankers, who are\npotentially managing loans to borrowers across the country, and to bank supervisors, who\nmonitor the condition of banks nationwide. Although these rankings abstract from the\nabsolute level of bank risk, they retain a useful amount of relative risk information at a point\nin time and across time.\nOur forecasting exercise proceeds as follows. First, we modify the modeling\nframework from the earlier part of the paper and estimate a linear probability model of\n16\n\nwhether or not a bank’s problem loan category exceeds a predetermined level—5.4%.13\nSecond, we break the full sample into three subperiods and estimate the models for each sub-\nperiod absent the last year. We use the fitted models for each period to forecast the value of\nthe linear probability model for each bank in each period’s out-of-sample period; that is, the\nfour quarters of 1989, the four quarters of 1995, and the three quarters of 2002, respectively.\nWe denote the forecasted value for bank I headquartered in state j at time t+1, conditional on\nthe information available at time t, as (cid:1) y . 14 Since we are estimating a linear probability\nijt+1\n(cid:1)\nmodel, the actual numerical values of y are not especially meaningful to the analysis.\nijt+1\nHowever, the cardinal ordering of these numerical values allows us to generate state-level risk\nrankings based on nonperforming loan ratios.\nTo generate state-level ratios of nonperforming loans to total loans, we aggregate\nacross banks in each state at each point in our forecasting periods. That is, the nonperforming\nloan ratio for state j at time t+1, denoted as (cid:1) is calculated as\nNPL jt+1 ,\n \nN (cid:1) PL = ∑ y (cid:1)  L ijt+1,\njt+1\ni∈j\nijt+1 \nL jt+1\n\n\nwhere L is the total loans for bank I headquartered in state j at time t+1 and L is the total\nijt+1 jt+1\n13The new dependent variable is a binary variable equal to one if the total nonperforming loan\nratio is greater than 5.4%. This threshold corresponds to the 80th percentile of the empirical distribution\nof nonperforming loans in our entire data. sample.\n14Note that (cid:1) y is neither an indicator variable, like our dependent variable, nor is it a true\nijt+1 (cid:1)\nprobability, since its support is not limited to the unit interval. Instead, y is a relative value that\nijt+1 (cid:1)\nindicates proximity to the 5.4% nonperforming loan ratio that we selected; that is, higher values of y\n(cid:1) ijt+1\nindicate that bank i is more likely to be above the threshold, while lower values of y indicate that the\nijt+1\nbank is more likely to be below the threshold.\n17\n\nloans across all banks headquartered in state j at time t+1. We construct the actual state\nproblem loan ratios, denoted as NPL using the same formula as above, but replacing the\njt+1\n(cid:1)\ny values with the actually observed nonperforming loan ratios for the individual banks.\nijt+1\nWe generate four sets of forecasted state rankings based on the variables specification\nused in Section V. We assess the accuracy of these forecasted state rankings by examining the\nextent to which they reproduce the actual rankings of state-level nonperforming loan ratios.\nThe degree of forecast accuracy is measured using the Spearman rank correlation test, which\ntests the null hypothesis that the actual and the forecasted rankings are independent. If we\nreject the null hypothesis, then the model generating the forecasts is accurately characterizing\nthe underlying economic relationships. The values of these correlation coefficients are\npresented in Table 6; note that they are all significant at the 5% level.\nTo consider the importance of the regional indicators, we look to see whether the\nforecasted rankings are different, depending on the inclusion of the composite index in the\nforecasting model. The findings show that regional variables do improve forecasts of state-\nlevel bank risk, i.e., the coefficients in the fourth column are larger than those in the first\ncolumn for all 11 out-of-sample forecast quarters. However, the results also highlight the\npotential difficulties of using a collection of individual regional indicators—employment\ngrowth, personal income growth, and home price appreciation. As shown in the second\ncolumn, in some of the time periods and relative to the baseline model in the first column, the\ninclusion of these individual regional indicators hinder rather than help the forecast. This is\nwhere the composite index clearly dominates the other regional variables in the analysis. By\ncollecting the trend that is common to all included regional indicators it improves the signal to\n18\n\nnoise ratio and aids the forecast accuracy of the state rankings, as shown in the third column.\nIn all the time periods forecast, the composite indicator either improves or fails to change the\nforecast with the bank variables alone.\nVI. Regional Economic Conditions Under Interstate Banking\nOur findings point to a clear link between regional economic conditions and bank\ncondition for both intrastate and interstate banks. That link, however, largely results from\nvariance in state regional growth and loan performance that predates the full expansion of\ninterstate banking; data from the 1980s and early 1990s. This has led some to argue that these\nlinkages may have dissolved. To get at this issue, we ran regressions based on equation (1) on\na subsample of the data ranging from 1995.Q1 to 2002.Q3 for both interstate and intrastate\nbanks.15 The idea was to examine whether the economic and/or statistical significance of the\nregional indicators has dissipated for the interstate banks, while remaining important to\nintrastate banks. The results show that during the latter half of the 1990s none of the regional\neconomic variables (including the composite index) had a statistically significant effect on\neither intrastate or interstate bank nonperforming loan ratios.\nThe reason for this non-result can be seen in Figure 7, which shows the variance in\nregional economic growth (measured by the composite index) and state nonperforming loan\nratios.16 As the figure indicates, during the latter half of the 1990s, the variance of these two\n15We do not show results from these regressions, but they are available from the authors upon\nrequest.\n16Another possibility is the relatively short sample period. However, regressions for sample\nperiods of equal length during the 1980s and early 1990s produce statistically significant coefficients on\n19\n\nseries dropped dramatically and stayed virtually unchanged for the remainder of the decade.\nThe lack of movement in either series makes hinders our ability to track their underlying\nrelationship.\nWhat can we expect going forward? Without additional data we cannot know whether\nthe 1995-2002 period was an aberration or per the discussion in Stock and Watson (2002) a\npermanent change in the relationship between bank condition and regional economic\nperformance. Given very recent data, the convergence of regional growth that characterized\nthe late 1990s already is fading as states recover from the recession at varying speeds.\nMoreover, the variance of the nonperforming loan values has begun to increase, suggesting\nthat its period of stability also may be nearing an end. Finally, earlier results from our\nGranger causality tests provide little support for the idea that the convergence of banking\noutcomes portends convergence in regional economic growth.\nVII. Conclusion\nIn summary, our work points to a clear link between bank conditions, measured by\nnonperforming loan ratios, and state-level composite indexes and other regional variables.\nThe statistical significance and economic relevance of the composite index remains stable\nacross bank sub-samples (interstate and intrastate). In general, the composite index performs\nat least as well as employment growth and outperforms other measures of regional conditions.\nMoreover, it appears to capture important and tractable interactions among the included\nregional variables that would otherwise be relegated to the state fixed effect or the residual.\nthe regional variables, suggesting the short sample is not driving our 1995-2002 findings.\n20\n\nWe find that for interstate banks, the composite index is the single-most important\nexplanatory variable from our set of regional economic variables. For intrastate banks, the\ncomposite index has the largest impact on those banks specializing in certain types of lending,\nbe it commercial real estate or business lending. This sensitivity to the indicator is not as\npronounced for interstate banks, which presumably are better able to diversify risks in their\nlaon portfolios.\nOur work also shows that while regional variables do little to improve the forecasts of\nindividual bank performance they are quite useful in forecasting state rankings of relative risk\nin the banking sector. This is where the composite indicator clearly outperforms the other\nregional indicators. In all cases tested, the composite indicator either improves or leaves\nunchanged the forecast accuracy relative to including bank variables alone.\nFinally, our analyses provides reason to believe that the advent of interstate banking\nwill not eliminate the importance of looking at regional economic conditions when tracking\ntrends in bank performance. Although the importance of regional variables falls away in the\ntime period following the allowance of interstate banking, our results indicate this likely has\nmore to do with the idiosynchratic convergence of regional growth and bank performance\nmeasures than with the advent of interstate banking.\n21\n\nReferences\nAvery, R., and Gordy, M., 1998. “Loan Growth, Economic Activity, and Bank Performance.”\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System working paper.\nBerger, A.N., Bonime, S.D., Covitz, D.M. and Hancock, D., 2000. “Why are Bank Profits so\nPersistent?

    "text": "FINAL\n“The New Stone Soup”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nIveagh House Lecture\nDublin, Ireland\nFebruary 10, 2020\n6:45PM GMT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction and warm welcome. It’s a privilege\nto be back here in Ireland. This is the first country I ever visited outside of the\nUnited States, and I still remember how welcoming you were and how much I\nlearned. So it’s truly a privilege to return.\nIt’s also a great honor to be part of such a distinguished lecture series,\naddressing such a distinguished audience. Now before I begin, let me say that\nmy remarks tonight are my own, and don’t necessarily reflect the views of\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you know, I am a policymaker – a monetary policymaker. Many of us\nin this room are policymakers or people who support policymakers. And even\nthough we come from different countries and have different areas of\nexpertise, we all share something in common.\nWe each want to serve the public. We each want to be remembered for\ndoing our best. We each want to make contributions that stand the test of\ntime.\n1\n\nFINAL\nBut times today are challenging. Countries across the globe face slow\ngrowth, low real interest rates, and persistent low inflation. This makes our\neconomies less resilient to everyday shocks and less able to offset them with\nthe tools we’ve traditionally relied on. Moreover, our futures are\ninterconnected. Today, a shock to one country can spill over. Said simply,\nwhen one of us stumbles, all of us sway.\nSo my question tonight is: in the face of these challenges, what can we\ndo?\nThe environment we face\nFirst, let’s talk about how we got here. And I’ll start with the story in the\nUnited States.\nLarge structural shifts are reshaping our economy. First among them is\npopulation aging. The baby boom generation is retiring. And this is having a\nprofound effect on labor force growth – especially since subsequent birth\ncohorts are so much smaller.\nThe numbers tell the story. During the 1970s, as the baby boom\ngeneration matured and entered the labor market in large numbers, the U.S.\nlabor force grew by just over 2.5 percent per year. Today, labor force growth\nis closer to 0.5 percent per year. All else being equal, this shaves about 2\npercentage points off potential GDP growth in the United States each year.1\nThis slower economic growth translates directly into lower interest\nrates. Slower growth decreases investment by reducing the return on capital.2\nAt the same time, an aging population increases the pool of available savings,\n1 Congressional Budget Office (2020), Fernald and Li (2019).\n2 Williams (2017).\n2\n\nFINAL\nas older individuals build and preserve their nest eggs. Together, these forces\nincrease the supply of savings relative to the demand for investment, reducing\nreal interest rates.3\nThese patterns are not unique to the United States. We could just as\neasily be talking about Ireland, or any country in Europe, or just about any\nadvanced economy around the world.4\nAnd these are not our only challenges. On top of slower growth and\nlower real interest rates, central banks are finding it more difficult to achieve\ntheir inflation goals, even in good times.\nFundamental changes in product markets have been putting downward\npressure on prices. And since many markets are global, these changes are\nspreading – creating a strong disinflationary trend and pulling down inflation\nand inflation expectations in many parts of the world.5\nCombined, these factors – lower inflation, lower inflation expectations,\nand lower real interest rates – add up to one thing: less monetary policy space\nwhen the next downturn emerges.\nBut central bankers aren’t the only ones feeling the pressure. Fiscal\npolicymakers are also constrained. Policies enacted to offset the global\nfinancial crisis have left many advanced nations with relatively high debt-to-\nGDP ratios.6 And most face looming obligations to support their aging\npopulations at levels promised when growth was much faster.7\n3 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016).\n4 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\n5 Mertens and Williams (2019), Amano, Carter, and Leduc (2019).\n6 Badia and Dudine (2019).\n7 See for example Rouzet et al. (2019).\n3\n\nFINAL\nSo this is where we find ourselves. Facing a future where economic\nshocks are inevitable, and where monetary and fiscal agents have less policy\nroom to combat them.\nSo again I ask: what can we do?\nMake stone soup\nWhen faced with a tough problem, my first instinct is to turn to books,\nmodels, and other formal practices. I’m an economist after all – that’s what we\ndo. But wisdom isn’t only found in traditional tools. Sometimes, you have to\nturn to tales.\nOne of my favorites is the story of stone soup. It's a European folktale\nI’m sure you've heard. There are many different versions, including one by\nIreland’s own William Butler Yeats. But I'd like to share the story as I learned\nit.\nOne day, a group of strangers came to a village. They were hungry and\nknocked on doors, asking for food. But the villagers had very little and were\nhungry themselves. They closed their doors, pulled their shades, and guarded\ntheir meager stocks.\nSo the strangers went into the town center and dragged over a large pot.\nThey built a roaring fire underneath. And to the pot, they added a few stones.\nAs the pot began to boil, the villagers looked on, curious. Some came\noutside. They asked: what are you doing? The strangers, with confidence, said\nthey were making stone soup. Then they began to imagine aloud how much\nbetter it would taste with just a few additional ingredients – an onion, a\npotato, a beef bone…\n4\n\nFINAL\nNo one villager had everything. But each villager had something. So they\nstarted contributing to the pot. And when they combined it all, everyone had\nmore. Everyone had enough.\nI learned this story when I was 7 years old. And it has stuck with me all\nthese years. I share it with you today to emphasize this point.\nIt’s tempting to look at our cupboards and say they’re bare. That the\nproblems we’re facing are too big. That the tools we have at our disposal are\ntoo limited. That the best strategy – the only strategy – is to close our doors,\npull our shades, and guard our meager resources as long as we can.\nBut this is why we need stories. To help show us a different path.\nSo what lessons from stone soup can we apply to our current situation?\nLook for strangers\nThe first lesson is to seek the perspectives of others. As policymakers,\nwe like to think that our education, experience, and institutional history are a\nsufficient foundation for good decision-making. We especially want to think\nthis when times are tough and people are counting on us to fix things.\nBut these are the very circumstances when pausing and engaging with\nthose outside of ourselves is most important.\nLet me give you an example. For much of our history, central bankers\nhave used the natural tension between unemployment and inflation to\nevaluate the stance of monetary policy – whether we’ve got it right or not. But\nover the past decade, this natural tension has been harder to see.\nUnemployment has fallen dramatically while inflation has remained relatively\nmuted. The question is, what should we make of this?\n5\n\nFINAL\nAs a labor economist and policymaker, I’ve thought a lot about this. But I\nactually found the answer by listening to those less familiar with the tradeoff.\nLast year, the Federal Reserve conducted a series of listening events as part of\nour monetary policy framework review. We talked to academics,\npolicymakers, and – most importantly – business and community leaders.8\nHere’s what we learned. A historically low unemployment rate does not\nmean that the labor market is historically tight. And letting the economy run\npast what we thought was possible has tremendous benefits, especially for\ndisadvantaged groups. Eleven years into the expansion, many more workers\nhave entered the labor force and found jobs than anyone thought possible. By\nfinding full employment experientially, we have improved the lives of\ncountless Americans.9\nImportantly, few models would have predicted this. Little history would\nhave told us this was possible. Our traditional approach would have said to\ncurb this growth, eliminate the possibility of unwanted inflation, and be\nsatisfied with bringing unemployment back to its historical average. If we had\nstayed within this mindset, we might very well have cut the expansion short.\nIn other words, if we hadn’t talked to others – the proverbial strangers –\nwe wouldn’t have seen all that was possible.\n8 See the discussion of the “Fed Listens” initiative on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors web site: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-\nmonetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm.\n9 See for example Aaronson et al. (2019), Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n6\n\nFINAL\nWe have more than we think\nHere’s the second lesson from stone soup. The bravest thing the\nvillagers did was to contribute to the soup without fully knowing what would\ncome of it. In other words, they had to act despite considerable uncertainty\nabout the outcome.\nAs policymakers, we face a similar challenge. There is no doubt that we\nare collectively more constrained than in the past, and that we face greater\nuncertainty about the impact of our tools and their ability to achieve our goals.\nStill, we have to act like the villagers.\nAfter more than 40 years of fighting to bring inflation down to target,\nthe new economic environment requires that monetary policymakers push\ninflation up to target.10 And while this will not be easy, we have the tools we\nneed. Options like average inflation targeting, nominal income targeting, and\nboosting the inflation target are already being researched and widely debated.\nBut having the tools and actually being willing to use them are two very\ndifferent things. And with very limited experience using these tools in this\nway, we feel uncertain. We’ve exercised the muscle of pushing inflation down\nfor so long that changing direction feels unnatural. But that is exactly what we\nwill need to do. We need to embrace the mindset that inflation a bit above\ntarget is far better than inflation a bit below target in today’s economic\nenvironment.11\nA similar mindset shift will be necessary for fiscal policymakers. With\nmonetary policy facing its own limits, fiscal policy will need to play a larger\n10 Jordà and Nechio (2018).\n11 Mertens and Williams (2019).\n7\n\nFINAL\nrole in smoothing through economic shocks. But in a world of fiscal discipline,\nit’s hard to commit to the idea of more.\nBut more is exactly what we need. Expanding the array of automatic\nstabilizers that form part of the social safety net can help mitigate the depth\nand duration of economic downturns.12 Think of unemployment insurance,\nwhich kicks in automatically when things are bad, helping individuals smooth\nthrough a tough time while limiting the amplification of their loss throughout\nthe economy. Although more work is needed, recent research suggests that\nthese types of programs will likely be especially powerful in the new\neconomic reality we face.13\nPerhaps most importantly, we need to continue investing in our future\ngrowth. Countless research studies have shown that spending on things like\ninfrastructure, research and development, and education pays off and actually\nincreases the productive capacity of the economy in the longer run.14 In\ntoday’s low interest rate environment, such investments are relatively easy to\nfinance and will pay a high rate of return in the future.15 We should take\nadvantage of the opportunity.\nA better global legacy\nBefore I conclude, I’d like to leave you with some final thoughts.\n12 See, for example, the panel discussion including Janet Yellen and others at the 2020\nAmerican Economic Association Annual Meetings:\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/1357.\n13 McKay and Reis (2016), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2016), Boushey, Nunn,\nand Shambaugh (2019).\n14 Fernald (1999), Leduc and Wilson (2012), Jones and Williams (1998), Bosler et al.\n(2018).\n15 Elmendorf (2019).\n8\n\nFINAL\nWe all look at the world through the lens of our own experiences. We\nonly know what we know. But what stone soup tells us is that it’s possible to\nwiden our lens. The villagers in the story were able to see a new path forward\nwhen they engaged with the strangers. Their mindsets changed. And then,\nthey were brave enough to act.\nAs policymakers, we must actively look for perspectives outside of our\nown. And we need to be courageous enough to take action, even in times of\nuncertainty. We don’t have the luxury of waiting for strangers to knock on our\ndoors.\nSo let this be our legacy. In the face of challenges, with limited tools and\nless than clear paths, we chose an abundance mindset over a scarcity mindset.\nWe came together and worked to hand future generations a better world than\nthe one we inherited.\nAs policymakers, I think we can all live with that. Maybe even be proud\nof it.\nThank you.\n9\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C. Daly, William Wascher, and David W.

Our analysis considers whether suicide risk is systematically related to the\nincome of others, holding own income and other individual and environmental factors fixed. We\nestimate proportional hazards and probit models of the suicide hazard using two separate and\nindependent data sets: (1) the National Longitudinal Mortality Study and (2) the National Center for\nHealth Statistics’ Mortality Detail Files combined with the 5 percent Public Use Micro Sample of\nthe 1990 decennial census. Results from both data sources show that, controlling for own income\nand individual characteristics, individual suicide risk rises with reference group income. This result\nholds for reference groups defined either by county or more narrowly by county and one\ndemographic marker (e.g., age, sex, race). These findings are robust to alternative specifications\nand cannot be explained by geographic variation in cost of living, access to emergency medical\ncare, or suicide misclassification. Our results support findings using self-reported happiness data\nand are consistent with models of utility featuring “external habit” or “Keeping Up with the\nJoneses” preferences.\nKeywords: Relative income, interpersonal comparisons, interdependent preferences, suicide,\nhappiness, Keeping Up with the Joneses.\nJEL Codes: I31, D6, H0, J0\n-2-\n\nRelative Status and Well-Being: Evidence from U.S. Suicide Deaths\nI. Introduction\nDespite popular acceptance and growing empirical support the idea that individuals assess\nthemselves relative to others has been slow to diffuse into mainstream economic theory. A potential\nreason for the reluctant adoption is that the data used to illustrate the presence and importance of\ninterpersonal comparisons—classroom orlaboratory experiments and subjective surveys of\nhappiness or life satisfaction—are themselves the subject of considerable debate. Experiments, by\ntheir nature, are contrived and frequently limited to very small samples. Self-reported happiness\nsurveys, while capturing much larger samples, elicit responses that are subjective and may be\ndifficult to compare across individuals and over time. These criticisms of experimental and\nhappiness data have limited acceptance of research findings on interpersonal comparisons.\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative source of data, suicide deaths, for identifying the\nimportance of interpersonal comparisons and relative status. Treating suicide as a choice variable\nregarding current life satisfaction and assessed value of future life, we examine the relationship\nbetween suicide risk and own and others’ income using data from two independent sources: (1) the\nNational Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) and (2) data from publicly available death\ncertificates combined with the 5 percent Public Use Micro Sample (PUMS) of the 1990 decennial\ncensus. Consistent with data from experiments and happiness surveys, we find that local area\n(county) median income, holding own income constant, is positively and significantly correlated\nwith suicide risk. This result is robust to alternative specifications of the empirical model and to\nattempts to reduce the impact of the relative income variable through controls for its potential\ncorrelates including geographic variation in the cost of living, access to emergency medical care,\nand errors in suicide reporting. We argue that additional omitted pathways through which county\n-3-\n\nincome might affect suicide risks (e.g., better mental health care services in higher income counties,\nendogenous mobility of individuals to counties where their relative income is higher, and county\nincome shocks that are correlated with unobserved non-income shocks (as suggested in Luttmer\n2005, for example)) are more likely to reduce than increase suicide risk, making our estimates an\nunderestimation rather than overestimation of the correlations.\nHaving established the robustness of our baseline result, we exploit the richness of our data\nand consider the association between relative income and suicide risk along two additional\ndimensions. First, we examine whether the relative income association holds for individuals across\nthe income distribution. Our results suggest that suicide risk rises with median county income both\nfor high-income and low-income individuals, although the effect appears to be somewhat larger for\nthe latter. Second, we consider whether relative income comparisons are limited to individuals’\nlocal geographic area, defined by county. The results indicate that age, in addition to local area, is a\nparticularly relevant factor. In contrast, the broader geography of state does not appear to be a\nrelevant comparison group..\nWe interpret our findings as consistent with the idea that relative income matters for\nmeasured happiness (unhappiness). Although our analysis is not able to rule out the possibility that\nomitted variables are driving the association we find, the robustness of the results and the fact that it\naligns with previous studies of relative income using experimental data and self-reported happiness,\nlead us to conclude that suicide data are a reasonable source of information for studies of\ninterpersonal comparisons.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the empirical\nwork on relative income and utility and discuss how information on suicide fits into and expands the\nliterature. We lay out our theoretical motivation and describe our empirical strategy in Section 3.\nThe data sets we construct and use are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we present our main\nresults and assess their robustness. A summary of our findings and the path for future work are laid\n-4-\n\nout in Section 6.\n2. Previous Research\nFollowing early recognition of the importance of relative comparisons by Adam Smith,\nseveral economists have composed fuller treatments of the issue, including Veblen (1899),\nDuesenberry (1949), Easterlin (1974), Abel (1990), Galí (1994), Kahneman and Tversky (1996),\nFrank (2000), Becker and Rayo (2007), and others. These models of interdependent preferences\ngenerally posit that individuals care about both their own socioeconomic status (generally defined\nby income, consumption, or wealth) and that of others. A growing empirical literature on the\nsubject has found evidence consistent with this view. Empirical investigations generally can be\ngrouped into two types. The first set consists of controlled experiments designed to elicit\nparticipants’ reactions to imposed hierarchies. In these experiments, performed on human and\nprimate subjects, researchers have looked for the subjects’ negative reactions to the extent of a\nhierarchy, i.e., “inequality aversion,” and for reactions to subjects’ relative placement within a\nhierarchy, i.e., “interdependent preferences” (Engelmann and Strobel 2004; Brosnan and deWaal\n2003; Alpizar, Carlsson, and Johansen-Stenman 2005). Although such experiments consistently\nfind that inequality and relative income matter, the relatively small sample sizes and artificial\nenvironments of these experiments make their results difficult to generalize. Moreover, their\ncontrived nature frequently makes it difficult to distinguish inequality aversion from relative income\nconcerns.\nA second vein of the literature on interpersonal income comparisons comes from research\non responses to questions from subjective well-being (happiness and/or life satisfaction) surveys. A\nnumber of researchers have used the responses from these surveys to study the extent to which self-\nreported happiness or satisfaction is correlated with relative position, holding other factors such as\n-5-\n\nown income constant.1 For example, Clark and Oswald (1996) use data on 5,000 British workers to\ninvestigate whether worker satisfaction rates are inversely related to relative wages. A similar\nexamination is done in Brown, et al. (2008), focusing on relative rankings of workers’ wages rather\nthan the relative wage ratio. Both studies find evidence that relative income matters to self-reported\nsatisfaction. Along the same lines, several papers have expanded the potential reference group to\nwhich individuals are compared by combining individual data on happiness and income with\nvariables on local, regional, and national income (Helliwell 2003; Luttmer 2005; Tomes 1986; and\nFerrer-i-Carbonell 2005). In general, these papers have found empirical support for the\ninterpersonal income comparisons hypothesis.\nStill, serious concerns have been raised about the quality of data on self-reported happiness\n(see, e.g., Brekke 1997, Osmani 1993, and Wilkinson 2007; see Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001 for\na broader critique of subjective survey data). Such concerns include language ambiguities\n(respondents may not all agree on the exact meaning of terms like “happiness” and “life\nsatisfaction”), scale comparability (one person’s “very satisfied” may be higher, lower, or equal to\nanother person’s “satisfied”), ambiguity regarding the time period over which respondents base their\nanswers, respondent candidness, and the difficulty of drawing cardinal inferences from ordinal\nsurvey responses. In addition, Diamond (2008) argues that happiness data may be inappropriate for\nanswering the relative income question in particular since the question itself could be a relative\none.2\n1There also is a recent cross-national literature using surveys of happiness. These studies\ncompare average reported happiness to average income across countries. They generally find little\ncorrelation (Di Tella, MacCulloch, Oswald 2001; Alesina, Di Tella, and MacCulloch 2004;\nEasterlin 1973, 1995; Oswald 1997), though an exception is Stevenson and Wolfers (2008b) who\nfind strong evidence of a positive correlation.\n2Diamond states: “How should we interpret answers to the question ‘How happy are you\nthese days?’.... If people answer whether they are satisfied with their lives in terms of their\nperceived relative position in happiness, that does not necessarily mean that happiness is based on\nrelative position, rather that the question being answered by the respondent is a relative happiness\nquestion…. Some exploration has been done of the impact on reported happiness of the...incomes of\n-6-\n\nTherefore, although the results from subjective surveys and experimental studies seem to\nconfirm a role for theories of interdependent preferences, concerns about how representative the\nunderlying data are have hindered broader acceptance of the results. The suggestive findings\ncoupled with concerns about experiments and self-reported measures of happiness suggest that\nadditional methods of addressing the role of relative income are needed.\n3. Suicide Data as an Alternative\nWe propose that suicide data provide an alternative measure of happiness (unhappiness)\nwith several advantages over experiments and happiness surveys.3 First, suicide can be thought of\nas a revealed choice made by individuals who have examined the value of continuing to live versus\nnot.4 In studies of consumer choice, using observed choices to infer preferences has long been\nconsidered preferable to relying on individual self-reports of preferences. Second, suicide data are\ncomparably measured across individuals and regions and over time. Third, in the United States at\nleast, data on suicides are publicly available and complete, covering the universe of reported\nsuicides by year.5\nneighbors. But such studies may not shed light on the question of how much well-being depends on\none's relative standing and how much the respondent looks to relative standing in order to answer\nthe survey question.”\n3As Oswald (1997) puts it, “Suicides represent choices in response to (un)happiness that are\nintrinsically more compelling than replies made to happiness survey questions, and data that, by their\nnature, cannot be generated in a laboratory experiment.”\n4We recognize that the actual choice may be suicide attempt rather than completion.\nHowever, data on attempts are quite limited and, moreover, a large share of attempts may reflect\n“cries for help” rather than true attempts to commit suicide.\n5Reported suicides may undercount all true suicides; many experts believe that a significant\nshare of true suicides are misclassified as accidents or “undetermined injuries” (see Moyer, Boyle, and\nPollock 1989; Rockett and Smith 1999; and Mohler and Earls 2001). We address this possibility in our\n-7-\n\nThere is also a long history in sociology and economics of relating suicide patterns to more\nuniversal social phenomena. The most complete example of such efforts is Durkheim’s detailed\nempirical study of suicide. Durkheim’s (1951) Suicide: A Study in Sociology, originally published\nin 1897, was a careful attempt to analyze the societal influences that affect suicidal behavior and\nunhappiness more generally. More modern treatments in economics have also treated suicide as a\npotentially social phenomenon, affected by both societal and individual factors. Examples of this\nwork include Hamermesh and Soss (1974), who develop an economic theory of suicide and, using\ncross-country and cross-state data, find that suicide risk is significantly related to unemployment\nand decreases in permanent income. More recently, Ruhm (2000) considers suicide as one of\nseveral causes of death and finds that, unlike other negative health outcomes that decline during\ntimes of recession, suicide risk is either increased or unaffected. In other work, Helliwell (2007)\ninvestigates the empirical association between subjective well-being and suicide rates using cross-\ncountry panel data and finds a strong negative relationship.6 In a related survey article on happiness\nand economic factors, Oswald (1997) notes that many variables positively (negatively) associated\nwith reported happiness are negatively (positively) associated with suicide risk.7 To our\nknowledge, though, we are the first to use information on suicide risk to study the existence and\nnature of interpersonal comparisons.\nempirical analysis.\n6Similarly, Koivumaa-Honkanen, et al. (2001) find that individual self-reports of life\nsatisfaction have significant predictive power for suicide over the subsequent 20 years.\n7Other recent examples of economists trying to explain suicide behavior include Cutler,\nGlaeser, and Norberg (2000), Brainerd (2001), Marcotte (2003), Stevenson and Wolfers (2008a),\nChuang and Huang (1997), Huang (1996), Kimenyi and Shughart (1986), Hamermesh (1974), and\nSchapiro and Ahlburg (1982-83). There have also been a number of recent studies in the\npsychiatry and public health literatures exploring the empirical links between suicide and\nsocioeconomic factors (see, e.g., Blakely et al. 2003, Lewis and Sloggett 1998, and Kposawa\n2001).\n-8-\n\nDespite the above-mentioned advantages of using suicide data to address questions on\nindividual well-being and utility, and the demonstration of its usefulness from prior studies, there\nstill is a couple of potential concerns with using such data. First, it is possible that suicide decisions\nare largely idiosyncratic and not systematically related to the variables that affect happiness or life\nsatisfaction. While this concern cannot be eliminated a priori, it is testable: if it is binding then we\nshould find no correlation between relative income (or other variables) and suicide risk.\nSecond, and more importantly, suicide victims presumably are at the extreme tail of the\ndistribution of life satisfaction over the population, and their preferences may not reflect the\npreferences of the non-suicide population. Conceptually, we posit that suicide relates to population\nhappiness as described in Figure 1. The figure shows the happiness continuums for two individuals,\ni = A, B, as well as their suicide thresholds θ. As the schematic illustrates, our maintained\ni\nhypothesis is that factors affecting utility (X) have the same marginal effect on suicide risk as they\ni\ndo on happiness, but that thresholds for suicide differ across individuals. That is, suicide victims\nand the general population have the same β’s but different θ’s. Given this assumption, uncovering\nthe marginal effects of variables on suicide then informs us about how these variables affect\nhappiness for the rest of the population. While the vast majority of the population never commits\nsuicide, this theoretical construct suggests that factors that affect an individual’s suicide risk also\naffect his or her overall happiness/unhappiness. In particular, we can use data on suicide deaths to\ntest hypotheses related to interpersonal comparisons.\nAdmittedly, without empirical examination one cannot know whether individuals who\ncommit suicide differ only in θ or in both θand β. To move toward this goal, Daly and Wilson\n(2009) conduct a cross-validation exercise using subjective well-being data and suicide and find\nevidence supporting the idea that β’s are the same between those who commit suicide and those\nwho do not. Specifically, they find that the relative risks of suicide along a host of dimensions\n(such as education, income, age, marital status, and employment status) closely match the relative\n-9-\n\nrisks of reported unhappiness. Based on these results we proceed as if the description in Figure 1 is\nreasonable and estimate an empirical model implicitly embedding these assumptions.8\nBefore turning to the results, in the next section we describe the data and report basic\ndescriptive statistics regarding suicide and its correlations with demographic, economic, and\ngeographic variables.\n4. Data, Sample, and Descriptive Statistics\n4.1 Data Sources\nTo analyze the relationship between relative income and suicide, we draw on two different\nindividual level data sets. Our primary data source is based on the National Longitudinal Mortality\nStudy (NLMS) augmented with data on county and state income from the U.S. Census Bureau. The\nNLMS data come from a confidential, restricted-use database developed and maintained by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau to facilitate research on the effects of demographic and socioeconomic factors on\nmortality (see U.S. Bureau of the Census 2005).9 These data have been used extensively by\nepidemiologists and public health experts to study, for example, cancer and heart disease, though\nthey have been used less frequently by economists. The NLMS consists of a set of cohort files,\nprimarily from Current Population Surveys (CPS), matched to the National Death Index (NDI), a\nnational database containing the universe of U.S. death certificates since 1979. The cohort files\nincluded in our analysis – those with sufficient information on income – are March CPS files from\n1979 to 1998, plus CPS files for February 1978, April 1980, August 1980, and December 1980.\nThe matching process appends to individual CPS records (1) whether the person has died within the\n8 At the end of the analysis we conduct a series of checks designed to test the\nreasonableness of our maintained hypothesis that suicide and happiness span the same continuum.\n9 There is also a public-use version of the NLMS, however it does not include county of residence or\nother geographic identifiers.\n-10-\n\nfollow-up period, (2) date of death (if deceased), and (3) cause of death (if deceased).10\nOur second source of data, which we use a check on the results from the NLMS data,\ncombines the Mortality Detail Files (MDF) for years 1989-1992, with data from the 1990 5 percent\nPublic Use Micro Sample (PUMS). We will refer to this data set as the MDF-PUMS data. The\npublic use MDF, compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics and available from the Inter-\nuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), for a given year are essentially the\ndata from all death certificates recorded in the United States in that year (see U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services 1992).11 For the years 1989-1992, we extract the records where suicide\nis the cause of death (i.e., International Classification of Death, Rev. 9 (ICD9) codes E950-E959)\nand combine them with the individual records from the PUMS 5 percent sample of the 1990\ndecennial census (Ruggles et al. 2004), which we treat as nonsuicide observations. We extract\nsuicides for years other than 1990 to maximize the number of suicide observations, given that\nsuicide is a relatively infrequent event.\nBoth data sources have advantages and disadvantages. The NLMS data have a much\nsmaller sample of suicide and nonsuicide records from which to draw inferences but contain actual\nreported income and have no limitations on geographic coverage. In contrast, the MDF-PUMS data\nhave the advantage of containing a very large number of observations from suicide victims (as well\nas from the general population), but do not include income and do not identify county of residence\nfor sparsely populated counties (i.e., those with populations less than 100,000). We consider the\nNLMS data the preferred and main source for our examination, but use the MDF-PUMS to check\nkey results and perform robustness checks not available in the NLMS data.\n4.2 Sample and Analysis Variables\n10At the time of this writing, the mortality follow-up (i.e., the matching to the NDI) from the\ncohort files covered deaths occurring from January 1, 1979 through December 31, 1998.\n11 For later years, these data are called Multiple Cause of Death files.\n-11-\n\nTo correspond to previous research on interpersonal comparisons we restrict our analysis to\nworking-age adults (20-64), for whom relative income concerns are likely to be most relevant.\nAlthough we make every attempt to match the sample and variables across data sets, such precision\nis not always possible. Below we describe the exact selections for each data source and note where\ndifferences emerge.\nIn the NLMS data, we restrict the sample to non-Hispanic working-age adults. Following\nstandard practice in NLMS research, we exclude Hispanics because of definitional changes in the\nHispanic status variable over time and concern that a nontrivial share of Hispanic CPS respondents\nmay have moved out of the United States prior to the end of the follow-up period, in which case\ntheir deaths would not be observed.12 However, for completeness, we also run results without this\nexclusion and report them in the results section. The final data set, after excluding a relatively small\nnumber of records with missing values for key variables, contains 957,939 individual records,\nincluding 74,929 nonsuicide deaths and 1,544 suicide deaths within the follow-up period (the\nremainder were still alive as of December 31, 1998).\nWe merge onto the NLMS data a number of geographic aggregates, most notably mean\nfamily income by county-year. The construction of these geographic aggregate variables is\ndescribed in Appendix A.\nThe variables jointly available in the MDF and the PUMS are age, race, sex, county of\nresidence (for counties with population above 100,000), marital status, education, and Hispanic\nstatus. Income, on the other hand, is not recorded on death certificates. We therefore estimate\nincome by matching suicide records in the MDF to individuals or groups of individuals in the\nPUMS data, where income is available. The matching procedure works as follows: (1) for each\nsuicide record, find all matching observations in the PUMS, matching on county, age, race, sex,\nHispanic status, education, and marital status; (2) calculate average family income for this matching\n12 This problem is well-known among researchers using the NLMS data and NLMS research staff at\nthe Census Bureau recommend the approach we have taken in this analysis.\n-12-\n\ncell; and (3) assign this average income to the suicide observation. This procedure provides a\nreasonably accurate estimate of income: over the 7,202,093 working-age observations in PUMS,\ncounty, age, race, sex, Hispanic status, education, and marital status jointly explain 24 percent of the\nindividual level variation in family income.13 A variance decomposition (not shown) reveals that\ncounty, education, and marital status (in decreasing importance) have the greatest explanatory\npower, together accounting for 16 percent of the variation.\nWith this matching procedure, we are able to estimate family income for 57 percent of U.S.\nworking-age suicide records from 1989-1992 (and 76% of suicide records among counties with\npopulation over 100,000), totaling 50,328 suicides.14 We use the same matching procedure to\ngenerate an analogous predicted income variable for the nonsuicide records; this is the “own\nincome” variable used in our regression analyses. (Because the PUMS contains few missing values\nfor the income-estimation variables, the match rate for non-suicide records from identifiable\ncounties is near 100%.) The final data set has 4,360,747 observations.\n4.3 Descriptive Statistics\nNational statistics show that the U.S. suicide rate has been relatively constant since 1950,\naveraging about 12 per 100,000 persons (see WHO 2005).15 Table 1 reports suicide risk overall and\nby our model variables for the NLMS and MDF-PUMS samples. Recall that both samples exclude\n13 Including occupation and industry in the income estimation would modestly improve the\nmodel fit to 28 percent. However, less than half of the suicide records report occupation and\nindustry (as many states do not include them on death certificates). Therefore, we omit these\nvariables from the matching procedure.\n14 The main constraining factors here in terms of coverage are county of residence and\neducation. Education is simply unknown or unreported on many death certificates. For\nconfidentiality reasons, county of residence (or occurrence) is not identified on the public-use MDF\ndata if the county has a population below 100,000. This occurs for roughly a quarter of U.S.\ncounties in 1990, covering slightly more than a quarter of all suicides. It should also be noted that\nsome death records include occupation and industry of the deceased, but not enough records contain\nthis information for us to include these variables usefully in our matching procedure.\n15 From 1950 to 2000, the overall U.S. suicide rate has fluctuated within the narrow range of\n10.4 to 13.5 per 100,000. The typical rate for the working-age adult population is somewhat higher,\naround 12 to 15 per 100,000.\n-13-\n\nHispanics and cover only working-age adults. The overall suicide rates in the NLMS and MDF-\nPUMS are quite similar to each other, at approximately 13 per 100,000, and are comparable to the\nnational statistics. Furthermore, national data indicate considerable variation in suicide risk by\ngender, age, and race. These patterns are mirrored in the NLMS and MDF-PUMS samples. For\nexample, suicide rates are far higher for males than for females and higher for whites than for other\nraces. Suicide rates decline slightly with age according to the MDF-PUMS while having no clear\nage trend in the NLMS sample, which may simply be due to the relatively small sample size of the\nNLMS. In both samples, married individuals have a lower suicide rate on average relative to those\nwho are single/never married or divorced/separated. Suicide rates generally fall, though not\nmonotonically, with educational attainment. Although rudimentary, these categorical suicide rates\nsuggest that the two data sources used in our analysis produce patterns consistent with the stylized\nfacts regarding suicide reported in the epidemiology/public health, psychology, and sociology\nliteratures.\nThe key variables in our analysis are own and reference group income. To assess the extent\nto which preferences of the general population can be inferred from the revealed preferences of\nsuicide victims, it is helpful to first compare these two populations along the key dimension of\nincome. Figures 2 and 3 plot the distribution of predicted family income for working-age suicide\nvictims in our two samples against the income distribution for the general U.S. working-age\npopulation. Figure 2 shows the distributions of reported family income (adjusted to 1990 dollars)\nfor the total sample and for the subset of those who eventually commit suicide, according to the\nNLMS data. Note that the NLMS data are survey reports reflecting income at the time the\nindividual was surveyed rather than income at the time the suicide was committed. The income\ndistribution of suicide victims is slightly left of that for the general population. That said, the bulk\nof the suicide population has income in the middle range of the distribution. We take this as\nsupporting evidence for the notion that suicide victims are broadly representative of the general\n-14-\n\npopulation, at least in terms of income (though the distribution for suicide victims is somewhat\nmore skewed). This will aid us when we offer an interpretation for our later findings.\nFigure 3 reports income figures for the MDF-PUMS sample; the figure shows the\ndistribution of estimated family income (estimated as described in Section 4 above) of suicide\nvictims compared to estimated family income of the general population.16 The distributions suggest\nthat the modal suicide victim sits slightly to the left of the modal member of the general population,\nbut overall the two distributions are quite similar. Importantly, there is little difference in the lower\ntail of the income distribution and overall the shapes for the two populations are roughly similar.17\nThe fact that the MDF-PUMS data show a pattern similar to the NLMS data suggests that our\nestimated income data in the MDF-PUMS data set are reasonably accurate.\nTurning to county income, suicide risk has a strong negative correlation with county\nincome. One can see this in Figure 4 which shows a scatterplot of county suicide rates (from the\nMDF) and county income per family in 1990 across the 3,150 counties in the data. Each circle in\nthe plot represents a single county and the size of the circle is proportional to the county’s\npopulation. The unweighted correlation is −0.07 and the population-weighted correlation is −0.29;\nboth are significant at well below the 1% level. Note we also have confirmed that this negative\n(unconditional) correlation between suicide risk and county income is present in the NLMS sample\nwith a simple proportional hazards model of suicide risk regressed on county income alone (results\navailable upon request). Thus, it is clear that the positive effect of county income on suicide risk\nthat we find later in our multivariate results is not what one would expect a priori.\nDescriptive statistics for other model variables are reported in Tables B1 (NLMS) and B2\n(MDF-PUMS) of Appendix B. Again, the key variables in our analysis are of similar magnitudes\n16 Recall that both the suicide and general populations in the MDF-PUMS sample exclude\nindividuals from counties with population under 100,000, since such counties are not identified in\nthe data for confidentiality reasons.\n17 We also did this matching using education alone and obtained similar results. Full details\nof both estimation strategies are available from the authors upon request.\n-15-\n\nand have similar patterns in both data sets.\n5. Empirical Model Specification and Results\n5.1 Empirical Strategy\nBased on the intuition summarized in Figure 1 and the data described above, we estimate a\nreduced form model of suicide risk and own and others’ income that closely matches those\nestimated using self-reported data on happiness. For the NLMS data we estimate Cox proportional\nhazards models of suicide risk–i.e., the hazard rate of suicide in a given period–as an exponential\nfunction of own income, reference-group income, and a set of controls. Ideally, one would prefer to\nestimate the risk of suicide since birth, but given the constraints of the NLMS, namely that it does\nnot contain information for years prior to the interview year nor does it contain information on\ndeaths observed prior to the interview date, this approach is infeasible.18 Thus, we use time-since-\ninterview as the duration variable in our models. The estimated proportional hazards model is the\nsuicide hazard (probability of suicide at time t given it has not already occurred) over the interval\nfrom 0 to T, where T is the maximum duration in the sample, conditional on individual covariates\nrecorded at period 0.19 The structure of the NLMS means that the vast majority of observations\n(individuals) are censored; the proportional hazards model accounts for this.20\nAnother approach would be to estimate a logit regression. In fact, the hazard regression is\n18 The NLMS data provides socioeconomic and demographic information on individuals at\nthe date of their initial CPS response (period 0) as well as time elapsed until death. Thus records are\nidentified in terms of duration from the original interview rather than in calendar time.\n19 In the NLMS, T is 7,633 days, which is the difference between December 31, 1998, the\nend of the NLMS follow-up window, and February 1, 1978, the date of the earliest CPS response in\nthe sample.\n20 Observations can be left-censored either due to non-suicide death prior to the end of the\nfollow-up period or to participating in a CPS survey later than February 1978. Observations can be\nright-censored due to the individual still being alive at the end of the follow-up period.\n-16-\n\nsimilar to a weighted cross-sectional logit regression but with the advantage of accounting for the\npassage of time between the interview and the suicide date. That is, in the hazard framework, an\nindividual who commits suicide soon after the interview period in which both own and relative\nincome are observed will get a larger weight than an individual who commits suicide long after the\ninterview date and thus long after the explanatory variables are observed. Giving the latter\nindividual a lower weight is appropriate given that her interview-date values of the explanatory\nvariables will be imperfect measures of the values of those variables at time t, the potential date of\ndeath, due to the passage of time. For instance, the discrepancy between a CPS respondent’s\nincome at the time of the CPS and her income at the time of her death is likely increasing (in\nabsolute value) in the duration between the two dates. A logit analysis would treat these two sample\nmembers as equivalent and thus implicitly assume that the length of time between the measurement\nof income and the suicide would have no effect on the coefficient. As a robustness check, we also\nestimate logit regressions where the dependent variable is 1 if the individual ever commits suicide\nand 0 otherwise. As we show later in the paper, the results are qualitatively similar to those from\nthe Cox proportional hazards model.\nFor the MDF-PUMS data we estimate logit models. Because the Cox proportional hazards\nand logit both have exponential functional forms, it is straightforward to compare the results\nbetween the two types of regressions.\nIn all regressions, standard errors are based on a variance-covariance matrix that is robust to\nheteroskedasticity and clustering within state. In the NLMS regressions we include time (survey\nyear) fixed effects to capture any macro/aggregate factors that might affect suicide and be correlated\nwith own or others’ income. The inclusion of time fixed effects also allows us to interpret the\nresults as evidence of a cross-sectional correlation between suicide risk and the measured\nvariables.21 Since the MDF-PUMS data is a single cross-sectional data source, time effects are not\n21 Since there is a time difference between the interview date and the death or right\n-17-\n\npossible.22\n5.2 NLMS Baseline Regression Results\nThe estimated coefficients and standard errors for our baseline NLMS models are reported\nin Columns 1 – 4 of Table 2. Columns 1 – 3 are identical but for the income variables that are\nincluded. Column 1 has (log) own family income measured as a single continuous variable.\nColumn 2 replaces this variable with income bracket indicator variables to allow for non-linear\nincome effects. Column 3 adds (log) county income per family. Column 4 adds county population\nshares by age category and race, to control for any correlation between county income and county\ndemographics. Before turning our attention to the estimated effects of income variables, we briefly\ndiscuss the relationship between suicide and our control variables; the results are reported in panel C\nof the table. These results are similar across the four columns. Consistent with the raw categorical\nsuicide rates in Table 1, being female or nonwhite lowers suicide risk, while being divorced or\nwidowed, separated, or never married raises suicide risk (relative to being married). Veterans are\nfound to be more likely to commit suicide than nonveterans. There is little evidence of a\nconditional age profile to suicide risk, though the point estimates suggest perhaps a weak inverted-U\nage profile. Controlling for these other factors as well as income, educational attainment lowers\nsuicide risk.\nConsistent with previous findings on suicide risk and labor market status, we find that being\nunemployed or out of the labor force, for any reason, raises suicide risk relative to being\ncensoring date, there is a valid concern that the variation we pick up in our regressions is related to\nunmodeled time series movements rather than cross-sectional correlations between our key\nvariables. By including the time dummies we account for these effects.\n22 We explored constructing a MDF-PUMS panel but the PUMS data are spatially\norganized according to public use microdata areas (PUMAs) which are not fixed over time,\ninhibiting matching from one decennial census to the next.\n-18-\n\nemployed.23 Specifically, those who are unable to work have the highest suicide risk, followed by\nthe unemployed, retired persons, and those who are employed but not currently working (e.g.,\npersons on furlough). In terms of magnitude, the estimated coefficient on unemployment of 0.541\n(from Column 1) implies a hazard ratio of 1.72 (e0.541), meaning that holding other factors constant,\nsuicide risk for an unemployed person is 72% higher than that of a person who is employed and\nworking. The patterns among the control variables vary little across different specifications of the\nmodel. Thus, for the remainder of the paper, we confine our discussion to the relationship between\nsuicide risk and own and others’ income, the key variables in our analysis.\nThe results of the income variables are reported in the upper portion of the table, beginning\nin Panel A. The first column shows the importance of own family income, measured in logs. Own\nincome is statistically significant and negative, implying that higher own income lowers suicide\nrisk. The coefficient on log own income of -0.087 suggests that a 10% higher income is associated\nwith 0.87% lower suicide risk. In column 2, we allow income to affect suicide risk non-linearly,\nand find evidence of important differences across the income distribution. In particular, individuals\nwith family incomes below $20,000 in 1990 dollars (which, by way of reference, is equivalent to\nabout $34,000 in 2010 dollars, based on the CPI-U) are significantly more likely to commit suicide\nthan those with incomes above $60,000 ($102,000 in 2010 dollars). In contrast, suicide risk for\nthose with incomes between $20,000 and $60,000 is not statistically significantly different than that\nof individuals with family income above $60,000.24 The point estimates of the coefficients on the\ncategorical income variables imply hazards ratios of 1.50, 1.43, 1.10, and 1.02, respectively, for\nincome categories $0 - $10,000, $10,000 - $20,000, $20,000 - $40,000, and $40,000 - $60,000. The\n23 The high relative risk of suicide for unemployed individuals has been found previously\nusing similar data (Kposawa 2001, Blakely, et al. 2003).\n24 Previous research on the individual effects of own income on suicide is inconclusive.\nSimilar to our finding, Kposawa (2001), using an earlier version of the NLMS, found that in a\nmultivariate regression, suicide risk decreases with income. Lewis and Sloggett (1998) and Blakely\net al. (2003), however, using British and New Zealand data, respectively, found no significant effect\nof income after other determinants of socioeconomic status had been controlled for.\n-19-\n\nhazard ratio of 1.50, for instance, means that an individual with family income less than $10,000 (in\n1990 dollars) is 50 percent more likely to commit suicide than an individual with income above\n$60,000 (the omitted income category). The hazard ratios decline monotonically, but at a\ndiminishing rate, toward 1.0 as income approaches the omitted top category (for which the hazard\nratio is implicitly 1.0). This pattern is consistent with the standard assumption of diminishing\nmarginal utility of income/consumption. Given this evidence of a non-linear income gradient for\nsuicide risk, we use this model going forward.\nColumn 3 of the table displays results of adding reference group income. Following\nprevious work on interpersonal income comparisons, we use county of residence to define reference\ngroup income. The results show that county income has a positive effect on suicide risk controlling\nfor own income. Our estimated coefficient of 0.453 on log county income implies that, holding\nown income constant, a 10% higher county income is associated with about a 4.5% higher suicide\nhazard relative to the baseline hazard (conditional mean hazard).25\nThough the results on own income point to a non-linear income gradient, this specification\nof own income does not allow for a natural comparison of the magnitudes of the county income\neffect and the own income effect. In a separate regression not shown here (results available upon\nrequest) containing the single log own income variable and log county income, we find the county\nincome coefficient to be larger than that of own income (in absolute value).26 However, this\ncomparison is probably misleading as the coefficient on own income is likely biased downward due\nto measurement error in income and the inclusion of other variables which are highly correlated\n25 The proportional hazards function is h(t)h(0)eln(y)eX , where y is county income\nand X is a vector of all other model variables. The elasticity of the hazard with respect to county\nincome is then: dlog(h(t)) dlog(y)dlog(y). We estimate ˆ = 0.453.\n26 The point estimates on county income and own income are 0.55 and -0.09, respectively,\nand both are significant at below the 1% level.\n-20-\n\nwith income. 27 Later in the paper, we confirm this finding using the MDF-PUMS sample which is\nless prone to the potential bias in income since the own income measures is by construction a fitted\nvalue from a first-stage estimation using PUMS data.\nIn the next column, we add controls for county demographic composition that might be\ncorrelated with both increased suicide risk and higher county income. The findings are qualitatively\nequivalent, although including these controls increases the magnitude of the coefficient on county\nincome to 0.596. The final two columns of Table 2 check the robustness of the results to the\nexclusion of Hispanics from the sample and suicide misclassification.28 In neither case does the\nchange affect our baseline findings. Including Hispanics in the sample reduces the magnitude of the\ncoefficients on all income variables slightly but does not change the pattern or statistical\nsignificance of these variables. Broadening the measure of suicide to include deaths from “injuries\nof undetermined cause” (ICD9 codes E980-E989), which some scholars have suggested may\ncapture suicides that were not correctly classified as such, has no notable impact on the coefficients\nof own or county income.29\nThe findings in Table 2 imply that controlling for other factors, including own income,\nindividuals living in higher income areas face greater suicide risk than those living in low income\n27 We have also estimated a 2SLS version of this regression where we instrument for own\nincome by predicting it with a model that includes state of residence dummies and all the other\nindependent variables included in the model. In this specification, the negative own income\ncoefficient is larger in absolute value than the other income coefficient, implying that if own and\nothers income rose by the same percentage, the aggregate suicide rate would fall. This result is\nsimilar to that in Luttmer (2005). He also found that in the absence of instrumenting for own\nincome, its coefficient was somewhat smaller in absolute value than that of others’ income.\n28 An additional robustness check we performed was to estimate the same specification as\nthat underlying Column 3 of Table 2 but using a logit model instead of the Cox proportional hazards\nmodel. We obtain very similar results. In particular, the estimated coefficient on log county income\nis 0.593.\n29 One other minor robustness check we perform is to assess whether the results are\nsensitive to the presence of outlier, high-suicide-rate counties. We have estimated the baseline\nregression (Table 2, Column 4) after having omitted individuals from counties with suicide rates\nabove the 99th percentile (45.448). There turned out to be just 1138 observations (0.12% of the\nsample) from those counties and just 1 suicide observation (0.06% of 1544 suicide observations in\nthe sample). Thus, the results are virtually unaffected by dropping these observations.\n-21-\n\nareas. This finding is consistent with results of studies using happiness survey data which suggests\nthat a loss of relative position leads to a reduction in individual happiness (see Luttmer 2005). Still,\nseveral other explanations or pathways for county income affecting suicide risk are possible; we\nexamine these alternative explanations in the next section.\n5.3 Alternative Explanations for NLMS Results\nCost-of-living differences.\nOne potential alternative explanation for the results reported in Table 2 is that the positive\neffect of county income on suicide risk is explained by county income simply being a proxy for cost\nof living, so that, conditional on nominal own income, individuals are made worse off by living in\nareas with higher costs, especially costs on nontradables such as housing. We control for this\nalternative explanation in two ways: state fixed effects and controls for county-level house prices.\nThe results of these tests are reported in Table 3; for convenience of comparison, our preferred\nmodel from Table 2 is repeated in column 1.\nThe first test is to add state fixed effects to our baseline regression. The logic is that\nregional differences in cost of living, associated with location, tax structures, etc., will be captured\nat the state level and pulled out in the state fixed effect. To the extent that these cost of living\ndifferences are driving our results, the coefficient on county income should fall or become\ninsignificant. The coefficient on county income falls, from 0.596 in the baseline, to 0.390 when\nstate fixed effects are included, but remains statistically significant. The coefficients on own income\nare qualitatively unchanged.\nThe second test exploits the fact that the cost of housing is likely the most important\ncomponent of cost of living differences across areas. Column 3 reports results from adding a county\nquality-adjusted house price index (described in Appendix A) to our baseline regression. Given the\n-22-\n\nquality adjustment, this index reflects the average cost of land in a county (in a given year) as well\nas any differences across counties in construction costs. The inclusion of the index drives up the\ncoefficient on county income, while the coefficients on own income remain qualitatively\nunchanged. The coefficient on the index of housing costs is negative, suggesting that suicide risk is\nlower in counties with higher housing costs, perhaps because these costs reflect positive area\namenities capitalized in local land values.30 Based on these checks we conclude that our results are\nnot driven by disutility of higher costs of living.\nCounty Income and Mortality.\nTwo other potential explanations of the positive correlation between county income and\nsuicide are that it reflects a relationship between county income and the quality of local emergency\nmedical care or a more general relationship between county income and mortality. The results in\ncolumns 4 and 5 are designed to address these concerns. Column 4 reports results from a regression\nin which heart attack risk (acute myocardial infarction, ICD9 code 410) replaces suicide risk as the\ndependent variable. The use of heart attack deaths is meant to test whether our results on suicide\nrisk owe to differential quality of or access to emergency room care or paramedical care, rather than\nto behavioral reactions to relative income. Research has shown that heart attack deaths are strongly\ncorrelated with time to treatment (e.g., proximity to emergency rooms). If our results on suicide are\ndue to unequal access to emergency rooms such that attempted suicides more frequently end in\ndeath, then we should see the same pattern for heart attack deaths. This is not the case. Indeed,\nwhile the mortality hazard from heart attacks falls monotonically with own income, as with suicide,\nit also falls with county income, contrary to suicide. The final column of the table repeats this\nanalysis using all causes of mortality. Our findings concur with the standard result in the literature\n(see, e.g., Miller and Paxson 2006 and Gerdtham and Johannesson 2004): mortality falls\n30 Interestingly, in a regression with both state fixed effects and the county house price\nindex included, the coefficient on the house price index is close to zero and statistically\ninsignificant, suggesting that the variation in cost of living is primarily state level.\n-23-\n\nmonotonically with own income and is unaffected by relative income.\nBased on these results, we conclude that our finding of a positive effect of local area income\non suicide, after controlling for own income, likely reflects a behavioral response to unfavorable\ninterpersonal income comparisons.31 These individual level results are consistent with earlier, semi-\naggregate results for suicide risk (Daly and Wilson 2006) and with recent empirical analyses using\nself-reported, subjective well-being survey data (Luttmer 2005).\n5.4 NLMS Extensions\nHaving established a robust relationship between suicide risk and own and others’ income,\nwe now turn to extensions of the baseline specification and the interpersonal income literature more\ngenerally. Table 4 displays the results of these extensions; for convenience, the first column repeats\nthe results from our baseline specification. We first consider whether county of residence is the\nmore relevant reference group than state of residence. 32 The results show that state family income\nhas no significant effect on suicide risk. Next, we ask whether the relative income effect varies over\nthe income distribution. To do so, we interact the categorical income variables with county income.\nThe results are shown in the third column of the table, Panel B. While the small sample size limits\nthe statistical power in this regression, the higher point estimates of the interactions involving the\nlower income categories are suggestive of a stronger effect for those at the bottom of the income\ndistribution than for those at the top.\nFinally, we consider whether the relative income effect differs by gender and race. To do\n31 One might worry that our results are reflecting unmeasured correlation between county\nincome and unobserved county characteristics, such as mental health services, that are also\ncorrelated with county income. While we cannot rule this out completely, we note that concerns\nalong these lines likely would produce a downward bias on the county income effect. For instance,\nprevious research has shown that psychiatric services are positively correlated with county income\n(see, e.g., Zimmerman and Bell 2006).\n32 Consideration of reference groups at a finer disaggregation than county is not possible\nwith our NLMS sample due to lack of income data availability over time. We do, however,\ninvestigate narrower reference groups below with our MDF-PUMS sample, which requires\nreference group income data only for 1990, a decennial census year.\n-24-\n\nso, we interact log county income with gender dummies and race dummies. These results are\nshown in the final two columns of the table, respectively. The results suggest that women are more\nresponsive to relative income than men and that whites are more responsive than nonwhites (though\nthe effects for non-whites are imprecisely estimated, likely due to small sample sizes).\n5.5 MDF-PUMS Baseline Regression Results\nAlthough the NLMS results provide consistent evidence of the effect of county income on\nsuicide risk, one might still be skeptical of this result given the relatively small number of suicides\nin the NLMS data. To try to address this issue, we turn to an alternative data source, the MDF-\nPUMS described earlier. As noted, the MDF-PUMS data combine suicide records from death\ncertificate data with individual records from the PUMS 5% sample of the 1990 decennial census.\nUsing these data, we estimate a set of regressions that are as analogous as possible (given the data\navailable in the MDF-PUMS) to the NLMS models. We estimate logit models of the probability of\ncommitting suicide as a function of (log) estimated own family income, (log) county income per\nfamily, and various controls, including state fixed effects. These models include the same control\nvariables as those in the NLMS regressions except education, labor market status, veteran status,\nand county characteristics (i.e., demographic population shares and population density). Labor\nmarket and veteran status are not recorded on death certificates and hence are unavailable in the\nMDF-PUMS data set. Even though we loosely refer to “county income” in the MDF-PUMS, these\ndata actually use a different geographic area, the PUMA, which doesn’t directly correspond to\ncounties, preventing us from including county characteristics. We omit education to avoid\nmulticollinearity with predicted income, given that, after county (PUMA) of residence, we find\neducation to have the most explanatory power in our income estimation. If we included education,\nthere would be little independent variation with which to identify the coefficient on own income.33\n33 We confirmed this point by running a regression equivalent to that in Column 2 of Table 6 but\n-25-\n\nOur strategy in these regressions thus amounts to treating estimated income as a summary statistic\nfor socioeconomic status.\nTable 5 gives the baseline results for the MDF-PUMS logit regression. As in the earlier\nNLMS results, the standard errors shown are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustering within\nstate.34 Column 1 shows results where own family income is measured as a continuous variable. In\nColumn 2, income is measured by a set of income bracket indicators. To enhance comparability\nwith the NLMS results, we defined these brackets using the same cut-off values as those used in the\nNLMS. Column 3 adds (log) county income per family.35\nAs in the earlier NLMS regressions, we find in Column 1 that suicide risk falls with own\nincome, at least when income is measured as a continuous variable. Columns 2 and 3 reveal less\nevidence of a non-linear income gradient for own income and suicide risk than in the NLMS\nregressions. It is possible that the estimation of income for the MDF-PUMS data results in less\nprecision across narrowly defined categories at the lower end of the income distribution and thus\nmasks the clear gradient seen in the NLMS results. In addition, whereas there are similar numbers\nof observations in each of the income brackets in the NLMS, this is not the case in the MDF-PUMS.\nWe have also estimated this MDF-PUMS regression replacing these dollar-level income brackets\nwith income quintile dummies, ensuring equal coverage in each category (results available upon\nrequest). The coefficients on these quintile dummies reveal a similar pattern to that found in the\nNLMS: suicide risk falls with income, but at a diminishing rate.\nThe key result of Table 5, however, is that the MDF-PUMS data confirm the pattern seen in\nthat additionally included education and marital status dummies. As expected, the effects of own\nincome were essentially unidentified (i.e., the standard errors were extremely large).\n34 In robustness checks not shown here we adjusted a subset of the models for the fact that\nincome is an estimated variable using the technique developed by Murphy and Topel (1985). In\neach of the cases we tried, the adjustment had a negligible effect and made no material difference in\nour findings.\n35 With the MDF-PUMS data set we are able to consider alternative measures of county/PUMA income,\nincluding median family income, mean and median household income, and mean and median individual\nincome. The results are robust to these alternative measures.\n-26-\n\nthe NLMS data that county income has an independent effect on suicide risk holding other\nvariables, including own income, constant. Based on the specification underlying Column 3, the\nestimated coefficient on log county income per family suggest that 10% higher county income per\nfamily is associated with 3.2% higher suicide risk. As with the NLMS regressions, the presence of\na non-linear income gradient hampers the ability to directly compare the magnitude of the county\nincome effect and that of own income. However, though the linear own income specification may\nbe a misspecification, we have estimated such a specification with county income included. We\nfind that the own income effect is somewhat larger, suggesting that an increase in aggregate income\nwould reduce aggregate suicide risk.36\nColumns 4 and 5 shows the results when we allow the coefficient on county income to\ndiffer by gender (Column 4) or by race (Column 5), as we did with the NLMS regressions in\nColumns 4 and 5 of Table 4. As in the NLMS results, the positive county income effect is larger for\nfemales than for males, though the difference here is not statistically significant. In terms of race,\nother races have the largest county income coefficient followed by whites. This differs from the\nNLMS results in which only whites had a statistically significant county income effect. The\ndifference is likely due to the small number of observations in the NLMS for non-whites, resulting\nin very large standard errors for the county income effect for non-whites.\n5.6 MDF-PUMS Robustness Check and Extensions\nTo assess whether the MDF-PUMS baseline results discussed above could be prone to\nomitted variable bias due to the omission of some of the important control variables that we\nincluded in the NLMS regressions but did not have available for the MDF-PUMS regressions, we\nalso estimated a parallel NLMS regression containing exactly the same set of variables that are\n36 The estimated coefficients on county income and own income are 0.25 and -0.37, respectively,\nand both are significant at below the 5% level. The full results of this specification are available\nupon request.\n-27-\n\navailable in the MDF-PUMS. The side-by-side results of our baseline MDF-PUMS logit regression\nand the parallel NLMS Cox proportional hazards regression are shown in Table 6. Both regressions\ncontain log own family income; dummy variables for income brackets (defined using the same cut-\noffs in terms of 1990 dollars); dummy variables for sex, race, age, and marital status; and state fixed\neffects. The NLMS regression also includes year fixed effects; the MDF-PUMS sample is a 1990\ncross-section, so the intercept captures any 1990 fixed effect. Both samples exclude Hispanics (for\nreasons discussion earlier).\nThe results are very similar across the two data sets. Both data sets indicate that suicide risk\nis significantly lower for females and non-whites. Both indicate that individuals under 35 years old\nhave lower suicide risk than those over 55, but the NLMS points to a monotonic reduction in suicide\nrisk with age, while the MDF-PUMS suggests an inverted-U age profile.37 Both data sets also\nindicate that suicide risk is lowest for married persons, followed by single ornever-married, and then\ndivorced or widowed (which are combined in the NLMS due to data constraints).\nThe key result of Table 6, though, is that the coefficient on (log) county income in the\nMDF-PUMS logit regression of 0.317, is remarkably close to the coefficient of 0.275 from the\nparallel NLMS regression. Both are statistically significant at the 5% level. The MDF-PUMS\ncoefficient implies that a 10% higher county income is associated with a 3.17% increase in suicide\nrisk; the NLMS coefficient suggests a 2.75% increase. Recall that the coefficient from our preferred\nNLMS regression – Column 4 of Table 2 – is 0.596. The coefficient from that same specification\nplus state fixed effects is 0.390 (Column 2 of Table 3). Thus, based on these patterns from the\nNLMS results, it appears that the omission of some potentially important control variables in the\nMDF-PUMS regressions is likely to lead to a downward bias on the coefficient on county income.\nIn other words, the 0.317 estimated coefficient is likely a lower bound on the true effect of county\n37 It is worth noting that studies using subjective survey data have tended to find that\nsubjective well-being is U-shaped in age (e.g., Blanchflower and Oswald 2004), consistent with the\ninverted-U age profile for suicide found in the MDF-PUMS.\n-28-\n\nincome.\nThe final component of our analysis exploits the greater detail and sample size in the MDF-\nPUMS to consider the importance of more narrowly-defined reference groups for relative income\ncomparisons. Table 7 reports results from introducing different reference income values computed\nover various reference subgroups. Column 1 repeats the baseline results from Table 5. Column 2\nreplaces the log of income per family within the same county with the log of income per family\nwithin the same county and the same age group. Column 3 uses log of income per family within the\nsame county and the same race. The results suggest that, while others in one’s county or others of\nthe same race in one’s county are relevant reference groups, others in the same age range in one’s\ncounty may be the most relevant reference group.\n6. Additional Considerations and Future Research\nUsing individual level data on suicide risk, we find compelling evidence in support of the\nidea that individuals care not only about their own income but also about the income of others in\ntheir local area. This finding is obtained using two separate and independent data sets, suggesting\nthat it is not an artifact of the particular sample design of either data set. Importantly, the finding is\nrobust to alternative specifications and we are not able to explain it by geographic variation in\nsuicide misclassification, cost of living, or access to emergency medical care.\nIt is also worth noting that other plausible stories of potential bias that we cannot test or rule\nout with our data generally imply a downward bias on our key county income variable. For\ninstance, previous research has shown that psychiatric services are positively correlated with county\nincome (Zimmerman and Bell 2006). This positive correlation combined with the possibility that\nthe quality of local mental health care negatively affects suicide hazard implies a possible\ndownward bias on county income’s effect on suicide. Another possibility is that individuals are\nmobile and endogenously select their county of residence in response to their income relative to the\n-29-\n\ncounty’s average (assuming, perhaps unrealistically, that individuals can obtain the same income\nwhen they move). This would suggest that suicide outcomes underestimate the true relevance of\ninterpersonal income comparisons because individuals are able avoid the negative utility impact of\nlow relative income by simply moving to a location where they have higher relative income.\nAnother possible story is that county income shocks may be correlated with unobserved non-income\ncounty shocks that reduce the general well-being of county residents and hence increase suicide\nrisk. For instance, a local plant closing might both reduce average household income in the county\nand lead to other negative county-wide outcomes (reduced local tax revenues and public services,\nreduced social capital, etc.) that are unobserved and reduce utility of individuals in the county,\nhence increasing suicide risk. Luttmer (2005) investigates this possibility in the context of reported\nhappiness by instrumenting for actual county income with county income predicted from national\ntrends and county level occupation and industry composition. He finds very little difference\nbetween the OLS and IV results, suggesting such unobserved county shocks are not quantitatively\nsignificant. More generally, any story involving classical measurement error in our reference group\nincome measures (relative to the unobserved true reference income) will imply attenuation bias\n(toward zero).\nFinally, regarding the proportional hazards estimations, a common concern in such survival\nanalysis is attenuation bias from unobserved individual heterogeneity. The concern is that\nindividuals with especially negative individual effects (“frailty” in the parlance of survival\nanalysis)–i.e., the θ term in our theoretical model–are more likely to exit the sample early via\ni\nsuicide; since there are no observations from these individuals for the remaining years of the\nsample, they receive less weight than survivors in the estimation, hence underestimating the effects\nof all variables on exit probability. Again, though, this bias only argues that the true effect of\nreference group income is in fact larger than what we find.\nOur results confirm those obtained in semiaggregate analysis (Daly and Wilson 2006) on\n-30-\n\ngroup suicide risk and income dispersion and also are broadly consistent with results using\nhappiness surveys. The finding that suicide risk, holding own income constant, increases in\nreference income holds for reference groups ranging from simple geographic areas to near\nneighbors (evaluated as living in the same county and having one demographic marker in common)\nto simple geographical areas like county, with some evidence that age is particularly relevant for\ncomparisons. State appears to be too broad as a measure of reference group. This finding is notable\nsince many previous papers investigating relative income or relative deprivation have been forced to\nrely on state- or higher-level aggregates as reference groups (e.g., Blanchflower and Oswald 2004;\nKennedy, et al. 1996; and Kaplan, et al. 1996).\nThis paper has focused on static interpersonal income comparisons. Models of this kind are\nknown by various names such as “external habit formation” and “Keeping Up with the Joneses”.\nFuture research using suicide data may consider dynamic models of preferences such as “internal\nhabit formation” or “Catching Up with the Joneses”. The evidence in this paper regarding the\nusefulness of suicide data for evaluating the nature of the utility function and preferences suggests\nthat such research could indeed be fruitful.\n-31-\n\nReferences\nAbel, Andrew B. “Asset Prices under Habit Formation and Catching up with the Joneses.”\nAmerican Economic Review, May 1990, 80(2), pp. 38-42.\nAlesina, Alberto, Rafael Di Tella, and Robert J.

Construction of Geographic Aggregates\nThis appendix describes the construction of the geographic aggregate variables used in this\nstudy.\nThe county income data are based on the Census Bureau’s Summary Table Files, SF-3,\nfrom the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses. Note that income values reported in the 1980,\n1990, and 2000 decennial censuses refer to income levels in 1979, 1989, and 1999, respectively.\nWe measure county income for non-census years using the following interpolation procedure: (1)\nFor each state and year, calculate the percentage deviation between that year’s growth rate in Gross\nState Product (GSP) and the average (annualized) growth rate from T to T+10, for T = 1979, 1989,\n1999; (2) Compute the average growth rate in county income from T to T+10; (3) Compute an\nestimated growth rate in county income as this 10-year average plus the percentage deviation from\naverage in the county’s state, as computed in step (2); (4) starting with county income in year T,\ncompute county income in years T+1,...,T+9 using this estimated annual growth rate. This method\npreserves county differences in average growth over each decade but forces each county in a state to\nhave parallel time series deviations from its decadal trend. Lastly, these nominal income levels\nwere deflated to constant 1990 dollars using the CPI-U price index.\nIn some regressions, we control for county-level cost of housing. Quality-adjusted house\nprice indices are not available at the county level, so we constructed a hedonic house price index\nusing data from the 1990 and 2000 PUMS data. The PUMS contains household-level data on house\nmarket value and numerous housing characteristics. The finest level of geographic detail in these\ndata is the household’s “Public-Use Microdata Area” (PUMA). Using the 1990 sample, we\nregressed log house value on PUMA fixed effects and a rich array of dummy variables covering all\npossible values of the housing characteristics variables, for all owner-occupied housing.38 The\n38 The housing characteristics were property acreage, condo status, kitchen status, number\n-- 37 --\n\nestimated PUMA fixed effects represent a constant-quality house price index for 1990. We used the\nestimated coefficients on the housing characteristics, each of which represents the percentage effect\nof the characteristic on house values, and the 2000 PUMS data on housing characteristics to obtain\nout-of-sample predicted house values for the 2000 PUMS observations. Averaging the difference\nbetween actual and predicted house value across households within PUMA yields a constant-quality\nhouse price index for 2000. The 2000 values are converted to 1990 dollars using the CPI-U. We\nuse 1990 and 2000 PUMA-to-County mapping files from the Census Bureau to convert the real\nhouse price index from PUMA-level to County-level.39 We obtain values for years 1979 to 1998\n(the NLMS sample range) via linear interpolation and extrapolation from the 1990 and 2000 values.\n(Since the index represents the logarithm of real constant-quality housing values, linear\ninterpolation amounts to assuming a constant within-county growth rate.)\nFinally, we merge in data from the Census Bureau’s Summary Table Files on shares of\ncounty population by race (white, black, other) and by broad age group (<20, 20-64, 65+).\nof rooms, plumbing status, age of building, number of units in building, and number of bedrooms.\n39 Counties that contain multiple PUMAs got the population-weighted average of those\nPUMAs’ index values; counties that shared a PUMA with other counties were all assigned that\nPUMA’s fixed effect.\n-- 38 --\n\nAPPENDIX B\nTABLE B1\nSummary Statistics of Model Variables (NLMS)\nVariable Mean S.D.

    "text": "FINAL\nGood Intentions\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUneven Outcomes in the Labor Market Conference\nVirtual Presentation\nFebruary 4, 2021\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nAuthor’s Note:\nThis speech is a reflection of my experiences and my learning. It is by definition imperfect. But in our\nimperfection, we must still do our part and participate in the conversations it will take to make\nprogress on racial equity. I will continue learning from and with all those committed to equity for all.\n“You don’t even know what I’m capable of”\nAbout 40 years ago, I found myself sitting in a coffee shop, waiting to\nhave a conversation with one of my students. We’d just finished a semester at\nthe University of Missouri—Kansas City. I was her peer teacher, leading\nreview sessions for the History of Science—a required course.\nI’d done the job for only one term, but I loved it. Loved teaching, loved\nhelping, loved the students—all one hundred-plus of them.\nSo when the semester came to an end, I couldn’t wait to see my\nevaluations. They were great—one after another giving me high marks and\nexpressing thanks. I remember feeling this tremendous sense of pride—like\nmaybe I had found my calling. 1\n\nFINAL\nBut as I got close to the end of the stack, I came across one that was\nunexpected. In the margin of the form, handwritten in pen, someone had\ncommented: “I wonder if Mary is a racist.”\nI kept staring at it, thinking it was a joke. One of those ironic puns that\nsays the opposite of what is true. But it wasn’t. It was an actual question,\nwritten by one of my students.\nFortunately, even though the evaluations were anonymous, the student\nhad signed her name. I knew her, had talked with her many times.\nSo after a few breaths, I decided to reach out.\nThat’s how I found myself sitting in a coffee shop, waiting to have a\nconversation that felt both perplexing and worrisome.\nIt was a hard meeting, for both of us. But we talked, a lot. Here is what I\nlearned.\nThe young woman was one of two Black students in my class that year.\nThey were friends. They had come to me together at the beginning of the\nsemester, just to check in. They shared that they’d gone to the high school\nnear campus. I’d heard of the school. It was thought to be a tough ride—\nlimited resources, lots of disruptions, low academic performance. They were\nworried that the History of Science, a hard class, was a high bar for their first\nsemester.\nI empathized with them. I had struggled with the class in my first term.\nSo I sprang into action. I thought about what I could do to make sure they\nsucceeded. I made a plan, spent extra time, and worked to build their\nconfidence.\n2\n\nFINAL\nHere’s what it looked like to them. I didn’t push. I gave them easier\nassignments. I congratulated them for minor successes. I held them to a\ndifferent—lower—standard than I set for the rest of the class.\nThey felt it, every time—like a cut. And after a semester of me doing\nthis, they did not feel confident. They felt unseen, skipped over. They\nwondered if maybe I was a racist.\nWhy wouldn’t they? For a whole semester, my students had observed\nthe way I treated them, and how different it was from the standard I set for\nthe rest of the class. I had used the information they had shared with me,\nabout where they went to school, as an unintentional weapon against them.\nLooking back, I see I was caught up in my own experience. I never asked\nthem what I could do to be helpful. I just jumped in. I assumed I knew what\nthey needed based on a few facts about their background. I let my good\nintentions—and the feeling of doing good—be my metric for success.\nI remember this like it was yesterday. My student, her untouched coffee,\nthe look on her face when she said, “I thought you understood me. You don’t\neven know what I’m capable of.”\nThe tyranny of good intentions\nI failed in my responsibility to those students. But this story is not\nunique to me. It happens every day—with all of us. We think we know what is\nask\nbest for people. We want to do something to contribute. So we move in\nquickly, to fix, solve, or soothe before we ever bother to .\nIt’s the tyranny of good intentions. And it allows assumptions and biases\nto drive our behavior.\n3\n\nFINAL\nThe fact that I’d done this—that I had judged my students’ abilities\nbased on their background—devastated me. I entered college with a GED after\ndropping out of high school at age 15. So many times, well-intentioned people\nassumed they knew me—what I could do, what I needed, what I could be.\nAlways a little less than what I had hoped for. And each time, it pained me—\ndiscouraged me. Until one day it didn’t—because someone looked past where\nI had come from and saw me for what I wanted to be.\nBut that’s the insidious thing about biases. They’re so deeply rooted in\nus, we don’t even realize we’re perpetuating them. It doesn’t matter how\nmany times we’ve seen them or been victims of them—they repeat. Until\neventually, they become our “truth.”\nAnd I end up asking less of my two Black students from a low-income\nhigh school. And all of us settle for persistent gaps—between Blacks and\nWhites, men and women, rural and urban dwellers, those with and without\nadvantage. Gaps that feel familiar, maybe inevitable, definitely embedded. So\nless\nthat even when we know aptitude, interest, and talent aren’t the privilege of a\nfew, we see difference as deficiency. We see others as .\nAgainst that picture, good intentions seem good enough.\nThe practice of equity\nAfter the coffee, I went home and did what you might expect. I vowed\nnot to repeat the same mistakes. I took classes, did anti-bias training, filled out\ncountless workbooks.\nWhat I learned is that the practice of equity requires accountability. And\nit takes work.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThe fact is, humans have biases. Some, like unconscious biases, are\nimpossible to completely eliminate. So we have to be intentional. We have to\ndevelop practices, behaviors, habits, and policies that minimize the impact of\nbiases on our decisions. We also have to put down our armor of good\nintentions and own the outcomes, whether we meant to cause them or not.\nAnd this is the hardest part of practicing equity: it takes humility. We\nhave to be willing to see ourselves, and the world around us, through the eyes\nof others.\nAccepting the difference between impact and intent takes continuous\ncommitment. It also takes courage, to have hard conversations again and\nagain. To listen, with curiosity, even when it feels bad. And to take what we\nlearn and make practical change.\nOnly then we will be accountable for our impact. Only then can we really\nmake a difference.\nAm I a racist?\nWhen I think back on that conversation with my student, I feel grateful.\nShe was brave. And I learned.\nBut I also feel responsible—for making sure that people and their\npotential are seen. That they don’t have to fight for attention or prove that\nOf course not.\nthey deserve it.\nFor most of us, “Am I a racist?” feels easy to answer. It’s\nalmost reflexive.\n5\n\nFINAL\nBut the question isn’t about that. It is about asking whether each day, we\nthey\nare equitably and intentionally giving people an opportunity, seeing their\npotential as boundless, and doing whatever need to see that through.\nlift\nPeople rise or fall to our expectations. And in this, we have the power to\n.\nMy students wanted me to believe in them. To validate that they\nbelonged and treat them like that was true. We all have that ability—to see\nothers as equals and to invest, mentor, and support.\nThe question is: will we use it?\nAchieving equity in our society is an audacious goal—and it is long\noverdue. It will require systemic change that fundamentally alters the\ninstitutions we’ve built. But it will also require us.\nInstitutions are simply mirrors. They reflect who we are and who we\nwant to be. If we change, so will they. So today, let’s begin. One person at a\ntime. Starting with me. Starting with you.\n6",

We study potential explanations for this phenomenon. After making adjustments for\nthe difference in the cost of living across provinces, we find that some of the inequality in real\nwages could be attributed to differences in quality of labor, industry composition, labor supply\nelasticities,andgeographicallocationofprovinces. Thesefactors,takentogether,explainabout\nhalf of the cross-province real wage difference. Interestingly, we find that inter–province redis-\ntribution did not help offset regional inequality during our sample period. We also demonstrate\nthat inter–province migration, while driven in part by levels and changes in wage differences\nacrossprovinces, doesnotoffsetthesedifferences. Theseresultsimplythatcross-provincelabor\nmarket mobility in China is still limited, which contributes to the persistence of cross-province\nwage differences.\nJEL classification: I3, J4, O5, R1\nKey words: inequality, China\n∗Contact: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 101 Market St., MS1130, San Francisco, CA 94105.\ngalina.b.hale@sf.frb.org.

Inthispaper, weanalyzethepatterns\nand causes of persistent regional inequality in China.\nChina presents a unique and important opportunity to study regional inequality. In terms of\nincome, China is a very unequal country.1 According to World Bank estimates, China’s income\nGini coefficient far exceeds that of South Asian countries such as India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.\nIncome differences in China are large both inter– and intra–regionally, with inter–regional differ-\nences increasing over time (Fujita and Hu, 2001; Kanbur and Zhang, 1999). China is also a country\nin transition, altering its institutions and economy at a rapid pace but with considerable variation\nacross provinces.2\nAlthough most of the research on Chinese inequality has focused on the urban-rural income gap,\nrecentstudieshaveexaminedregionalinequality. Forexample, KanburandZhang(2005)construct\nlong time series of regional inequality and show that it is explained, in different periods of time, by\nthe share of heavy industry (which we also find), the degree of decentralization, and the degree of\nopenness. In a recent paper, Wan, Lu, and Chen (2007) show that increasing globalization, uneven\ndomestic capital accumulation, and privatization contribute to regional inequality in China, while\nthe effects of location, urbanization and the dependency ratio have been declining. Yao and Zhang\n(2001)demonstratethatthereisdivergencebetweengroups(orclubs)ofChineseprovincesinterms\nof real per capita GDP. Meng, Gregory, and Want (2005) argue that discontinued provision of free\neducation, housing, and medical care, as well as increased uncertainty increased the incidence of\nurban poverty when measured in terms of expenditure. Xia, Song, Shi, and Appleton (2013) find\nthat reforms of the state sector have contributed to urban wage inequality across regions. In our\n1Persistent and even growing cross–region inequality in China during the reform period has been documented in\nthe past (Jian, Sachs, and Warner, 1996; Chen and Fleisher, 1996).\n2For the survey of regional inequalities in transition economies, see Huber (2006).\n2\n\npaper we take it a step further to understand the relationship between the persistence of regional\ninequality and labor movement.\nSome researchers argue that persistent inequalities in income are the result of unmeasured off-\nsetting factors that work to equalize well–being across regional agents (Rice and Venables, 2003).\nIn our study we find, not surprisingly, that cost–of–living differences are, indeed, an important\noffsetting factor. Thus, we adjust average nominal wage in each province by province–specific CPI\nto obtain average real wage. We find, however, that even in terms of real wage cross-province\ninequality in China is large and persistent.\nWe analyze factors that might explain this persistent inequality, such as the quality of labor,\nwhich we proxy by measures of education level in each province; labor productivity, which we\nproxy by the industrial composition in each province; labor supply elasticity, which we measure as\na share of agricultural population in the province; access to export markets, which we measure as\nthe size and presence of large sea ports in the province;3 cross–province government transfers. We\nfind that, with the exception of government transfers, all these factors help explain a substantial\nportion of wage differentials. Nevertheless, about half of the variance in real wages across provinces\nremains after controlling for these factors.\nDuring our sample period from 1993 to 2011, the restrictions on migration resulting from the\nsystem of permanent registration (hukou) are being gradually relaxed, if not de jure, then de facto\n(Bao, Bodvarsson, Hou, and Zhao, 2011).4 It is, therefore, natural to expect that such persistent\nunexplained difference in real wages across provinces would generate cross-province migration.\nUsing the summary data from 2000 and 2010 population censuses we find that cross–province\nmigration in the second half of the 1990s and the second half of 2000s is indeed partly driven by\nreal wage differences and by differences in growth rates of real wages.\nEven though cross-province migration is partly driven by wage differences, it still appears quite\nlimited. In particular, migration flows do not seem to reduce regional inequality, once we control\nfor factors that we find to affect wage inequality. This suggests that the migration is still quite\n3Muchoftheliteratureemphasizesinland-coastaldifferences. However,asdemonstratedinCandelaria,Daly,and\nHale (2009), it is the presence of a large port that makes all the difference, not simply the presence of the coastline.\n4We briefly describe China’s migration policies in Section 2.\n3\n\nconstrained by the remaining barriers. This finding is consistent with the literature. Chan and\nBuckingham (2008) argue that recent reforms of the hukou system did not make migration any\neasier, but may in fact further reduced mobility, especially between rural and urban population.\nWhalley and Zhang (2007) calibrate the effect of removal of the hukou system and show that the\nresulting reduction in regional inequality is sizable, indicating that such removal has not occurred\nyet. More recently, Bao, Bodvarsson, Hou, and Zhao (2011) show empirically that migration is still\nvery sensitive to hukou constraints, even in 2000-05, although the sensitivity has declined relative\nto 1995-2000.\nTaken together, our results indicate that regional inequality is likely to persist in China for\nquite some time, since it is due to structural and long–term factors such as education, industry\ncomposition, regional labor supply, and geographical location. While further removing barriers\nto labor mobility may alleviate some of the regional wage differences, it is likely to be a slow\nprocess, because it needs to be accompanied by urban development.5 In the meantime, cross–\nprovince income redistribution may be useful to address social and economic tensions that regional\ninequality can bring. Our study finds that in the period of consideration inter–province transfers\ndid not help offset regional wage differences.\nThe paper is organized as follows: We begin by describing the policies that restrict labor move-\nment in China in Section 2. We describe our data and recent trends in Section 3. In Section 4 we\npresent the results of our empirical analysis. We conclude in Section 5.\n2 Migration policy in modern China\nIn1958,MaoZedongsetupanhereditaryresidencypermit(Hukou)systemdefiningwherepeople\ncould work. This system classifies individuals as either “rural” or “urban” workers and assigned\nthem to a specific geographic area.

For longer than one-month stay and especially\n5Chan (2009) argues that the hukou system is a major obstacle to China’s development.\n4\n\nwhenseekinglocalemployment,onemustapplyandbeapprovedforatemporaryresidentialpermit.\nViolators are subject to fines, detention, and forced repatriation (partially relaxed in 2003).6\nThe main impact of the hukou system is on rural–to–urban mobility, which explains an extraor-\ndinary low degree of urbanization in China (Chan and Zhang, 1999). In addition to limiting the\nrural–to–urban migration of the workers, this system limited migration across regions: migrants\nwould need to obtain registration in the new area before they could be allowed to work legally.\nBecause of bureaucracy and red tape, obtaining registration could take months or years. Hence,\nthe migration process in China was in many ways similar to the migration process across national\nborders.\nUntil 1978, the system was enforced rather strictly: police would periodically round up those\nwithout valid residence permit, place them in detention centers, and expel them from cities. After\nChinese market reforms began in 1978, a private sector appeared. Unlike state-owned enterprizes\n(SOEs), private firms frequently do not require registration from potential employees. Economic\nreforms created pressures to encourage migration from the interior to the coast and provided in-\ncentives for officials not to enforce regulations on migration. However, even if migrants are hired\nwithout the registration, they would not have access to social services such as child care, schools,\nor health care.\nForced repatriation rules were still in place after the beginning of market reforms. In fact,\nthe 1982 “Measures of Detaining and Repatriating Floating and Begging People in the Cities”\nstreamlined the relevant legislation. It was not until 2003, after the tragic incident in Guangzhou,\nwhere a Hubei resident was beaten to death in jail in the process of repatriation, and the outcry\nthat followed, that the repatriation law was relaxed. “Measures on Managing and Assisting Urban\nHomeless Beggars without Income” adopted on June 20, 2003, established new rules governing the\nhandling and assisting of destitute migrants. Many cities, including the most controlled Beijing\nmunicipality, decided soon after that hukou–less migrants must be dealt with more care; they are\nno longer automatically subject to detention, fines, or forced repatriation, unless they have become\nhomeless, paupers, or criminals.\n6This information and some of what follows in this section is partly quoted from Wang (2005). For more detail,\nsee Wang (2004).\n5\n\nWhile recent reforms made it easier for migrants to survive without hukou, they did not make\nit easier to obtain one. Thus, many people, especially those with families, are hesitant to perma-\nnently change their location. Moreover, fees charged for temporary residency permits, while fairly\naffordable, add to the cost of moving. Nevertheless, according to the census data, in 2000 almost\n30 percent of the population was residing in a province other than the one in which they had their\nhukou.\nThere has been more progress in reforming the hukou system at the provincial level than at\nthe national level. Between 2001 and 2007, a number of provinces adopted various measures,\nmostly addressing the rural–urban migration limitations. These measures ranged from changing\nthe administration of the hukou system to completely abolishing the differences between rural and\nurban hukou.7\nForthepurposeofourproject, wehavetorecognizethatthebarrierstocross–provincemigration\nin China still exist but were weakening throughout our sample period. Moreover, we have to take\ninto account the fact that the progress of reform was uneven across provinces.\n3 Data\nIn this section, we describe our data sources for inequality, explanatory variables, and migration.\nWe also describe recent trends and patterns in regional inequality and migration.\n3.1 Inequality and related data\nWe use national and provincial level data that are reported in the China Statistical Yearbook.\nThis annual publication is compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics of China and is published\nby the China Statistics Press. In conjunction with these data, we also use CEIC Data’s “China\nPremium Database” because it provides time series of the data in the China Statistical Yearbook.\nUsing these sources, we construct an annual data sample from 1993 to 2011, covering a period of\nfast economic growth in China. Due to data limitations, not all series have coverage for the entire\n7See“RecentChineseHukouReforms”publishedbytheCongressionalExecutiveCommissiononChina,accessed\nat http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/Residency/hreform.php in October 2007.\n6\n\nperiod.\nTable A.1 provides definitions and Table A.2 gives summary statistics for the variables we use\nin this paper. Because of the high level of economic growth in China, the variables are trending\nfor all the provinces; thus, for measures of inequality, we express the majority of our variables\nin terms of percentage deviation from the country average. In doing so, we obtain unit–free,\ncommontrend–free,comparablevariablesforalltheprovinces. Thevariablesthatarenotexpressed\nin percentage deviation are berth capacity, inter-provincial migration, and rural–to–urban intra–\nprovincial migration.\nIn 1997 the city of Chongqing in Sichuan province was raised to a status of provincial city,\nresulting in the creation of a new province and also affecting all the population–based statistics for\nthe Sichuan province. Moreover, since Chongqing was the largest and wealthiest part of Sichuan,\naverage income in the Sichuan province was also affected through a composition change. We take\ntwoapproachestodealingwithChongqing: weeitherdropSichuanandChongqingfromoursample,\nor we construct weighted averages of variables for Chongqing and Sichuan after 1997. Measures of\ninequality are weighted by population. In the rest of the paper, we present the results which treat\nChongqing and Sichuan as a combined province, but our results do not change if we exclude both\nof them.\nWe omit the provinces of Hubei and Tibet from our data sample. Hubei has been excluded\nbecause of the vast relocation of residents due to construction of the Three Gorges dam beginning\nin December of 1994. We do not include Tibet due to a lack of a CPI index that extends back\nto 1993. Because of this, we cannot construct real measures of key variables that are used in our\nanalysis. With the omission of Hubei and Tibet, and the combination of Chongqing and Sichuan\ninto a single province, we have a data set with a total of 28 provinces.\n3.2 Migration data\nWe use migration data that is collected by the National Bureau of Statistics of China and\ncompiled by China Data Online. The data we use come from the 2000 and 2010 population\ncensuses, which measure migration between 1995 and 2000 (2000 census), and between 2005 and\n7\n\n2010 (2010 census). To our advantage, the 2000 data provide information not only on the province\nof origin and destination, but also the area within each province that the migrant came from and\nwent to. This is especially useful to track patterns of migration such as the movement of people\nfrom rural to urban areas—both intra– and inter–provincially.8\nIn both censuses, individuals 5 years of age or older were asked if in the census year they resided\nin a different subcounty-level unit than that in which they lived five years prior. If an individual\nmoved his hukou to the new location or he resided in the new location for more than six months,\nhe was counted as a migrant. While the migration data includes in-migration to Chinese provinces\nfrom Hong Kong, Macau, and abroad, we exclude these numbers from our analysis.\n3.3 Trends in inter–province inequality\nWe now turn to the description of the trends and patterns in our data. Figure 1 shows median\naverage levels of disposable income for urban and rural households and for urban households in\ndifferentsubgroupsofprovinces. Onecanimmediatelyseethegrowinggapbetweenurbanandrural\nincome that was much discussed in the literature. We can also see large differences in urban income\nacross provinces, especially between coastal and inland provinces, as has also been discussed in the\nliterature. As Caballero, Candelaria, and Hale (2009) show, for coastal provinces, the presence of\na large commercial port is important.\nIn this paper we leave aside the important rural-urban inequality, since it is well studied in\nthe existing literature, and focus on inter-provincial inequality in urban income. We have some\nconcerns about the accuracy of disposable income data at the provincial level and therefore for the\nrest of the paper we focus on the average wage data. Average wage data is not reported separately\nfor rural and urban households, but the detailed description of these series (see Table A.1) suggests\nthat most of the input into average wage comes from the urban wages. We, therefore, frame the\nrest of the paper as an analysis of inter-provincial inequality in urban income.\nUnlike most countries, China provides province by province consumer price index (CPI) data.\nWe take advantage of this fact to calculate real wages using individual province CPI, which allows\n8See Fan (2005) and Lavely (2001) for a detailed discussion of 2000 migration data.\n8\n\nus to account for differences in cost of living in different provinces. Figure 2 depicts the coefficient\nof variation of nominal and real wages across provinces as a measures of cross-province inequality.\nWe can see that rapid increase in urban wage dispersion from 1990 to 2001 followed by a gradual\ndecline. Figure 2 also shows that part of the measured inequality in wages disappears once we\naccount for the cost of living. For example, in 2002 the coefficient of variation of nominal wage\nacrossprovinceswas0.34, whilethecoefficientofvariationofrealwagewas0.26. Becauserealwage\ninequality and not nominal wage inequality is economically important, we continue our analysis in\nterms of average real wage. In terms of real wage, we also see a rapid increase in cross-province\ninequality from 1990 to 1999, followed by a very small decline from 2006 to 2011.\nDespite some decline in cross-province inequality in recent years, it remains very large, even in\nreal terms. At the end of our sample period, the coefficient of variation of real wage is over 0.22,\nwhich means the standard deviation of the real wage across provinces is almost a quarter of the\nmean real wage.\n3.4 Patterns in inter–province migration\nWe now describe trends in the migration patterns in China. We focus on the migration that took\nplace between 1995 and 2000, and between 2005 and 2010, using information from the 2000 and\n2010 population censuses.\nForthe2010censusdataweobservetotalmigrationwithinandacrossprovinces. The2000census\ndata is more detailed. We have emigration (out-migration) from each province broken down into\nrural and urban migrants. The urban migrants are those coming from the sub-county level units of\nneighborhood committee of the town and street. The rural migrants are the migrating population\nfrom townships and village committees of the town. With respect to immigration (in-migration),\nwe are able to classify migrants as entering a town, city, or county. We broadly define city and\ntown as an urban region and county as a rural region.9\nA large part of migration took place within provinces, with population moving from rural to\n9Chan and Hu (2003) include an appendix of major points in defining urban population for the 2000 census. In\nthis appendix they state that urban population of China consists of City and Town population.\n9\n\nurban areas. Thirty five percent of the intra-province migrating population moved from rural to\nurban areas in 1995-2000.10 Inter–province migration was also important, with 76 percent of all\ninter–provincial migrants going into urban areas and almost none going to rural areas.\nTablesA.3aandA.3breportmigrationforallprovincesbetween1995and2000andbetween2005\nand 2010, respectively, both cross–province and rural-to-urban migration within the province, in\nlevels and as a percent of host province population in 1997 and 2007, respectively. Not surprisingly,\nthe provincial cities of Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the Guandong province that is adjacent\nto Hong Kong, attracted the most cross–province migrants as a share of their population in both\ntime periods. We also note that coastal provinces tended to attract more cross–province migrants\nthan inland provinces as a share of their population. Trends in intra–provincial migration are more\ndifficult to identify. For intra–province migration, the variance in rural–to–urban intra–province\nmigration across provinces is much smaller than that of the cross–province migration. We also note\nthat within province migration increased substantially from 2.7 percent to 6.1 percent between\nthe 2000 and 2010 census periods, indicating that, indeed, some relaxation of hukou controls was\nhappening.\n4 What explains persistent inter–province inequality in China\nInthissectionwestudyexplanationsforpersistentinter–provinceinequality. Webeginbystudy-\ning the effects of quality of labor, industry composition, government transfers, and geographical\nfactors. We then turn to the analysis of cross–province migration patterns and test whether inter–\nprovince migration is driven, at least in part, by wage differences and whether it, in turn, helps\noffset some of these differences. We conduct our analysis using the average wages adjusted by\nprovince-specific CPI, which we refer to as real wages.\n10Someofthesenumbersarenotreflectingactualmovingofthepopulation,buttheannexofruralareasbycities.\nFor statistical purposes, however, this is identical to actual migration.\n10\n\n4.1 Reasons for real-wage inequality\nWe begin with a measure of the quality of human capital that may explain differences in real\nwages. Since we do not have a direct measure of labor quality, we use two different measures\nof education level in the province to proxy for the quality of labor. If observed differences in\nwages are fully explained by differences in labor quality, there is no reason to believe that such\ndifferences should go away. We then consider industry composition in the provinces. Because labor\nproductivity may be higher in some industries, industry composition will affect average wage in\nthe province. While we would expect labor to move to the industries where it is more productive,\nstructural changes in the economy take a long time to complete and thus inequality that is due to\nindustrycompositionisexpectedtobepersistent. Next, wetestwhetherthelaborsupplyelasticity,\nas measured by the share of agricultural population in the province, explains wage differences. If\nmigration across provinces is constrained, we would expect wages to be higher in provinces with\nlower share of potentially available labor that is currently employed in agriculture. We also test\nwhether some of the wage differentials across provinces are offset by transfers from the central\ngovernment. Finally, we test whether access to export markets, as measured by total commercial\nship berth capacity in the province, explains wage differences. Since access to the sea cannot be\nchanged and port capacity can only be changed slowly, real wage differences that are due to such\ngeographical factors are likely to be persistent.\nTheresultsofthisanalysisarereportedinTable1. Thefirsttwocolumnspresentourresultswith\nrespect to measures of education level in each province. In the first column we measure education\nlevel as a number of college graduates per capita, and in the second column we use real government\nexpenditures on education per capita. We can see that both measures indicate that higher levels of\neducation are associated with higher average real wages. We can also see from the adjusted R2 that\nthe first measure explains 26 percent of standard deviation in real wages across provinces, while\nthe second measure explains 66 percent, although there is a possibility that there is some spurious\ncorrelation in case of government expenses on education — provinces that are wealthy for whatever\nreason are likely to have higher wages and more expenditure on education.11 For this reason, and\n11Note the sample difference between the two columns. They are due to the fact that education expenditure data\nare only available starting 1999.\n11\n\nbecause of sample limitation in the case of the second measure, we will use the first measure as a\ncontrol variable in the tests that follow. Moreover, the first measure seems to be more relevant, as\nit measures the contemporaneous level of college education in the province.\nColumns (3) and (4) of Table 1 use different measures of industrial composition — employment\nshares of secondary and tertiary industries (primary being a base category) and the share of agri-\ncultural population. We find that higher shares of primary and tertiary industries, which tend to\nhave larger labor productivity, are associated with higher real wage and explain about 54 percent\nof cross-province wage differences. Similarly, a higher share of agricultural population is associated\nwith lower wages and explains 44 percent of cross-province wage differences.\nColumn (5) estimates a correlation between real wages and transfers from federal to provincial\nbudgets. We find that there is no such correlation; that is, Chinese government is neither creating\nnor smoothing cross-province wage differences.\nFinally, results reported in column (6) of Table 1 demonstrate that the provinces with larger\ncommercial ports, as measured by their commercial berth capacity, tend to have higher wages.\nThis is likely to be partly driven by export platforms in these provinces, which partly are owned by\nforeign companies and tend to pay higher wages, at least to skilled workers (Hale and Long, 2008).\nBerth capacity, however, only explains a small portion of cross-province variation in real wages.\nIn Column (7) we include all the above controls together, even though many of them are highly\ncorrelated.12 Wecanseethattakentogethertheyexplain84percentofthecross-provincerealwage\ndifferencesifmeasuredbytheadjustedR2. Intermsofthestandarddeviationoftheresidualinthe\nlastyearofthesample, itisaboutonethirdofthestandarddeviationofrealwagesacrossprovinces\nin the same year. If we extract a first principle component from all the explanatory variables, and\ninclude that instead, we find that about 64 percent of cross-province wage differences are explain\nby this first principle component (see Column 9 of Table 1). The standard deviation of residual in\nthe last year of the sample in this case is about half of the standard deviation of real wage in the\nsame year.\nAll the regressions described above and reported in Table 1 are based on the panel data and\n12See Appendix Table A4 for correlations.\n12\n\ntherefore are identified based on time-series as well as cross-province differences. To separate the\ntwo effects we first include province fixed effects in our regressions with all controls and with the\nfirst principle component (Columns (8) and (10) of Table 1). We find that only education measures\nare significantly correlatedwith within variation inreal wages, with fixedeffectsabsorbing all other\ncross-province differences. Overall, regressions with fixed effects do not perform much better than\nregressions without. This indicates that, as we discussed above, the results are identified off of\ncross-province rather than within differences. We confirm this once again by re-estimating all the\nregressions in Table 1 with either a linear trend or with year fixed effects and find that the results\nremain almost identical.13\n4.2 Labor mobility\nBefore addressing the question of whether cross–province migration offsets some of the wage\ndifferences, we have to establish that cross–province migration is at least in part driven by wage\ndifferences. To this end, in Table 2 we test whether cross–province migration into urban areas\nbetween years t−5 and t is correlated with differences in real wages across provinces in t−5, where\nt ∈ {2000,2010} is the year of the census. Similarly, in Table 3 we test whether cross-province\nmigration between years t − 5 and t is correlated with differences in real wages in t − 10 and\ndifferences in growth rates of real wage between t−10 and t−5. In both specifications, migration\ndoesnotaffectwagedifferencesbecauseitoccursafter therealwageismeasured. Wefindthatboth\nthe level and the growth rate of real wages have positive effect on migration into urban areas of a\ngiven province from other provinces.14 These results hold even when we control for the explanatory\nvariables that we found to be important in the first part of our analysis. These results are also\nrobust to including a different intercept for the observations resulting from the later, 2010, census\nperiod.15 Not surprisingly, province fixed effects absorb the effects of the wage level, but not of\n13The results of these regressions are not reported in interest of space. The effect of linear trend is not significant\nin most regressions.\n14For comparison, Tables A.5. and A.6. provide the same analysis for rural to urban migration within provinces.\nThese results show that for the within-province migration growth rate of wages matters more than the level.\n15Even though a later period indicator does enter significantly, we chose to report benchmark regressions for\nconsistency. In the interest of space we do not report regressions with the second period dummy, but they are\navailable upon request.\n13\n\nwage growth. Importantly, two-thirds to three-quarters of variation in migration flows is explained\nby levels of and changes in real wages alone.\nCoefficients on other explanatory variables have expected signs — higher education and larger\nshare of tertiary industries attract more migrants, while higher share of agricultural population\nlower the inflow of migrants. Interestingly, share of secondary industries, while associated with\nhigherwages(SeeTable1),hasanegativeeffectonmigration. Thisshowsthatoncewagedifferences\nare accounted for, secondary industries are not particularly attractive to permanent migrants.16\nBerth capacity does not enter significantly in these regressions.\nHaving established that migration is indeed driven by wage differences, we now turn to the main\nquestion of interest — does migration offset any of the wage differences? To this end, we estimate\nthe effect of cross–province migration into urban areas between years t−5 and t on real wage in\nt+1, while controlling for our explanatory variables in t+1, where t ∈ 2000,2010 is a census year.\nThe results are reported in Table 4.17\nIncolumn(1)weseethat,farfromoffsettingwagedifferences,highermigrationisassociatedwith\nhigher real wage. This effect is spurious, however. Because real wage differences across provinces\nare highly persistent over time, migration in t−5 to t may be endogenous even with respect to\nt+1 real wages. To rule out this possibility, we add real wage in t−5 as an additional control\nvariable. As we can see from column (12), where real wage in t−5 is the only regressor, real wage\nis, indeed, highly persistent.18\nWe can see that once the real wage in t−5 control is included, migration has a much smaller\npositive effect on real wages (Column (2)) and no statistically significant effect in subsequent\nregressions that include t+1 variables that we found important in explaining real wage. Moreover,\nthe reduction in the variance of the residual is minimal to nil (compare column (2) with column\n(12)). We conclude, therefore, that cross–province migration that occurred between 1995 and\n16Note that our migration data are unlikely to include temporary migrant workers.\n17For comparison, results of similar tests for rural to urban migration within provinces are reported in Table\nA.7. The results for the within-province migration are once again very similar to those discussed below for the\ncross-province migration.\n18Alltheresultswediscussherearenotaffectedbytheinclusionofanindicatorforthelatercensussample. These\nregressions are not reported in interest of space but are available upon request.\n14\n\n2000 as well as between 2005 and 2010 did not produce any equalizing effects for real wages in\nsubsequently years. This is not particularly surprising, since, as we discussed in the Introduction\nand in Section 2, the effects of hukou system on restricting migration are still substantial and\ntherefore observed migration, although driven by real wage differences, is not sufficient to offset\nthem.\n5 Conclusion\nProvincial statistics show that regional inequality in China has been persistent in the last two\ndecades. We find that main sources of this persistence were structural and long–term factors such\nas labor quality, industrial composition, regional labor supply, and geographical location. We find\nthat inter–provincial transfers did not offset wage inequality during our sample period, and neither\ndid inter–province migration. These findings suggest that regional income inequality in China is\nnot likely to go away in the near future.\nWhile we believe that fully removing barriers to labor mobility will help reduce cross–province\nwage inequality, we are aware of the fact that urban infrastructure is unable to accommodate\nlarge inflows of new migrants. We therefore view the message of this paper as more positive than\nnormative — given the gradual nature of structural changes and urban infrastructure development,\nwe should expect that regional inequality in China will persist for quite some time.\nA policy implication of this observation is that social tensions that arise due to such inequality\nmay need to be addressed in the short run through redistribution. According to our analysis, such\nredistribution has not been present during our sample period (at least not in the measures we\nconsidered). Chinese government, however, recognizes inequality as an important problem, which\nis reflected in its most recent five–year plan.\nReferences\nBao, S., . O. B. Bodvarsson, J. W. Hou, and Y.

SSI is now the\nlargest federal means-tested program in the United States, serving a population dominated by\nlow-income adults and children with disabilities. With other forms of federal support devolving\nto state programs (e.g., welfare), policymakers pressing to redefine social expectations about\nwho should and should not work, and the Americans with Disabilities Act guaranteeing people\nwith disabilities the right to employment, the goals and design of SSI have come under scrutiny.\nIn this article we review the role that SSI has played to this point and consider the directions SSI\nmight take in a work-dominated welfare environment where people with disabilities increasingly\nwish to be included in the labor market.\n-2-\n\nLeft Behind: SSI in the Era of Welfare Reform\nIn 1974, when Supplemental Security Income (SSI) began as a program to aid the aged,\nthe blind, and individuals with disabilities who are also poor, it was relatively small, providing\nbenefits to a mostly elderly population. SSI is now the largest federal, means-tested, cash\nassistance program in the United States. In 2001 an average of 6.7 million people received\nbenefits, and federal and state expenditures for the program totaled over $32 billion. The\nmajority of SSI recipients are under 65, and the caseload is dominated by children and working-\nage adults with disabilities; only about 30 percent of recipients are elderly (see Figure 1).\nThe rapid growth of SSI and the changing composition of its beneficiaries are sufficient\nreason to explore its role in the broader structure of U.S. social welfare programs. An\nexamination is the more urgent because of the current efforts to integrate a variety of people\nwho have not worked, or were not previously expected to work, into the workforce. Since SSI\nwas established, social expectations regarding who should work and who should be entitled to\nincome support have changed dramatically. Most people are living and working longer than in\n1974; in addition, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 granted people with\ndisabilities a legal right to equal access to employment, suggesting that the aged, blind, and\ndisabled may be more likely to work than in the past.\nThe accelerating devolution of fiscal and administrative responsibility for social\nprograms to state and local governments has changed some of the dynamics driving the SSI\nprogram. SSI will clearly be affected by the changed legislative environment for social welfare\nprograms. There are now strict time limits on cash assistance and new requirements that\n-3-\n\nrecipients of public assistance, with few exceptions, work or prepare for work. What are the\nlikely interactions between SSI and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the main\ncash welfare program? Now that TANF is no longer an entitlement, and control of TANF\npolicies is largely in state hands, will the role of SSI in the social safety net change?\nOf special importance is the question of whom the program should serve. The\nboundaries separating the working-age and child populations eligible for SSI from those eligible\nfor other income-based benefits are imprecise and fluid, as we shall later show, and their\ndemarcation is a political almost as much as it is a medical decision. The persistence of high\npoverty rates among children, even during the long and robust economic expansion of the 1990s,\nsuggests that some form of income maintenance program must remain a crucial part of the social\nsafety net. But should SSI play that role?\nIn this article we review the role that SSI has played to this point, examining in particular\nthe evidence regarding its behavioral and labor market effects on the population of working-age\nadults. We briefly consider the directions SSI might take in a work-dominated welfare\nenvironment with a multiplicity of state and federal programs.\nThe Rationale for SSI\nIn 1972, Congress rejected the Nixon administration’s Family Assistance Plan (FAP), the\nfirst serious attempt to institute a federal program that would provide support for all low-income\nfamilies. But it passed legislation creating SSI, largely because providing income assistance to\npeople not then expected to work seemed unlikely to have much effect on employment. Through\nSSI, Congress federalized the administration of benefits, set minimum benefit standards,\nimposed uniform eligibility criteria, and set relatively low benefit reduction rates on earnings\nfrom work. But at the very beginning of the program, Congress began to blur the traditional\n-4-\n\nability-to-work standard for determining who should be entitled to public welfare payments. By\nextending benefits to the needy families of disabled children, SSI expanded the social safety net\nto include families headed by adults who were “employable.”\nThe goals of SSI have not changed, but the program itself has undergone extensive\nlegislative and administrative revisions over the years. These have sought primarily to make the\ncriteria for disability more precise (the term generally used is “target effective”) and to\nencourage recipients to return to the workforce. The Social Security Disability Amendments of\n1980, for example, allowed recipients to deduct some work expenses from earnings, thus in\neffect raising the level of allowable earnings. And in the 1996 welfare reform legislation,\nCongress restricted the eligibility of noncitizens for SSI, out of a belief that the program had\nbecome a magnet for newly arrived noncitizens with immigration sponsors.\nQualifying for the Program\nThe categorical criteria\nThe first two criteria for SSI eligibility—age and blindness—are straightforward and\neasily determined. Disability screening is more complex, and has been extremely controversial.\nFirst, there is no simple definition of disability. The most common measure in the economics\nliterature distinguishes three components: the presence of (1) a pathology—a physical or mental\nmalfunction—that leads to (2) an impairment—a physiological, anatomical, or mental loss or\nabnormality—that results in (3) an inability to perform, or limitation in performing, socially\nexpected roles and tasks.1 For men, and increasingly for women, market work is a socially\n1. For further discussion see S.

Badley, Conceptual Issues in\n-5-\n\nexpected role, and those unable to work or limited in their work ability are considered to be\ndisabled.\nSSI applicants move through a multi-step process in which their pathology, impairment,\nand level of functioning are judged. Although the disability criteria are federal and therefore\nuniform nationwide, state disability agencies, working with vocational and medical consultants,\nact as the primary gatekeepers and make the determination of disability. If a decision cannot be\nreached on medical grounds alone, applicants are evaluated in terms of their “residual functional\ncapacity” (can they work, either in the kind of job they have held in the past, or in another kind\nof job?). The interpretation of the criteria clearly varies systematically from state to state and\nover time. For instance, the 20 year average, from 1974 to 1993, of within state initial\nacceptance rates, (i.e. the percentage of those who apply for SSI benefits who are accepted at the\nfirst level of evaluation each year in a given state), ranged from lows of 28 percent in Louisiana\nand New Mexico to highs of 48 percent in Delaware, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.\nScreening children has proved more complex and contentious than screening adults. The\noriginally stringent criteria for eligibility were broadened in 1990 as a result of the U.S. Supreme\nCourt decision, Sullivan v. Zebley. This decision held that to meet the standard of equal\ntreatment, the initial determination of disability must include a functional limitation component\nparallel to that of adults—for example, certain schooling difficulties should be considered\nground for eligibility. With the addition of these new and broader grounds, the SSI child\ncaseload, about 185,000 in 1989, began to grow rapidly, reaching 955,000 by 1996. In that year\nthe Measurement of Disability.” in The Dynamics of Disability: Measuring and Monitoring Disability for\nSocial Security Programs. (Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 2002.)\n-6-\n\nCongress, as part of the welfare reform legislation, again raised the bar for eligibility by\nredefining the criteria and since then program growth as been slower.\nThe economic criteria\nTo be eligible for SSI an individual must have “countable income” less than the federal\nbenefit rate, $9,360 per year in 2002, and “countable assets” below $2,000 (for couples, the\namounts are 150 percent of the individual rate). Not all income is countable: $65 a month in\nearnings are disregarded. Thereafter, for every dollar earned, a recipient loses $0.50 in SSI\nbenefits. In-kind assistance like food stamps and public housing subsidies and $20 in income\nfrom other sources are disregarded, but all other government benefits are taxed at 100 percent. If\nsomeone eligible for SSI lives with others who are not—a spouse, or working-age parents—a\nportion of the income of those others is also considered in determining the amount of the SSI\npayment.\nAlthough the federal benefit rate and thus the monthly income test rise with inflation\nevery year, the income disregards, the asset limits, and the value of assets that are allowed (a car,\nor household goods) have never changed, and have fallen substantially in real terms since 1974,\neroding the value of the SSI benefits and narrowing the population of potential recipients. In\n2002 dollars, for example, the $65 earnings disregard would be $275; the $2,000 asset limit for\nan individual would be $6,345. The population now eligible for SSI is thus smaller and more\neconomically disadvantaged than it was in 1974.\nSSI Benefits\nIn general, SSI beneficiaries with no countable income receive the maximum monthly\nbenefit ($545 for an individual, $817 for a couple in 2002. Although the original objective of\nSSI was to guarantee an income at the poverty level, the federal minimum benefit in fact never\n-7-\n\nrepresented more than about 75 percent of the poverty threshold for an eligible individual (90\npercent for a couple).\nSSI recipients are required by law to apply for every government program for which they\nmay be eligible. In most states, they are automatically eligible for food stamps and Medicaid. A\nmajority of states pay an SSI supplement, but several factors minimize the importance of these.\nFor example, only 23 states provide supplements to the vast majority of SSI recipients living\nindependently in their own households. Because state supplements are not annually adjusted for\ninflation, the real value of the median payment to individuals declined by about 60 percent\nbetween 1975 and 1997.\nAs a federal income maintenance program, SSI is funded from general revenues and the\nfederal government pays the bulk of the benefits.2 States thus have an incentive to move\nindividuals to SSI from state programs, including TANF, which is federally financed as a fixed\nblock grant that does not rise as caseloads increase. This fiscal incentive may well explain the\nactive role state welfare agencies play in SSI outreach programs.\nProfile of SSI Recipients\nDemographic composition of the SSI rolls\nAs the basis of eligibility and the age composition of SSI recipients have changed, a\nnumber of other key demographic characteristics also have changed (Figure 2). First, the\nproportion of males and non-whites has increased. So too has the number of noncitizens, which\nshrank when restrictions were imposed in 1996, but still constitutes about 11 percent of the SSI\n2. In 1975, state supplements accounted for about 27 percent of all SSI payments. By 1998, the\nstate proportion had declined to 13 percent of the total.\n-8-\n\npopulation. Second, the number of recipients qualifying on the basis of physical disability has\nshrunk, and over 35 percent of the caseload now is qualified on the ground of psychiatric\ndisorders (the percentage qualifying by virtue of mental retardation has remained essentially\nstable).\nWhat proportion of people who meet the categorical, economic, and citizenship tests for\nSSI are actually participating? We can provide only a rough approximation, using census data.\nWe estimate that the participation rate of the poor elderly declined from around 79 percent in\n1974 to about 54 percent in 1982; it has fluctuated since then, but no more than two-thirds of\npoor, elderly people now receive SSI benefits. Participation rates among poor people of working\nage, in contrast, have risen, especially during the 1990s; in 1998, 20 percent of this group were\nSSI recipients, up from 15 percent in 1974. Recipiency rates for poor children also increased\nrapidly over the 1990s but remain in comparison low—around 6.6 percent in 1998.3 Increases in\ndisability rates did not cause the changes; these rates have not risen since 1980.\nMultiple program participation among SSI beneficiaries\nAs SSI policies mandate, a large fraction of SSI beneficiaries participate in other\ngovernment programs (Table 1). In 1999, nearly all SSI recipients received Medicaid—89.4\npercent. A substantial fraction also received Medicare—41.4 percent in 1999; forty percent were\nalso receiving Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance, on the ground either of retirement\n3. In 2001 the U.S. population with incomes below the poverty threshold included 17.8 million\npeople of working age and 3.4 million people over 65, a poverty rate of 10.1 per cent; there were11.7\nmillion poor children under 18, a poverty rate of 16.3 percent. U.S. Census Bureau, Poverty in the United\nStates, 2001, Report P60-219, September 2002, Table 1.\n-9-\n\nor disability.4 In the same year, 40 percent of SSI beneficiaries lived in households receiving\nfood stamps, over 5 percent were receiving the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for\nWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC), and another 25 percent were receiving free or reduced-\nprice meals. One in ten received energy or housing assistance. Over time, the proportion\nreceiving social security and Medicare has declined, while the proportion receiving other public\nbenefits has risen. The fact that a growing share of SSI recipients receive benefits from multiple\nmeans-tested programs suggests that the work incentives faced by the typical beneficiary are\nincreasingly complex. We discuss how this potentially affects the behavior of SSI beneficiaries\nlater in this article.\nFactors Affecting SSI Participation\nSupply of and demand for benefits\nWhile application for SSI disability benefits is a function of health, it also is influenced\nby the eligibility criteria of income support programs, both social insurance and means-tested,\nthe generosity of their benefits relative to work, macroeconomic conditions, and the applicant’s\neducation and job skills. In this brief discussion we look first at the evidence regarding caseload\ndynamics and the supply of benefits, and then at the demand for benefits.\nThe supply of benefits has fluctuated over time, largely as the stringency of the screening\nregulations has fluctuated. From the mid-1970s through the Social Security Disability\nAmendments of 1980, the disability determination and review process was steadily screwed\n4. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers Old Age, Survivors, and Disability\nInsurance (OASDI). Old Age and Survivor’s Insurance (OASI) is the benefit generally known as “social\nsecurity.” Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI or DI) provides payments to individuals who have\nworked for the required period and are judged to be disabled under the SSA guidelines. It is not means-\ntested, but does have restrictions on labor earnings. The Social Security Administration also administers\nthe SSI program.\n-10-\n\ntighter. The number of SSI recipients fell, and the level of complaints about the harshness of the\nsystem rose. In 1984, the Social Security Administration (SSA) issued revised guidelines that\nloosened the requirements. Thereafter, the number of working-age adults with disabilities rose\nby about 4–5 percent a year during the economic growth years of the 1980s. When the next\ndownturn came in the early 1990s, conditions were ripe for a surge in applications. The\nincreases in the disability transfer population in the early 1990s exceeded anything seen since the\nprogram began. Acceptance rates rose to almost 45 percent in 1992, well above those in the\n1980s. Economic recovery and Congressional action with respect to SSI disability have\ntempered the growth in the working-age adult SSI population, but acceptance rates remain well\nabove those in the 1980s, suggesting that rolls could easily increase in response to weaker\neconomic conditions.\nFluctuations in applications have been as large as changes in the disability rolls. To some\nextent they have mirrored changes in eligibility standards, but other factors—local economic\nconditions, outreach efforts by the SSA and state governments, and the relative generosity of\nSSI—have also contributed. Regulatory changes, such as the increased weight given to pain and\nother symptoms, the increased reliance on evidence from the patient’s own doctor (rather than\nSSA examiners), and broader standards for those with mental impairments all contributed to the\nsurge in applications. Among economic factors, long-run effects appear to be more important\nthan transient local fluctuations. The national recession of the early 1990s contributed to the\nrapid growth of SSI; it has been estimated that a 1 percentage point rise in the unemployment\n-11-\n\nrate was associated with a 2 percent increase in applications.5 Eligibility standards and\neconomic circumstances clearly interact: for example, in the earlier recession of the 1980s, at a\ntime of tightened eligibility standards for SSI, there was no such surge. Changes in the\nunemployment rate had a smaller effect on the number awarded benefits than on applications,\nsuggesting that recessions induce those with less severe disabilities and greater likelihood of\nbeing rejected to apply for SSI benefits.\nThe SSI program also grew over the 1990s because of state welfare policies. Many states\ncut General Assistance—once a common form of state cash welfare for single men or others who\ndid not qualify for AFDC—and those that did experienced above-average growth in applications\nfor SSI benefits. Indeed, a number of state governments made conscious efforts to shift\nindividuals onto SSI. States and other third parties such as private social welfare organizations\nhave often acted as intermediaries in the complicated SSI application process to make these\ntransfers easier.\nProgram Incentives and Caseload Dynamics\nLike all public assistance policies, programs for the disabled must contend with potential\n“moral hazard” problems and with work disincentives induced by program rules.6 Because the\nUnited States has few program alternatives that offer long-term benefits to working-age persons\nwho are not working, the relatively generous benefits and imperfect screening mechanisms in\n5. D. Stapleton, K. Coleman, K. Dietrich, and G. Livermore, “Econometric Analyses of DI and\nSSI Application and Award Growth,” in Growth in Disability Benefits: Explanations and Policy\nImplications, ed. K. Rupp and D. Stapleton (Kalamazoo, MI: W. E. Upjohn Institute, 1998).\n6. Moral hazard is formally defined as the risk that the presence of a contract (in this case a\nsocial contract to provide benefits) will affect the behavior of one or more of the contract parties. The\nclassic example is in the insurance industry, where coverage against a loss might increase the risk-taking\nbehavior of the insured.\n-12-\n\nSSI could pose significant work disincentives for persons with disabilities who are considering\napplying for benefits. Additionally, the high marginal tax rates associated with multiple program\nparticipation could discourage exit from it and entry into the labor force. These same factors\npotentially affect the labor market decisions of adults with disabled children on SSI.\nIf those with disabilities were not expected to work, the bundle of program disincentives\nwe have discussed above would be irrelevant. Marginal tax rates could approach 100 percent\nwith no change in work behavior. Moreover, to the degree that age and work disability are\nclearly defined and immutable categories, differences in guarantees, time limits, or funding\nmechanisms for SSI and other programs would have little effect; the size of the SSI program\nwould primarily reflect the prevalence of health limitations among low-income families. But\nneither the definition of disability nor the condition itself are immutable. And if work is both\npossible and expected for people with disabilities who meet other eligibility criteria, then policy\ndiscussions of SSI must consider such issues as, for example, the trade-offs among tax rates,\nguarantees, and break-even points.\nIn the United States, the typical working-age person with a disability acquired that\ndisability at some point during his or her work life.7 Social policy may, therefore, influence not\nonly whether such workers remain in the labor force or end up in a transfer program, but also the\nspeed at which the transition takes place. Thus the behavioral responses to worsening health\ndepend not only on the severity of the condition but also on the social environment for people\n7. In 1992, 70 percent of men and women who reported a health-related impairment said it\nstarted during their work life. R. Burkhauser and M. Daly, “Employment and Economic Well-Being\nFollowing the Onset of a Disability: The Role for Public Policy.” In J. Mashaw, V. Reno,\nR.V.Burkhauser, and M. Berkowitz (eds.) Disability, Work, and Cas Benefits (Kalamazoo, MI: W. E.\nUpjohn Institute, 1996).\n-13-\n\nwith health impairments—the availability of jobs, of accommodation, rehabilitation, and\ntraining, the legal supports and protections, and the accessibility and generosity of SSI and other\ngovernment transfer programs. Because the 1996 welfare reforms removed entitlement to many\npublic assistance programs, SSI policy decisions must also, increasingly, take into account the\nactions of state and local governments.\nIn the end, the more important question is not whether the SSI program induces\nbehavioral changes, but whether these changes are small relative to the social gains from\nredistributing income to less advantaged persons. In general, there is a social consensus that it is\nimportant to protect people against the economic consequences of age and disability. But\nbecause a socially appropriate eligibility standard for SSI is difficult to assess, a more stringent\nset of definitions will deny benefits to some who are less capable of work than is socially\nacceptable. More lenient criteria, however, involve a trade-off: given the presence of\nuncertainty, do the social benefits outweigh the efficiency costs of giving benefits to some who\ndo not “deserve” them—who are more capable of work?\nAdults with disabilities\nDespite a large literature on the magnitude of the moral hazard effects of SSDI, AFDC,\nand food stamps, little research exists on the moral hazard problem in SSI.8 While it is tempting\nto look to the research on other programs to gain insight into how the SSI program affects the\nbehavior of low-income adults with disabilities, doing so is problematic. Comparisons to SSDI\nare constrained by the fact that the typical SSDI applicant has very different characteristics from\n8. A review of this literature is J. Bound and R. Burkhauser, “Economic Analysis of Transfer\nPrograms Targeted on People with Disabilities,” in Handbook of Labor Economics 3(c), ed. O.\nAshenfelter and D. Card (Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1999).\n-14-\n\nthe typical SSI applicant, who is mostly younger and poorer, more likely to come from an ethnic\nor racial minority, to have functional limitations arising from mental conditions, less education,\nand fewer work skills and experience. Comparisons to other means-tested programs eliminate\nsome of these problems, but are troubled by their broader scope of coverage and easier entry and\nexit (i.e., no disability screening).\nThe small amount of research that does exist on the behavior of SSI applicants or\nrecipients shows that the average SSI recipient faces substantial disincentives to leave the rolls.\nRecent research shows that only a small fraction of SSI applicants work in the years leading up\nto their application. This limited work history combined with the long process of establishing\nthat they have a medical condition that prevents them from working makes it difficult for\nbeneficiaries to locate employment that compensates them for the loss of income associated with\nmoving off of SSI and into the labor market. Finally, those who consider returning to work may\nbe subject to very high marginal tax rates, in the form of reduced benefits from SSI and other\ntransfer programs, plus the regular assortment of federal, state, and local taxes, as well as the\npotential loss of medical insurance (Medicaid).9 Combined these implicit and explicit taxes can\nproduce very high marginal tax rates for SSI recipients. For example, in 1994 a single male SSI\nrecipient faced net tax rates ranging from 23 percent ($0 earnings) to 89 percent ($522 earnings).\nIn the hopes of offsetting some of these disincentives, adult recipients of SSI are eligible\nfor a variety of federally funded and state-administered vocational rehabilitation programs; the\npool of eligible providers was expanded in 1999 by the legislation called, significantly, the\n9.

But efforts to encourage SSI recipients to\nreturn to work have proved discouraging. The SSA conducted two large-scale return-to-work\ndemonstration projects to study the effectiveness of providing rehabilitation and employment\nservices to SSI beneficiaries; these were the Transitional Employment Training Demonstration,\nTETD (1985–87), and Project Network (1992–95). Both programs called for volunteers. The\nfirst focused on mentally retarded beneficiaries, the second on beneficiaries with a wider range\nof diagnoses. Both projects were evaluated using random-assignment methodologies. For both,\nthe conclusions were similar: TETD produced significant earnings gains for participants over six\nyears, but the small impact on SSI payments was not nearly sufficient to cover the average cost\nof providing services to participants. In Project Network, earnings gains in the first two years\nwere enough to offset reductions in SSI and SSDI benefits, but did not offset the costs of\nadministration and training, and a third year follow-up showed that earnings gains had declined\nto zero. In both programs, the fraction of those eligible who volunteered was very small, around\n5 percent. This suggests that transitional employment services are unlikely to have a large effect\non the SSI population as a whole.\nFamilies of children with disabilities\nThe primary justification for awarding cash benefits to poor families containing a\ndisabled child is that they face economic burdens associated with their child’s poor health.\nThese burdens may include lost earnings as well as medical expenses, but SSI child benefits are\nnot based on an earnings replacement or expenditure offset formula; they are simply means-\ntested against current income. With current data, it is difficult to know whether families of\nchildren with disabilities became low-income due to earnings declines and/or increases in\nexpenses associated with the onset of the child’s disability or whether the families which qualify\n-16-\n\nfor SSI benefits had low incomes before the onset of the child’s disability. In the latter case, the\nextra burdens of the disability would not the root cause of their poverty.\nThe moral hazard faced by families whose child receives SSI benefits—the incentive to\nhave their child become and remain eligible for SSI—depends to some degree on their economic\ncircumstances before the child became disabled. If the typical family is a middle-income family\nwhose economic well-being declines drastically when their child becomes disabled, a cash\nbenefit that only partially offsets these losses is unlikely to be a real disincentive to work or to\nthe child’s recovery. But for families that are already economically vulnerable, SSI benefits for\na disabled child may replace or even increase family income.\nIt has been estimated that perhaps as many of two-thirds of the children coming onto the\nSSI rolls in the early 1990s, after the Zebley decision, were in families already receiving some\ntype of welfare assistance.10 Other things equal, families eligible for multiple programs are\nlikely to select those that provide them with the highest net benefit. SSI is associated with higher\ncosts (more stringent application rules, greater stigma, etc.), but as the benefits associated with\nother programs shrink in comparison, more families may be willing to incur these costs to\nimprove their economic circumstances. According to Kubik (1999) in 1990, a family of three,\nliving in Maryland with one disabled child, could have increased monthly family income by over\n$3,500 if one child transferred to the SSI rolls.\nClearly behavioral change is much more likely in families confronted with such financial\nincentives. And there is evidence that families are more likely to report disabilities in\n10. Kubik J. “Incentives for the Identification and Treatment of Children with Disabilities: The\nSupplemental Security Income Program.” Journal of Public Economics 73 (1999): 187-215.\n-17-\n\nchildren—particularly mental impairments—in states with low welfare benefits than in states\nwith high welfare benefits. At the same time, work is affected. The Zebley decision appears to\nhave had a significant dampening effect on the employment of unmarried women without a high\nschool education, and increases in SSI benefits lower the probability that poorly educated\nhousehold heads will work.11 In general, the evidence suggests that working-age adults and\nfamilies of children with disabilities are moving from other welfare programs to SSI.\nSSI: An Old Program in a New Era\nAs noted earlier, SSI was born out of a compromise between those wanting to provide a\nguaranteed income floor under all Americans and those wishing to limit it to individuals not\nexpected to work, at that time, the aged, blind, and disabled. Times have changed since this\noriginal compromise. Individuals are living and working longer, the normal retirement age for\nSocial Security benefits has been raised, the Americans with Disabilities Act has granted people\nwith disabilities a legal right to access to employment, and congress has agreed that nearly all\nAmericans (even young, single, mothers with children) are expected to work. For policymakers,\nthis creates a conundrum: Should people with disabilities be expected to work or not?\nThis conundrum has been brought to the forefront by recent trends in employment and\nbenefit receipt among those with disabilities (Figure 3). Figure 3 shows employment rates of\nworking-age men and women with self-reported disabilities and the number of individuals\nreceiving benefits for 1980-2001. As the figure shows, while employment rates for those with\nself-reported disabilities rose through the economic expansion of the late 1980s, they have fallen\n11 J. Kubik, “Incentives for the Identification and Treatment of Children with Disabilities: The\nSupplemental Security Income Program,” Journal of Public Economics 73 (1999): 187–215; A. Garrett\nand S. Glied, “Does State AFDC Generosity Affect Child SSI Participation?” Journal of Policy Analysis\nand Management 19, no. 2 (2000): 275–95.\n-18-\n\nalmost continuously since, even during the strong expansion of the 1990s. At the same time that\nemployment has been falling, the number of individuals on disability benefits (SSI and SSDI)\nhas been rising.\nWhile researchers debate the reasons for the declining employment and rising benefit\nrates of men and women with disabilities during the 1990s, policy makers are debating whether\nthese outcomes are signs of success or failure of U.S. disability policy. For some advocates of\nthose with disabilities, the increasing disability benefit rolls reflect an appropriate increase in\nsupport for a group of individuals with limited labor market opportunities. For others, the\nincreased rolls reflect shortcomings of a transfer-focused policy that failed to provide the\nnecessary supports (e.g., universal health insurance, rehabilitation, and job services) to allow\nindividuals to select work over benefits. For others still, the outcomes observed during the\n1990s are simply evidence of the law of unintended consequences in policy making, where\npolicies to promote economic well-being (in the case of benefits) and work (in the case of the\nADA) actually increased the disability benefit rolls and reduced employment.\nWhatever perspective one takes on the increase in the SSI disability population, as the\npopulation of SSI changes and the group of those not expected to work narrows, the structure of\nSSI comes into question. First, despite some attempts to offset the negative work incentives in\nSSI, exits to employment, even among this relatively younger population, are rare. The high tax\nrates and relatively generous benefits of SSI, which made sense for populations not expected to\nwork, are a serious disincentive in a population where work is possible. For those with a\ncapacity to work, SSI and the eligibility for other programs that it conveys can become a classic\n“poverty trap.” Since the Zebley decision, moreover, nearly a million children have entered the\nSSI rolls. Given the broad commitment to integrating people with disabilities into the workforce\n-19-\n\nembodied in the ADA and welfare-to-work programs of the 1990s, major initiatives to integrate\nthese children into the workforce rather than onto adult disability rolls are likely to be\nconsidered. Policies targeting young people with disabilities would surely be better focused on\neducation, rehabilitation, job training, and accommodation than on increasing or expanding\ntransfers. Especially for the children, investing more time, energy, and resources in education\nand development than in income supplementation for their families might be desirable.\nSecond, in the absence of a universal, guaranteed-income program for all Americans of\nthe kind envisioned in the Nixon administration’s FAP, the operational flexibility of the\neligibility criteria for SSI has made the program sensitive to economic downturns and to\nincreases in the pool of vulnerable people. The recent legislative changes in the social safety net\nand the increasing percentage of the population aged 50 and over—a point at which the\nincidence of disability rises sharply— in combination with the end of the record growth period\nof the 1990s business cycle and the slide of the economy into recession makes further increase in\nthe rolls likely.\n-20-\n\nTable 1.

Going forward, labor quality is likely to add considerably less\nand may even be a drag on productivity growth in the medium term. Using a variety of\nmethods, we project that potential labor-quality growth in the longer run (7 to 10 years\nout)islikelytofallintherangeof0.1to0.25percentperyear. Inthemediumterm,labor-\nquality growth could be lower or even negative, should employment rates of low-skilled\nworkers make a cyclical rebound towards pre-recession levels. The main uncertainties\nin the longer run are whether the secular decline in employment of low-skilled workers\ncontinues and whether the Great Recession pickup in educational attainment represents\nthe start of a new boom or is simply a transitory reaction to a poor economy.\nJEL classification codes: J24, O47, O51.\nKeywords: Demographic change, growth accounting, labor quality, wages.\n∗Prepared for NBER/CRIW conference on ”Education, Skills, and Technical Change: Implications for\nFuture U.S. GDP Growth.” We thank Doug Elmendorf, Chuck Hulten, Valerie Ramey, Todd Schoellman, and\nthe CRIW participants for helpful comments.

And since the seminal analysis of Jorgenson & Griliches (1967), which provided\na straightforward measurement framework, indices of human capital, or labor quality, have\nbecome standard in growth-accounting studies for many countries. In this paper, we assess\nalternative methods for estimating U.S. labor quality and provide projections for the future.\nWe also identify key uncertainties that will determine the actual path of U.S. labor quality\nin the medium and longer run. In almost all scenarios we consider, labor quality adds less to\ngrowth over the next decade than it has historically—in some scenarios, much less.\nWe begin by reviewing commonly used methods for measuring labor quality. Since labor\nquality is not directly observable, measuring it requires researchers to find an observable proxy.\nNot surprisingly, the best proxy is wages, which should move closely with marginal products.\nFor example, a neurosurgeon is likely to have a higher marginal product than a grocery clerk.\nThisdifferenceinmarginalproductsis,inturn,arguablythemainreasonwhytheneurosurgeon\nis paid more.\nThe question is how best to impute the relative marginal products of workers based on\ndifferent characteristics. We develop a novel statistical metric that evaluates the reliability of\nalternative approaches to imputing relative marginal products. Specifically, we examine the\ntrade-off that each approach implicitly makes between (a) the share of the productivity-related\nvariation in observed wages that is explained, and (b) the precision of the imputed estimates\nof relative marginal products of different workers.1\nIn our statistical assessment, the best-performing model is a parsimonious Mincer specifi-\ncation that includes experience, education and, when accurate data are available, occupation.\nExperience and education are clearly related to productivity differentials across workers, and\nare empirically important for explaining the patterns of wages in the data. Other commonly\nused variables raise challenges. For example, both occupation and gender add explanatory\n1For example, adding an additional variable might add explanatory power for wages but at the cost of\nsharply reducing precision of imputed marginal products.\n2\n\npower with little cost in terms of precision. But, historically, occupation has been challenging\nto forecast with any degree of accuracy so, for the purpose of projections, we exclude it. For\ngender, it is unclear to what degree gender-related wage differentials reflect marginal prod-\nucts, so we again prefer to exclude it. (In any case, including gender turns out to make little\ndifference empirically to our estimates of labor quality). Other variables (such as industry or\nrace) add little to explanatory power while substantially reducing the precision of estimated\nmarginal products.\nWe then use our preferred parsimonious Mincer specification to estimate labor-quality\ngrowth from 2002 to 2013 across three alternative datasets.2 We find that labor quality grew\nabout 0.5 percent per year—somewhat faster than its post-war average of about 0.4. Indeed,\nlaborqualityarguablyexplainsabitunderone-thirdoflabor-productivitygrowthof1.8percent\nper year over the 2002-2013 period.3 This finding is robust across data sources.\nStrikingly, the growth and acceleration of labor quality since 2002 has a very different\nsource than it did in the half century before that. In the 20th century, the primary driver of\nlabor quality increases was rising educational attainment (Ho & Jorgenson, 1999; Goldin &\nKatz, 2009; Fernald & Jones, 2014). In contrast, since 2002, the source of labor-quality growth\nhas been a shift in the composition of employment away from lower skilled and toward higher\nskilled workers. This change owed to ongoing secular changes in the labor force as well as\ncyclical adjustments associated with the Great Recession.\nBuilding on this analysis, we provide alternative scenarios for the evolution of labor-quality\ngrowth over the medium and longer run. Our work reinforces the view that labor-quality\ngrowth will add less to growth in productivity and output than it has historically. That\nsaid, the actual path of labor-quality growth is sensitive to uncertainties about trends in\n2Thetimeperiodisconstrainedbyourdesiretocompareresultsacrossthreepubliclyavailabledatasources.\n3This contribution is calculated assuming that growth in output per hour rises one-for-one with growth in\nlabor quality. That is, the growth in labor quality is not multiplied by labor’s share, which would give the\nproximate growth-accounting contribution. The one-to-one mapping comes from standard economic models,\nwherethereisanindirecteffectfromendogenousgrowthincapital. Thereasonisthatcapitaldeepeninginthe\nmodels is typically in terms of “effective labor.” Fernald & Jones (2014) discuss this accounting and estimate\nthatincreasesinlaborqualityexplained0.4percentperyearofthe2.0percentannualizedgrowthinU.S.GDP\nper hour between 1950 and 2007.\n3\n\nemployment rates and, to a lesser extent, educational attainment. These differences will show\nupinproductivitygrowth,butwhethertheymatterforoutputgrowthdependsonthedegreeto\nwhich they are offset by hours growth. This highlights a takeaway from our analysis, namely\nthat labor-quality growth and hours growth are often negatively correlated. An important\nimplication of this is that forecasts of overall labor input growth, or quality-adjusted hours,\nare preferable to independent projections of labor quality and hours.\nSection 2 reviews the growth-accounting definition of labor quality that we apply in this\npaper. Section 3 then discusses the practical challenges involved in empirically applying our\nconceptual framework and assesses alternative approaches and data sets. Section 4 examines\nthe evolution of labor quality since 2002, and compares approaches and data sets. Over this\nperiod, labor-quality growth was boosted by disproportionate declines in employment rates\namong low-skilled workers, especially during and after the Great Recession.\nWith a framework in place, Section 5 turns to projections of labor-quality growth over the\nmedium- to long-term. We forecast that labor-quality growth is likely to slow to somewhere\nin the range of 0.1 to 0.25 percentage points a year over the next 10 years. Should employ-\nment composition return to its pre-recession levels, medium-term labor-quality growth will fall\nbelow this baseline and could even turn negative. In the longer run, trends in education and\nemployment rates are central. To generate labor-quality growth at close to its historical pace\nrequires not just a continuing shift in the composition of employment from low-skill towards\nhigh-skilled workers, but also a resumed upward trend in educational attainment. Although\nsuch a scenario is possible, we think it unlikely. In particular, although educational attainment\nhas picked up since 2007, our preferred interpretation is that the rise represents a transitory\nreaction to a poor economy, not a new upward trend.\n4\n\n2 Definition of labor-quality growth\nIndices of labor quality are based on standard neoclassical production theory.4 Consider a\nneoclassical value-added production function of the form\nY = F (A,K,H ,...,H ). (1)\n1 n\nOutput, Y, is produced by combining the n types of labor inputs, H ,...,H , with a capital\n1 n\ninput, K; A denotes the level of technological efficiency with which the inputs are combined.5\nTo quantify how changes in inputs affect output growth, we apply a first-order logarithmic\nTaylor approximation. Small letters denote the natural logarithms of the capitalized variables\nsuch that y is the log of output, Y. Applying the first difference operator, ∆, we can write\n∆y = lnY −lnY . (2)\nt t−1\nThisissimplythegrowthrateofoutput, asmeasuredbythechangeinthelogarithmofoutput.\nThe Taylor approximation then reads\nn\n∂F A ∂F K (cid:88) ∂F H\ni\n∆y = ∆a+ ∆k + ∆h . (3)\ni\n∂AY ∂K Y ∂H Y\ni\ni=1\nOutput growth depends on technology growth plus the contribution of the various factors of\nproduction. The final term in this expression is the effect of changes in labor inputs on output\ngrowth, where growth in each type of labor is multiplied by its respective output elasticity.\nThe contributions of labor inputs can be further decomposed into the effect of growth in\ntotal hours (i.e., growth in\n(cid:80)n\nH ) and changes in the composition of total hours. To do this\ni=1 i\n4Ho & Jorgenson (1999) survey the history of labor quality measurement and discuss several semantic\nand/or conceptual confusions.\n5Assumingasinglecapitalinputisforsimplicityanddoesnotaffecttheresultsthatfollowforlaborinput.\n5\n\nwe rewrite (3) as\n(cid:32) (cid:33)(cid:32) (cid:33)\n∆y = ∂F A ∆a+ ∂F K ∆k + (cid:88) n ∂F H j ∆h+ (cid:88) n ∂ ∂ H F i H i (∆h −∆h) . (4)\n∂AY ∂K Y ∂H Y (cid:80)n ∂F H i\nj=1 j i=1 j=1 ∂Hj j\nGrowth in total hours is ∆h and the change in the composition of hours worked is\nn ∂F H\n(cid:88) ∂Hi i (∆h −∆h). (5)\n(cid:80)n ∂F H i\ni=1 j=1 ∂Hj j\nThe change in the composition of hours worked in (5) amplifies or attenuates growth in total\nlabor input relative to growth in total hours. This wedge between growth in labor input and\ngrowth in hours is commonly interpreted as labor-quality growth. Intuitively, if all type of\nlabor inputs, H , grow at the same rate, then the composition of total hours does not change\ni\nand labor-quality growth is zero. But if, instead, hours of relatively more productive workers\n(with high ∂F ) grow more quickly than hours of less productive workers, then labor-quality\n∂Hi\ngrowth will be positive.\nEmpirically, the marginal products of labor, ∂F , in (5) are not observed. Under standard\n∂Hi\nneoclassical conditions, the ∂F are proportional to the nominal hourly wage earned by workers\n∂Hi\nof type i, denoted W . We assume that the proportionality constant is equal across types of\ni\nlabor.6 If this is the case then\n∂F H W H\n∂Hi i = i i , (6)\n(cid:80)n ∂F H (cid:80)n W H\nj=1 ∂Hj j j=1 j j\nwhich is the share of total compensation that gets paid to workers of type i.\nUndertheseassumptions, labor-qualitygrowth, denotedbyg , isthecompensation-share-\nLQ\n6In competitive markets, standard neoclassical assumptions imply that real (output-price-deflated) wages\nequal marginal products, so the assumption holds (with proportionality given by the output price). Imperfect\ncompetitionintheoutputmarketallowsfirmstochargeamarkupofpriceovermarginalcost; butthemarkup\nis constant across types of workers so the assumption again holds. It also holds if firms have some monopsony\npower in the labor market, as long as the wedge is constant across types of labor.\n6\n\nweighted average deviation of labor input from total hours growth by type, i.e.\nn\n(cid:88) W H\ngLQ = i i (∆h −∆h). (7)\n(cid:80)n\nW H\ni\nj=1 j=1 j j\nThis is the measure of labor-quality growth that we analyze. It is the same as the one used in\nrange of growth-accounting datasets for many countries.7\nNote that growth in total labor input, or “quality-adjusted” hours, is simply the share-\nweighted growth in hours:\nn\n(cid:88) W H\ngLQ +∆h = i i ∆h . (8)\n(cid:80)n\nW H\ni\nj=1 j=1 j j\n3 Measurement of labor-quality growth\nTo implement (7) and obtain an empirical estimate of labor-quality growth requires three\nthings:\ni Definition of worker types: decisionregardingthespecifictypesofworkers,i = 1,...,n,\nthe labor-quality index will distinguish between.\nii Estimate of wage by worker type: estimate of average hourly earnings for each worker\ntype, W , used to construct the share of each worker type in total compensation.\ni\niii Measure of hours: measure of hours worked by worker type, H , used to calculate the\ni\ndeviation of hours growth by worker type, ∆h , from overall hours growth, ∆h.\ni\nItem (iii) is relatively straightforward. Measures of hours worked by individuals are avail-\nable in many datasets. Once the worker types are defined, calculation of H simply involves\ni\naggregation of hours across individuals in each of the n groups.\n7For the United States, examples include Jorgenson et al. (1987, 2014); Ho & Jorgenson (1999); Zoghi\n(2010), and Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015a,b). Notable examples for a wider set of countries include\nEUKLEMS (O’Mahony & Timmer, 2009), the Conference Board’s Total Economy Database (van Ark &\nErumban, 2015), and the Penn World Tables (Feenstra et al. , 2015).\n7\n\nItems (i) and (ii), are less straightforward than (iii) and we discuss the different options\nfor dealing with them in this section. We are not the first to discuss the choice of worker types\nand wage measures in the context of the construction of labor-quality indices. For example,\nsee Zoghi (2010). Our contribution relative to that work is to introduce a framework that\nallows us to make tractable choices for (i) and (ii) and “test” those choices against each other\nusing standard statistical techniques.\nIn terms of datasets, we focus primarily on the American Community Survey (ACS). The\nACS is a smaller, annual version of the decennial census and collects a relatively narrow range\nof demographic and socioeconomic data on a sample of about 1 percent of the U.S. population\n(approximately 3 million individuals) each year.8 We also consider two other datasets. The\nfirstistheCurrentPopulationSurvey’sOutgoingRotationGroups(CPS-ORG),whichconsists\nof the outgoing rotation groups from the Current Population Survey (CPS). This is the quarter\nof the CPS respondents that are asked about their earnings and income in any given month.\nThis results in an annual sample of about 135,000 individuals. The second, the Current\nPopulation Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC), is the Annual\nSocial and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, also known as the March\nSupplement. It contains annual earnings and income data from the full March CPS sample\n(70,000 individuals).\nThough based on different samples and sampling methods, each of the datasets allows for\nthe construction of similar hourly wages, as well as the six variables of education, age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, industry, and occupation, that are our main focus. In all cases, we measure\nhours as usual hours worked per week, which is available in all three datasets.\n8The sample of the ACS has been expanded twice and has only been a 1 percent sample of the population\nsince 2006. In its first year, 2000, the sample was just under 400,000 individuals and between 2001 and 2005\nthe sample was slightly over 1 million.\n8\n\n3.1 Criteria for choosing worker types and wage estimates\nIndices of labor quality are built by dividing workers into groups based on their marginal\nproducts of labor, ∂F . The decision about how many and which worker types, i = 1,...,n, to\n∂Li\nuse depends on: (i) the degree to which the types distinguish between workers with different\nmarginal products, and (ii) the degree to which the different worker types capture the cross-\nindividual variation in wages.\nA simple way to quantitatively assess the degree to which these criteria are met for any\nparticulargroupingisaregression. Toseethis,considerj individualsanddenotethelogoftheir\nindividual hourly wage by w . For each individual we also observe a vector x of individual-\nj j\nlevel characteristics based on their worker type, i. Under the assumption that relative wages\nreflect relative marginal products, the extent to which the characteristics in the vector, x ,\nj\ncapture cross-individual differences in marginal products can be measured as the fraction of\nindividual-level log-wage variation that is explained by the variables in x . This measure is\nj\nequal to the R2 of the following standard log-wage regression\nw = x(cid:48)β +ε . (9)\nj j j\nHere, x(cid:48)β is the part of the wage variation captured by the variables in x .\nj j\nThoughsimple,thisspecificationisverygeneral. Itsubsumesthecaseinwhichtheelements\nof x are dummy variables that span the set of worker types. In this version, every type is a\nj\nstratum made up of individuals with the characteristics, as in Jorgenson et al. (1987).9 It also\nincludes the case where x contains polynomial terms of variables affecting workers’ marginal\nj\nproduct. In this case (9) is a form of a Mincer (1974) regression. This is the model used by\nAaronson & Sullivan (2001), among others.\nOf course, in practice we do not know the true parameter vector β and the log-wage\nregression (9) is estimated using a sample of workers of finite size. This means that, at best,\n9Most stratum-based studies use median rather than mean wages. Our results are not sensitive to this\nchoice.\n9\n\nˆ\nwe can obtain an estimate β of the parameter vector and that we thus infer the part of wages\ncaptured by our explanatory variables with error. To formalize this mathematically, we denote\nthe standard deviation of the estimation error of the explained part as\n(cid:115)\n(cid:20) (cid:21)\n(cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:17)2\nσ = E x(cid:48) β ˆ −β . (10)\nj j\nSince it is important to have a reliable estimate, the smaller σ the better. However, for\nj\nthe construction of the labor-quality index, we are not interested in one particular worker,\nj, but instead in the reliability of the relative marginal product estimate, x(cid:48)β ˆ , across the\nj\nwhole sample. To gauge the reliability of the marginal product estimate across the sample,\nwe consider the pth percentile of the standard errors, σ , across individuals. We denote this\nj\npercentile by σ˜ .\np\nBased on this simple framework, we suggest two statistical criteria for determining the\ntypes of workers to distinguish and the method to use when estimating wages.\n1. R2 of log-wage regression This measures the share of cross-individual wage variation\nthat is captured by our choice of worker types and specification of the log-wage equation.\n2. Percentile of standard error, σ˜ , of marginal product estimates This captures\np\nhow reliably we estimate the (relative) marginal product of labor across workers.\nHigher R2’s and lower σ˜ ’s are preferred.\np\nImportantly, there is a direct trade off between these two measures. In principle, we can\nobtain an R2 = 1 in the estimated regression (9) by including as many linearly independent\nvariables in x as we have observations, m. However, this would result in a regression with zero\nj\ndegrees of freedom and σ˜ → ∞. Alternatively, we can aim for a very low σ˜ at the expense\np p\nof a R2.\nUsing these tools we can directly compare different choices of (i) worker types and (ii)\nwage estimates by worker type. We do so using a scatterplots that plot the R2 and σ˜ for each\np\n10\n\nchoice that we consider. Before we construct the scatterplots, we first describe the choices of\nworker types and wage regression specifications we consider.\n3.2 Choice of worker types and wage regression specifications\nSo far, we have discussed the choices of worker types, i, and the regression specification, i.e. x ,\nj\nas two distinct decisions. In practice, however, they are one and the same. This is because for\nthe variables that are commonly considered in log-wage regressions there are only a countable\nnumber of values. Consequently, for a given regression specification in terms of these variables\nthere is only a finite number of permutations of x across individuals. In this context, a worker\nj\ntype, i, corresponds to a permutation of the covariates vector x .\nj\nWith this in mind, two questions remain: (i) which variables should be included in the\nvector x , and (ii) what functional form of these variables works best?\nj\nChoice of variables in wage equation\nThe decision regarding which variables should be included in the regression is guided by the\nassumption, underlying the labor-quality growth derivation, that wage differentials between\nworker types reflect differences in relative marginal products of labor. This means that the\nvariables we include in the wage equation should have two properties. First, they should\nexplain a substantial part of the variation in wages across worker types. Second, the part of\nwage variation they explain should reflect only differences in marginal products.\nWhether a variables has the first property is straightforward to verify statistically. The\nsecond property—i.e., which variables capture marginal product differentials—is more con-\ntroversial. This is because certain observable characteristics may be correlated with wedges\nbetween wages and marginal products.10 Though such variables might improve the fit of the\nwage regression, (9), including them in our measure of labor quality would bias our results.\nThe most obviousvariables to consider for inclusion in (9) are education and experience.\n10See Boeri & van Ours (2013) for a textbook treatment of many possible sources of such wedges.\n11\n\nSeveral decades of running Mincer regressions has demonstrated a robust correlation between\neducation and potential experience (or age) and wages (Psacharopoulos & Patrinos, 2004).11\nAlthough there is some controversy over the degree to which returns to education are derived\nfrom improved human capital as opposed to the signaling of unobservable worker charac-\nteristics, both perspectives tend to attribute educational wage differentials to differences in\nmarginal products (Weiss, 1995).12 Overall, there is broad agreement that the correlation\nbetween wages and education or experience is driven by real productivity differentials.13\nA substantial literature, summarized in Altonji & Blank (1999), has also pointed to a role\nfor gender, race, and ethnicity in explaining wage differentials. Here we encounter substantial\ncontroversy as to whether, or to what degree, these wage differentials reflect differentials in\nproductivity as opposed to discrimination. On the one hand, gender differentials may capture\nthe fact that women are more likely to work part time or leave the labor force temporarily,\nwhich is not captured in the measures of experience available in standard datasets (Light &\nUreta, 1995). And ethnic differentials may proxy for unobserved language barriers that have a\nreal impact on productivity (Hellerstein & Neumark, 2008).14 Yet, there is also a substantial\nliterature documenting the existence of labor market discrimination, particularly on the basis\nof race and ethnicity, in both hiring and wages (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2003; Pager et al.\n, 2009; Hellerstein et al. , 2002; Oaxaca & Ransom, 1994).\nFinally, there is also a body of literature suggesting that there are inter-industry wage\ndifferentials that persist even after controlling for education and experience (Dickens & Katz,\n11Some of the recent Mincer regression literature has suggested that there are important differences in the\neducation-experiencereturnprofilesbetweencohorts(Lemieux,2006;Heckmanetal.,2008). Weallowforsuch\ncohorteffectsinthatweestimatewageregressionsonannualcross-sectionaldata. Thus,inouranalysiscohort\nand age effects are indistinguishable. This is appropriate for our application, because we are only interested in\nmaking robust wage predictions and not in isolating specific returns.\n12Outside of developing countries there has been little empirical research that even asks the question of\nwhether educational wage differentials might reflect something other than productivity, and the research in\ndevelopingcountrieshasgenerallyconcludedthatthedifferentialsareconsistentwithdifferencesinproductivity\n(Jones, 2001; Hellerstein & Neumark, 1995).\n13Broad as the agreement is, it is not entirely universal: incomplete labor contracts, labor market segmen-\ntation, or cultural factors could potentially drive a wedge between wage premia associated with education and\nexperience and differentials in marginal product (Blaug, 1985).\n14Skrentny (2013) and Lang (2015) discuss the theoretical and empirical evidence on race and worker\nproductivity.\n12\n\n1987; Krueger & Summers, 1988).15 Once again, such differentials could originatefrom genuine\ndifferences in productivity (e.g. the matching of a worker to a particular job may reflect differ-\nences in social skills (Deming, 2015)) or from non-productivity related features of an industry\n(such as profit sharing). Interestingly, although similar arguments could apply to occupa-\ntional differences, there has been little research that considers whether there are persistent\ninter-occupation wage differentials independent of educational and experience prerequisites.\nThough not the main purpose of our analysis, our estimates of (9) partially fill this void by\nincluding occupation in our analysis.\nThus, the observables we focus on are age, education, gender, race, industry, and occupa-\ntion. We are aware that there are many other variables that could be interpreted as reflecting\ndifferencesinmarginalproductoflaboracrossworkers. Examplesincludemaritalstatus, rural-\nurban location, or family structure. However, given the limited evidence that these variables\nare of first-order importance in explaining cross-individual variation in wages, we omit them\nfrom our analysis.\nThere is also a wide range of potentially influential unobservable characteristics (such as\nentrepreneurial talent (Silva, 2007), cognitive and non-cognitive abilities (Heckman et al. ,\n2006), and physical attractiveness (Hamermesh & Biddle, 1994)).16 Although it would be\nideal to include measurements of, or proxies for, these characteristics in our analysis, that is\nnot possible in the datasets available.\nChoice of functional form\nWith the set of variables to include in x in hand, that last thing to consider is the specific\nj\nfunctional form imposed on these variables. For example, is the traditional Mincer regression,\nwith a constant, linear years of education, and a quadratic polynomial in experience, the ap-\npropriate functional form or should dummies for high school graduation and college graduation\n15Gibbons et al. (2005), however, suggest that sectoral wage differentials can be accounted for by allowing\nfor sector-specific returns to skill.\n16These characteristics are unobservable in the sense that they are not measured as part of the standard\ndatasets (ACS, CPS-ASEC, and CPS-ORG) that we use for our analysis.\n13\n\nbe included to account for sheepskin effects (Hungerford & Solon, 1987)? Are education and\nexperience additively separable, or is there a nonlinear interaction between the two? These\nquestions have been investigated quite carefully for the traditional Mincer regression variables\nof education and experience (Lemieux, 2006), but less attention has been paid to the other\nvariables.\nGiven this uncertainty around the appropriate functional form, one approach is to allow\nfor the maximum flexibility in the log-wage regression, (9). To do this, one would treat each\npossible combination of values of the included variables as a worker type. This boils down to\nrunning a fully non-parametric regression in which x is a vector with separate dummies for\nj\neach worker type. The fitted log wage, x(cid:48)β ˆ , for each worker type in that case is the average\ni\nlog-wageforworkerswiththatcombinationofvaluesfortheincludedvariables. Thisapproach,\nthough flexible, results in a significant loss of degrees of freedom.\nFor example, if we only consider age and education, restrict the population under consid-\neration to 16-64 year olds, and distinguish 16 educational categories (as is the case with most\nstandard U.S. micro datasets), then this regression has 768 estimated parameters correspond-\ning to the 768 possible permutations of age and education in the data. In practice many of\nthese worker types will contain very few observations in the data. For those worker types\nfor which there is only one observation the standard error of the estimated mean log-wage is\ninfinite, i.e. σ = ∞.\ni\nThough such a non-parametric regression might result in a very good fit, the heterogeneity\nin marginal products of labor across worker types will be estimated with a high degree of\nuncertainty.\nStratum-basedmethodologies, whichhavebeenusedextensivelyinpriorgrowthaccounting\nexercisesthataccountforlaborquality(Gollop&Jorgenson,1983;Jorgensonet al. ,1987;Ho&\nJorgenson,1999;Jorgensonet al. ,2014),areaformofthistypeofdummyregression. Stratum-\nbased studies define worker types by partitioning the population by observable characteristics,\nwith the mean wage of each partition being interpreted as the wage for workers of that type.\nIn practice, in order not to run into the curse of dimensionality described above, stratum-\n14\n\nbased studies do not treat each value of a variable as distinct. Instead, they group different\nvalues of the variables together. For example, the 16 educational categories are often col-\nlapsed into less-than-high-school, high-school, some college, and college categories. Using a\nless granular partition regains some degrees of freedom but with a loss of some flexibility in\nthe functional form. How granular a partition can be used largely depends on the sample size\nof the dataset used.\nIn the context of the regression framework that we use here, this grouping of values imposes\nmultidimensional step functions on the data. Thus, although the most granular partitions\nresult in a non-parametric regression that will have an R2 that is at least as high as any other\nregression specification, the partitions used in practice actually impose a restrictive functional\nform that does not necessarily fit the data better than alternative model specifications.\nConcernsaboutthestepfunctionsimposedbypartitioneddummyregressionshaveledsome\nresearchers to hew more closely to the Mincer-regression literature (Aaronson & Sullivan, 2001;\nBureau of Labor Statistics, 1993). These specifications focus on education and experience as\nthe fundamental drivers of human capital, marginal product, and wages.17 These regressions\ngenerally include education (either as a polynomial in years of education or as a set of dummies\nindicating levels of educational attainment) and a polynomial in experience.\nIn addition to the baseline education and experience variables, these human capital specifi-\ncations often include some interaction between gender and experience to account for women’s\nhigher rate of part-time work and temporary withdrawal from the labor force (either as an\ninteraction between gender and experience or by estimating the regression on men and women\nseparately). In some cases (Aaronson & Sullivan, 2001; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1993,\n2015a,b) they also include control variables like part-time status, marital status, veteran’s\nstatus, race, and rural location. These variables are not included to capture differences in\nmarginal products across workers but instead to reduce omitted variable bias in the education\nand experience coefficients.\n17As commonly done, we define experience as the difference between age and years of education (plus six).\n15\n\nComparison of specifications\nBetween the question of which variables to include and what functional form to impose, the\ntask of selecting a preferred regression specification for a labor quality measure is quite daunt-\ning. Even in the narrowed down set of variables we consider, age, education, gender, race,\nindustry, and occupation, there are several options on how to group their values. For each of\nthe six variables we use, Table 1 lists how many different classifications we consider for our\ncomparison of model specifications. In the last four columns of each row, the table lists how\nmany groups are defined for each classification. For example, for age we consider two classifica-\ntions: one that splits the individuals up into 9 age groups and another into 13 age groups. The\nnumber of permutations across the different classifications of variables is 192. This includes\none classification for each of the variables. Once one allows for dropping variables, then the\npossible number of stratum specifications increases to 1,799. The most detailed one, which\nincludes the most granular classification for all variables, consists of 8,486,400 worker types.18\nAs noted, we apply the statistical tools R2 and σ˜ as two clear criteria on which we can\np\nbase our model specification decision. For our application we use the adjusted R2, i.e R ¯2, as\nit penalizes for overfitting the data. We consider the 80th percentile of the standard errors of\nthe estimated relative marginal product of labor across workers, i.e. we use σ˜ as our measure\n80\nof the reliability of the imputed wages.19\nWe complete our analysis using three different datasets. Our results are qualitatively very\nsimilar across datasets. For the sake of brevity, we present results obtained using the ACS,\nsince this is the dataset with the largest sample size.20\nFigure 1 illustrates the tradeoff between the goodness-of-fit, R\n¯2,\nand the precision of the\nwage imputation, σ˜ . Panel 1a shows the scatter plot in\n(cid:0)\nσ˜ ,R\n¯2 (cid:1)\nspace for all 1799 stratum-\n80 80\n18To put the amount of potential overfitting in perspective, this most granular definition of strata means\nthat, on average, there are less than 20 workers per worker type in the U.S., since civilian employment has\nnever exceeded 150 million.\n19In principle, the choice of p for the percentile is arbitrary. However, qualitatively all results that we\nemphasize in this section hold for choices of p > 75. The reason we do not use the mean is that, in the case\nof the stratum-based methods, σ = ∞ for all worker types with one observation. This would also make the\nj\nsample mean of the σ ’s go to ∞.\nj\n20See Appendix B for results based on CPS-ORG and CPS-ASEC data.\n16\n\nbased model specifications from Table 1. This panel shows how increasing the R\nˆ2\nof the model\nspecification comes at the cost of the precision with which the relative marginal products are\nimputed, i.e. an increase in σ˜ . Because a higher R\nˆ2\nand lower σ˜ are preferred, we are\n80 80\nfocusing on specifications that move us to the upper-left in the plotted\n(cid:0)\nσ˜ ,R\n¯2 (cid:1)\nspace.\n80\nPanel 1b shows the same 1799 points as panel 1a with two sets of points highlighted. The\nredcrossesarethe192stratumspecificationsthatincludeallsixvariablesweconsider, withthe\ndifference being the level of granularity at which the variables are classified.

At the other end of the cloud of points are the ones highlighted as red circles. These\nare the specifications that do not include age and education. The blue points are specifications\nthat include age and education but not all four of other variables. When we compare the red\ncircles with the blue points we find that, among the blue points, there are several specifications\nthat have a substantially higher R\n¯2\nand not much higher levels of σ˜ .\n80\nWefindthataddingoccupationaldummiestothestratumdefinitionsthatalreadycondition\non age and education, yields the greatest improvement in fit and a relatively small decline in\nthe precision of the imputed wages. This can be seen from panel 1c, which highlights the\nspecifications that add only occupations as green dots. As can be seen from the figure, adding\noccupationaddsabout0.1totheR\n¯2\nbutincreasesσ˜ onlyslightly. Incontrast,addingindustry\n80\nalone, depicted by the red squares, does not improve the fit as much as adding occupation and\nresults in lower precision with which the wages are imputed. 21 Adding both industry and\noccupation results in values of σ˜ well above 0.5. This means that for more than 20 percent\n80\nof the strata log-wages are imputed with a standard error of more than 0.5 (65 percent).\nPanel 1d adds gender and race/ethnicity to the stratum definitions that include education\nand age. Race/ethnicity only slightly increases the fit at the cost of a substantial reduction in\nthe precision of the marginal product imputation. Gender does increase the fit substantially.\nThe question is what part of the variation in wages that is captured by gender reflects marginal\n21Ofcourse,forsomepurposes,suchasestimatingindustry-specificlabor-qualityindices,includingindustry\ndummies may still be necessary.\n17\n\nproduct differentials. In our analysis, the in- or exclusion of gender does not have a large effect\non our estimates of labor-quality growth. As such, we exclude gender from our specifications\nin the rest of this paper.\nIn addition to the stratum-based model specifications, we also consider Mincer-type regres-\nsions. In particular, the baseline Mincer specification on which we settled includes a quadratic\npolynomial in experience and 5 education dummies.22 Because our stratum-based analysis\nsuggests that occupation is an important determinant of wages, we also consider a baseline-\nplus-occupation specification which adds 51 occupation dummies.23\nFigure 2 compares the regression-based fit and precision of imputed wages for the baseline\nand baseline-plus-occupation specifications with the stratum-based specifications. The lower\ncross in the figure shows the point for the baseline specification and the lower blue dots are the\nstratum-based points that only include age and education. Because the Mincer-type regres-\nsion is more parsimonious than the semi-parametric regressions, it results in more precisely\nimputed marginal product levels across workers, i.e. it has a smaller σ˜ . Moreover, the quar-\n80\ntic polynomial in experience captures more of the variations in wages across workers than\nthe piecewise linear specifications implied by the stratum-based methods. Consequently the\nregression results in a higher R\n¯2.\nThus, the flexibility of the semi-parametric specification\nthat Zoghi (2010) emphasizes when she proposes to use stratum-based medians as estimates of\nwages,24 is outperformed by the quartic polynomial in experience that we use here. As a result,\nthe Mincer-regression based way of imputing wages dominates the stratum-based methods in\nterms of both model-selection criteria.\nThis is not only true for the baseline regression specification. It is also true for the one that\nincludes occupational dummies. In Figure 2 the upper cross corresponds to the baseline-plus-\noccupations regression and the upper cloud of blue dots to the corresponding stratum-based\n22A similar Mincer specification, with the addition of several control variables, was also used by Aaronson\n& Sullivan (2001),\n23We focus on this parsimonious baseline specification in the main text and illustrate that our main quali-\ntative results are unaltered when additional covariates are included as controls in Appendix B.\n24The regression framework we use here results in the conditional mean for a stratum to be the imputed\nwage. In unreported results we redid our analysis with the conditional median as the wage estimate and\nobtained the same results compared to the Mincer specifications.\n18\n\nregressions that include age, education, and occupation. Again, the Mincer-regression-based\nspecification outperforms the stratum-based ones.\nThis evidence shows that our baseline and baseline-plus-occupation specifications perform\nwell in terms of our two model-selection criteria.\n3.3 Index formula\nGiven the choice of the vector x and the period-by-period estimates of the parameter vector\nj\nˆ\nβ , based on (9), the final choice to be made for the calculation of the labor-quality index is\nt\nthe index formula.\nIn line with the log-linear approximation of (4), the index formula that is used for most\nlabor-quality index calculations is of the Translog form and estimates labor-quality growth as\nthe compensation-share weighted average of log changes in hours across worker types.25 That\nis,\nn (cid:18) (cid:19)\n(cid:88) s +s (cid:16) (cid:17)\ngˆLQ = i,t i,t−1 (∆h −∆h), where W ˆ (x ) = exp x(cid:48)β ˆ (11)\nt 2 i t i i t\ni=1\nˆ\nW (x )H\nt i i,t\nand s = . (12)\ni,t (cid:80)n\nW\nˆ\n(x )H\ns=1 t s s,t\nThis translog index formula has the desirable property that it is a so-called superlative index\n(Diewert, 1978). That is, it is an exact index for a function (the translog) that provides a\ngeneral second-order approximation of the production function. In other words, the labor-\nquality index does not rely simply on a first-order approximation (though we used such an\napproximation in our derivation in Section 2 for expositional clarity).\nFor labor quality, implementation of the translog formula is complicated by the fact that\nin some cases the number of hours worked by a worker type, i is zero. In that case ∆h can\ni\nnot be calculated and such worker types are dropped from the calculations. Though dropping\nthese worker types is a reasonable option, because their compensation share is, presumably,\n25Compensation share are averaged across the two periods between which growth rates are calculated.\n19\n\nsmall, one can also use another superlative price index formula that does not suffer from this\nproblem.\nThis is what we do in this paper. In particular, we follow Aaronson & Sullivan (2001) and\nuse a Fisher Ideal index formula of the form\n(cid:40) (cid:41)1 (cid:40) (cid:41)1\n(cid:26) H (cid:27) (cid:80) W ˆ (x )H 2 (cid:80) W ˆ (x )H 2\ngˆLQ = t−1 i t i i,t i t−1 i i,t −1.

This is useful for two reasons. First, by comparing historical results for\ndifferent specifications and datasets, we can assess how sensitive the labor-quality growth\nestimates are to the different choices discussed in Section 3. Second, and most importantly,\nthe concerns about plateauing educational attainment and the retirement of experienced older\nworkers that many observers currently express were also raised as concerns in the early 2000’s.\nOur historical analysis shows that, contrary to these concerns, labor-quality growth barely\n26For our benchmark specification, the problem of zeros does not occur, and the Translog and Fisher are\nvirtually identical. It can make a little more difference in cases with extremely large numbers of cells, where\nthere are more zeros.\n27Note that exponentiating the predicted log-wage would not normally be sufficient to get a predicted wage\nin levels because\nE[w ]=E[exp(x β+(cid:15) )]=E[exp(x β)+((cid:15) )]=exp(x β)·E[exp((cid:15) )]\nj j j j j j j\nand E[exp((cid:15) )] is not 1. It is, however, a constant if the residuals are assumed to be independently and\nj\nidentically distributed. So if Wˆ =exp(x β) and c=E[exp((cid:15) )], then plugging the predictions into the share\ni j j\nof the wage bill calculation from (7) gives\nW H cWˆ H cWˆ H Wˆ H\ni i ≡ i i = i i = i i .\n(cid:80)n j=1 W j H j (cid:80)n j=1 cWˆ j H j c (cid:80)n j=1 Wˆ j H j (cid:80)n j=1 Wˆ j H j\nTherefore we need not make any adjustments to the predictions, nor do we need to impose an assumption on\nthe distribution of the residuals beyond the standard assumption that they are IID.\n20\n\nslowedoverthepast15years. Thisrealizationoflabor-qualitygrowthowesmuchtoareduction\nin the employment rates of less productive individuals, especially during and after the Great\nRecession. We will return to this point in the projection section.\n4.1 Comparison across methods and datasets\nAs we discussed in Section 3, we construct our benchmark labor-quality index using ACS data\nbased on our baseline Mincer specification. The index for labor quality obtained from this\nspecification is plotted as the blue line, labeled Regression - age and education, in Figure 3a.\nFrom 2002 through 2013 the cumulative growth in the index was 5.96 percent, which is 0.53\nannually. As the figure shows, labor-quality growth has been far from constant at this average\nduring our sample period. Its standard deviation across years is 0.39. From 2002 to 2006 labor\nquality by this measure grew relatively slowly, about 0.37 percent per year. Subsequently,\nduring the Great Recession from 2008-2010 labor-quality growth logged in at 0.94 percent a\nyear. Since then it has come down to 0.36 percent.\nIn Section 3 we showed how our baseline specification outperformed many others in terms\nof goodness of fit of the log-wage regression as well as the precision of imputed wages. In\nterms of labor-quality growth our baseline specification yields an estimate that is very close\nto those obtained using other specifications that include age and education. This can also\nbe seen in Figure 3a. As the figure plots, the stratum- and regression-based methods give\nvery similar estimates of the labor-quality index when both age and education are included in\nthe vector x . Moreover, the index constructed does not change very much when we use the\ni\nbaseline-plus-occupation specification instead of the baseline specification.\nAmong the series plotted in Figure 3a there are two clear outliers that exhibit much less cu-\nmulative labor-quality growth. The first is the stratum-specification that includes all variables.\nSuch a specification results in large errors in imputed wages, which reduces the correlation be-\ntween hours growth and wages that drives labor-quality growth. As a result, the overfitted\nspecification yields much less labor-quality growth than our baseline model. The other outlier\n21\n\nseries is the version that excludes age and education entirely (the underfit stratum). That\nseries is flat, confirming that age and education are what drive the series.\nExcluding the two outlier series, the cross-specification mean of average annual growth\nrates of labor quality is equal to the average annual labor-quality growth rate implied by\nour baseline index, namely 0.53 annually. The cross-specification standard deviation in these\naverage annual rates is 0.03. Besides very similar mean growth rates, all these indices also\nshow a very similar qualitative pattern over the sample period: Slow growth from 2002-2006,\nan acceleration during the Great Recession, and a subsequent slowdown in 2011 and 2012.\nThe results in Figure 3a are reminiscent of Zoghi (2010)28 in that she suggests that es-\ntimated average annual labor-quality growth rates are fairly robust to the choice of model\nspecification. This robustness of estimated average annual labor-quality growth rates also\ntranslates across datasets.\nThis can be seen from Figure 3b. It plots the baseline and baseline-plus-occupation results\nfor the three datasets that we consider in this paper, i.e. for ACS, CPS-ASEC, and CPS-\nORG. The six indices plotted look very similar.29 In terms of their summary statistics, the\nmean average annual labor-quality growth rate across series in the figure is 0.49 percent with\na standard deviation of 0.03.\nTogether, these results suggest that the pattern of labor-quality growth from 2002 through\n2013 we find using our baseline case is not the result of the particular specification or dataset\nchosen. Indeed, we find this pattern for all reasonable model specifications and across all data\nsets. Overall, we conclude that from 2002-2013 labor quality has grown around 0.5 percent a\nyear. This is about the same as the average of about 0.5 percent labor-quality growth between\n1992 and 2002 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015a; Fernald, 2015).\n28See Zoghi (2010) Table 12.2, page 478.\n29The only exception is the ACS-based indices in 2005-2006. In this year the sample size of the ACS was\nexpanded from 1 to 3 million respondents, which appears to have resulted in a sample with a slightly lower\nlevel of labor quality than before.\n22\n\n4.2 Counterfactuals to identify the sources of growth\nThe fact that we find no substantial deceleration in labor-quality growth since 2002 is surpris-\ning, especiallygiventheslowgrowthofeducationalattainmentandthebeginningofretirement\namong the oldest baby boomers, during the period. Our analysis shows that as these adverse\ndemographic and educational trends were pulling down labor-quality growth, a disproportion-\nate decline in the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio of lower quality worker types was\npushing it up. To illustrate this, we calculate three counterfactual historical indices, which are\nplotted in Figure 4.\nThese counterfactuals take advantage of the fact that hours worked by workers of type i,\nH , are the product of (i) average hours worked per year by workers of this type, η , (ii) the\ni i\nEPOP of these workers, E , and (iii) the population of these workers, P . That is,\ni i\nH = η E P . (14)\ni i i i\nUsing this expression, we can create different counterfactuals by holding one of the three\nfactors, i.e. η , E , and P , fixed at its 2002 level. We then allow the other two factors to\ni i i\nchange as observed in the data.\nFigure 4 shows our baseline estimate, labeled observed index, as well as the three counter-\nfactual indices. As can be seen from the figure, changes in average hours worked across worker\ntypes have had relatively little impact on labor-quality growth. In contrast, if the composi-\ntion of the population had not changed since 2002 then labor-quality growth would have been\nabout a third lower. This is because removing population changes eliminates the continued\naccumulation of experience of the baby boom generation from the calculations.\nThe most striking of the three counterfactuals, however, is the one for the EPOP ratio.\nFrom Figure 4 it is clear that if EPOP ratios by worker type had remained at their 2002\nlevels labor-quality growth would have been half of what we observed over the past decade.\nNotably, the wedge between the observed index and the counterfactual with constant EPOP\nratios increased most rapidly during the Great Recession. This wedge is consistent with the\n23\n\nextensivelydocumentedcompositioneffectofrecessionsonrealwages. Manystudies, including\nthose by Bils (1985) and Solon et al. (1994), find that the incidence of unemployment is more\ncyclical among low-wage workers.\nIn growth-accounting terms, this cyclical composition effect means that labor quality has a\ncountercyclical component (Ferraro, 2014). This is reflected in the strong negative correlation\nof around -0.9 between labor-quality growth and hours growth as measured by our baseline\nspecification. This negative correlation is quite robust across specifications: Figure 5 plots the\ncorrelations for all of the labor quality specifications plotted in Figure 3a except the overfit and\nunderfitstratumspecifications, andallofthecorrelationsarestronglynegative. Animplication\nof this negative correlation is that it is important to jointly forecast labor quality and hours\nworked to get a robust estimate of labor input going forward.\nAs discussed, our labor-quality index captures the fact that EPOP ratios among lower\nquality worker types are more cyclical. And our counterfactuals show that the disproportion-\nate decline in employment rates among less-skilled workers led to a recession-driven increase\nin labor-quality growth. Therefore, an important question for any medium-term forecast of\nlabor-quality growth is to what extent these movements in EPOP ratios by worker types are\ntransitory or permanent. Since a large part of the decline in these EPOP ratios reflects de-\nclines in labor force participation rates, this is largely a question of what fraction of recent\nmovements in labor force participation is structural versus cyclical.\nIf labor force participation rebounds substantially, as Congressional Budget Office (2015)\nprojects, this will put downward pressure on labor-quality growth over our forecast horizon.\nHowever, if, as Aaronson et al. (2014) suggest, the bulk of the movements in participation\nrates across groups since 2007 have been structural, then our labor-quality index would be\nlargely unaffected. In that case there would be no downward pressure on labor-quality growth\ncoming from changes in labor force participation by skill level.\nThis finding highlights an important lesson from our analysis. We should not be misled\nby the positive sound of “increases in labor quality” due to composition effects. Often, labor\nquality is discussed assuming a path of total hours. But an important factor driving labor-\n24\n\nqualitygrowthsincetheearly2000shasbeendeclinesinhours(oraslowdowninhoursgrowth)\nfor lower-skilled workers. From (4) we know that what matters for output growth is the growth\nrate of the total labor input, which is hours growth plus labor-quality growth. Hence, if labor\nquality grows as a result of a selection effect among workers when total hours decline, then\nthis is neither necessarily good news for growth of overall labor input nor for output growth.\n5 Projecting labor-quality growth\nIn this section we consider the outlook for labor-quality growth over the next ten years. We\nbegin by reviewing the components of labor-quality growth projections. We then evaluate\nthe performance of our baseline specification for 2002-2013, paying particular attention to\nthe components that have contributed most to historical projection errors. Guided by these\nfindings we provide a range of alternative scenarios for future labor-quality growth in both the\nmedium and longer run.\n5.1 Components of labor-quality growth projections\nAs previously discussed, the index for labor quality, equation (13), is a highly non-linear\nfunction of the parameter vector β and hours worked by worker type H . The fact that\nt i\nwages and hours are endogenous to one another further complicates the problem. In practice,\nproducing an optimal forecast of labor-quality growth based on the joint distribution of future\nlog-wage regression coefficients and future hours worked by worker type is not feasible.\nIn its place, researchers generally project labor-quality growth by projecting independently\nthe log-wage parameter vector, β, and the hours worked by worker type, H , and substitute\ni\nthemintoequation(13).30 Giventhattime-variationintheβsaccountsforaverysmallportion\nof labor-quality growth over time, the convention is to hold log-wage parameters constant\n(Aaronson & Sullivan, 2001; Jorgenson et al. , 2015). We follow this convention and set\n30This gives a joint projection of hours and labor quality, which is important given the negative correlation\nbetween hours and quality documented in Section 4.2\n25\n\nˆ ˆ\nβ = β .\nt+h 2013\nˆ\nTurning to hours, recall that hours worked by worker type, H , can be decomposed into\ni,t+h\nthe three factors as in equation (14), namely (i) average hours, ηˆ , (ii) the EPOP rate,\ni,t+h\nˆ ˆ\nE , and (iii) population, P . Historically accounting for heterogeneity in average hours\ni,t+h i,t+h\nworked by worker type does not make a material difference. This is highlighted in Figure 6\nwhich plots the observed baseline index against an employment-based index constructed under\nthe assumption that all workers work the same number of hours, i.e. η = η for all i. The\ni,t t\nemployment-based index shows average annual labor-quality growth of 0.61 percent, about a\ntenth of a percentage point higher than the 0.53 obtained from the hours-based index.31 Given\nthe modest difference, and the significant challenges associated with projecting heterogeneous\nhours worked, we set ηˆ = η for all worker types i. We use this 0.61 percent observed\ni,t+h t+h\naverage annual growth of labor quality as our baseline for comparing the observed index with\nforecasts.32\n5.2 Historical projection accuracy and sources of error\nIn this section we examine how our baseline projection specification would have performed for\nthe 2002-2013 sample period. Specifically, we compare our projection to observed labor-quality\ngrowth and use an informal decomposition to evaluate the sources of forecast errors. Following\nAaronson & Sullivan (2001) we build our projections using Census Bureau 2000 (“middle”)\nNational Population Projections by age, gender, and race.33 To obtain population projections\nfor all age and education combinations, we apply a multinominal logit model that estimates\n31This difference between the hours-worked-based and employment-based indices is even smaller in the\nCPS-ORG and CPS-ASEC data than in the ACS (see Appendix B).\n32Notethatourbaselinespecificationdoesnotincludeoccupation. Includingoccupationrequiresprojecting\npopulation and EPOP ratios by age, education, and occupation. This turns out to result in very imprecise\nprojections, since projections of employment by occupation, without considerations by age and education,\nalready have large errors. This can be seen in Figure 7, which plots the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ actual\nversus projected growth in employment between 1996 and 2006 by 6-digit SOC codes. To avoid introducing\nthese errors into our projections, we limit ourselves to projections using our baseline specification.\n33Our projection method is differs from Aaronson & Sullivan (2001) in the following ways: we distinguish\nfiveracialgroupsinsteadoffour, defineemploymentmorenarrowlytobeconsistentwithoursampleselection,\nand use ACS data.\n26\n\nthe probability distribution of our five educational levels, based on age, cohort, gender, and\nrace. We use these estimated probabilities to construct population projections by age and\nˆ\neducation, i.e. to construct P , for each year. Finally, to project the age and education\ni,t+h\nˆ\nspecific EPOP ratios, E , we estimate the probability that an individual is employed as a\ni,t+h\nfunction of age, cohort, and education, using logit models that vary by gender and race.34\nTheresultsareshowninFigure8. ThetoplineinPanel8ashowstheobservedemployment-\nbased index of labor quality which grew at an average annual pace of 0.61 percent. The\nbottom line in Panel 8a shows our projection of labor-quality growth as of 2002. The results\nare strikingly different, our projection expected average annual labor-quality growth to rise\njust 0.19 percent, well below the pace observed over the period. This large difference result\nis consistent with projections by Aaronson & Sullivan (2001) which used a slightly different\nmodel specification and CPS-ASEC data rather than ACS.\nThe remaining lines in the panel 8a plot counterfactual indices that replace (a) projected\ndemographics with observed demographics and (b) projected log-wage regression parameters\nwith observed parameters. The line labeled “2002 betas; observed demographics” is much\ncloser to the actual index than the forecast index, suggesting that errors in the projected\ndemographic variables account for a substantial portion of the forecast error over the period.\nIn contrast, the line labeled “Observed betas; projected demographics” is very close to our\nbaseline projection and far from the observed index. This suggests that time-variation in the\nlog-wage regression parameters accounts for a very small portion of the forecast errors. Panel\n8a also shows that the bulk of the forecast errors accumulate during the Great Recession.\nˆ\nIn other words, deviations in demographics, H , from their projections, H , in the Great\ni,t i,t\nRecession account for much of the forecast error.\nPanel 8b takes a closer look at the specific demographic variables contributing to the large\nprojection errors. The lines labeled “All observed” and “All projected” are the “Observed\n34Because the first ACS data were released in 2002, we cannot use ACS data for the estimation of the\nEPOP and educational attainment models. Instead, we estimate these models using 1992-1997 data from the\nCPS-ORG for this historical forecast. The full technical details of this projection are provided in subsection\nA.2 of Appendix A.\n27\n\nindex” and “Observed betas; projected demographics” lines from Panel 8a. The line labeled\n“Observed age & education; proj employment” reflects an alternative index based on observed\ncomponents of the demographics, less the EPOP ratios, for which we use projections. The\ndifference between this line and the “All observed” index isolates the effect of projection errors\nin EPOP ratios across worker types. As can be seen from the figure, these errors account\nfor about one-third of the cumulative forecast error in labor-quality growth and are especially\nimportant after the onset of the Great Recession in 2008. The line “Observed age; proj\neducation & employment” shows that projection errors in educational attainment also account\nfor about one-third of the forecast error in labor-quality growth. The remaining error owes\nto misses in Census’ population projections.35 Notably, the projection errors in for education\nand population accumulate relatively smoothly over our sample period.\n5.3 Projections of future labor-quality growth\nGoing forward most commentators project labor-quality growth will be slower than its histor-\nical pace. This view stems from the fact that the exceptional increases in U.S. educational\nattainment during the 20th century seem unlikely to be repeated (Goldin & Katz, 2009).\nHowever, as we will show, this oversimplifies the uncertainties surrounding the future path of\nlabor-quality growth both in the medium and the longer run. To illustrate these uncertainties\nand how they relate to various components of labor-quality growth we consider three potential\nfuture paths for educational attainment and employment-to-population rates and assess how\nthese paths affect estimates of future labor-quality growth in the medium and longer run.\nThese alternative paths, which are briefly described below and fully explained in Appendix\nA.3, illustrate the mechanics of how different economic forces influence future labor quality.\nGiven the limited role of the β (which capture relative returns to experience and education)\n35Since this is not a formal decomposition we are not accounting for the nonlinear contributions associated\nwith interactions between the Census demographics, distribution of education, and employment rates. These\ninteractions,however,appeartoberelativelyminorcomparedtothefirst-ordercontributionsofdemographics,\neducation, and employment.\n28\n\nin the accuracy of the historical projections, we hold at them fixed at their 2013 values.36 To\nallow sufficient time for the economy to recover from the effects of the Great Recession we\ndefine the medium term as 2015-2022. The longer run is 2022-2025.\nFor employment-to-population, we consider three alternative paths. The paths are meant\nto illustrate a range of potential outcomes.\n(i) Cyclical rebound, or ’revert’: Age-education specific EPOP rates return to 2007 values,\nbetween 2015 and 2022, and remain there. This scenario corresponds to the view that the\nchanges in EPOP rates for specific age-education groups were cyclical.37\n(ii) Structural change, or ’persist’: Age-education specific EPOP rates remain at 2013\nlevels. This scenario corresponds to the view that much of the decline in EPOP rates following\nthe Great Recession is permanent.\n(iii) Extrapolated 2002-2007 structural trends in EPOPs: The final path allows for hetero-\ngeneous paths across groups. Specifically, it extrapolates the declining EPOP rates of young\npeople(withheterogeneityacrosseducationgroups), theincreasingEPOPratesofolderpeople\n(particularly the more educated), and the widening gap between the EPOP rates of more and\nless educated prime-age people (Dennett & Modestino, 2013; Burtless, 2013; Aaronson et al. ,\n2014).\nThe paths above illustrate how changes in various EPOP rates affect future U.S. labor-\nquality growth.\nWe also consider three alternative paths for educational attainment. Again, these paths\nare meant to highlight a range of potential outcomes.\n(i) Revert to pre-crisis levels During the Great Recession enrollment and graduation rates\nrose. This path assumes that the increase was a temporary cyclical effect and rates will return\nto their pre-crisis levels.\n36An alternative approach to projections of education and employment would be to use a statistical model,\nfollowing Aaronson & Sullivan (2001). Experiments with this methodology produced variable results that\nappear less reliable, especially in the more distant future, than the methods we employ here.\n37Both the cyclical (i) and structural (ii) paths allow for a demographically (or educationally) driven struc-\nturaldeclineintheaggregateemployment-to-populationratio. However,theydonotallowastructuraldecline\n(or increase) in age-education specific EPOPs.\n29\n\n(ii) Persist at 2013 educational plateau This alternative assumes that the uptick in educa-\ntional attainment in recent years persists through future cohorts. Specifically, 2013 rates of\neducational attainment carry forward for each cohort over the next decade.\n(iii) Extrapolate 2007-2013 trends in education The final path assumes that the uptick in\neducational attainment over the past several years represents a resumed upward trend. Projec-\ntions are based on age-specific time trends in educational attainment from logistic regressions.\nTable 2 shows projections for 2015-22. All scenarios incorporate the Census Bureau’s\npopulation projections by age group. In addition, the scenarios incorporate differing medium-\nrun cyclical dynamics for employment rates and education. The columns of the table show\nthe three alternative EPOP assumptions. The rows show the three educational attainment\nassumptions. For each cell, the first number shows growth in labor quality and the second\nshows growth in hours. (Note that, since we do not model average hours worked, hours grow\nat the same rate as employment growth.38)\nA notable takeaway from the Table 2 is the potentially negative correlation in the medium\nrun between growth in hours and growth in labor quality. The negative correlation appears\nin the two “level” EPOP scenarios. The “persist” (structural) scenario results in 0.35-0.36pp\nfaster labor-quality growth than the “revert” (cyclical) scenario. However, this is fully offset\nby 0.35-0.39pp slower growth in hours. As a result, growth of total labor input grows at 0.59-\n0.67pp per year in all of the scenarios in columns 2 and 3. This negative correlation highlights\nthe importance of jointly modeling these two variables to obtain a forecast for quality-adjusted\nhours.\nThe near-invariance of quality-adjusted-hours growth across the level scenarios seems sur-\nprising at first glance. Intuitively, an extra hour of work should add something to quality-\nadjusted hours—albeit more if it involves higher-skilled workers. The reason for the near-\ninvariance in Table 2 is that low-skilled and high-skilled workers have seen an opposite pattern\nin EPOP ratios since 2007. Employment rates of lower-skilled workers have fallen while rates\n38 Thisisequivalenttoassumingthatallworkersworkthesamenumberofhours,acounterfactualassump-\ntion but one which has been relatively innocuous historically (see Figures 6 and B.4).\n30\n\nfor higher-skilled workers have risen. Thus, the “revert” scenario includes not only a rise in\nemployment by lower-skilled workers but also a decline by higher-skilled workers.\nThe first column of Table 2, which extrapolates 2002-07 EPOP trends, looks quite different\nfrom the others. In this case, we see markedly stronger growth in both labor quality and\nhours. For lower-skilled workers, there was little pre-recession trend in EPOP rates. For this\ngroup of workers, this extrapolation-based scenario thus looks similar to the “revert” scenario,\nwhich boosts hours but holds labor quality down. But for higher-skilled and older workers, the\npre-recession trend was to increase employment rates. These workers tended to be below their\nestimated trend in 2013. Hence, in this scenario, these workers add both hours and skills to\nthe labor force between 2015 and 2022. For both groups, hours increase quickly as employment\nrates rise. For labor quality, the extra hours of high-skilled workers dominate and labor quality\nrises more quickly.\nFinally, looking down the columns, for none of the cases do the education scenarios matter\nmuch between 2015 and 2022. Extrapolating the rising educational trend from 2007-13 (row\n1) matters only a few basis points over this time period. The dominant force in the medium\nrun is thus what happens to employment rates.\nTurningtothelongerrun, Table3showsprojectionsfor2022-2025. Thesescenariosassume\nthat all cyclical/transitional dynamics will have taken place by 2022.\nIn the longer run, educational trends do matter. Looking down the three columns, the\neducational-extrapolation row implies almost 2/10ths pp faster growth in labor quality than\nthe “revert” or “persist” rows, with minimal difference in hours worked. Of course, this\neducational-extrapolation path assumes a considerable acceleration in educational attainment\nrelative to what we have seen since WWII. Our reading of the data so far is that there is\nlittle indication that such an educational acceleration is actually happening. Rather, we view\none of the plateau scenarios for educational attainment as more plausible—either the scenario\nwhere educational attainment for entering cohorts reverts to its 2007 levels, or where it persists\nat its 2013 levels. The CPS data suggest that some of the Great-Recession-induced increase\n31\n\nin educational attainment of younger cohorts may already be reversing.39 The “revert” and\n“persist” rows of Table 3 are very similar for both labor quality and hours. Relative to\nthe revert or persist scenarios—which are very similar—we take the predictions from the\neducational extrapolation scenario as an upside risk for labor quality.\nFinally, we consider the importance of employment rates for longer-run projections of labor\nquality. In the longer-run, only trends in EPOP rates matter. Indeed, the two ‘level’ columns\nlookverysimilartoeachother, showingthatinthelongerrunitmakes little differencewhether\nwe revert to pre-crisis EPOPs or remain at 2013 EPOPs.\n5.4 Putting it all together\nThe previous section highlighted the uncertainties around any forecast of labor-quality growth\nboth in the medium and longer-run. Here we provide a judgmental assessment of the most\nlikely path for labor quality in the longer-run. Looking at the bottom right two cells of Table\n3, where education plateaus and EPOPs remain level, we project labor-quality growth of about\n0.1 percent per year and hours growth of a little above 0.4 percent per year. Quality-adjusted\nhours in these scenarios grows a little above 0.5 percent per year.\nAlthoughthese‘level’scenariosareareasonablebenchmarkforthefuture, continuingshifts\nin EPOPs also seem plausible. Earlier, we found that these shifts were central to driving labor-\nquality growth from 2002-2013. This was also the case for the 2002-2007 period, before the\nemployment effects of the Great Recession. Going forward, there is certainly the potential for\ntechnological advances to continue to generate job polarization, to displace low- and medium-\nskill workers, and/or to entice high-skill workers to increase their labor supply. If these trends\nwere all to continue at their 2002-2007 pace, then it would lead to some longer-run boost in\nlabor quality, though the effect on hours is ambiguous.\nOne particular unknown in this regard is whether older, more educated workers will con-\ntinue to work longer than they have historically. For example, suppose we extrapolate EPOP\n39AdditionalevidenceforareversalcomesfromCensusdataoncollegeenrollmentsrelativetothepopulation\naged 16-24. That enrollment rate peaked in 2011 and has since retreated somewhat.\n32\n\ntrends only for those over 55 years of age—a situation that would boost both labor quality and\nhours. With that limited extrapolation, we would see hours growth of about 0.55 percent and\nlabor-quality growth of about 0.15 percent, implying quality-adjusted hours growth of about\n0.70 percent per year. In the 2022-25 period, these figures are not affected by whether other\nemployment rates revert to pre-crisis levels or remain at 2013 levels.\nTrends for individuals under age 55 are more nuanced and challenging to predict. In the\nextrapolation scenarios, educated prime-aged workers tend to work more, while less-educated\nprime-aged workers tend to work less. We think it is unlikely that the trends continue at the\nearlier pace captured by the extrapolation column in Table 3; but, qualitatively, the trends\nmight continue in the same direction. That would suggest that it is plausible labor quality\ngrows a little faster than 0.15 percent per year (the pace in the previous paragraph, where we\nextrapolate EPOP trends only for those over 55). The effect on hours would be small, since\nthe trends somewhat offset.\nThus, in the longer run, a projection of 0.10-0.25 percent growth in labor quality and\nperhaps 0.4 to 0.55 for hours is a plausible judgmental baseline.\n6 Conclusion\nHistorically, rising labor quality was an important source of growth in U.S. GDP per hour.\nGoing forward, this source of growth is likely to slow markedly. Indeed, our preferred forecast\nis that, in the longer run (2022-25), labor quality is likely to rise in the range of 0.10 to 0.25\npercent per year. This implies that growth in quality-adjusted hours in the range of 0.5 to 0.8\npercent per year is plausible, with a range of 0.7 to 0.8 percent per year seeming perhaps most\nlikely. To see a faster pace of labor-quality growth, closer to its historical average pace, would\nrequire a renewed, and sustained, upward trend in educational attainment. In a typical macro\nmodel, the slowdown in labor-quality growth passes through one-for-one to slower growth in\nproductivity and GDP.\nIn the 20th century, the main driver of labor-quality growth was rising educational attain-\n33\n\nment (Fernald & Jones, 2014; Ho & Jorgenson, 1999). In contrast, in our empirical estimates\nand forecasts for the 21st century, we find a very different source of labor-quality growth: The\ndiverging trends in employment rates for workers of different skills. Since 2002, employment\nrates for more educated, older individuals have risen whereas employment rates for less edu-\ncated, younger individuals have fallen. These diverging trends explain why previous forecasts\nthat labor quality would plateau (Aaronson & Sullivan, 2001) went awry—from 2002-13, labor\nquality turned out to grow at a pace even faster than it did in the second half of the 20th\ncentury because of changing employment dynamics.\nThese forecast-misses point to a broader lesson: It is essential to jointly examine growth in\nhours and growth in labor quality. Labor quality and hours are strongly negatively correlated\nin the short run, which implies that quality-adjusted hours are less variable than either quality\nor hours alone. Looking at hours or labor-quality growth independently can lead to inaccurate\nprojections of potential output growth.\nGoing forward, movements in employment-to-population rates for different worker types\ncontinue to be central to how future labor quality will evolve. In the medium run (2015-22),\nan important source of uncertainty is whether the diverging employment-rate movements seen\nsince 2007 are cyclical or structural. If employment rates (based on age and education) revert\nto 2007 levels, then growth in labor quality is likely to be negative as lower-skilled workers\nreturn to employment. In this case, labor quality in the next few years will at least partially\noffset the strong growth since 2007. In contrast, if the changes since 2007 are structural, then\ngrowth in labor quality will be considerably stronger, albeit not at rates seen historically.\nBut, once again, these alternative paths illustrate the importance of jointly modeling labor\nquality and hours. Quality-adjusted labor input turns out to grow at remarkably similar rates\nin the scenarios where employment-to-population rates revert to 2007 values (cyclical), or\nremain at 2013 values (structural), leaving overall output growth unchanged.\n34\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, & Sullivan, Daniel. 2001.

The first is\nthe American Community Survey (ACS), which is a smaller, annual version of the decennial\ncensus and collects a relatively narrow range of demographic and socioeconomic data on a\nsample of about 1 percent of the population (approximately 3 million individuals) each year.40\nThe second, the CPS-ORG, consists of the the outgoing rotation groups from the Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS). This is the quarter of CPS respondents that are asked about their\nearnings and income in any given month. This results in an annual sample of about 135,000\nindividuals. The final dataset, CPS-ASEC, is the Annual Social and Economic Supplement\nto the Current Population Survey, also known as the March supplement. It contains annual\nearnings and income data from the full March CPS sample (70,000 individuals). Though based\non different samples and sampling methods, each of the datasets allows for the construction of\nsimilarhourlywages, aswellasthesixvariablesofeducation, age, sex, race/ethnicity, industry,\nand occupation, that are our main focus.\nFor each dataset we construct the sample of workers to cover those in the civilian nonin-\nstitutional population ages 16+ that are employed in the private business sector (specifically,\nexcluding anyone with self-employment or government employment earnings) and have both\npositive earnings and positive hours. The sample period is 2002-2013, because that is the\nperiod for which we have a consistent set of occupation and industry crosswalks and data from\nall three datasets.41\nWe define wages as hourly wages. Wages are constructed in slightly different ways in each\n40The sample of the ACS has been expanded twice and has only been a 1 percent sample of the population\nsince 2006. In its first year, 2000, the sample was just under 400,000 individuals and between 2001 and 2005\nthe sample was slightly over 1 million\n41In principle, the CPS-ASEC is available starting in 1962 on and the CPS-ORG from 1979 on if industry\nand occupation are omitted or approximate crosswalks are used. The ACS is available from 2000 on without\nany need for adjustments.\n41\n\nofthedatasetsbecauseofdifferencesinreferenceperiodandquestionsasked. IntheCPS-ORG\nwe use the hourly wage as constructed in the National Bureau of Economic Researchs CPS\nLabor Extracts (Feenberg & Roth, 2007). For the CPS-ASEC and ACS we define hourly wages\nas total annual earnings divided by the product of usual hours worked per week and weeks\nworked per year.42 All wages are deflated into real 2005 dollars using the Consumer Price\nIndex for All Urban Consumers, and wages exclude self-employment, self-owned business, and\nfarm income.\nA.2 Projections of educational attainment and employment\nThe Census Bureau’s 2000 National Population Projections provides projections of the age,\ngender and race/ethnicity distribution of the population, but to forecast labor quality we\nneed to further break these cells down by educational attainment and employment rates.\nTo do so we follow a methodology similar to that used by Aaronson & Sullivan (2001)—\nour primary adjustments are that we use five race/ethnicity categories instead of four and\nwe define employment more narrowly as being employed exclusively in the private business\nsector to match the sample selection stated in Section A.1. Given that the methodology is\nsubstantively unchanged, this section is largely a restatement of Box 1 from (Aaronson &\nSullivan, 2001, p. 65).\nLet pj = P[y = j] for j = 1,...,5 by the probability that individual i in year t has educa-\nit it\ntional attainment j, where the five levels of attainment are less than high school, high school\ngraduate (including GEDs), some college (including associates degree holders), college gradu-\nates (Bachelor’s), and post-graduates, and let qj = P[y ≥ j|y ≥ j −1] for j = 2,...,5 be the\nit it it\nprobability of attaining education j given that the individual has completed the “prerequisite”\n42In 2008 the ACS switched from collecting weeks worked as a continuous to a categorical value (13 weeks\norless,14-26weeks,27-39weeks,40-47weeks,48or49weeks,and50-52weeks).

Themodelsforeducationlevelj areestimatedonthesampleofpeople\nwith at least j − 1 education and who are above an education-level specific age threshold.43\nFor the projections for the forecast error decomposition exercises in Section 5.2 the models are\nestimated on the CPS-ORGs from 1992 through 1999, the same period Aaronson & Sullivan\nused for their forecasts.44\nThe idea behind these models is that educational attainment follows some sort of lifecy-\ncle pattern, with the probability of completing a certain level of education increasing rapidly\nfor people under 30 and then more gradually for those who are older. This lifecycle pattern\nis assumed to be the same for different cohorts, but cohorts born in different years are al-\nlowed to have uniformly higher or lower log-odds of completing a given level of education. For\nhigh school, some college, and college levels of education the model is estimated separately\nfor each of ten gender-race-ethnicity combinations without any control variables (x ). For\nit\npost-graduates some of the gender-race-ethnicity samples become quite small, so the model\nis estimated separately for men and women with race/ethnicity dummies included as con-\n43The thresholds are 18 for high school, 19 for some college, 22 for college, and 26 for post-graduate.\n44IdeallythiswouldhavebeenestimatedonACSdatatoensureconsistencybetweentheseprojectionmodels\nandthelog-wageregression. However,inordertodistinguishageandcohorteffectstheprojectionmodelmust\nbe estimated on multiple years of data. Since there is no pre-2000 data for the ACS, this forces us to rely on\nanother dataset to construct the education and employment projections.\n43\n\ntrols. The estimated model is then used to predict the fraction of individuals with each level\nof educational attainment based on the Census Bureau projections of the age, gender, and\nrace/ethnicity distribution of the population.\nThe projection model is only able to estimate birth year coefficients (β ) for birth years\njb\nthat are observed in the sample. However, some birth years that are too young to be observed\nin the sample will be old enough to be in sample by later years of the projections — a child\nborn in 2000 is to young to be in any of our current samples, but by 2025 they will be 25 years\nold and of critical importance to our forecasts. Therefore we define these unobserved cohort\ncoefficients by a linear extrapolation using the last 15 birth year coefficients (not including the\nmost recent).45 In effect, this approach extrapolates recent trends in educational attainment\ninto the future.\nThis process yields projections of the population distribution of age and educational at-\ntainment, the key variables for our baseline Mincer specification. However, to construct our\nforecast of labor quality we must also project the EPOP rates for these worker types. Our\nEPOP projection model is identical to the educational attainment projection model, except\neducational attainment is added as a control variable. Rather than using the standard BLS\ndefinition of employment we define employment as being employed exclusively in the private\nbusiness sector — this makes our definition consistent with the sample selection used to con-\nstruct our labor quality measures.\nA.3 Projection scenarios for educational attainment and employ-\nment\nThe Fisher Ideal index does not have the circularity property, so the labor-quality growth\ncalculatedfromcomparingatargetyeartoabaseyearisnotnecessarilythesameasthegrowth\ncalculated from cumulated year-over-year changes. However, this is not true for the labor-\nquality growth projections because our assumption that the log-wage regression coefficients\n45The most recent coefficient is omitted because it is based on just one year of observations, making the\nsample size quite small.\n44\n\nare constant over time means that the Fisher Ideal index collapses into the Laspeyres index,\nwhich does have the circularity property. This allows us to construct alternative projection\nscenarios based on assumptions about the education and employment distribution in a target\nyear alone, without having to make assumptions about the path of educational attainment\nor EPOP between now and then. Therefore our projection scenarios discussed in 5 are based\non the Census Bureau age projections for the years 2022 and 2025 and the education and\nemployment assumptions described below.\nBaseline labor quality in 2015 is calculated by applying the empirical 2013 education and\nemployment distributions by age from the ACS to the Census Bureau population projections\nfor 2015. That is, we calculate the share of 25 year olds that have a college degree, the share\nof 25 year olds with college degrees that are employed, and then combine that with the Census\nprojection of the number of 25 year olds in 2015 to estimate the number college educated 25\nyear old workers in 2015. This same baseline distribution is used in all nine labor quality\nprojections.46\nEducation scenarios All three education scenarios assume that the educational distribu-\ntion for those over 30 will stay the same as they age. For example, the educational attainment\nof 52 year olds in 2025 is assumed to be the same as that of 40 year olds in 2013 (the most re-\ncent year in our data). Although non-traditional educational attainment, differential mortality\nrates, and immigration make it unlikely that this assumption strictly holds, those forces are\nmarginal enough that they are unlikely to cause substantial deviations. Where the scenarios\ndiffer is in their assumptions on the educational attainment of 1) people 30 and under in the\nprojection year (the “young group”), and 2) the educational attainment of people under 30\nin 2013 that will be over 30 in the projection year (e.g. 31-42 year olds in 2025; the “middle\ngroup”). The educational attainment of the young group, which was in middle school or below\nduring the Great Recession and thus unlikely to have been driven by cyclical factors — their\neducational attainment can be thought of as representing a “normal” level. Unlike the young\n46Note that the differences between the growth rates in the different scenarios is completely independent of\nthe baseline, since we report log-growth.\n45\n\ngroup, those in the middle group were making critical education decisions (such as whether to\ndrop out of high school or college and whether to enroll in college or grad school) during the\nGreat Recession and its aftermath. Therefore, if “educational sheltering” has been a strong\nforceduringandaftertheGreatRecession, aspositedbyBarrow&Davis(2012), Sherk(2013),\nand Johnson (2013), then their attainment may deviate from the norm.\nRevert to pre-crisis educational plateau The first education scenario assumes that the edu-\ncational attainment of young people reverts to its pre-crisis levels. This reflects the possibility\nthat the uptick in enrollment and graduation rates over the past several years is simply a tem-\nporary cyclical effect of the Great Recession. For the young group, this scenario assumes they\nwill have the same distribution of educational attainment as people of the same age in 2007.47\nFor those in the middle age group, whose attainment may have been increased by “educational\nsheltering” effects, this scenario assumes that they will either have the educational attainment\nof someone that age in 2007 or their current educational attainment, whichever is higher. That\nis, they will have at least the educational attainment that would have been expected of them\nbefore the recession, and they may have a little more if the recession encouraged them to stay\nin school. Specifically, let qˆj be the probability of someone with age a having at least education\na\nj in 2007, let q˜j be the probability of someone that will be age a in 2025 having at least\na−12\neducation j in 2013, and let qj = max (cid:0) qˆj,q˜j (cid:1) . Then for this scenario the share of people of\na a a−12\nage a = 31,...,42 with education j will be pj = qj −qj+1. This is the same for 2022, except\na a a\nusing q˜j .\na−9\nPersist at 2013 educational plateau The second scenario assumes that the educational at-\ntainment of young people persists at its 2013 rate, reflecting the possibility that there was a\nstep increase in educational attainment over the past several years but that attainment has\nonce again reached a plateau. This scenario assumes that people in the young group will have\nthe same distribution of educational attainment as someone of the same age in 2013. For the\n47Recent research suggests that the housing boom depressed educational attainment by providing good job\nopportunities to low skill workers, in which case the educational attainment patterns from the boom years\nwould be unusually low Charles et al. (2015). That would suggest that this may be a particularly pessimistic\nimplementation of this “cyclical uptick” hypothesis. However, we believe this is still a useful scenario to\nconsider as it provides a plausible worst-case scenario for education trends.\n46\n\nmiddle group we have to account for the fact that the increase in educational attainment was\ngradual and had not fully propagated through for those over 30 but people under 30 will often\ngo on to further education, meaning that there is no clear baseline group. To get a baseline\nfor this group we calculate the probability qj in 2013 of completing at least education j for\nthe five year age group that are young enough to have experienced a sheltering effect but old\nenough that we would expect them to have completed that level of education already.48 For\nthis scenario we define the expected educational attainment distribution of the middle group\nas pj = qj −qj+1.\nExtrapolate 2007-2013 trends in education The final scenario assumes that the uptick in\neducational attainment over the past several years represents a resumed upward trend in\neducation attainment rather than a temporary cyclical boost or a one-off step increase. Age-\nspecific time trends in educational attainment are estimated from logistic regressions of the\nform\nqj\n(cid:88)\nlog it = [year·Daβ +Daγ ]. (17)\n1−qj it a it a\nit a\nAs in Section A.2, these logits are estimated on the population of people with education j−1\nor higher, and they are estimated on 2007-2013 data. Let q2013 be the probability that a person\na\nof age a had education j or higher in 2013. Then this scenario assumes that the probability of\nhavingatleasteducationj atageain2025istheprobabilityofhavingeducationj in2013plus\nthe age-specific time trend — that is, they have probability qj = invlogit[logit(q2013)+12·β ]\na a a\nof having at least education j at age a in 2025. As in the other cases, we then recover the\nshare of people with education j at age a in 2025 as pj = qj −qj+1. This is the same for 2022\na a a\nexcept qj = invlogit[logit(q2013)+9·β ]\na a a\nEmployment scenarios The employment scenarios are much more straightforward to\nconstruct because there is little to no need to keep track of the stock of employment — the\nfact that 85 percent of 29 year old college graduates were employed in 2013 does not impose\nparticularlybindingconstraintsonourassumptionsabouttheEPOPrateof41yearoldcollege\n48Forhighschoolweus19-23, forsomecollegeweuse23-27, forcollegeweuse25-29, andforpost-graduate\nwe use 30-34. Less than high school is the residual category.\n47\n\ngraduates in 2025. Therefore, our two baseline employment scenarios simply assume that the\nEPOP rates for specific age-education groups in the projection year will be the same as in some\nother base year. For the revert to pre-crisis EPOPs scenario we assume that the probability of\napersonofageawitheducationj beingemployedintheprojectionyearisthesameasitwould\nhave been in 2007.49 This scenario corresponds to the view that the entire decline in EPOP\nrates for specific age-education groups is cyclical.50 The second employment scenario is the\ninverse of this and assumes that the entire change in the EPOP rates of specific age-education\ngroups is structural and will persist at 2013 EPOPs.51\nExtrapolated 2002-2007 structural trends in EPOPs The final scenario extrapolates certain\npre-crisis trends in employment patterns out to the projection year. In particular, it extrapo-\nlates the declining EPOP rates of young people (with heterogeneity across education groups),\nthe increasing EPOP rates of older people (particularly the more educated), and the widen-\nning gap between the EPOP rates of more and less educated working age people Dennett &\nModestino (2013); Burtless (2013); Aaronson et al. (2014). Given that we have pre-selected\nthe trends that are extrapolated, this scenario can be accused of cherry-picking. We do not\ndeny that vulnerability, and we do not intend this scenario to be understood as a probable\noutcome. Again, these scenarios are primarily intended to illustrate the mechanics of labor-\nquality growth and what factors are most critical to the setting expectations about future\nlabor-quality growth in the U.S., as well as to impose certain bounds on plausible forecasts of\nlabor-quality growth.\nTo implement the third employment scenario we follow an approach similar to that in\nthe education trends scenario above. To extract age and education-specific time trends in\n49As with the first education scenario, this may be an extreme assumption on what the pre-crisis norm\nwas — if the housing boom boosted EPOP rates to abnormal levels, then this scenario overstates the baseline\nEPOPrates. Similartotheeducationcase,webelievethisremainsausefulscenariotoconsiderasitillustrates\na sort of best-case scenario for employment rates.\n50This still allows for a demographically (or educationally) driven structural decline in the aggregate\nemployment-to-population ratio. What it does not allow for is a structural decline (or increase) in EPOP\nfor specific age-education groups. For example, it does not allow for a structural decline in students working\npart-time, or a structural increase in older people staying employed past the traditional retirement age.\n51Thisscenariomaybetoopessimisticinthatthelabormarkethasclearlycontinuedtoimprovesince2013.\nOnce more recent ACS data becomes available we will revise this scenario to reflect the most recent year of\ndata available. However, this once again provides a sort of outlier case with unusually low EPOP rates.\n48\n\nemployment we run the following logistic regression on the sample of 16-24 and 55-69 year olds\nover the 2002-2007 period\nlog p it = (cid:88)(cid:88)(cid:2) year·Da ·Djβ +Da ·Djγ (cid:3) . (18)\n1−p it it aj it it aj\nit\na j\nand to extract education-specific time trends in employment among prime age workers we run\nthe following logistic regression on 25-54 year olds over the same period\nlog p it = (cid:88)(cid:2) year·Djβ +Djγ (cid:3) . (19)\n1−p it j it j\nit\nj\nwhere p is the probability of individual i being employed in year t, Da is an indicator for\nit it\nbeing age a, and Dj is an indicator for having education j. Let p2007 be the probability that a\nit aj\nperson of age a with education j was employed in 2007. Then this employment trends scenario\nassumes that the probability of a person of age a and education j being employed in 2025 is the\nprobability of being employed in 2007 plus the relevant age- and education-specific time trend.\n(cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:3)\nFor 16-24 and 55-69 year olds this is p = invlogit logit p2007 +18·β and for 25-54 year\naj aj aj\n(cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:1) (cid:3)\nolds it is p = invlogit logit p2007 +18·β .52 The 2022 projection is the same, except the\naj aj j\nβs are multiplied by 15 instead.\nB Robustness checks\nIn this section of the appendix we present additional results that illustrate that our qualitative\nresults are unchanged when we change some of the underlying assumptions, specifications, and\nacross datasets.\n52For people 70 and over there is no time-trend added in and their EPOP rate in the projection year is\nassumed to be the same as it was in 2007.\n49\n\nB.1 Adding control variables to the baseline Mincer regression\nThroughout the main text we limited ourselves to parsimonious baseline Mincer regression.\nHowever, prior implementations of such specifications have included control variables to ensure\nthat only productivity-induced wage differentials are reflected in the estimated wages (Aaron-\nson & Sullivan, 2001; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1993). Here we consider the robustness of\nour results to including standard control variables, such as part-time status, marital status,\nveterans status, race, and geographic location.\nAs discussed in subsection 3.2, it is critical that the variables included in the labor quality\nspecification (x ) be 1) correlated with wages, and 2) that the correlation is driven by differ-\nj\nentials in the marginal product of labor. A desirable property of a regression-based framework\nlike (9) is that it allows for the inclusion of control variables, z , that may be correlated with\nj\nboth individual wages, w , and the variables meant to quantify marginal product differentials,\nj\nx . The resulting generalized regression framework is\nj\nw = x(cid:48)β +z(cid:48)γ +ε . (20)\nj j j j\nBecause we attribute only the part of wage variations explained by the variables in x to\nj\nmarginal product differentials, we impute the log marginal product of a worker as x(cid:48)β ˆ . The\nj\ninclusion of these control variables does not alter our definitions of σ and σ˜ . They continue\nj p\nˆ\nto be based on x and β.\nj\nWhat is less clear is the appropriate measure of fit when considering a regression with\ncontrols. Consider, for example, a set of controls z that predict wages (γ (cid:54)= 0) but for which\nthe correlation between any element x of x and any element z of z iz zero (corr(x,z) = 0). In\nthis case the regression R\n¯2\nwill increase, making the specification appear more appealing than\nthe version without z despite the fact that substantive components of the regression, x and\nβ ˆ , remain unchanged.53 An alternative approach would be to consider the partial R-squared\nwith respect to x, r¯2. However, then maximizing r¯2 is not necessarily desirable. For example,\nx x\n53The standard errors will also slightly increase because of the loss of degrees of freedom.\n50\n\nif the association between a control variable z and the core variables x has the same sign as\nthe association between z and wages w, then the r¯2 will decline in the regression with z. But\nx\nthe r¯2 declined precisely because z had been a source of omitted variable bias and we are now\nx\ncontroling for that.\nUltimately, the selection of z operates on an orthogonal basis from the selection of x in a\nproperly controled regression. As discussed in subsection 3.2, the desirability of higher R\n¯2\nis\nentirely conditional on the assumption that W ˆ ≡ exp (cid:0) x(cid:48)β (cid:1) = c·W — if any omitted variable\nj j\nbias is loaded onto β then this assumption is violated. In principle, this means that one should\noptimize z for each separate specification of x, at which point we can compare the r¯2 of the\nx\ncontrolled regressions as is done in subsection 3.2.\nRather than undertaking this highly multidimensional and daunting task, we consider\nwhether it is likely to be of first-order importance to any of our results. Specifically, we\nconsider the impact of including two standard sets of controls in our baseline Mincer and\nbaseline+occupation specifications. The first set of controls is a set of indicators for part-time\nemployment, marriage, and race, which are the controls included in the specification used by\nAaronson & Sullivan (2001).54 The second set of controls is similar Bureau of Labor Statistics\n(1993) and includes indicators for part-time employment, veteran status, and which Census\ndivision the individual lives in.55\nFigure B.1a, which is comparable to Figure 2, plots the adjusted R-squared (R\n¯2)\nagainst\nthe 80th percentile standard error of the predictions (σ˜ ). This shows that, as expected, the\n80\ninclusion of the additional variables increases both R\n¯2\nand σ˜ . The Aaronson & Sullivan\n80\n(2001) controls improve the fit slightly more and increase imprecision slightly less than the\nBureau of Labor Statistics (1993) controls. However, as can be seen in Figure B.1b, there is\nalmost no change in the partial R-squared with respect to x, suggesting that either the control\nvariables are not a significant source of omitted variable bias or that the biases they induce\n54Weusefiverace/ethnicityindicatorswheretheyusedfourraceindicators—wedistinguishHispanicsfrom\nnon-Hispanic whites, blacks, Asians, and other.\n55The Bureau of Labor Statistics (1993) specification also includes indicators for whether the individual is\nin a central city or balance of a SMSA/CBSA or in a rural area, which we omit.\n51\n\nbalance out on average. This suggests that the impact of including these control variables\non measured labor-quality growth is likely to be quite limited. This is confirmed in Figure\nB.1c, which plots the resulting labor-quality indices. The indices with the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (1993) controls are virtually indistinguishable from their uncontrolled counterparts,\nwhile the Aaronson & Sullivan (2001) controls appear to exert a modest negative drag on\nlabor quality, on the order of a couple hundredths of a percentage point per year. These\nresults suggest to us that control variables are not of first-order importance in measuring or\nforecasting labor-quality growth.\nB.2 Additional results for CPS-ORG and CPS-ASEC\nThe majority of the results presented in the main text were produced using data from the ACS,\nbut it is possible to conduct the same exercises using both the CPS-ORG and CPS-ASEC. In\nthis section we evaluate the robustness of key results from the main text in these alternative\ndata sources. All of the qualitative results hold up, with some minor differences in magnitude.\nFigures B.2a and B.2b plot the adjusted R-squared (R\n¯2)\nagainst the 80th percentile stan-\ndard error (σ˜ ) of the same specifications considered in Section 3 and Figure 2 for the CPS-\n80\nORG and CPS-ASEC, respectively. As we note in the main text, the large sample size of the\nACS is relatively favorable to stratum-based specifications: with the CPS datasets, which are\nmorethananorderofmagnitudesmaller, thestandarderrorsareanorderofmagnitudehigher.\nIn fact, the CPS-ASEC is small enough that for some of the more granular specifications more\nthan 20 percent of the observations are in single-observation cells with infinite standard errors,\nleaving σ˜ undefined.56 However, the tradeoff between fit and precision is still clearly visible,\n80\nthe age and education or age, education and occupation specifications strike a reasonable bal-\nance between fit and precision, and the baseline and baseline+occupation Mincer specifications\ndominate the stratum-based specifications. In short, the results are entirely consistent with\nour findings from the ACS.\n56We substitute the highest observed percentile standard error, which is the source of the vertical lines in\nthe upper right region of the figure.\n52\n\nFigures B.3a and B.3b plot the 2002-2013 labor-quality indices presented in Section 4 and\nFigure 3 for the CPS-ORG and CPS-ASEC, respectively. Once again the results are quite\nsimilar to those found in the ACS. The overfit specification (which includes all six variables\nconsidered in Section 3) and the underfit specification (which includes all variables except age\nand education) both show very little labor-quality growth over the 2000s. In the case of the\nCPS-ASEC the overfit and underfit specifications are quite noisy, with implausible jumps and\nchanges in direction.\nAll of the age and education specifications (with or without occupation) and the baseline\nand baseline+occupation Mincer specifications, by contrast, are clustered together and quite\nsimilar to the ACS results in Figure 3a, although the CPS-ORG specifications show about 0.5\npercent less cumulative labor-quality growth by 2013. The CPS-ORG results are also slightly\nmore closely clustered than those for the other two datasets. This may be because hourly\nwages are measured directly in the CPS-ORG, whereas in the CPS-ASEC and ACS hourly\nwages are noisily derived from annual earnings divided by the product of usual weekly hours\nand weeks worked per year.\nOne notable difference is that ACS indices show an unexpected decline in labor quality\nbetween 2005 and 2006, while the CPS-based indices do not. This appears to be an data\nartifact induced by the tripling of the ACS sample size in 2006. A similar jump occurs when\nwe calculate labor-quality growth between 2000 and 2001 in the ACS (not reported), and there\nalso appears to be a slight tick in the 2012-2013 period for the ASEC, which saw a sample\nsize change in 2013. Why changing sample size can induce these sharp adjustments in labor\nquality is somewhat unclear and bears more careful investigation.\nFigures B.4a and B.4b plot the 2002-2013 counterfactual labor-quality indices presented\nin Section 4 and Figure 4 for the CPS-ORG and CPS-ASEC, respectively. The results are\nqualitativelythesameintheCPSdatasetsasintheACS,withchangesinaveragehoursworked\ncontributing relatively little to labor-quality growth while changes in population demographics\nand demographic-specific EPOP rates both contributing significantly. However, there are two\nquantitative differences.\n53\n\nFirst, average hours appear to matter less in the CPS datasets. This is likely due to\nthe fact that the ACS uses a categorical measure weeks worked after 2008, which induces\nadditional noise in the measurement of average hours relative to the other two datasets. This\nis consistent with the fact that hours only make a significant difference after 2008. The relative\nunimportance of hours further strengthens our conviction that projecting average hours is not\ncritical to a labor quality forecast and that attempts to do so are likely to introduce as much\nforecast error as they address.\nSecond, whereas for the ACS the evolution of EPOP rates induced more labor-quality\ngrowth than changing demographics (compare the yellow line to the red), in the two CPS\ndatasets the contributions of employment and demographics are almost equal. Additionally,\nthe contribution of EPOP rates, reflected in the yellow lines, is more obviously cyclical for the\ntwo CPS datasets — it is virtually flat before and after the Great Recession, with a substantial\nstepincreaseduringtheGreatRecession. TheACS,bycontrast,showssignificantlabor-quality\ngrowth from EPOP rates even before the Great Recession, with the Great Recession simply\naccelerating the trend.\nThese observations have important implications for which of the scenarios presented in\nSection 5 one finds most compelling. If one believes the CPS datasets more accurately reflect\nthe role of the employment margin in driving labor-quality growth, then the two plateau\nscenariosappearmostcompelling: theysuggestthattheU.S.experiencedanunusualupskilling\nof employment during the Great Recession that will either persist or unwind, while offering\nlittle evidence of a pre-Great Recession upskilling trend in employment. If, on the other\nhand, one believes that the ACS data more accurately reflects the contribution of employment\ncomposition to labor quality then there appears to have been a significant pre-Great Recession\nstructural trend, suggesting that the labor-quality growth from employment composition is\nunlikely to fully unwind and may even continue to drive a significant portion of labor-quality\ngrowth going forward.\n54\n\nTable 1: Different levels of granularity of classification of variables\nGroups per classification\nNumber of\nVariable (I) (II) (III) (IV)\nclassifications\n1.

    "text": "Steering Toward Sustainable Growth\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas\nLas Vegas, NV\nApril 20, 2022\n08:25 AM PDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nGood morning.\nI am thrilled to be back in Las Vegas. But even more than that, I’m thrilled to see that Las Vegas\nis back. I saw this at the airport and driving around town yesterday. And I also heard it from the\ncivic, business, and community leaders we met. Nevada is thriving, growing, and moving\nenthusiastically toward a post-pandemic world.\nAnd this is true for the economy as a whole. After two years of pandemic-related economic\nchallenges, signs of health are everywhere. The job market is robust, household and business\nbalance sheets are strong, and consumer and business sentiments are solid, despite the war in\nUkraine and rising prices at the gas pump.\nOf course, everyone agrees that inflation is too high. Across the country, Americans are waking\nup and going to bed worried about whether their incomes will keep up with the rising cost of\nrent, food, and fuel. Businesses are also worried, some thinking twice about committing to long-\nterm contracts that may become too costly to fulfill if prices continue to rise. Put simply,\nhouseholds and businesses are feeling the pain and asking when things will get better.\nSo today, I will spend my time discussing inflation and how monetary policy has and will adjust\nto bring it down and put the economy back on a sustainable path. But before I get started, let\n1\n\nme remind you that the views I will share today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those\nof anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nFocusing on Inflation\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve has two Congressionally mandated goals: full\nemployment and price stability. Although there is no fixed number for full employment, we\ndefine it as a broad and inclusive goal that considers all those who want to work.1 Right now, by\nalmost any measure, this goal has been achieved. Anyone who wants to a job has not just one\nbut many opportunities to choose from, and workers of all types are benefiting, including those\noften left behind in expansions.2\nIn contrast, we are far away from our price stability goal. The Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) defines price stability as average inflation of 2 percent. The high readings we have seen\nover the past year, breaching 8 percent last month, clearly exceed that target.3 This means\npolicy must adjust. One of our goals is not being met.\nThe key insight of the dual mandate is that both sides matter. It was critical to assist the\neconomy in recovering the job losses that occurred early in the pandemic, and it is now critical\nto stem what has been a longer-than-expected run of high inflation.\nThe question is how to do that smoothly. And to determine that, we have to understand how\nwe got here.\nThe simple answer is COVID. Lockdowns early in the pandemic, transportation issues, and labor\nshortages constrained the supply of many goods. And these supply disruptions fell largely\noutside the scope of policy. After all, policymakers can do little to get more cars to the lot or\nmore appliances into stores.\nIn contrast, we have a range of tools to help people buy what they need. And these tools were\ndeployed to help households sustain while we fought the pandemic. For those who lost their\nincomes, fiscal policy provided a lifeline. To bolster growth and employment, monetary policy\n1 In August 2020, the FOMC revised its long-run statement that defines full employment and price stability goals.\nSee Board of Governors (2022).\n2 Powell (2022) discusses employment gains across ethnicities as well as the record number of job openings per\nunemployed persons. Expansions tend to pull down the unemployment rate for all demographic groups. However,\nthis process is faster for groups with higher unemployment rates during recessions; see Aaronson et al. (2019) and\nDuzhak (2021).\n3 The 12-month change in headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation was 8.5 percent and core CPI inflation was\n6.5 percent in March.\n2\n\nturned accommodative. These measures helped sustain consumer spending and get people\nthrough the worst of the crisis.\nUnfortunately, as the pandemic persisted, this policy-supported demand collided, again and\nagain, with COVID-disrupted supply. And as we would expect, as demand outstripped supply,\ninflation rose.4\nSince high inflation was initially caused by the pandemic and our responses to it, the\nexpectation has been that it will recede as COVID does. The problem is that, while COVID has\nabated, it has not disappeared. We can more easily do things like go out for dinner, travel, and\nsee a movie. But countries and firms managing new variants and rising caseloads have not been\nable to return to full production. So, supply chain disruptions have lingered. And the war in\nUkraine has further pressured supply, especially for energy, food, and other critical\ncommodities.\nAll of this has added up to persistently high inflation readings. And that presents a different\nproblem. Long periods of high inflation, even if it is projected to come down, can seep into\nexpectations, leading people to anticipate further price increases. This is especially salient now,\nwith prices for food and gas making headlines. Research tells us that these prices heavily\ninfluence consumers’ beliefs about future inflation.5 We already see this in surveys of short-run\ninflation expectations, which show that consumers and businesses are reacting to high inflation\nreadings.6\nFortunately, longer-run expectations have remained steady. Moreover, consumer and business\nsurveys, as well as market-based measures of inflation compensation, foresee an easing of\ninflation pressures in coming years, moving to levels more consistent with the FOMC’s average 2\npercent goal.7\n4 As a consequence of more spending being redirected from services towards goods, inflation rates across these\ntwo sectors have diverged. CPI inflation for services hit 5.1 percent in March, while goods CPI inflation is running at\n14.2 percent. In February, PCE inflation reached 4.6 percent for services and 9.6 percent for goods.\n5 D’Acunto et al. (2021) show that consumers particularly rely on grocery prices in their consumption bundle.\nCoibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) link households’ inflation expectations to food and gas prices.\n6 Armantier et al. (2022) find that short-term inflation expectations have moved up with higher inflation readings.\nHowever, they also point out that medium- to longer-term inflation expectations are less responsive now\ncompared with before the pandemic.\n7 The breakeven inflation rate, computed as the difference between nominal and real yields, is 4.33 percent\nannually over the next two years, as of April 13, 2022. Also as of this date, the annual breakeven inflation rate over\nthe five-year period starting five years from now is 2.35 percent. According to the ATSIX data developed in Aruoba\n(2016), the expected one-year inflation rate nine years out stands at 2.29 percent (updated data available at\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/atsix).\n3\n\nBut we can’t be complacent. The longer realized inflation remains high, the more risk there is\nthat rising prices will become part of public psychology.8 And once psychology shifts, it is hard to\nbring it back.\nWe learned this lesson the hard way. The last time we experienced this kind of elevated\ninflation was in the 1970s—some of us remember that time. Americans faced a steady\ndrumbeat of rising prices that lasted for over a decade. By the early 1980s, high inflation had\nbecome firmly entrenched in the public’s psyche. To get things under control, the Fed had to\nimplement a series of steep interest rate hikes. They worked, but the correction was painful.9\nThis is a history no one wants to repeat. And it’s why the Fed is taking actions today, far earlier\nthan in the 1970s, to tighten policy, rebalance demand and supply, and ensure that both of our\ndual mandate goals are achieved.\nThe obvious next question is, how will we get there?\nHow We Get There Matters\nThe truth is, there is a hard way and an easier way.\nTo see what I mean, imagine you’re in a car. You’re driving along the highway and you spot a\nhazard up ahead. At this point, you know you need to slow down. One way to do it is to slam\nhard on the brakes. You’ll achieve your goal, but you and your passengers will probably suffer in\nthe process. You might jerk forward in your seat or spill coffee on your lap. That’s the hard way.\nThe better way is to purposefully and smoothly decelerate. You avoid the danger, and you spare\nyourself and others the whiplash. Most importantly, you get to continue your trip.\nI think we can all agree that this is good driving. But it is also good policymaking. If we slam the\nbrakes on the economy by adjusting rates too quickly or too much, we risk forcing unnecessary\nadjustments by businesses and households, potentially tipping the economy into recession. If\nwe ease on the brakes by methodically removing accommodation and regularly assessing how\nmuch more is needed, we have a good chance of transitioning smoothly and gliding the\neconomy to its long-run sustainable path.\nNow some are nervous—or even skeptical—about whether this can be achieved. They fear that\nmonetary policy is behind the curve and only a rapid and aggressive tightening can prevent an\n8 Malmendier and Nagel (2016) show that individuals form inflation expectations based on realized inflation during\ntheir lifetime.\n9 Goodfriend and King (2005) document the depth of the two recessions in the early 1980s that followed interest\nrate hikes to rein in inflation. For an extensive record of the Volcker disinflation, see Silber (2012).\n4\n\nunbridled increase in inflationary pressure. 10 Of course, for those who hold this view, memories\nof the 1970s inflation and the painful correction it required loom large.\nFor many reasons, this is not my modal outlook. First, the conditions we face today are very\ndifferent from the 1970s. For one thing, current high inflation readings have a clear catalyst—\nthe pandemic. Moreover, the duration of rising prices has been far shorter—a year, rather than\na decade. And in stark contrast to the 1970s, longer-run inflation expectations have remained\nstable.\nSecond, the Fed is different than it was in the 1970s. We are far more attuned to the\nimportance of inflation psychology and the transparency it demands. So we regularly share\npost-FOMC statements, summaries of economic projections, and other forms of forward\nguidance that tell households, businesses, and market participants what we are thinking and\nwhere policy is heading.11\nThese communications provide clarity. But they also affect financial conditions, often long\nbefore we adjust rates. You can see this in the recent data. Although the FOMC has only raised\nthe funds rate 25 basis points so far this year, our forward guidance has resulted in higher\ninterest rates for Treasuries across the yield curve.12 This has in turn moved rates in other\nfinancial markets. Mortgage rates, for example, have gone up to their highest levels since the\nstart of the pandemic. This highlights an important point—communication is itself a tool and\ncan tap the brakes on the economy long before actual adjustments to policy occur.\nThird, history suggests that smooth, rather than abrupt, transitions are the norm. In fact, a\nrecent study by Princeton professor and former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder shows that, out of\nthe last eleven tightening cycles, when the Fed raised interest rates after a period of\naccommodative policy, seven were followed by a mild recession or none at all—basically a\nsmooth landing.13\nThere are, of course, no guarantees when it comes to a highly uncertain and fast-moving\neconomy. But for now, most economic agents also expect a smooth transition. Financial market\ndata put very little probability on a near-term recession.14 And consumers continue to see\nunemployment falling in coming quarters, even as the Fed adjusts rates.15 My business contacts\n10 See, for example, Summers (2022).\n11 For a complete discussion about how the current moment differs from the 1970s, see Daly (2022).\n12 Over the past six months, the 1-year Treasury yield moved up about 170 basis points while the 10-year Treasury\nyield moved up about 125 basis points.\n13 See Blinder (2022).\n14 Bauer and Mertens (2018a) document that the slope of the yield curve, which is the difference between long-\nand short-term interest rates, can be used to predict recessions. Bauer and Mertens (2018b) argue that the\ndifference between 10-year and 3-month interest rates performs best among several alternatives. By this metric,\nthe yield curve is far from an inversion and implied recession probabilities are low.\n15 See the preliminary results for the April edition of the Michigan Survey of Consumers, available at\nhttps://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=69819.\n5\n\nare equally optimistic, preparing to move past the pandemic and take advantage of\nopportunities for growth and expansion.\nThis bullishness likely reflects the strong underlying momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as\nthe public’s confidence that, even as rates rise and the economy slows, growth and the labor\nmarket will remain solid.\nBut this will take work. And let me turn to that next.\nNavigating Policy Out of the Pandemic\nAs I have noted, the inflation outlook combined with a strong labor market leave no doubt that\nfurther policy tightening is appropriate. The question is, how much and how quickly?\nLet’s start with how much. The first step is to remove the accommodation that we provided\nduring the pandemic. That means raising the federal funds rate to its neutral level, which most\nforecasters put at around 2.5 percent in nominal terms. We started that journey in March with a\n25-basis-point rate increase, so we still have significant work to do. Moving purposefully to a\nmore neutral stance that does not stimulate the economy is the top priority.\nAnd this is where the question of timing comes in. How quickly should we get there?\nAccounting for the risks of being too fast or too slow, I see an expeditious march to neutral by\nthe end of the year as a prudent path. We will continue to evaluate the data and the risks, but\ntoday I see little indication that the economy needs policy accommodation.\nOnce accommodation is removed, we need to evaluate the effects—observe how financial\nconditions adjust, how much inflation recedes, and what more remains to be done to ensure a\nsustained expansion. This watchful deliberation is always important, but it’s critical when the\nlevel of uncertainty is high, as it is today.16\nThere is the uncertainty about COVID. While it feels like our recovery from the pandemic is\ngaining traction here in the United States, China and other global producers are in the midst of\nanother wave of lockdowns to manage outbreaks. This makes it hard to declare victory on the\npandemic or to be comfortable about the projected recovery of supply chains.\nThere is also uncertainty about the impact of the war in Ukraine. So far, the U.S. economy is\nweathering the disruption to supplies of oil and other commodities, but energy shocks have\n16 Leduc and Liu (2016) show that increases in uncertainty decrease demand and lower economic activity. Bok,\nMertens, and Williams (2022) show that financial market pricing is consistent with this view when the lower bound\non interest rates is a salient concern.\n6\n\nhistorically led to periods of economic contraction, domestically and globally. And that’s a risk\nthat bears close watching.17\nAll of this means that it’s hard to fully know what next year will look like. Will we be in a world\nwhere supply chains have healed, inflation has come down, and policy can remain close to\nneutral? Or will we be in a world where disruptions remain, inflation persists, and monetary\npolicy must further adjust to restrain the economy, balance supply and demand, and return\ninflation to our price stability objective? The data will tell us over the course of this year, and we\nwill be prepared to respond when it does.\nBut no matter what happens next year, that will not be the end of our work. The Fed’s\noverarching job is to foster a long and durable expansion that delivers both full employment\nand price stability. We need to calibrate policy to get back on that path. We need to manage\nthe economic headwinds immediately in front of us. But we also need to lay the groundwork\nfor the economy we want in the future. A truly smooth transition does both.\nGo Smooth to Go Far\nLet me leave you with a story that illustrates my approach to policymaking and how I will\nnavigate the challenges ahead. As a teenager, I worked at a donut shop. Part of my job was to\ndrive a delivery truck. I drove the long-distance route at night, when traffic was sparse. As you\nmight expect, I sometimes went a little too fast. And as you also might expect, that didn’t turn\nout too well. I wound up losing my license for three weeks—which, to me, felt like a lifetime.\nThat youthful mistake taught me a valuable lesson. Getting there is important. But so is the\njourney. In my attempt to get there quickly, I actually didn’t get there at all. Though I didn’t\nknow it at the time, I had taken the hard way.\nBut we don’t have to. A smooth and methodical approach to policy will alert us to hazards along\nthe way, prepare us for unexpected bumps in the road, and ultimately keep us moving\nforward—not just to our immediate destination, but to all of the destinations that follow.\nThank you.\n17 The impact on domestic growth may be different this time. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration, the United States has been a net exporter of petroleum since 2019.\n7\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

    "text": "FINAL\nThe Last Resort in a Changing Landscape\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nMoney Marketeers of New York University Webinar\nNew York, NY\nApril 15, 2021\n02:00 PM EDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nI grew up in Missouri surrounded by three rivers. Nearly every spring,\nat least one of them would flood. Each time this happened, families,\nbusinesses, and sometimes whole communities, would be forced to higher\nground until the water receded and returned to its banks.\nPublic programs were there to assist. Teams helped people evacuate,\ntemporary shelters were stood up overnight, and financial support was\nprovided for repairs and rebuilding. By many measures, these responses\nwere a win, repeated successes of a system meant to insure against these\ntypes of disasters.\nBut flooding was not a rare event, it happened almost every year.\nAgainst that backdrop, the prevailing public policy seems incomplete. A patch\nagainst a problem that owed in part to known structural factors such as\ngeography, location, and regular weather patterns.\nWhich takes me to what I want to discuss today. Changes in our\neconomic and financial landscape have left us with a financial market\n1\n\nFINAL\ninfrastructure that is more vulnerable to disruptions. We saw this in the\nGlobal Financial Crisis and in our recent experience with the unprecedented\nshock of COVID-19. As the lender of last resort in the United States, the\nFederal Reserve was there to assist. In both cases, we intervened—provided\nliquidity, stabilized markets, and ensured that the financial system could\ncontinue to fulfill its role in the economy.\nBut the frequency and scale of our interventions is concerning. Without\nchanges to our financial infrastructure, the Federal Reserve may regularly be\ncalled to step in to stabilize markets during turbulent periods. And not just\nfor 100-year floods like COVID-19, but for more typical disruptions associated\nwith average shocks to the global and domestic economy.\nThe Federal Reserve’s role as lender of last resort will always be a\ncritical backstop in the protection against turmoil and dislocation caused by\nrare or extreme events. But to fulfill the role sustainably, we need to be the\nlast, not the first, line of defense. Regularly relying on “save the day”\ninterventions by the Federal Reserve can be costly, resulting in public losses\nand undesirable risk-taking on the part of the private sector.\nAs policymakers, we must continually evaluate our actions. We must\nuse all of our experiences, even those from times of crises, to identify\nvulnerabilities and create a more resilient future. This means working\ntogether, across regulatory agencies, to examine the events of last year and\nask what needs to be done to minimize the chances of future severe\ndisruptions.\nSo as we begin to emerge from our battles against COVID-19, it is time\nto focus on crafting more complete policies that leave us better prepared to\n2\n\nFINAL\nweather future storms, big and small. Only then can we foster a more stable,\nsound and resilient financial system.\nBefore I turn to this, let me remind you that my remarks are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nA Changing Landscape\nThe financial sector is crucial for the smooth functioning of the\neconomy. It enables the borrowing, lending, and saving that supports growth.\nFrom that vantage point, it is a public resource, a critical infrastructure for our\nshared prosperity.\nBut many shifts, exogenous to the financial system itself, are affecting its\nfunctioning. Most notable is the decline in the neutral rate of interest, or r-\n1\nstar, which has been falling globally for the past three decades. The decline\nreflects slow-moving structural trends including a step-down in productivity\ngrowth and shifts in the demand for savings and investment associated with\n2\npopulation aging. The decline in r-star and other prevailing interest rates\nalone would challenge the profitability of financial firms. But lower neutral\nrates of interest also mean that the Federal Reserve and other central banks,\nconstrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates, need to routinely\nemploy “low-for-long” policies to achieve mandated employment and price\n3\nstability goals.\nThe effects of these low-for-long policies have well-documented\nbenefits of boosting economic growth, which ultimately supports the financial\n1\nHolston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\n2\nCarvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016), Williams (2017).\n3\n3\nMertens and Williams (2019), Andrade et al. (2021).\n\nFINAL\n4\nsystem. But they are not without trade-offs. Over time, low interest rates can\nput pressure on the business models of financial institutions, leading them to\n5\nreach for yield, which can jeopardize the stability of the financial system.\nA related but additional development affecting the financial system is\nthe broad-based increase in debt levels and leverage ratios. Government\npolicies enacted to offset the Global Financial Crisis in the late 2000s left many\n6\nadvanced nations with relatively high debt-to-GDP ratios. The response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified this trend. Debt has also surged\n7\nin the private sector, especially among nonfinancial corporate firms. Notably,\n8\nmuch of this increase in debt has been funded outside of the banking sector.\nWhile the rise in public and private debt have contributed to economic growth\nover the past decade, the increased indebtedness has created vulnerabilities\nthat the financial system has to intermediate.\nImportantly, this increase in borrowing has had a significant impact on\nthe U.S. Treasury market. And this is the final aspect of the changed landscape\nthat I will focus on. The Treasury market is the largest and most liquid bond\nmarket in the world and is a critical component of the domestic and global\nfinancial infrastructure. Broker-dealers provide the lion’s share of Treasury\nsecurity intermediation and generally are well-positioned to meet the\ndemands of investors to buy or sell Treasury securities.\nOver the past decade, Treasury securities have also become an\nincreasingly important p art of short-term funding markets, for instance as\n4\nArias et al. (2020), Caldara et al. (2020), Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019).\n5\nChoi and Kronlund (2018), Di Maggio and Kacperczyk (2017), Financial Stability\nOversight Council (2020).\n6\nBadia and Dudine (2019).\n7\nBoard of Governors (2020).\n8\n4\nBoard of Governors (2020), Financial Stability Board (2020).\n\nFINAL\ncollateral in repurchase agreements. And a sizable and growing share of\nTreasury securities are held by financial entities such as hedge funds or\nmoney market funds that in times of stress can find themselves needing to\nliquidate quickly to meet redemption demand. This can put pressure on\nbroker-dealers to absorb those sales.\nThe pressure on the Treasury market is magnified by the fact that\nTreasury securities remain a safe haven investment for foreign official and\nprivate investors. Normally, this is a benefit to the U.S. economy, but in\nperiods of global stress, when liquidity is at a premium, it increases demands\non Treasury clearing that go far beyond the needs of domestic investors.\nIn all of these situations, broker-dealers are the primary intermediary\ntasked with meeting the demand for liquidity. This normally works extremely\nwell. But, as we saw last year, these intermediaries face regulatory and\ninternal risk limits that can challenge their ability to meet surges in demand\nfor liquidity. Given the growing size of the Treasury market, and the potential\ninability of broker-dealer balance sheets to keep up, this intermediation\n9\nchannel could face more capacity pressure in the future.\nLender of Last Resort: Crisis and Response\nThe onset of COVID-19 and the financial and economic disruptions that\nit caused, exacerbated many of the vulnerabilities embedded in the changing\nfinancial landscape. The crisis roiled financial markets. Even the bedrock\nTreasury market experienced a severe disruption.\n9\nThis issue has been raised by various researchers including Duffie (2020) and Liang and\nParkinson (2020). But this is an open area of study and one where no consensus has\n5\nformed.\n\nFINAL\nIn the early days of March 2020, when it became clear that COVID-19\nwas a pandemic that would disrupt the entire global economy, investor\nsentiment shifted quickly. Short-term funding markets became especially\nstressed. A “dash for cash” among both domestic and foreign investors\nresulted in a run from even relatively safe longer-dated Treasury securities to\n10\ncash and Treasury bills. The rapid and large-scale repositioning caused\ntrading volumes to surge and price volatility to spike. Broker-dealers, facing\ntheir own internal risk and balance sheet limits, had difficulty meeting the\ndemand for cash. Bid-ask spreads widened, market depth fell, and the\nnormally fluid Treasury market was strained. Stress was particularly\napparent in longer-dated off-the-run securities.\nThe Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed’s Open Market\nTrading Desk reacted immediately, conducting a record number of open-\n11\nmarket operations to restore and promote smooth market functioning. This\nis exactly what the lender of last resort is tasked with accomplishing.\nStepping back from the crisis and the unique features of the shock, the\nevents of last March raise questions about the resiliency of intermediation in\nthe Treasury market during periods of market stress. A key lesson from the\nGlobal Financial Crisis (GFC) was that even rare events deliver important\nlessons. Following the GFC, regulatory bodies across the globe made material\nchanges to the financial system that paid dividends during the COVID-19\ncrisis. For example, in the United States, the regulatory framework that came\nout of the Dodd-Frank Act ensured that systemically important institutions\nentered the pandemic with sufficient capital to facilitate the forbearance and\n10\nAcharya, Engle, and Steffen (2021).\n11\n6\nLogan (2020a).\n\nFINAL\n12\nlending that has been critical to our economic recovery. The question before\nus now is, what can we learn from the events of March 2020, and how can we\nuse those lessons to build a more resilient financial system moving forward.\nBuilding the Resiliency of the Financial System\nThere are many potentially important topics for study, but I will focus\non two that are particularly salient to the idea of building more resiliency in\nthe financial system: short-term funding markets and greater prudential\noversight for the banking system.\nTreasury and Short-Term Funding Markets\nFor the Treasury market, a number of possible reforms are currently\n13\nbeing discussed. These include the Federal Reserve creating a domestic\nstanding repurchase facility to backstop markets in times of stress and making\npermanent the temporary FIMA—Foreign and International Monetary\nAuthorities Repo Facility—to help support smooth market functioning. These\nactions would provide assurance to markets that liquidity will be available in\ntimes of stress, but they could also leave financial markets more dependent on\ntheir existence. So, further careful study is required.\nOutside of the Federal Reserve, expanding trading platform access to\nmore entities and using central clearing for Treasury cash markets could\nreduce the burden on broker-dealers and lessen the liquidity crunch in times\nof stress. Additionally, reconsidering the inclusion of reserves or even\nTreasuries in the regulatory leverage-ratio requirements for broker-dealers,\n12\nSee Baily, Klein, and Schardin (2017), Quarles (2020), Brainard (2021).\n13\n7\nSmith (2021).\n\nFINAL\nparticularly when markets are strained, could further facilitate capacity for\n14\nclearing. Again, these changes and expansions have potential benefits and\ncosts so further careful study is warranted.\nLooking beyond the direct functioning of the Treasury market, the\n15\nstability of hedge funds and money market funds is an important priority.\nThese entities have structural funding risk that can easily spike in times of\nstress, contributing to the severity of runs. The Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (FSOC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission have signaled\nsome movement in shoring up the resiliency of these funds, something I see as\ncritical to ensuring that we are prepared for the next stressful shock.\nExpanding Prudential Oversight\nBut fixing the Treasury market and reforming other short-term funding\nmarkets is just one piece of ensuring a healthy financial system going forward.\nThe proximity of the effective lower bound on interest rates and the necessity\nto keep policy rates low for longer after a downturn, can, as I mentioned\nearlier, result in reach-for-yield behavior among financial firms. So, we also\nneed to find ways to foster and maintain sustainable increases in leverage.\nRegulators already have a variety of regulatory and supervisory tools\nthat provide an effective first-line of defense, including capital requirements,\nleverage ratios, and stress tests. These tools have proven successful at\nkeeping the banking sector healthy and well-capitalized over the business\n14\nSee for example Liang and Parkinson (2020), Duffie (2020), Treasury Market Practices\nGroup (2019), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (2020).\n15\nU.S. Department of the Treasury (2021), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n8\n(2021).\n\nFINAL\ncycle, a characteristic that has served us well as we work through the\n16\npandemic.\nBut new risks emerge as the economy evolves and we need to ensure\nthat we are prepared for what is ahead. The banking sector is just one part of\nthe financial system. Shadow banking was a problem during the Global\nFinancial Crisis, and with the rapid growth of the fintech sector, there is much\nto consider outside our traditional areas. At the Federal Reserve, we\ncontinuously monitor the resilience and vulnerabilities of the financial system\n17\nas a whole and publish our assessment in our Financial Stability Report. And\nthe FSOC is actively working to ensure that all the regulatory bodies are\n18\ncoordinating, so that the right policy levers can be activated. But more work\nmay need to be done to ensure that other parts of the financial infrastructure\nremain sound and stable.\nPolicy for a Changing World\nTurning back to where I started, I often think about my experience\ngrowing up near a flood plain. The frequent disruptions of the rivers to\npeoples’ lives and livelihoods. It reminds me of the importance of a last resort\nbackstop. Protection against losses too big for any one of us to bear. But the\nexperience also taught me the value of prevention. Of building resiliency and\nminimizing the chances that a backstop is needed at all.\nand\nWhat the rivers of Missouri really taught me is that optimal public\npolicies are those that manage mitigate risks. Backstops and prevention\nthat result in consistently better outcomes.\n16\nBaily, Klein, and Schardin (2017), Quarles (2020), Brainard (2021).\n17\nBoard of Governors (2020).\n18\n9\nFinancial Stability Oversight Council (2020).\n\nFINAL\nThis is the balance we will need to strike to ensure that our ever-\nchanging financial system continues to fulfill its role as critical public\ninfrastructure.\nThank you.\n10\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAcharya, Viral V., Robert F.

    "text": "For release on delivery\nApprox. 7:40 p.m. MT, 6:40 p.m. PT\nMay 16, 2025\nChoose and Choose Again\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCollege of Western Idaho\n2025 Commencement Ceremony\nBoise, Idaho\nMay 16, 2025\nApprox. 7:40 p.m. MT, 6:40 p.m. PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n1\n\nIntroduction\nThank you, Skip, for that kind introduction. It is truly my honor to be here for the College of\nWestern Idaho’s 16th commencement ceremony. I’m so happy to be celebrating with you.\nBefore I go any further, I would like to ask all the graduates, and only the graduates, to give\nyourselves a big round of applause. You’ve earned this day and it’s important to take a moment and\nacknowledge it. Of course, we also have to recognize all the family, friends, and faculty who have helped\nmake this day possible.\nI first visited CWI last fall, and I immediately felt at home. Everyone is welcome, everyone has\nopportunity, everyone belongs. Whether you like welding, mechanics, nursing, business—or one of the\nother 120 plus programs the college offers—you can learn here and you can thrive.\nThat’s the American promise. Everyone has a future.\nNo matter how you start, or where your journey takes you, with hard work and determination, you\ncan craft a path to success. A path that you choose.\nI believe that. But truth be told, I didn’t always know it.\nRaising Expectations\nWhen I was a teenager, I used to drive around neighborhoods with big houses. I would go out at\nnight when my shift of making donuts was complete, and the streets were mostly empty. I liked looking at\nothers’ accomplishments. I wasn’t jealous, just resigned. Their lives were so different than mine.\nSee, I was living in Ballwin, Missouri. I had dropped out of high school about six months earlier.\nMy family had difficulties, and they finally took us under. So, I went to work.\nThe last thing I heard as I left high school still rattled in my mind: “It’s your decision. But you\nwill never amount to much.”\nI believed it.\nSo I drove around looking at houses, thinking at 15, my fate was already determined.\n2\n\nI set my sights on getting a full-time job with better pay and maybe benefits. A big billboard on\nthe side of the road became my goal: “Good hours, good pay, good people. Be a bus driver.”\nCall it good luck, good timing, or just a good person seeing something I couldn’t—my former\nhigh school guidance counselor made a connection. She introduced me to a friend of hers, Betsy.\nBetsy had this amazing car, a Mercedes her father had once driven. We sat inside on its leather\nseats, drinking coffee from McDonald’s, and we talked. Actually, I talked, and she listened. When I was\ndone, she said gently, “You can't be a bus driver without a high school diploma.”\nNow, dreams are hard to give up, even when they’re small. And I was crushed. All I could hear\nwas the voice from high school saying, “You’ll never amount to much.”\nBut then Betsy said a second sentence. “So, you will have to get a GED.”\nI would like to say I jumped at the opportunity, but I didn’t. It seemed daunting. I hadn’t been in\nschool for a while, and I wasn’t sure where to begin. But Betsy encouraged me, and as you can see from\nthe honorary green tassel that I’m wearing tonight, I did it!\nMy GED stands as the single best degree I’ve ever earned. I have it right here. It was more than a\ncertificate, a piece of paper saying that I could become a bus driver. It was a change. A little opening in\nmy narrow expectations. A sliver of light that let me see that more might be possible.\nFinding Out\nAfter my GED, Betsy suggested I take a semester of college. I didn’t know much about college or\nmany people who had ever gone. But she said it would be a good way to see what I liked, so I decided to\ntake a chance. After all, I could always go back to bus driving.\nI took a semester, and I really enjoyed it. So, I decided to keep going. I moved across the state\nand started a four-year program.\nI was in way over my head in the early days. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to study. I wasn’t\nearning any money. And I was worried about failing.\n3\n\nI started out in psychology and philosophy, and took math, history, science, photography, music,\nand computers. I even took a marketing class at a community college to see if that would fit my interests.\nBut nothing clicked. So, I went to the campus learning center to get some help. The advisor suggested\neconomics and took me to a class.\nI had never had economics, so I had no idea what to expect. The class was large—in a giant\nauditorium. It lasted 90 minutes, and it felt like 15. I knew I had found my place.\nI graduated with a degree in economics and philosophy. And went onto get a PhD and eventually\na job at the San Francisco Fed, where I am now President and CEO.\nAmount to Much\nSo why do I tell you this story?\nWell, it’s not to say that you need a PhD in economics or a path that looks like mine.\nIt’s to say that the words I heard as I exited high school were never true. They were just a narrow\nperspective on what could be.\nThe truth is, decisions are rarely final and paths are rarely predetermined. We all have moments\nwhen we feel stuck or off course. But time passes, constraints fade, doors open, and your ambitions\nfollow.\nI didn’t start out wanting a PhD or even knowing what the letters meant. But I got a GED, and\nthat led to a class, and that led to a semester, and that led to a career.\nAnd looking back, I realize it was never the big houses that I went to see. It wasn’t the owners’\naccomplishments. It was the possibilities.\nA world where a single decision isn’t final. And we all have the opportunity to choose and choose\nagain.\n4\n\nAnd that is why I love CWI and why I am thrilled to be here tonight. It’s filled with possibilities.\nAnd it’s filled with choosers. Each of you put in hard work, dedication, and desire to earn a degree. You\nexpected a lot of yourselves and rose to meet the challenge.\nAs you leave tonight, my wish for you is that you always have the opportunity to choose.\nMy hope for you is that you always have the will to take it.\nAnd my want for you is that you always know that you already amount to much.\nCongratulations graduates! I look forward to seeing what you do.\n5",

    "text": "Forward-Looking Policy in a Real-Time World\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nGriswold Center for Economic Policy Studies\nPrinceton University, Princeton, NJ\nMarch 4, 2023, 1:00 PM ET\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThe most frequent question I am asked these days is, “What will the Fed do next?”\nI understand. People are worried. Inflation is high and the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) has taken aggressive policy action to bring it down. The responses range from fearing\nthese actions will tip the economy into a recession to fearing they won’t be enough to get the\njob done.\nFor most, this adds up to a lot of uncertainty. And the impulse to look for answers in the\nimmediate. The next meeting. The next data release. The next market update. It doesn’t help\nthat we face a round-the-clock ticker tape of economic and financial news.\nBut achieving our mandated goals takes time and a broader view. As policymakers, we have to\nrespond to an economy that is evolving in real time and prepare for what the economy will look\nlike in the future.\nSo today, I am going to do just that. I will pull back the lens from the immediate and talk about\nwhat the inflation landscape looked like before the pandemic, what it looks like now, and what\nboth could mean for the future.\nBefore I get started, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve\nsystem.\n1\n\nThe World We Had\nTo understand how future inflation could evolve, we must first remember where we were\nbefore the pandemic. So, let me start there.\nBefore the pandemic and the current episode of high inflation, the world was starkly different.\nThe central and decade-long challenge for the Federal Reserve and most other central banks\nwas trying to bring inflation up to target, rather than pushing it down.\nLarge structural forces were at play. The most notable was population aging, which was\naffecting the labor force and savings rates in industrialized and developing nations alike.1 Global\nproductivity growth was also slowing, affecting demand for investment.2 Together, these\ndevelopments brought about weaker trend growth and lower real interest rates, and they put\nsteady downward pressure on inflation.3 Economics and policy discussions became focused on\nsecular stagnation—a persistent state of little or no growth with economies running below\npotential. And a low neutral rate of interest, the zero lower bound on interest rates, and the\nrisks of consistently below target inflation were top of mind.4 ,5 ,6\nThe inflation challenges in the U.S. were pronounced (Figure 1). Despite sustained monetary\npolicy accommodation after the Great Recession, annual personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation remained below 2 percent for 84 of the 98 months from 2012 through February\n2020, or about 86 percent of the time.7 Over that same period, the federal funds rate was set\nnear zero almost half of the time and below the neutral rate of interest the entire time.8\nThis environment ended up offering some advantages. The economy was able to run\nconsistently above estimates of potential growth and unemployment was able to fall to near-\nhistoric levels without spurring inflation.\nBut it also came with risks. Namely, that inflation would fail to get to target in good times and\nfall further in bad ones. Eventually, this would seep into inflation expectations, reducing\nmonetary policy space and compounding the existing structural downward pressures on\n1 United Nations (2022) and Jones (2022).\n2 Fernald et al. (2017) and Fernald and Li (2022).\n3 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017) and Jordà et al. (2019).\n4 Summers (2014), Gordon (2015) and Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Summers (2016).\n5 Bernanke (2012), Dudley (2013), and Yellen (2013).\n6 Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2019), Mertens and Williams (2019), and Lansing (2021).\n7 The sustained accommodation included low interest rates, forward guidance, and the announcement of a formal\ninflation target in January 2012 (Board of Governors 2012).\n8 The neutral rate of interest declined over this period and currently is estimated to be about 2.5 percent.\n2\n\ninflation.9 The persistent deflation in Japan underscored this challenge, and it motivated the Fed\nand many other central banks to fight vigorously to get inflation up to target.10\nThis was the seemingly unchangeable topography of the economy before the pandemic.\nAnd then of course, everything changed.\nThe Pandemic Shock\nWe all know the story. When COVID-19 hit, the economy faltered. The Fed cut interest rates,\npurchased long-term assets, and opened lending facilities, all to help bridge the economy\nthrough the very worst. U.S. fiscal agents took equally aggressive action, infusing about $5\ntrillion in federal spending into the economy.\nThese actions were unprecedented. And they worked, to an extent. U.S. economic growth\nrebounded, demand surged, and the labor market began to recover. Supply chains, however,\nwere slow to respond. And by early 2021, price pressures were starting to build—first in a few\nsectors directly affected by the pandemic, and then more broadly, as imbalances between\nrobust demand and limited supply spread throughout the economy.11 By the fall of 2021,\ninflation was high and heading higher.\nThe chart puts the change in inflation in perspective (Figure 1). After averaging about 1.4\npercent per year in the low-inflation period, PCE inflation shot up to an average rate of 5.8\npercent between February 2021 and today—a quadrupling of average inflation.12 Said simply,\nwithin a year, inflation went from consistently undershooting our 2 percent target to reaching\nlevels not seen in more than a generation.\nIn response, the Fed pivoted from a stance of sustained accommodation to one of rapid\ntightening, first through forward guidance and then through conventional increases in interest\nrates. Since March of last year, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate at every meeting, by\n9 Amano, Carter, and Leduc (2020) and Diwan, Leduc, and Mertens (2020).\n10 It also prompted a review of policy objectives and tools that could reliably deliver on this goal. See Board of\nGovernors (2020).\n11 Initially, the FOMC believed the run-up in inflation was transitory. From April through November 2021, five\nconsecutive FOMC statements described inflation developments as “largely reflecting transitory factors” or “factors\nthat are expected to be transitory.” But the word “transitory” did not appear in any subsequent FOMC statements.\nNot everyone shared this initial view that inflation would be transitory, with some commentators arguing that the\nextensive federal fiscal relief to address the pandemic could trigger a prolonged episode of high inflation. See\nBlanchard (2021) and Summers (2021).\n12 Notably, the inflation surge over the past two years has brought the price level close to a linear trend of 2\npercent growth as measured since January 2012. Stated differently, the PCE price index has risen at an average,\nannual rate of slightly above 2 percent when measured over the entire 11-year period from January 2012 through\nJanuary 2023.\n3\n\nFigure 1\nA shock to inflation\nHeadline PCE inflation, Jan 2012 to Jan 2023 (12-month rate)\nAverage Annual Inflation Rates\nJan 2012 to Feb 2021 = 1.43%\nFeb 2021 to Jan 2023 = 5.82%\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis, FRBSF staff calculations. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\na cumulative total of 4½ percentage points. This is the fastest pace of monetary policy\ntightening in 40 years. Broader financial market conditions, which capture funds rate\nmovements, along with FOMC forward guidance and the reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet,\nhave tightened even more.13\nThis tightening, while pronounced, was and remains appropriate given the magnitude and\npersistence of elevated inflation readings. Higher interest rates help bridle demand growth,\nbringing it back in line with supply. This rebalancing helps reduce inflation pressures.14\nAnd this is what we are seeing (Figure 2). The economy has been gradually slowing and inflation\nhas followed. Since June of 2022, overall inflation has been easing, falling from its highs of\naround 7 percent to its current reading of 5.4 percent in January of this year.\nThis is good news, a sign that policy is doing its job and—along with improvements in supply—\nworking to reduce the imbalances that have pushed inflation so high. But the work is far from\ndone.\n13 Choi et al. (2022).\n14 The Phillips curve summarizes the link between inflation and economic activity. For evidence, see Hazell et al.\n(2022) and Jørgensen and Lansing (2021, 2023). Shapiro (2022) decomposes inflation into demand-driven versus\nsupply-driven components.\n4\n\nFigure 2\nInflation components: Goods and services\nDecomposition of headline PCE inflation (12-month rate)\nJan2023\n5.4%\n6%\nGoods\nHousing\nOther services\nApproximation error\nHeadline\n4%\n2%\n0%\n-2%\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis, FRBSF staff calculations. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\nOverall inflation remains well above target and contributions from each of the components of\ninflation—goods, housing, and other services—remain well above their historical trend (Figure\n2). Moreover, the incoming data have been bumpy. The recent PCE reading is a good example.\nAfter months of decline, headline and core inflation both ticked up in January on a 12-month\nbasis, and the monthly inflation rate rose at its fastest pace in seven months. This suggests that\nthe disinflation momentum we need is far from certain.\nPutting all of this together, it’s clear there is more work to do. In order to put this episode of\nhigh inflation behind us, further policy tightening, maintained for a longer time, will likely be\nnecessary. Restoring price stability is our mandate and it is what the American people expect.\nSo, the FOMC remains resolute in achieving this goal.\nAs we work toward that end, we must also consider the world we are entering. What will the\npressures on inflation be once the pandemic shock has fully worn off? Will we return to a world\nwhere the central bank struggles to get inflation up to target? Or has the pandemic left a more\npermanent imprint, such that the pressures on inflation now trend higher and we have to work\nto keep them at bay?\n5\n\nThe answers aren’t yet clear. But the questions are imperative.\nAn Uncharted Path\nWe know what forces drove the pre-pandemic inflation trend. And we know what forces are\ndriving the ongoing pandemic-induced inflation surge. What we don’t know is how they will\nevolve and interact after the pandemic is gone, or what this new confluence will mean for\nunderlying inflation.\nIndeed, a number of forces have either grown in importance during the pandemic era or were\nset in motion by it. And I want to touch on four in particular that could counterbalance or even\noffset entirely the deflationary trend of the past.\nOne is a decline in global price competition. If firms decide to reshore some or all of their\nforeign production facilities, costs and prices are likely to continue to rise. My conversations\nwith business leaders suggest that some of this is already happening. But it’s a major\nundertaking to completely revamp well-established production networks, and it remains to be\nseen how far this trend will go. One thing, however, is clear. Globalization has been a key driver\nof past goods deflation in the United States.15 And a trend toward less global competition could\nmean more inflation in the goods sector and more pressure on overall inflation going forward.16\nAnother potential factor affecting future inflation is the ongoing domestic labor shortage. Labor\nforce participation fell precipitously during the pandemic and has been slow to recover,\nespecially among workers aged 55 years and older. These developments exacerbate the already\nsignificant downward drag on participation related to population aging.17 Absent a substantial\npickup in the share of working-age adults looking to be employed or a large change in\nimmigration flows,18 labor force participation will continue to decline and worker shortages will\npersist, pushing up wages and ultimately prices, at least in the near and medium term.\nInflation pressures could also move upward as firms make the transition to a greener economy,\nwhich will require investment in new processes and infrastructure. As firms increase\ninvestments in renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, they are likely to pass some\nportion of these transition costs on to consumers, boosting inflation. This increased demand for\ninvestment could raise the neutral rate of interest, at least in the short and medium term,\nlessening the importance of the zero lower bound and the downward pressures on inflation that\ncame with it.19\n15 See for example Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido (2010).\n16 See Figure 2 (green bars) for the contributions of goods inflation to overall PCE inflation over time.\n17 Hornstein and Kudlyak (2019; updated FRBSF estimates) and Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).\n18 Duzhak (2023).\n19 Daly (2021).\n6\n\nFinally,—and this is at the forefront of my mind as a policymaker—there is the possibility that\ninflation expectations could change. To date, these expectations—especially in the longer run—\nhave remained stable and well anchored near the Fed’s 2 percent goal.20 In other words, so far,\ninflation psychology has not shifted and public faith in the Fed’s ability to achieve its price\nstability mandate remains intact. But the longer inflation remains high, the more likely it is to\nundermine confidence. And once high inflation becomes embedded in public psychology, it is\nvery hard to change.\nAny or all of these factors could influence the natural tilt of inflation and the monetary policy\napproach necessary to maintain price stability over the long term.\nThe hard part, of course, is knowing when and how each of these factors will evolve or what\nforce they will have relative to the strong pull coming from population aging and slow\nproductivity growth. If those pre-pandemic trends reemerge as the dominant structural forces,\nthen our efforts to bring inflation down will be reinforced by natural features of the economy.\nBut if the old dynamics are eclipsed by other, newer influences and the pressures on inflation\nstart pushing upward instead of downward, then policy will likely need to do more.\nWe don’t know what the trend will be. But we do know that, while we continue to diffuse the\nongoing inflation shock, we need to be working to gather data and research that illuminates the\nlikely path forward. That’s prudent policymaking.\nThe Duality of Policymaking\nStill, when things are hard and you’re in the middle of it, it’s easy to get caught up in the here\nand now. So much so that we can forget to look forward, take stock, and imagine what the\nfuture could hold.\nBut policymaking requires it. The pandemic and its shockwaves will one day fully dissipate. And\nwe must be ready.\nSo as I close today, I will return to the question I started with: What will the Fed do next?\nMy answer: We will work on the economy we have, and prepare for the economy to come.\nThat’s what this moment demands.\nThank you.\n20 Armantier et al.

    "text": "FINAL\n“Bloom Where You’re Planted”*\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSyracuse University Commencement\nSyracuse, NY\nMay 12, 2019\n11:00AM ET\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n*This speech is dedicated to all those who helped me get here.\nIntroduction\nWow. This is awesome, and I’m not even graduating. Such a big crowd.\nSo much excitement.\nyou\nBefore I begin, I want all the graduates – and only the graduates – to\ngive yourselves a big round of applause. This is a special day, and I want to\ntake in its meaningfulness.\nThe last time I was here, I was getting my Ph.D. and serving as a\ngraduation marshal. I was excited, of course, but also slightly nervous that I\nwould mess up my role as flag bearer during our procession.\nThis is way more responsibility. But luckily, I don’t have to carry\nanything.\nChancellor Syverud, thank you so much for entrusting me with this\nhonor. And thank you for that very kind introduction.\nSince becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,\nI’ve listened to a lot of introductions about myself.\n1\n\nFINAL\nThere is a common thread in all of them. An ‘unlikely’ path. GED to PhD\nto CEO. Forty years of life condensed into three, rarely seen together,\nacronyms.\nThe question that almost always follows is: How did it happen? Am I\nexceptional? Did I see forty years ago the life I have today?\nThe answer is simple: not at all.\nBetsy\nForty years ago, I was sitting in the parking lot of a McDonald’s near\nBallwin, Missouri, where I grew up. I had driven there to meet a woman\nnamed Betsy, a friend of my high school guidance counselor.\nBetsy was in her mid-30s, a successful woman, busy building her life\nand career. I was 15, my family was in chaos, I’d dropped out of high school,\nand I was living with friends. My counselor thought Betsy could help.\nBetsy had the fanciest car I had ever seen. It had a tan leather interior,\nand when the sun shined in, it felt warm and safe. It was a refuge.\nMy counselor was right. Betsy took me under her wing. She encouraged\nme to get a GED. She paid $216 for my first semester of college. [I know, it’s\nhard to believe.] And that started the journey that led me here, to a PhD from\nSyracuse University.\nBut those are the highlights of the story, and they don’t capture how\nBetsy really changed my life.\nSitting in that car, feeling like my world was out of control, I wanted\nBetsy to give me answers, to fix things. Instead, she told me:\n“Mary, you have to bloom where you’re planted.”\n2\n\nFINAL\nI was shocked. I immediately protested. I said it wasn’t fair. I didn’t\nknow how to manage my life. I was only 15. It all seemed too much.\nI blamed others. I blamed myself. For a moment, I even blamed her. I felt\nlost.\nHow was I going to make it?\nMary, you have to bloom where you’re planted.\nSo she said it again. More gently this time.\nBuilding resiliency\nThe fact that you have to start from where you are is hard. It’s an easy\nstatement to understand, but a much tougher one to accept.\nLife can be unfair. Not everyone begins from the same position. And as\nyou go out in the world, you may find yourself short of where you think you\nshould be.\nSometimes it knocks the wind out of you. Sometimes it makes you\nangry. It always leaves you feeling a little unsure.\nMy situation was tough. Betsy never denied it. But she told me that I had\none life, and I shouldn’t let it be defined by the bad draw I’d gotten.\nHer advice was to accept my frustration and sadness, and let it inform –\nbut not determine – my future. Let it serve as a reminder, but not a barrier.\nfreeing\nI’ll be honest… accepting my situation was difficult. But I also found it\n.\nIt meant I could change my life. That my presence mattered. That I had\nsome say in my own success.\nIt helped me be resilient, and it allowed me to bounce back, make my\n3\nway, and stand in front of you today.\n\nFINAL\nBloom where you’re planted\nBut acceptance and blooming aren’t the same. So how do you thrive?\nFor me, it’s been about being open.\nEvery week when I saw Betsy, she had a new book for me. Sometimes it\nwas about art, sometimes history, maybe even poetry. And always, there were\nthe biographies.\nI drank it all in. And it let me live in a world beyond my own experience.\nMy father was a postman. My mom stayed home and took care of us. I\nhad loved school, but the challenges of our daily lives consumed me. And they\ncrowded out my interest in other things. They made me insular, and inward-\nfacing. They left me feeling alone.\nBetsy’s books took me outside myself. They generated ideas –\nperspectives I’d never considered, concepts I’d never thought of. They also\nshowed me paths – taken by other people, people I didn’t know – that seemed\nhope\ncompletely improbable and wildly unrealistic.\nThey sparked .\nSo when Betsy suggested I get a GED, I was willing to give it a try.\nGrowing into yourself\nBut that’s not the end of the story. Betsy is a nudger. I’d get one thing\ndone, and she would suggest another, even more improbable sounding\npossibility. Once I had a GED, she suggested I go to college.\nI’d never imagined college – I’d barely heard of it. But I wanted to be\nlike Betsy. And I certainly didn’t want to let her down. So I went.\n4\n\nFINAL\nI was in way over my head during my first semesters of college.\nFamiliar feelings crept in. Fear, mostly. A sense that maybe I didn’t belong, and\nI couldn’t make it.\nSo I worked day and night, and took as many classes as allowed, all in an\nattempt to catch up and boost my confidence. I told myself I could fake it until\nI made it.\nAnd I did make it. But not in the linear, predictable fashion you might\nthink.\nI graduated with a degree in economics… and philosophy. But I loved\nthe arts, and got my first jobs out of college at a theatre, and a dance company.\nmicro social\nEventually I returned to economics and public policy, which brought me to\nmacro monetary\nSyracuse. And after getting a PhD in economics and policy, I chose\na job working on economics and policy at the San Francisco\nFed.\nNow when people hear these details, they often conclude that I must be\nwhen\namazingly self-assured. But the truth is, I’ve spent years struggling with my\nconfidence. Wondering , not if, I would be found out.\nWhen would people dig through the veneer I had created and discover\nthat, beneath the degrees, the accomplishments, and the contributions, I was\nsimply an imposter – that scared kid in Betsy’s car.\nHere is the big reveal. True confidence came only recently for me.\nMostly because I spent years focusing on the wrong thing.\nOther people weren’t waiting to criticize me, or judge me for my past. I\nwas doing that to myself. I was constantly trying to rise above my background.\nThe secret all along was to just embrace it.\n5\n\nFINAL\nMy experiences absolutely define me, but in a way I hadn’t been able to\nsee. They make me focus on others, be tolerant of fresh starts, celebrate wins,\ndespite because\nand look for ways to contribute.\nIn other words, I’m not who I am my life. I am who I am\nof it.\nDon’t go it alone\nSo with all those shrouds of doubt laying over me, how did I ever come\nto see who I was? With the help of many others.\nWe’re often taught to admire people who pull themselves up by their\nbootstraps and forge a path completely on their own. It can make it hard to be\nvulnerable, and ask someone for help.\nBut I didn’t have the luxury of standing alone when I met Betsy at 15.\nAnd it taught me that we all need Betsys – in fact, we need a lot of them\nthroughout our lives.\nA few years ago, I received an award from my undergraduate school –\nthe University of Missouri-Kansas City – for ‘defying the odds.’ Winning the\naward was a great honor. But the most amazing part was getting to invite all\nthe people who had helped me get there.\nMy wife Shelly and I hosted a dinner of gratitude. Betsy was there, of\ncourse. But so was my sixth grade best friend… my undergraduate economics\nprofessor – a fellow Syracuse grad! – who drove from Phoenix to attend… the\ncouple who brought me into their home in Kansas City when I felt homesick.\nAnd there were many others, too.\n6\n\nFINAL\nThey all had one thing in common. They had been my supporters.\nListening when I needed to talk, believing in me when I lost faith, and pushing\nme when I got stuck.\nlesser\nWhen I looked around that table, I can tell you with complete certainty\nthat my life wasn’t because I’d gotten help along the way. It was far, far\nricher.\nEmbrace your path\nToday is about celebrating your accomplishments. It’s about taking in\nyour time here, and looking forward to your future.\nBut my advice isn’t for today.\nIt’s for all your future days. The ones that make you stretch and grow as\nyou learn who you are, and what you want to contribute.\nAnd on those days, I hope you’ll be open. Open to opportunities you\nhaven’t yet conceived of, and to paths you’ve never imagined.\nDon’t worry if your journey wanders, or if your seemingly perfect plans\nend up being not quite right. This is just part of exploring, and it helps you\nfigure out what’s right for you.\nAnd when something goes wrong, and fear and worry creep in, I hope\nyou’ll remember Betsy’s words: You have to bloom where you’re planted.\nYou may not always be in control of where you land. But you can\nabsolutely decide how you’re going to live there.\nOwn your situation. Let it make you resilient. Let it fuel your confidence.\nBe vulnerable enough to ask for help, and be brave enough to take it.\n7\n\nFINAL\nIf you do these things, I promise: you’ll be great. Able to thrive in the\nmost unlikely of places. Able to achieve the completely improbable and the\nwildly unrealistic.\nThank you, and congratulations. I can’t wait to see who you become.\n8",

The relative importance of these two margins varies significantly over the\nbusiness cycle. When labor markets are tight, continuously full-time employed workers\ndrive wage growth.

Aggregate\nreal wages exhibit less variability over time than standard macroeconomic models predict and\nobserved movements appear only modestly related to business cycle fluctuations.1 Both of\nthese patterns are evident in Figure 1 which plots growth in real median weekly earnings and\nthe unemployment rate. As the figure shows, aggregate real wage growth, measured as median\nweekly earnings, varies less than the unemployment rate, a standard measure of business\ncycle movements.2 Moreover, and in contrast to most models, there is no consistent pattern\nof comovement between wage growth and the unemployment rate.3 Over the course of our\nsample, aggregate wage growth has looked procyclical, countercyclical, and acyclical.4\nPrevious research attempting to reconcile the data with the theory have focused on two\nwedges: (1) changes in workforce composition, namely countercyclical increases in the average\nmarginal product of workers, and (2) departures from neoclassical wage setting practices,\nincluding models of wage bargaining and wage rigidity. The results confirm that both factors\nplay a role.5 That said, neither can fully account for the range of variation highlighted in\n1Several authors have concluded that wages are modestly tied to business cycle conditions: for example,\nLucas (1977); Mankiw (1989); and Christiano & Eichenbaum (1992). See Abraham & Haltiwanger (1995) for\na survey of empirical studies of real-wage growth over the business cycle.\n2The limited variability of aggregate real wage growth fails the predictions of a variety of macro models\nincluding real business cycle models (Hansen, 1985) and models of frictional unemployment (Shimer, 2005).\nThe flipside of this is that unemployment, employment, and hours tend to move more than these models\npredict, suggesting that most of the adjustments in the labor market come through quantities rather than\nprices.\n3While most models expect wages to exhibit some cyclicality, the direction depends on the model. For\nexample,Kydland&Prescott(1982),RobertJ.Barro(1984),Rotemberg&Woodford(1992),andBartelsman\net al.(1994)allpositprocyclicalrealwageswhileacountercyclicalrelationshipispredictedbyKeynesianwith\nsticky wages. See Swanson (2007) for a brief review of these issues.\n4Incontrasttothemovementsofaggregaterealwagegrowth,realwagefluctuationsofindividualshavebeen\nfoundtobeconsistentlyprocyclical,risingastheunemploymentratefallsandfallingastheunemploymentrate\nrises. Moreover, in keeping with standard macro theory, the size of the response is non-trivial. For example,\nseveralauthorsincludingBils(1985), GarySolon(1994), andDevereux(2001)findthataonepercentincrease\nintheunemploymentratereducesreal-wagegrowthofindividualsbyabout1.3percentagepoints. Thispattern\nholds across decades and for various subpopulations of the labor market.\n5For example, previous studies have shown that employment losses during economic downturns dispro-\nportionately occur workers with lower than average wages (Hines et al., 2001). This upskilling implies less\nvariation in aggregate real wages than would be implied by models where workers are homogeneous and wages\nadjustuniformly(Altonji&Devereux,2000). Researchhasshownthatcontrollingforcompositionbias, wages\narehighlyprocyclical(Perry,1972),(Bils,1985),and(GarySolon,1994)Ingeneral,modelsofwagebargaining\nhave been used to explain why aggregate wages adjust less than employment or hours and nominal rigidities\nPage 2\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nFigure 1. Moreover, these factors have proven difficult to capture in standard macro models,\nmaking them of limited use in addressing some of the key puzzles related to labor market\nadjustment over the business cycle. This is because the typical margins of wage adjustment\nin macroeconomic models relate to worker flows into and out of employment and to a lesser\nextent from job-to-job. These margins are not easily linked to observations on compositional\nshifts in worker quality or to rigidities created by wage setting practices.\nOur paper fills this gap by examining the dynamics of real wage adjustment as they re-\nlate to intensive and extensive adjustments in the labor market. Specifically, we decompose\nthe fluctuations in aggregate real median weekly earnings displayed in Figure 1 into the wage\ngrowth of continuously full-time employed workers –the intensive margin– and the wage dif-\nferences of those moving into and out of full-time employment –the extensive margin. Using\nthis decomposition we document how the contributions of these two margins vary over the\nbusiness cycle. We also net out the effects of intensive and extensive margin adjustments over\ntime and relate them to the observed variance and cyclicality of aggregate real wage growth.\nOur results provide useful guidance to macro modelers interested in tracking the differential\nresponses of labor market prices (wages) and quantities (unemployment).\nThe key results are as follows. Both the intensive and extensive margins affect real wage\ngrowth, but their relative contributions vary over the business cycle. The intensive mar-\ngin is procyclical and accounts for most of the variance of real wage growth, mainly due to\nwage changes among job switchers. The extensive margin is countercyclical and, in business\ncycle downturns, offsets more than half of the procyclicality of the intensive margin. Dur-\ning recessions, much of the extensive margin adjustment comes from flows between full-time\nemployment and part-time/self-employment and between full-time and not-in-the-labor-force.\nThis was especially important during the Great Recession. Somewhat surprisingly given its\ncentral placement in macroeconomic models of wage fluctuations, the unemployment margin\nis relatively less important for the variance and cyclicality of real wage growth.\nhavebeencitedasareasonforthelimitedcyclicalresponsivenessofwages(Card&Hyslop,1997;Lebowet al.,\n2003; Dickens et al., 2007; Barattieri et al., 2014; Daly & Hobijn, 2014). See Pissarides (2009) and Kudlyak\n(2010) for two useful overviews.\nPage 3\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS) data and discuss its key advantages. We then provide a narrative\nexample of how the intensive and extensive margins affect median real wage growth in Section\n3. In Section 4 we formalize this intuition and introduce a decomposition method that allows\nus to decompose the change in median wages into the contribution from: (1) the wage growth\nof continuously full-time employed workers and (2) the relative wage levels of workers entering\nand exiting full-time employment. In Section 5 we present the results of our decomposition of\nreal median weekly earnings growth in the U.S. from 1980 through 2015. We conclude with\nSection 6.\n2 Data and Measurement Issues\nWe use data from the CPS which has the advantage of being a long-standing, nationally\nrepresentative, publicly available data source on earnings and labor market status. The CPS\nalso is one of the key sources of information on aggregate U.S. wage growth.6 The most\ncommonly quoted aggregate measure of wages derived from the CPS, and the one we focus on\nin our analysis, is median usual weekly earnings (MWE) of full-time wage and salary workers.7\nMWE is published at a quarterly frequency. Usual weekly earnings are defined as “...earnings\nbefore taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or tips usually\nreceived (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders).”8\n6Previous research on the drivers of aggregate wage dynamics relied on smaller panel surveys which pro-\nvide detailed data on individuals. For example, Bils (1985) uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth\n(NLS/Y). Gary Solon (1994), Devereux (2001), and Hagedorn & Manovskii (2013) use the Panel Study of In-\ncome Dynamics (PSID). Gertler & Trigari (2009), Barattieri et al. (2014) use data from the Survey of Income\nand Program Participation (SIPP). Card & Hyslop (1997), like we do here, use data from the CPS.\n7The focus on full-time wage earners still means that MWE is affected by fluctuations in overtime pay, as\nwellasatrendintheaverageworkweekforfull-timeworkers(SeePerry,1972,foradiscussionoftheseissues).\n8The CPS survey questions related to usual weekly earnings have evolved over time: Prior to 1994, re-\nspondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been\naskedtoidentifytheeasiestwayforthemtoreportearnings(hourly,weekly,biweekly,twicemonthly,monthly,\nannually, other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis\nother than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term usual is as perceived by the respondent. If\nthe respondent asks for a definition of usual, interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half\nthe weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011).\nPage 4\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nTo show how the CPS data on aggregate real wage growth compares with alternative\naggregate wage measures, especially those used in other empirical studies, Figure 2 plots\naveragehourlyearnings(AHE)ofproductionandnon-supervisoryworkersintheprivatesector,\ncompensationperhour(CPH)inthenonfarmbusinesssector, andtheEmploymentCostIndex\n(ECI)alongwithMWEfromtheCPSfrom1980through2011.9 Allmeasuresofnominalwages\naredeflatedbythePersonalConsumptionExpendituresPriceIndex(PCEPI)sothatthefigure\nplots growth in real wages.\nAs the figure shows, all of these measures are highly correlated and exhibit similar cyclical\npatterns. ThecorrelationofrealwagegrowthmeasuredbyMWEwiththeotherthreemeasures\nis 0.6 or higher. Importantly for our work is that the MWE series captures the coincident\nmovements of the different compensation growth measures very well. Visual inspection shows\nthat MWE is rarely an outlier across the series in terms of fluctuations in growth.10\nImportantly for our study, the CPS also provides the individual micro data underlying\nMWE, including information on earnings levels and labor market status.11 These micro data\ncan be used cross-sectionally or, as we do, to construct short panels of individual respondents.\nTo understand the type of information contained in each of these short panels it is useful to\nreview the CPS survey structure. The CPS is a dwelling-based survey in which households\nare included for 16 months. Over this period, individual household members are interviewed\nmonthly for the first four months, not interviewed for the next eight months, and then inter-\nviewed monthly again for the remaining four months before being retired from the sample.12\nTable 1 provides an illustration of this structure. The regular monthly surveys collect very\nbasic information about labor market status. Earnings information along with other details of\n9For example, Gertler & Trigari (2009) focus on AHE for the empirical analysis in their paper while Gal´ı\n(2011)focusesonCPHforhisestimateoftheNew-KeynesianWagePhillipsCurve. Lebowetal.(2003)analyze\nthe National Compensation Survey data on which the ECI is based.\n10The exception to this statement is 1994, when MWE rose much more rapidly than the other series. This\ncoincides with the CPS redesign and the way the survey was changed to determine whether someone is a\npart-time or full-time employee.\n11Of the four measures of real wage growth in Figure 2, MWE, which is based on the CPS, is the only one\nfor which underlying individual level data is available that covers both the level of earnings of workers as well\nas their labor market status.\n12Because the CPS is a dwelling-based survey, individuals who change residences are dropped from the\nsample.\nPage 5\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\njobs are collected twice during a household survey tenure, once in survey month 4 and again\nin survey month 16.13 Earnings and job information are collected only for individuals who are\nemployed at the time of the interview. Following other researchers, we rely most heavily on the\ninformation collected in survey months 4 and 16 and use the additional information collected\nin other survey months to refine our labor market status measures as described below. To\nmatch individuals across surveys we follow Madrian & Lefgren (1999) and Nekarda (2009).14\nSinceweareinterestedindisentanglingtheintensiveandextensivemarginsofwagegrowth,\nwe construct a series of short panels based on individuals who we observe in both months 4 and\n16. We then calculate an alternative MWE growth series using this sequence. This alternative\nMWE growth series, which we term “Matched MWE Growth”is what we decompose. Though\nour Matched MWE Growth measure does not exactly match the published statistic, the two\nare highly correlated, with a correlation of 0.79.15\nTo be able to link wage growth to different labor market states, we next classify individuals\nbased on their reported labor market status. This allows us to divide individuals in our\nMatched MWE Growth series into five mutually exclusive groups. These are listed in Table 2.\nAs the table shows, we first divide individuals into two groups: (i) those who are continuously\nfull-time employed and have a reported wage in both survey month 4 and survey month 16,\nand (ii) those who move into or out of full-time employment and have a reported wage in\neither survey month 4 or survey month 16. We label these two groups the intensive and\nextensive margin, respectively. This nomenclature reflects how the intensive margin of wage\n13Surveymonths4and16arecommonlyreferredtoastheoutgoingrotationgroupssincetheyareindividuals\ntemporarily moving off the sample frame or permanently retiring from the survey. The matched samples of\nthese outgoing rotation groups are known as the MORG files.\n14For more details about how we construct and match the data see Daly et al. (2011). One concern about\nusing the CPS to track individuals over time is that the sample may not be representative of the population.\nSince the CPS is a dwelling based survey, when individuals change residences they are dropped from the\nsample and the new occupants of the unit are interviewed. While this does not alter the cross-sectional\nrepresentativenessoftheCPS,itcanpotentiallyinterferewithrepresentativenessoftheindividual-basedshort\npanels, especially if moving is related to the variables being analyzed. However, work by Nekarda (2009)\nand Kim (2009) that carefully corrects for this type of sample attrition finds that the biases introduced are\nempirically modest. Thus, we use the raw CPS matched data as our baseline for analysis.\n15DuetothescramblingbytheCensusBureauofidentifiersthatweusetomatchindividualsacrossmonths,\nwe are unable to perform this matching for two sub-periods of our sample, namely October 1985 through\nSeptember 1986 and September 1995 through August 1996.\nPage 6\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\ngrowth captures the intensity with which continuously full-time employed workers get paid\nwhile the extensive margin captures the effect on aggregate wages of entry and exit into full-\ntime employment.\nTo enable us to further track the drivers of real wage adjustment, we further divide these\nworkersasfollows. Withintheintensive marginwedistinguishbetween: (1)Same job (S), full-\ntime employed in the same job in both periods, and (2) Job changers (C), full-time employed\nin a different job from one period to the next.16 The extensive margin is split up by transitions\nto or from full-time employment and: (3) part-time/self-employment (P), (4) unemployment\n(U), and (5) not in the labor force (N).\nAlthoughmostofthesestatescanbedirectlyobservedinthesurveydata, theCPSprovides\nno specific information on whether full-time employed earners have stayed at the same job or\nchanged jobs over the sample. Following previous research, we impute the fraction of full-\ntime workers who stay in the same job versus change jobs using reported information on\nindustry, occupation and whether or not the individual works for the same employer in both\nperiods (Fallick & Fleischman, 2004; Nagyp´al, 2008). Our measure identifies as a job changers\nindividuals who change employers and individuals who change jobs but not employers.\n3 Labor Market Flows and Wage Growth\nTo preview how intensive and extensive labor market adjustments can affect median wage\ngrowth Table 3 reports the average shares (1980-2015) of wage earners who occupy each of\nthe five states at the beginning of the period (survey month 4) and at the end of the period\n(survey month 16) as well as the fraction of these workers who earned below median earnings\nin the period. The first thing to note is that the vast majority (89 percent) of wage earners are\ncontinuously full-time employed over a 12 month period. About 41 percent of these workers\nstayed in the same job over the period while about 48 percent changed jobs. Of the remaining\n16Makingthisdistinctionisimportantgiventhedifferentcyclicalpatternsofwagegrowthamongjobstayers\nand job changers (Bils, 1985; Devereux, 2001; Hagedorn & Manovskii, 2013; Haefke et al., 2013).\nPage 7\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nwage earners, 2.6 percent of those full-time employed at the beginning of the year end up\nunemployed at the end of it and about 2.6 percent of those full-time employed at the end\nof the year were unemployed at the beginning. In contrast, flows into and out of full-time\nemployment from part-time/self-employed and not in the labor force are substantially larger.\nThe fact that so many flows occur along these margins suggests that they could play a bigger\nrole in real wage adjustments than normally considered.\nThe second thing to note is that the distribution of earnings among those flowing into, or\noutof, full-timeemploymentlieswelltotheleftofthatforthecontinuouslyfull-timeemployed.\nAbout half of those continuously full-time employed earn wages below the median; job stayers\nhave slightly higher earnings than job changers. In contrast, about two-thirds (63.9 percent)\nof full-time workers who exit to unemployment were earning below median wages. An even\nlarger fraction, 72.5 percent, of those making the reverse transition, from unemployment to\nfull-time employment, make less than median earnings. This means that in general when\nunemployment rises, it disproportionately pulls out workers making below median earnings.\nHolding the wages of other workers constant, this serves to increase in the aggregate median\nwage. The part-time/self-employed and not in the labor force margins contribute in a similar\nway. Most of their flows into and out of full-time employment occur below the median. Thus,\nwhen exits from full-time employment to part-time employment/self-employment and not-in-\nthe-labor-force increase, the aggregate median wage tends to rise.\nThese results highlight the potential for both intensive and extensive margins in the labor\nmarket to matter for aggregate real wage growth. We now turn to a more formal method of\nquantifying these effects and tracking their relative importance over the business cycle.\n4 Formal Decomposition of Median Real Wage Growth\nOur goal is to formally track the contributions of the intensive and extensive margins to\nfluctuations in median real earnings growth over the business cycle. Developing a method to\ntracking the median and its drivers, rather than the more straightforward mean, is important\nPage 8\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nfor several reasons.17 First, the growth rate (log change) of the median is what is published\nquarterly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Second, in surveys of individual earnings, such\nas the CPS, the aggregate mean can be affected by missing or implausible values at the lower\nend and top coding at the upper end of the earnings distribution. Finally, the methodology\nused to decompose the median can be applied to decompose any percentile of the wage growth\ndistribution, allowing for a much richer understanding of how intensive and extensive margin\nadjustments affect fluctuations in wage inequality.\nThe problem is that percentiles, such as the median, are nonlinear functions of the under-\nlying conditional percentiles. As such there is no way to directly decompose the movements\nin the unconditional median into the contributions of the changes in the medians of different\nsubgroups. To get around this researchers have proposed two different approaches. Both of\nthese approaches involve relating the change in the median to shifts in distribution functions\nover time.\nThe first approach, developed by DiNardo et al. (1996), decomposes the change in the\ndistributionfunctionbycalculatingaseriesofcounterfactualdistributionfunctionsandimplied\nmedians based on iteratively altering the drivers of interest. This method is especially useful\nfor evaluating large changes in distributions over long periods of time. The main drawback of\nthis method is that it is not additive. Consequently, the decomposition can lead to over- or\nunder-explaining the total change in the median.\nAs discussed in Fortin et al. (2011), a second possible approach is to linearize the change\nin the distribution function with respect to the log-level of the wage. By construction this\nresults in an additive decomposition of the change in the median. Our decomposition is an\napplication of this second approach. Because it involves a linear approximation, this method\nis useful for analyzing small changes over relatively short periods of time. The annual changes\nin the distribution of log-wage levels that we analyze exactly fit this use.\n17Ifwewereinterestedinmeanrealwagegrowththiswouldbesimple. Wecouldapplyastandardshift-share\ndecomposition of the type used by Juhn & Potter (2006) to investigate changes in labor force participation or\nBartelsman et al. (2004) to investigate average labor productivity growth.\nPage 9\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\n4.1 “Shift-share”analysis of change in log real earnings distribution\nOur method performs a shift-share-type analysis of the change in the cumulative distribution\nfunction. ToseethisconsiderFigure3. Thefigureplotstwolog-earningsdistributionfunctions,\nF(W) and G(W). These are the earnings distribution functions at the beginning and end of\nthe period, respectively. The medians associated with these two distribution functions are\ngiven by w and w(cid:48).\nTo illustrate the relationship between changes in the median and changes in the underlying\ndistribution function we assume, without loss of generality, that there is positive growth in the\npercentile over the period and that w(cid:48) > w. These percentiles satisfy\n1/\n2\n= F (w) = G(w(cid:48)). (1)\nThe decomposition proceeds as follows. First, we decompose F (w(cid:48))−F (w) and G(w(cid:48))−\nG(w) into contributions by the intensive and extensive margins we examine. We then apply\nthe mean value theorem to translate these contributions, measured along the vertical axis in\nFigure 3, into changes in earnings along the horizontal axis, i.e. w(cid:48) − w. This yields the\ndecomposition of the change in the median of log earnings.\nA standard shift-share analysis is based on the fact that the unconditional mean is the\nmarginal-density-weighted sum of conditional means. For our analysis we exploit that, simi-\nlarly,theunconditionalCDFisthemarginal-density-weightedaverageoftheconditionalCDFs.\nIn particular, we condition on the labor market states, l, listed in Table 2.\nWe denote the fraction of full-time employed wage and salary workers in each of these\nstates at the beginning of the period by φ(l) and their wage distribution conditional on their\nlabor market state by F (W | l). This allows us to write\n(cid:88)\nF (W) = φ(l)F (W | l). (2)\nl\nA similar decomposition can be applied to G(W).\nPage 10\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nThis observation allows us to apply a shift-share decomposition to the change in the dis-\ntribution functions at the median at the beginning of the period, i.e. at w. This yields\n(cid:88)\nF (w)−G(w) = φ(l)[F (w | l)−G(w | l)] (3)\nl∈{S,C}\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\n+ φ(l)[F (w | l)−1/\n2\n]− γ(l)[G(w | l)−1/\n2\n]\nl∈{P,U,N} l∈{P,U,N}\n(cid:88)\n− (γ(l)−φ(l))[G(w | l)−1/\n2\n].\nl∈{S,C}\nHere γ(l) and G(W | l) are definined in a similar way to φ(l) and F (W | l). Each of the three\nlines in the above equation capture a different reason for the shift in the distribution function.\nFor the job stayers, S, and the job changers, C, the first line measures the difference\nbetween the fraction of each of these groups that is below the median at the beginning of\nthe period and the fraction that is below the median at the end of the period. That is, for\neach of the two categories of continuously full-time employed the first line gives the fraction\nof them that moved across the median. This is equivalent to the shift-part of a conventional\nshift-share analysis. Because this line captures the effect on the distribution of wage changes\nfor the continuously full-time employed, we denote this as the intensive margin effect on the\ndistributional shift.\nThe two terms in the second line of equation (3) reflect the effect of exit out of and entry\ninto full-time employment on the wage distribution respectively. For each group, the first term\nmeasures the fraction of those that exit from below the median. Exit from below the median,\ni.e. F (w | l) > 1/\n2\n, shifts the wage distribution rightward, increases F (w)−G(w), and thus\nputs upward pressure on the median. Hence the plus sign in front of this first term. The\nsecond term measures the fraction that enters below the median. Such entry tends to shift\nthe wage distribution leftward and pull down the median. This is why this term is preceded\nby a minus sign. Because the terms in the second line of equation (3) quantify the part of the\ndistributional shift that is due to entry and exit, we include this in the extensive margin effect\non the wage distribution dynamics.\nPage 11\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nAs for the third line of equation (3), if net entry is zero, such that\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nφ(l) = γ(l), (4)\nl∈{P,U,N} l∈{P,U,N}\nthen, by definition, γ(S) = φ(S) and γ(C) = φ(C), and the third line is zero.\nIt is not necessarily zero when there is net entry into or exit out of full-time employment.\nThis line captures the effect of the net entry share on the wage distribution. For example,\nconsider the case in which net entry is negative and there is no full replacement of outflows out\nof full-time employment, γ(l) > φ(l). If exit exceeds entry for groups that generally earn less\nthan the median, such that, G(w | l) > 1/\n2\n, then this shifts the wage distribution rightwards\nand pushes up the median wage. This is the distributional version of a conventional share\neffect. Because this share effect is only non-zero in case there is net entry or exit, we include\nit in the extensive margin of the dynamics of the wage distribution.\nIn terms of Figure 3, equation (3) decomposes F (w) − G(w), which is the downward\narrow at the median at the beginning of the period, w. Similarly, one can apply the same\ndecomposition at the median at the end of the period, w(cid:48) . As is most commonly done in shift-\nshare analyses, we do not take a stance on which one of these decompositions is preferred.\nInstead, we decompose the sum of the both of them. That is, we use\n[F (w)−G(w)]+[F (w(cid:48))−G(w(cid:48))]\n= (cid:80) {φ(l)[F (w | l)−G(w | l)]+γ(l)[F (w(cid:48) | l)−G(w(cid:48) | l)]}\nl∈{S,C}\n+ (cid:80) φ(l){[F (w | l)−1/\n2\n]+[F (w(cid:48) | l)−1/\n2\n]} (5)\nl∈{P,U,N}\n− (cid:80) γ(l){[G(w | l)−1/\n2\n]+[G(w(cid:48) | l)−1/\n2\n]}\nl∈{P,U,N}\n− (cid:80) (γ(l)−φ(l)){[F (w(cid:48) | l)−1/\n2\n]+[G(w | l)−1/\n2\n]}.\nl∈{S,C}\nThough the terms in this equation are longer than in equation (3), the main intuition of what\nmakes up the intensive and extensive margins of the shift in the earnings distribution remains\nthe same. Using this method we are able to divide the change in the wage distribution function\nPage 12\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nin every period into the parts driven by the intensive and extensive margins of interest.\n4.2 Translating changes in CDFs into changes in the median\nThe shift-share-type decomposition of the shift in the distribution function introduced above\ndivides changes along the vertical axis in Figure 3 into parts due to the intensive and extensive\nmargins. However, our aim is not to decompose the shift in the earnings distribution function\nbut, instead, todecomposechangesinthemedian. Thesechangesinthemedianaremovements\nalong the horizontal axis in Figure 3. The final step then is to translate the change in the\nCDFs into changes in the median.\nThis translation can be done by applying the Mean Value Theorem. To apply the Mean\nValue Theorem, we first use the fact that w and w(cid:48) satisfy equation (1) to write\n[F (w)−G(w)]+[F (w(cid:48))−G(w(cid:48))] = [G(w(cid:48))−G(w)]+[F (w(cid:48))−F (w)]. (6)\nIf F (W) and G(W) are continuously differentiable with associated density functions f (W)\nand g(W) then, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists w∗ ∈ [w,w(cid:48)] such that\n[G(w(cid:48))−G(w)]+[F (w(cid:48))−F (w)] = q∗ ×(w(cid:48) −w), where q∗ = [f (w∗)+g(w∗)]. (7)\nTheconstant, q∗, thattranslateschangesinthedistributionfunctionintochangeinthemedian\nis the sum of the earnings density at the beginning and end of period evaluated in w∗. Since\nthese densities, by definition, reflect the fraction of the population, i.e. the y-axis variable in\nFigure 3, per unit of the wage, i.e. the x-axis variable in Figure 3, q∗ is a well-defined and\ninterpretable translation factor.\nAnother way of interpreting this translation factor is to consider a linearization of the\nchange in the distribution function. For illustrative purposes we consider this linearization\nPage 13\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nwith w as the expansion point. Such a log-linearization yields that\n[G(w(cid:48))−G(w)]+[F (w(cid:48))−F (w)] ≈ q ×(w(cid:48) −w), where q = [f (w)+g(w)]. (8)\nThe error of this first Taylor Approximation tends to be small when we evaluate relatively\nsmall changes in the median. If the changes in the median are small then\nq = f (w)+g(w) ≈ q∗ = f (w∗)+g(w∗) ≈ q(cid:48) ≡ f (w(cid:48))+g(w(cid:48)) (9)\nThus, fortherelativelysmallchangesinthemedianthatwestudyinthispaper, thetranslation\nfactor, q∗, can be interpreted as sum of the earnings densities at the beginning and end of the\nperiod evaluated at the median.\nThe most important insight from the application of the Mean Value Theorem in equation\n(7) is that, because q∗ is the same for all subgroups, the shares of the contributions of the\nintensive and extensive margins in the change in the distribution functions are the same as\nthose in the change in the median. We use this result for our decomposition. In particular, we\nuse equation (5) to divide the change in the distribution function into parts due to the different\nsubgroups from Table 2. We then use the translation constant to rescale these contributions\nsuch that they reflect changes in the median log wage rather than the earnings distribution\nfunction.\n5 Results\nIn the remainder of the paper we present the results of our decomposition. We begin by\nreviewing how the contributions of the intensive and extensive margins to aggregate median\nwage growth vary over time. We then discuss the key findings in the context of the standard\nassumptions embedded in many macro models. We conclude with a discussion of the average\ncontributions of the intensive and extensive margin and how these average contributions vary\nPage 14\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nover the business cycle.\n5.1 Time-series results\nFigure 4 plots the time series of the contributions of the intensive and extensive margins to\nmedian real wage growth. The first thing to note is that the intensive margin drives wage\ngrowth. The intensive margin effect is the dominant driver in all decades of our sample and\n’ ’\nwas especially important during the strong labor markets of the mid 1980 s and the late 1990 s.\nThe second thing to note is that the net effect of entry and exit–the extensive margin–is to\ndepress wage growth, as workers with higher wage levels are replaced by entrants into full-\ntime employment with wages below the median. During recessions, the extensive margin\nbecomes less negative, partially offsetting the procyclical slowdown in wage growth among the\ncontinuously full-time employed. Although the magnitude of the effect varies from recession\nto recession, it generally is not very large.\nThe exception to this general characterization is the recent Great Recession. During this\nperiod, the extensive margin contribution turned from negative to positive, something pre-\nviously unseen in the data. The decline in the drag from entry and exit owed to a surge of\nexits from full-time employment that largely occurred from below the median. This upskilling\npushed aggregate median wage growth above that of the continuously full-time employed. This\neffect was amplified by the near stoppage of entry into full-time employment during the period,\nsince entrants largely earn below median wages. Combined, these two extensive margin effects\nelevated aggregate median wage growth higher during the recession and early stages of the\nrecovery than it would have been otherwise.\nFigure 5 further decomposes the intensive and extensive margins into the more detailed\nlabor market states. Panel 5a of the figure shows the contributions of job stayers and job\nchangers to the total intensive margin effect. The results reveal that those who change jobs\nover the year contribute more to the intensive margin than those who remain in the same job.\nThis owes to the fact that the share full-time employed who change jobs, C , is larger than\nPage 15\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nthe share who stay in the same job S, while the earnings changes, or shifts, of C and S are\nsimilar.\nWhen labor markets are tight, job changers contribute more to wage growth; the C effect is\namplified by an increase in the share of job changers and an increase in the fraction who move\nfrom below to above MWE. In labor market downturns, job changing and the wage returns\nto changing fall such that job changers contribute roughly the same to wage growth as those\nwho stay in the same job. This means that the wage growth effect of C and S converge. In\ngeneral, during labor market expansions the strong performance in terms of wages of those\nwho are in S and C (displayed in Figure 4) is accentuated by an increase in their share. The\nresult is that the intensive margin contributes procyclically to real wage growth.\nTurning to the sub-groups details of movements in the extensive margin displayed in Panel\n5b, all of them contribute to the countercyclicality of the extensive margin on real wage\nfluctuations. Though small, even the replacement components for same job and job changers\nmove countercyclically.\nRelative to standard models, the contributions to fluctuations in the extensive margin are\nsurprising. The part-time/self employment margin contributes the most of any sub-group.\nThe magnitude of the part-time/self employment effect relative to other margins owes to the\nfact that a larger fraction of flows into and out of part-time/self-employment occur from below\nMWE. In business cycle downturns, more workers move from full-time to part-time boosting\nthe share of exits to this margin. At the same time there is little change in the earnings\ndifferences associated with these flows, with nearly all of it taking place below the median.\nFocusing in on the Great Recession highlights the impact of this part-time/self-employment\nmargin. The incidence of involuntary part-time employment increased sharply during the\nGreat Recession, causing the countercyclical contribution of the part-time and self-employed,\nP, to the extensive margin of real wage growth to increase substantially after 2008.\nAnother surprisingly large contributor to the fluctuations in the extensive margin is not-\nin-the-labor-force N. The N effect is always larger or as large as the unemployment margin.\nDuring labor market expansions, a larger share of individuals enter full-time employment from\nPage 16\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nnot-in-the labor force. Since the vast majority, around 80 percent, enter at below median\nearnings, the larger share pulls down wage growth. In recessions, this effect is tempered by\na reduction in the share of workers flowing into full-time employment from not-in-the-labor\nforce and an increase in workers flowing out of full-time employment to not-in-the-labor force.\nThis causes the N effect to be countercyclical. In the Great Recession this countercyclical\ncontribution was especially pronounced, even turning positive for a short period. At this\npoint, the N effect is again a drag on aggregate median wage growth, largely due to the inflow\nof new and returning workers who enter below the median. This effect is also being amplified\nby the secular retirement of the Baby Boom generation, who have higher wages than average\nworkers who flow from full-time to not-in-the-labor force.\n5.2 Why doesn’t unemployment matter more?\nUnemployment is the prevalent extensive adjustment margin considered in most macroeco-\nnomic models. However, the results in Figure 5b show that unemployment is less important\nthan other margins, both in terms of contributions to extensive margin fluctuations and in\nterms of the countercylicality of the extensive margin. Here we discuss the underlying move-\nments in shares and shifts that drive the contribution of U. We will refer to Table 3 which\nreports the average share and shifts components of unemployment, Figure 6a which shows the\ntime series of the share of full-time employed exiting to and entering from unemployment, and\nFigure 6b which shows the accompanying fraction of flows into and out of unemployment from\nbelow the median.\nConsider first the average effect of U on the extensive margin adjustment Table 3, row\n4. As with the other extensive margin sub-groups, entrants to full-time employment from\nunemployment are more likely to come from below the median than are exits from full-time\nemployment. However, the impact of this difference is attenuated by the fact that the flows\ninto and out of unemployment are relatively small when compared to the flows into and out\nof part-time/self-employment and not-in-the-labor-force. Moreover, on average exits to and\nPage 17\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nentry from unemployment are roughly equal, so that only relative wages of entrants and exiters\ncontribute to U.\nOf course, the average effect of U varies over the business cycle. During expansions, more\nworkers enter from unemployment than exit to unemployment, see Figure 6a. This serves\nto amplify the drag on aggregate wage growth coming from U. In recessions, the opposite\noccurs, more workers exit full-time employment, than enter full-time employment, from un-\nemployment. At the same time, as Figure 6b shows, the incidence of unemployment rises in\nthe wage distribution such that the fraction of exits coming from below the median falls. This\nmeans that the share effect (flows) and the shift effect (relative wages) are moving in opposite\ndirections. On net, this serves to temper the impact of unemployment on wages as the share\nand shift effects partially offset.\n5.3 Adding it all up\nOur decomposition allows us to express the time series of 12-month log change of real MWE,\n∆ln(w ), as the sum of the seven components shown in Figure 5. We index these components\nt\nby c , where i = 1,...,7 , such that we can write\ni,t\n(cid:88)\n∆ln(w ) = c . (10)\nt i,t\ni\nThe fact that the individual components add up to the aggregate time series that we study\nallows us to assess how important they are, on average, over our sample period 1980-2015Q1,\nfor the variance and cyclicality of real MWE growth.\nTo measure the contribution of each of the components to the variance of real wage growth,\nwe apply a simple variance decomposition. The additive relationship in equation (10) allows us\nto write the variance of aggregate real wage growth as the sum of the covariances between each\nof the individual components, c , and the aggregate, ∆ln(w ). Column I of Table 4 lists the\ni,t t\nshare of each of the components in the variance of real wage growth. Rows 3 through 7 of the\ntable show that each of the composition effects only account for a small share of the variance\nPage 18\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nof real wage fluctuations. In total, the extensive margin accounts for only 10.4 percent of the\nvariance of real MWE growth. The other 89.6 percent is due to the intensive margin. In fact,\nwage changes of job changers, C, alone account for half of the fluctuations in real wage growth\nover the past three decades (row 2, column I).\nAs for the cyclicality of real wage growth, we measure it by the slope coefficient, β, from a\nsimpleregressionofrealwagegrowthontheleveloftheunemploymentrate, u . Bothrealwage\nt\ngrowth as well as the unemployment rate are measured in percentage points in this regression.\nThe particular regression equation is\n∆ln(w ) = α+βu +ε (11)\nt t t\nThe coefficient is reported in the top row of column II of Table 4 and equals -0.124 and is not\nsignificant. This indicates that over the past 35 years real wage growth has only been mildly\nprocyclical. Real wage growth has tended to be high when the unemployment rate was low\nand vice versa. However, this relationship has not been particularly strong, leading to the\nstatistical insignificance of the coefficient.\nBy construction, the cyclicality coefficient, β , is the sum of seven component-specific\ncyclicality coefficients, β for i = 1,...,7, obtained using regressions of the form\ni\n∆ln(w ) = α +β u +ε , where i = 1,...,7. (12)\nt i i t i,t\nThese component-specific coefficients are listed in rows 1 through 7 of column II of Table 4.\nAs can be seen from the table, on the one hand, each of the components of the extensive\nmargin, except that for unemployment, is significantly countercyclical. On the other, each of\nthe components of the intensive are significantly procyclical. Though the intensive margin is\nmore important than the extensive margin for the cyclicality of real wage growth, half of its\nmovements over the business cycle are undone by entry into and exits out of full-time employ-\nment. This is why the aggregate cyclicality coefficient is negative, just like that associated\nPage 19\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nwith the wage growth effect, but statistically insignifant.\n6 Conclusion\nUsing data from the Current Population Survey from 1980 through 2015 we examined what\ndrives the variance and cyclicality of the growth rate of real wages over time. To do this\nwe employed a novel decomposition technique that allows us to divide changes in percentiles\nof aggregate usual weekly earnings growth into the part associated with the wage growth of\ncontinuously full-time employed workers–the intensive margin–and the part associated with\nrelative wage levels of individuals entering and exiting full-time employment–the extensive\nmargin.\nThe relative importance of these two margins varies significantly over the business cycle.\nWhen labor markets are tight, continuously full-time employed workers drive wage growth.\nDuring labor market downturns, the procyclicality of the intensive margin is largely offset\nby net exits out of full-time employment among workers with lower earnings. This leads\naggregate real wages to be largely acyclical. Most of the extensive margin effect works through\nthe part-time employment margin. Notably, the unemployment margin accounts for little of\nthe variation or cyclicality of median weekly earnings growth.\nPage 20\n\nReal Wage Adjustment Daly and Hobijn\nReferences\nAbraham, Katharine G., & Haltiwanger, John C. 1995.

    "text": "What Will Your Letter Say?\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUtah Valley University Commencement\nOrem, Utah\nMay 6, 2022\nThank you for that kind introduction. I’m so happy to be here and honored to be part of your\ncelebration.\nSpeaking of celebrating, before I get started, I would like all the graduates—and only the graduates—to\ngive yourselves a big round of applause. This is a special day, and I want each of you to take in its\nmeaningfulness. For everyone else—family, friends, professors, university leaders—these graduates are\nour future and I stand with you in looking forward to what they will do.\nNow the last time I sat where you are today was 1994, almost 30 years ago. I was graduating with my\nPh.D. from Syracuse University and looking forward to my new life as an economist. So when I got my\nfirst job in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco I was excited. And in\n2018, when I got the job I have now as president and CEO I was ecstatic.\nWhen the job as President became available, I knew I was qualified. But I also knew the competition\nwould be tough. After all, the Fed is a storied institution. Many of the world’s great economists have\npassed through its doors. Most of my colleagues arrived from schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and\nStanford—pedigrees that could be intimidating. And now I was competing against hundreds of\napplicants inside and outside of the Fed with portfolios that I thought could be better than mine.\nAnd so, I did what many of us do to stand out: I wrote a beautiful cover letter. It was truly a work of art.\nIt expounded on history, the state of the nation, and how my long list of credentials, accumulated over\nmy career, were meant for an opportunity like this. One week later when I finished, I proudly showed it\nto an acquaintance who had experience in hiring. And she said, “Wow Mary, this letter is amazing.” And\nthen she said, “…but anyone could have written it.”\nMy heart sank, but I also knew she was right. I had written the letter I thought the hiring committee\nwanted to read. And I was presenting the person I thought I needed to be to get the job. A person, in\nmy mind, who bore only an abstract resemblance to the real me.\nLet me tell you about the real me: I grew up in Ballwin, Missouri. And when I was fifteen, I dropped out\nof high school. My family was struggling and I thought my time would be better spent earning an income.\nSo, I cobbled together a schedule of odd jobs. I worked at a donut shop and at Target, hoping to\n1\n\neventually become a bus driver—stable employment with good income and benefits. By an unexpected\ntwist of fate, I met someone who encouraged me to get a GED. Later, I became the first in my family to\nattend and graduate from college.\nThat was my story, and it was—to put it mildly—very different from most of my colleagues and anyone\nelse who had ever held the position I was trying to get. So I left it out of the letter and focused on\ncredentials and accomplishments and things that made me similar rather than different.\nAnd it wasn’t the first time I had done this. In my early years at the Fed, I felt the need to fit into a\ncertain mold. So, I went shopping. I bought pearls and skirt suits, even a scoop neck sweater. Now\nanyone who knows me, or has even seen me, knows that I’m most comfortable in slacks and a collared\nshirt, my outfit of choice most days. But back then, I dressed as the person I thought people wanted to\nsee. I even tried to style my hair a certain way. I worked to become economist Mary, rather than just\nMary.\nBut that mindset spread and began to permeate everything. In conversations with colleagues, I was\ncareful not to veer into topics that were too personal. I tried not to reveal too much of my background.\nI kept things focused on work, job, and contribution, all with the view that people can’t judge what they\ndon’t know.\nPretending, as it turns out, is exhausting. It is also hugely limiting. I was sitting on a mountain of\nexperience that gave me unique insight into how the economy functions. As a kid from Missouri, I\nwitnessed firsthand how people get left behind—fall through the cracks—and the lasting impact,\ngenerations out, that this can have on families. I saw the toll that poverty takes and the stress people\nfeel when they don’t have opportunities. But I never talked about it. And so on the outside I looked like\neveryone else. I had become Mary the economist with a job as a researcher, instead of Mary from\nMissouri with a GED.\nThe irony of course, is that no one actually asked me to play a role. I had done this to myself. And when I\nstarted to understand that, I started to change. Gradually. Little by little, I shed the pearls and the skirts.\nI let my hair be wild. I even agreed to a profile story in a major news outlet that revealed personal\ndetails about my past.\nGetting the space to be myself was a remarkable gift. I felt newly at ease, and that ease translated into\nopportunities. By being open and me—all of me—I attracted people with diverse ideas. I connected my\nexperiences with my research and found capacity that I didn’t know I had. I became so much better at\nmy job. But mostly I found fortitude and confidence from aligning my inner with my outer self. Mary\nwith a GED who also had a Ph.D. And perhaps unsurprisingly, my career took off.\nWhich brings me back to 2018, 20 years after I stopped wearing pearls, applying for the top job at the\nbank where I had built my career, and here I was back to my old habits. Once again, playing a role. Back\nto being the Mary that I thought people wanted.\nSo, I re-wrote the letter. But this time, I leaned into my story. I talked about my life growing up in\nBallwin, MO, the eldest of four siblings, in a family with challenges, and how those experiences helped\nme understand the responsibility of institutions and the honor of serving others. I also talked about\ndignity and the importance of the economy in creating and sustaining opportunities for everyone. I\n2\n\nwrote it in two hours. And no one else could have written it. And when I hit send, I felt absolutely\nterrified.\nOf course, we all know how the story ends. Six months and many interviews later, I got the job—not in\nspite of where I came from, but, in part, because of it. And I relearned what I’d learned many times\nbefore. Difference, my difference, is a virtue, not a weakness.\nAnd this brings me to the time in my speech where I very much want to impart some lasting wisdom. A\nphilosophy for how to live your life and accomplish your dreams. It’s simple: “Be yourself.” “Stay true to\nwho you are.” This is good advice. You should do those things. But the truth is, you probably already\nknow that.\nWhat you might not know—what I have learned over the course of my 30-year career—is that being\nyourself isn’t a switch that you can simply turn on. It’s a journey of discovery, and it’s one that you will\nhave to take over and over again.\nThroughout your lives and career, you will likely lose yourself here and there. You will drift away from\nthe person you know you are. You may feel out of sorts or like you don’t fit in. And you may want to\nhide. And in those times, you very well might do as I have done, and take refuge behind a mask of your\nown making. And that’s okay. It’s part of being human.\nThere is safety in conformity. Being yourself, especially when yourself is different from others, can feel\nrisky. It leaves all of us feeling vulnerable and exposed. But as you embark on your careers—as you\nstretch for new things and find yourself in unfamiliar places—find your way back, return to the core of\nwho you are. That is the place from which your greatness will grow.\nYou are the sum total of every experience, every triumph, and every hardship that you have endured.\nAnd this singular equation is your superpower. It is the secret combination that unlocks your innate\ntalents and sets you apart from every other person you meet. It is what makes your letter uniquely\nyours.\nAnd so, class of 2022: what will your letter say?\nMy wish for you is that it will say the things you are most afraid to reveal. That these revelations will\nupend assumptions about who belongs where. That your bravery will fly in the face of the worry and\nfear and all of the other emotions that arise when we strive for something more. And most of all, I hope\nyour letter will be unmistakably, unapologetically, you.\nAnd to that you, I say: Congratulations on this momentous achievement of your graduation. I cannot\nwait to see what amazing things you will do.\n3",

    "text": "This Time Is Different…Because We Are\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nLos Angeles World Affairs Council & Town Hall\nLos Angeles, CA\nFebruary 23, 2022\n12:30 PM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIt’s hard to believe it’s been almost two years since COVID-19 hit our shores. And while it’s not\nfully behind us, we’ve come a long way, especially in the economy. Growth is up.\nUnemployment is down. And people are getting back to their lives.\nBut as anyone who has shopped, bought gas, or paid rent lately knows, inflation is high—higher\nthan it has been in nearly four decades.\nFor some, this is a sign that price stability is at risk. That, absent aggressive action by the Fed,\nthe economy will be propelled into a 1970s-style “Great Inflation.”\nLike many of you, I lived through that time. I remember my parents’ daily complaints about\nrising prices and rising bills, and the hours-long waits at gas stations in the hot Missouri sun,\nstuck to the vinyl seats of our station wagon.\nHigh and rising inflation made life harder. And there was no end in sight.\nBut the picture today looks different. And so does the Federal Reserve. We have evolved as an\ninstitution, and our understanding and tools have evolved as well. I’ll spend my time today\ntalking about how this evolution makes us better prepared to meet our dual mandate goals of\nprice stability and full employment, even in these challenging times.\n1\n\nFirst, I want to remind you that the views I will express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nThen…\nBefore I talk about what’s different this time, let me talk about what exactly happened during\nthe “Great Inflation.” What was it like?\nFrom about the mid-1960s through the early 1980s, American households faced an unrelenting\nrise in prices. The worst of it came during the 1970s, when the cost of living for the average\nfamily more than doubled.1 The stress in our nation was palpable. Businesses and families lost\nconfidence, and many struggled simply to make ends meet.2\nPeople wondered how it had happened.\nThe answer, of course, is complicated. But I will focus on a few factors that I think are\nparticularly relevant for today’s discussion.3\nThe first has to do with fundamental economic changes and our inability back then to measure\nand understand them in real time.\nFor example, after decades of rapid postwar GDP growth, led by booming technological\nadvancements and rising labor productivity, U.S. productivity growth had started to slow. This\nmeant that the capacity of the economy to expand without spurring inflation was much more\nlimited than it had been in previous decades.4\nAt the same time, the labor market was changing. Young baby boomers were joining the labor\nforce in large numbers and altering the age composition and the dynamics of the workforce. In\nparticular, they were taking longer to find jobs and churning through more opportunities as they\nfound their preferred path.

Without the data, tools,\nand focus on real-time monitoring, they—and macro forecasters more broadly—expected the\neconomy to behave as it had before, for inflation to fall as the economy and labor force grew.6\nThese views, in part, kept the Fed from acting forcefully to offset rising inflation.7\nBut the story doesn’t end there. The Fed’s policy misses were amplified and perpetuated by\ninstitutional factors and by its own communication strategy.\nLet’s start with institutional factors. At the time, there was a very tight link between price and\nwage inflation. Many employment contracts included automatic cost-of-living adjustments, or\nCOLAs, which meant that when prices went up, wages soon followed.8 Firms then passed on\nthese increased labor costs to prices, and so it went, again and again, in a self-perpetuating\nupward inflation spiral.\nWhen two oil price shocks created even higher inflation, prices and wages grew in near\nlockstep. And here is where the Fed’s own communication practices exacerbated things.\nThe Fed and many central banks at the time held the view that transparency and\ncommunication were more costly than beneficial. Central bankers actively avoided sharing\ninformation, believing that such communications might constrain their ability to nimbly adjust\npolicy, or even dilute its impact.9,10\nBecause of this, the Fed operated largely behind closed doors. The public became aware of Fed\npolicy actions by watching how markets reacted following Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) meetings. And the main source of information that market participants, households,\nand businesses had about the Fed’s commitment to price stability was what they could glean\nfrom incoming inflation data.\nFigure 1\n5 Crump et al. (2019).\n6 DeLong (1997) and Taylor (1997).\n7 Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000), Orphanides (2003), Primiceri (2006), and Romer and Romer (2013). Political\npressures also played a role in the Fed’s decision to keep policy accommodative. See Weise (2012).\n8 Ragan and Bratsberg (2000).\n9 Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) and Bernanke (2007a). Bernanke noted, “Since 1975, the Federal Reserve has\npresented testimony twice each year to the Congress on the conduct of monetary policy.” So there was at least\nsome communication to the public about policy back then. Before the 1990s, however, inflation targets, FOMC\nstatements, and other communications were not publicly shared as they are now.\n10 In the June 2003 FOMC meeting, then-Chair Alan Greenspan advised participants to be “very vague” in response\nto questions about the conduct of monetary policy. See Federal Open Market Committee (2003).\n3\n\nThe result was predictable.\nAnd you can see it in this figure. The green and blue lines show two measures of actual inflation\nand the red line shows inflation expectations.\nClearly, the more inflation rose, the more consumers and businesses expected it to rise. As\ninflation moved up, so did inflation expectations.11 These expectations of future inflation were\nthen built into wage and price contracts.\nBefore long, inflation dynamics and future inflation were deeply intertwined with inflation\npsychology. And with the Fed offering little guidance or reassurance that it would do something\nabout it, the situation snowballed.\nIt wasn’t until the Fed implemented a series of steep interest rate hikes that inflation finally\nstarted to recede.\n…Now\nNow inflation is high again and many are concerned that we could soon be facing another long\nand painful period, followed by another long and painful correction.\n11 Cogley and Sbordone (2008) and Lansing (2009).\n4\n\nBut that’s not what I see. Let me explain.\nYou’ve heard many, including me, talk about how inflation itself is different this time. It’s been\npushed up by pandemic-related imbalances between policy-supported demand, which has\nremained robust, and COVID-disrupted supply, which has been slow to recover. Both of these\nfactors should recede as the pandemic weakens its grip.\nAnd the economy is also different. There are weaker links between wage and price inflation,\ngreater global price competition, and a number of longer-term structural factors, including an\naging population, that will continue to exert downward pressure on growth and inflation once\nthe pandemic is behind us.12\nBut these are not the differences that matter most. The main reason I’m confident we are not\nheading for another 1970s-style Great Inflation is that the Federal Reserve is different. And I’m\nnot referring to the people of the Fed, who clearly have changed, but to the practices and\nbeliefs, which have changed even more.\nOne major evolution that separates today’s Federal Reserve from the Fed of 50 years ago is a\ndeep understanding that inflation expectations influence future inflation.13 If people expect\ninflation to persist, then it does.14\nThis understanding led the Fed, and economists more broadly, to a critical insight: in order to\nmanage actual inflation, policymakers also have to manage inflation psychology.15 The Fed has\nto enlist the help of households, businesses, and market participants in the job of fighting\ninflation, by communicating with them about its commitment to price stability and its plan to\nachieve it.\nActing on this insight required a radical transformation. The Fed had to break open its “black\nbox” of decision-making and embrace transparency.\nFigure 2\n12 Eichengreen (2015), Gordon (2015), and Laubach and Williams (2016).\n13 Orphanides and Williams (2005) and Bernanke (2007b).\n14 Gürkaynak, Levin, and Swanson (2010).\n15 In October 1979, at the height of the Great Inflation, Fed Chair Paul Volcker (1979) famously observed, “Inflation\nfeeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to\nbreak the grip of inflationary expectations.”\n5\n\nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nTo understand the magnitude of this transformation, you have to recall that, for most of its\nhistory, the Fed was uncommunicative.\nThe first step in its communications “revolution” came in 1994, when the Fed began releasing\npost-FOMC meeting statements (see Figure 2).16 In the mid-2000s, the Fed went further,\npublishing the Summary of Economic Projections to provide the public with information about\nthe expected path of the economy and interest rates. In 2012, the Fed announced its first\nexplicit inflation target, 2 percent.17 And in 2020, we introduced a new monetary policy\nframework, which outlined principles for managing our inflation and employment mandates in a\nvariety of economic conditions.18\nAs the figure illustrates, the Fed went from being mostly silent to explicitly and intentionally\ntransparent.\nThe effects of these efforts can be seen in the data.\nWith greater transparency came more stable inflation expectations, which, since the late 1990s,\nhave remained well anchored around 2 percent through spikes or drops in the inflation rate.19\n16 Revolution was the term then-Vice Chair Janet Yellen used to describe the evolution of communication at the\nFederal Reserve. See Yellen (2012).\n17 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20120125c.htm\n18 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm\n19 Williams (2006), Bernanke (2007b), and Jørgensen and Lansing (2022).\n6\n\nEven today, with inflation at a 40-year high, long-run inflation expectations of businesses have\nremained quite stable.20 And financial market expectations have also been well anchored, as\nevidenced by long-term interest rates staying low despite the current inflation shock.\nThis tells us that businesses and markets are listening. They’re hearing the Fed’s\ncommunications and believe that we will act on our commitments.\nIn practice, greater transparency, better communication, and the era of well-anchored inflation\nexpectations built Fed credibility. And this credibility provides an important insurance. It makes\nthe economy more resilient and less vulnerable to painful periods like the one we experienced\nin the 1970s.21 And it gives all economic agents, not just the Fed, a role to play in helping the\neconomy smooth through inflation and other shocks, making it more resilient to whatever\nchanges are on the horizon.\nMost importantly, greater transparency and a strong commitment to achieving our goals\nassures Americans that periods of high inflation or unemployment will not last forever; that\nthere is an end in sight.\nFocused and Aware\nBut transparency is not a destination, it’s a practice. And it requires ongoing communication if\nwe are to keep the credibility that we so value.\nIn that spirit, let me tell you about how I see the economy today and the policy adjustments\nthat will be needed to move us to a sustainable path.\nLet’s start with the economy. By almost any measure, it is doing well. GDP growth, consumer\nspending, and business investment are all up, and the labor market continues to post solid job\ngains, low unemployment, and strong wage growth. Importantly, labor market gains have been\nbroad based, occurring for a wide range of groups, including those who are traditionally\ndisadvantaged—African Americans, Hispanics, and people with less than a college education.\nOf course, as everyone knows, inflation is too high, and inflation pressures have begun to\nspread outside of sectors most directly affected by pandemic-related disruptions.22 Most\n20 See Survey of Professional Forecasters. https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-\nresearch/survey-of-professional-forecasters\n21 Indeed, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke (2003) observed that during the Great Inflation, “the Fed’s loss of\ncredibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.”\n22 Lansing, Oliveira, and Shapiro (2022).\n7\n\nstrikingly, average Americans, like my parents five decades ago, are worrying about rising prices\nand rising bills.\nThis means it is time to move away from the extraordinary support that the Fed has been\nproviding during the pandemic and bring monetary policy in line with the challenges of today.\nAbsent any significant negative surprises, I see our next meeting, in March, as the appropriate\ntime to begin this adjustment.\nThe timing and magnitude of future funds rate and balance sheet adjustments will depend on\nhow the economy and the data evolve. And this will depend on how well we transition from\npandemic to endemic; how much and how quickly supply chains recover; how rapidly workers\nsidelined by health, family care, or other COVID-related barriers return to the labor force; and\nhow quickly the fiscal boost that aided spending in 2020 and 2021 fades. We will closely watch\nall of these developments and let the data determine the appropriate path of policy.\nAs we adjust policy and move into a post-pandemic world, we will also have to keep in mind\nthat many of the challenges that existed pre-pandemic will likely still be with us. Notable for\npolicy are slower global growth, less monetary and fiscal policy space, and the associated\ndownward pressure on inflation.23\nAgainst this backdrop, the next few years will require focused awareness; focus on bringing\ninflation back down to levels consistent with price stability and delivering a labor market that\nworks for everyone; and awareness, of the uncertainty that lies ahead and the challenges that\nare surely before us.\nThat for me is the main lesson of the Great Inflation. It’s not really about the Fed. It’s not even\nreally about economics.\nIt’s about humility.\nIt’s about knowing that ours is an economy in transition. And that none of us knows for sure\nwhat the new future holds.\n23 Fernald and Li (2019) and Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013). These and other developments help explain the steady\ndecline in the neutral policy rate, which over the past 30 years has been more prone to reaching the zero lower\nbound. See Mertens and Williams (2021).\n8\n\nWe need to move forward with confidence—in our policy, in our tools, and in the credibility the\nFed has built. But we also have to remember that evolution isn’t static. And to meet the needs\nof a constantly changing economy, we have to be constantly changing.\nToday’s Federal Reserve looks different than it did 50 years ago. And I expect that it will look\ndifferent again in 50 more.\nAnd that will be a good thing. It will mean the evolution continued. And that next time will also\nbe different.\nThank you.\n9\n\nReferences\nBasu, Susanto, and John G.

    "text": "Employment Declines Among People with Disabilities:\nPopulation Movements, Isolated Experience, or Broad Policy Concern?\nMary C. Daly\nEconomic Research Department\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nAndrew J. Houtenville\nSchool of Industrial and Labor Relations\nCornell University\nThis research is funded in part by the United States Department of Education, National Institute on\nDisability and Rehabilitation Research, cooperative agreement No. 13313980038. It does not necessarily\nreflect the view of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research or the Federal\nResearch Bank of San Francisco.\n\nI. Introduction\nChapter 2 showed that the decline in employment rates among working age men and\nwomen with disabilities over the 1990s was not an artifact of measurement choices or research\ndesign, but robust across definitions of disability and data sources. Although this overall trend is\ndisturbing, a greater understanding of what underlies it is needed before an appropriate policy\nresponse can be crafted. Specifically, policymakers need to know whether the recent\nemployment decline was broad-based or concentrated among a few subgroups of the population,\nwhether it reflects changes in the characteristics of the population with disabilities or changes in\ntheir behavior and/or labor market opportunities, and finally, whether it was associated with\nexogenous changes in health or changes in environmental factors.\nWith these questions in mind, we look beyond the overall decline in employment among\npeople with disabilities to track the importance of three factors on the observed changes: 1)\ntrends among key sub-groups, especially those with employment-risk factors other than\ndisability; 2) population shifts towards subgroups with lower than average employment rates; 3)\nchanges in self-reported health status. Our analysis is based on the same cross-sectional data\nfrom the Current Population Survey (CPS) discussed in Chapter 2. Throughout the analyses we\nrely on descriptive analyses and more formal decomposition methods to evaluate the contribution\nof each of these three factors to the average employment decline described in Chapter 2.\nOur results suggest that the decline in employment among those with disabilities was\nbroad-based, present in a wide range of demographic and educational sub-groups. In terms of\npopulation shifts, we find no evidence that compositional changes in the population with\ndisabilities during the 1990s account for the average employment decline during the period. In\ncontrast, we find that compositional changes were important to the increase in employment\n-1-\n\namong those with disabilities during the 1980s. Finally, we show that self-reported health\namong those with disabilities remained relatively stable in the latter half of the 1990s, making\nchanges in health status an unlikely cause of declining employment rates.\nII. Data and Measurement\nWe base our analyses on data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS)\ndiscussed in Chapter 2. We focus on working-age men and women, aged 25 to 61, who self\nreport a work limitation-based disability (defined below).1 To avoid attributing cyclical\nfluctuations to secular trends we make comparisons of employment rates at similar points in the\nbusiness cycle (see Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville, and Nargis 2002 for a complete description\nof the relationship between employment rates and business cycles for those with disabilities.)\nDefining Disability. We use the same conceptualization of disability discussed in\nChapter 2.2 We operationalize this concept using the work limitation-based definition of\ndisability in the Current Population Survey (CPS).3 While not an ideal measure of disability, the\nwork limitation-based question in the CPS has been shown to provide a consistent measure of\ntrends in employment status of people with disabilities.4 And, importantly for our purpose, the\n1Using this age range avoids confusing reductions in work or economic well-being associated with\ndisabilities with reductions or declines associated with retirement at older ages and initial transitions into the labor\nforce related to job shopping at younger ages.\n2 Nagi (1991) and the recently developed International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health\n(ICF) provide similar frameworks to conceptualize the definition of disability within the context of social roles and\nenvironmental influences.\n3The CPS is a monthly survey of the non-institutionalized population of the United States. Information is\ncollected on labor force characteristics (e.g., employment, earnings, hours of work). In March of each year, the CPS\nbasic monthly survey is supplemented with the Annual Demographic Survey. This supplement focuses on sources\nof income, government program participation, annual employment, insurance, and a variety of demographic\ncharacteristics. In 1981, the March Supplement was expanded to include several questions about disability and\nincome derived from disability programs and insurance. The CPS and the Annual Demographic Survey are used\nextensively by government agencies, academic researchers, policy makers, journalists, and the general public to\nevaluate government programs, economic well-being and behavior of individuals, families and households.\n4See Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville and Nargis (2002).\n-2-\n\nsample size in the CPS is large enough to allow us to focus on the employment of key subgroups\nwithin the working-age population with disabilities and to do so over a long period of time. The\nCPS question we use is (cid:1)[d]oes anyone in this household have a health problem or disability\nwhich prevents them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do? [If\nso,] who is that? (Anyone else?)(cid:1)\nDefining Employment. For consistency, we define employment as in Chapter 2. People\nare classified as employed if they work 52 hours or more in the previous year.5 The use of last\nyear(cid:1)s employment introduces minor time inconsistencies, since our disability and population\ncharacteristics data are for the (cid:1)current(cid:1) or survey year. To reduce confusion, we use the\nemployment year to anchor our analysis. We choose the employment year as our point of\nreference, rather than the survey year, to better control for business cycle effects.\nDefining Key Sub-Populations. Throughout the analyses we divide the population with\ndisabilities into broad, and frequently overlapping, sub-groups based on gender, age, race, and\neducation. Specifically, we compare employment and disability patterns for men, women,\nwhites, non-whites, individuals aged 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-61, and individuals with less\nthan high school, high school degree, some college, and college or more. Small sample sizes\nprohibit us from making more detailed comparisons.\nIndividuals are classified into as many of these groups as they fit based on responses to\nsurvey questions. The CPS questions regarding age and gender are straightforward. Race\ninformation comes from the question, (cid:1)[w]hat is [person(cid:1)s] race? probe: [Is person] White,\nBlack, American Indian, Aleut or Eskimo, Asian or Pacific Islander or something else?(cid:1) We\ndivide individuals into whites and all others. Education information is derived from two\n5 Although the CPS obtains information on current employment, the question changed notably in 1994,\nlimiting its usefulness for time series analysis.\n-3-\n\ndifferent questions. Prior to 1992, the CPS asked, “[w]hat is the highest grade or year of regular\nschool [person] has ever attended? Did [person] complete that grade (year)?(cid:1) questions that\nhave changed once during this period. In 1992, the CPS switched from a “grade/years\ncompleted(cid:1) characterization of education to a (cid:1)credential(cid:1) characterization of education and\nasked, “[w]hat is the highest level of school [person] has completed or the highest degree\n[person] has received?(cid:1) To provide continuity, we converted these credentials to years complete\nusing standard assumptions.\nMeasuring Health. In 1996, the CPS survey began to include questions regarding self-\nreported health status. The health question we use is, (cid:1)Would you say (name's/your) health in\ngeneral is excellent, very good, good, fair, poor?(cid:1) Although the short history of this question\nlimits its usefulness in our analyses, we incorporate it as a first indication of the role of health\nplays in the employment decline among those with disabilities.\nIII. Shifts in Population Composition\nLike the U.S. population as a whole, employment rates for those with disabilities vary\ngreatly across key subgroups. Exhibit 1 shows employment rates in 2000 of those reporting\nwork limitations, by gender, age, race, and educational attainment. As the figure indicates,\namong working-age adults reporting work limitations, employment rates were lower for women\nthan for men, for older compared to younger workers, and for non-whites relative to whites.\nEmployment rates also were strongly correlated with educational attainment, coming in more\nthan twice as high for someone with a college education or more as for someone with less than a\nhigh school education.\nAlthough this pattern is not surprising and follows general population trends fairly\nclosely, the differential pattern of employment across groups opens the possibility that changes\n-4-\n\nin population shares among those reporting work limitation may be driving the overall decline in\nthe employment of working age people with disabilities documented in Chapter 2. This concern\nis especially salient when one recognizes that these same correlates also are good predictors of\ndisability, as shown in Exhibit 2.6 For example, the prevalence of disability among those with\nless than a high school education is six times that of someone with a college education or more.\nExhibits 3A through 3D provide a first look at the role that population shifts may have\nplayed in the decline in employment among those with disabilities.7 The figures display changes\nin population characteristics (gender, age, race, and education) among those with disabilities\nfrom 1980 through 2000. As the figures indicate, there have been some movements in the\ncomposition of the population with disabilities over the past two decades. Like in the U.S.\npopulation more generally, the largest movements have occurred in the age (Exhibit 3B) and\neducation (Exhibit 3D) distributions. Shifts in the gender (Exhibit 3A) and race (Exhibit 3B)\ncomposition have been substantially smaller. For example, between 1989 and 2000, the share of\nwomen in the population with disabilities rose from 48.3 percent to 52.2 percent, an increase of\n3.9 percentage points. In the prior decade, the share of women fell slightly from 50.1 percent in\n1980 to 48.3 percent in 1989. Shifts in the racial composition of those with disabilities also have\nbeen small. Between 1989 the share of non-whites increased just slightly from 19.7 percent in\n1980 to 19.8 percent in 1989. Movements in the 1990s also were modest, with the share of non-\nwhites rising to 22.3 percent by 2000, an increase of 2.5 percentage points from 1989.\nShifts in the distribution of age and education among those with disabilities were far\nmore dramatic. For example, the share of the population with disabilities aged 25-34 fell from\n6\nAppendix Exhibit 1 provides disability prevalence rates by population sub-group from 1980 through\n2000. The data show that the patterns described in Exhibit 2 persist across time.\n-5-\n\n20.3 percent in 1989 to 12.8 percent in 2000, a drop of 7.5 percentage points. In the previous\ndecade, the share of 25-34 year olds rose slightly. The share of 55-61 year olds also declined,\nalthough the drop was substantially smaller, 2.2 percentage points between 1989 and 2000. The\ndecline of the share of 55-61 year olds represented a continuation of a trend begun in the 1980s.\nThe population share of the remaining two age groups—35-44 and 45-54—increased during the\n1990s. As a result of these shifts, in 2000, 61.5 percent of the population with disabilities was\nbetween the ages of 35 and 54, a 10 percentage point increase from 1989.\nIn considering whether shifts in the age distribution of those with disabilities can explain\nthe relative decline in employment (compared to those without disabilities and over time) two\nthings come out of these figures. First, although large, movements in the distribution of age\namong those with disabilities largely mirror shifts in the rest of the population.8 In 2000, for\nexample, 59.9 percent of the working-age population without disabilities was between the ages\nof 35-54; in 1989 51.9 percent of those without disabilities fell within this age range. Thus,\ndifferential shifts in age are unlikely to account for the divergent employment experiences of\nthose with disabilities during the 1990s. The effect of shifts in the population with disabilities on\nthe time series of employment trends for those with disabilities are more complicated. The\ndecline in the share of younger adults (25-34) with disabilities should pull down the overall\nemployment rate while the decline in the share of older adults (55-61) should boost it. More\nformal decomposition analyses, presented later in this paper, is necessary to quantify the net\nresults of these joint movements.\n7The data for Exhibits 3A through 3D are provided in Appendix Exhibit 2. Data for those without\ndisabilities are provided in Appendix Exhibit 3.\n8Although volatile from year to year, the prevalence of disability by age group was largely the same in\n2000 as in 1980. The largest changes were for individuals 35-44 and 45-54, where disability prevalence increased in\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s.\n-6-\n\nTurning to education, the link between population shifts and employment patterns is\nclearer. As in the population as a whole, educational attainment among those with disabilities\nsurged over the past two decades. Between 1989 and 2000, the share of the population with\ndisabilities and less than a high school education fell more than 10 percentage points, about the\nsame decline recorded during the 1980s. The share of high school educated also fell, although\nby a much smaller amount. By 2000, 35.5 percent of the population with disabilities had at least\nsome college; in 1989 only 22.8 percent had some college and in 1980 about 18 percent had any\ncollege.9 Again, these shifts in educational attainment mirror those for the population without\ndisabilities. More importantly, given the relationship between education and employment\ndocumented in Exhibit 1, the movement towards higher educational attainment should have\nboosted, rather than pushed down, the population employment rate for those with disabilities.\nThis will be formally tested in section V.\nIV. Isolated Occurrence or Widespread Decline?\nSection III showed that shifts in population shares towards those with lower than average\nemployment rates is not likely to explain much of the overall decline in employment among\nworking age adults with disabilities observed during the 1990s. Nevertheless this still leaves the\npossibility that one or more subgroups is driving the overall decline and that this decline is not\nrepresentative of the experience of all, or even most, subgroups of the population with\ndisabilities. Given the differential employment experience in the cross-section shown in Exhibit\n1, this type of outcome certainly is plausible.\n9\nDecomposing the shift into that associated with general population trends versus that associated with\nchanges in prevalence indicates that for those with H.S. or some college, the prevalence of work limitation rose\nsubstantially in the 1990s (especially for the H.S. group). This change in prevalence of self-reported work limitation\nis consistent with the story of Autor and Duggan (forthcoming) that states that replacement rates on earnings for\nthose with relatively low levels of education (i.e., high school only) have risen, inducing more to apply for benefits.\n-7-\n\nTo examine whether the recent decline in employment rates, as well as the increases\nduring the 1980s, were broad-based across the population with disabilities, Exhibits 4 through\n4D show employment rate trends (1980 through 2000) by gender, age group, race, and\neducational attainment.10 Similar to Chapter 2, Exhibit 4A points to a substantial decline in\nemployment among men and women with disabilities during the 1990s. Between 1989 and\n2000, the employment rate of men with disabilities declined over 10 percentage points, from\n44.0 percent in 1989 to 33.1 percent in 2000. The decline for women was about half as large,\nfive percentage points, but still sizeable. These declines contrast sharply with the patterns\nobserved for those without disabilities as well as the patterns observed in the previous decade.\nOver the same period, the employment rate of men without disabilities fell one percentage point,\nwhile the employment rate for women without disabilities rose by 4.3 percentage points.11\nBetween 1980 and 1989, employment rates for men and women with disabilities rose 1.4 and 9\npercentage points, respectively.\nExhibit 4B displays employment rates for those with disabilities by four major age\ngroups. As the figure indicates no age group was immune to the 1990s trend towards lower\nemployment rates. Younger men and women with disabilities aged 25-34 and 34-44 experienced\nthe largest declines. Between 1989 and 2000, the employment rate of those with disabilities\naged 25-34 fell from 57.5 percent to 40.9 percent, a drop of more than 16 percentage points. The\nemployment rate for those aged 35-44 also fell precipitously, dropping by nearly 11 percentage\npoints over the period. Employment rates of individuals in these age groups without disabilities\nrose slightly between 1989 and 2000. The 1990s decline in employment among younger adults\nwith disabilities contrasts sharply with the previous decade when employment rates for 25-34\n10The underlying numbers for these figures, referred to in the text, are provided in Appendix Exhibit 4.\n11The figures reported for those without disabilities can be found in Appendix Exhibit 5.\n-8-\n\nyear olds with disabilities rose 9 percentage points and employment rates for 35-44 year olds\nwith disabilities rose 5.3 percentage points.\nDeclines in employment rates of older men and women with disabilities (aged 45-54 and\n55-61) were more modest than those of younger adults during the 1990s. Employment rates\ndropped 3.8 percentage points for those aged 45-54 and 1.8 percentage points for those aged 55-\n61. This trend contrasts with the previous decade when employment rates rose for both age\ngroups with disabilities. It also contrasts with the trend among same-aged individuals without\ndisabilities during the 1990s who experienced rising employment rates.\nEmployment trends by race reveal similar patterns, with employment rates of both whites\nand non-whites with disabilities falling during the 1990s (Exhibit 4C). The largest declines\noccurred for whites, with employment falling 9.1 percentage points (from 43.8 to 34.7 percent)\nbetween 1989 and 2000. Employment rates for non-whites fell 2.3 percentage points (from 28.8\nto 26.5 percent) over the period. During the previous decade employment rates for whites with\ndisabilities rose 5.7 percentage points, while employment rates for non-whites increased 3.6\npercentage points. Again, the reversal of fortune in employment between the 1980s and 1990s\nwas limited to those with disabilities, with employment rates for whites and non-whites without\ndisabilities rising between 1989 and 2000.\nExhibits 4A-4C showed that the decline in employment among working-age adults with\ndisabilities documented in Chapter 2 was broad-based across gender, age, and racial sub-groups.\nAs Exhibit 4D shows, the employment decline also was broad-based across sub-populations\ncharacterized by different levels of educational attainment. Employment rates of those with\ndisabilities and less than a high school education fell 4.9 percentage points between 1989 and\n2000. For similarly educated adults without disabilities, employment rose during the period,\n-9-\n\nhitting a two decade high in 2000. In contrast to other groups with disabilities, the 1990s decline\nin employment among those with less than high school represented an acceleration in a\ndownward trend that extended back to 1980; the employment rate for adults with disabilities and\nless than a high school education fell 0.9 percentage point between 1980 and 1989.\nThe remaining lines in Exhibit 4D display the familiar pattern of solid employment gains\namong those with disabilities during the 1980s followed by substantial employment losses during\nthe 1990s. Employment rates for adults with disabilities and a high school degree or some\ncollege fell 13.4 and 13.0 percentage points, respectively, between 1989 and 2000. During the\nprior decade, employment rates for both groups increased by 5.6 percentage points. The most\npronounced declines occurred among college-educated adults with disabilities. Between 1989\nand 2000 the employment rate of those with at least a college degree fell 16 percentage points,\nfrom 64.2 percent to 48.2 percent. Like most other sub-populations examined, employment rates\namong college-educated adults with disabilities rose during the previous decade. With the\nexception of those with college or more, employment rates for comparable educational groups\nwithout disabilities increased during the 1990s.\nExhibits 4A through 4D and Appendix Tables 4 and 5 show that the decline in\nemployment among those with disabilities during the 1990s expansion was broad-based,\noccurring in all major sub-groups of the population. The results also indicate that in nearly every\ncase the 1990s decline represented a significant reversal in the positive employment trends\nrecorded during the 1980s expansion. Finally, the figures highlight the divergence of\nemployment trends for those with disabilities from those in the rest of the population.\n-10-\n\nV. Decomposition of Employment Decline\nAs shown in Exhibit 4A, the overall employment rate of those reporting work limitations\ndeclined from 40.8 percent in 1989 (the peak of the 1980s business cycle) to 32.8 percent by\n2000 (the peak of the 1990s business cycle). This 8.0 percentage point decline in employment\nmay be due to a change in the characteristics of the population, changes in the employment rates\nof various subgroups within the population, or to some combination of both factors. The\nevidence in Section III suggests that the characteristics of the population with disabilities\nchanged substantially over the past two decades. Still, the evidence presented in Section IV\nindicates that all subgroups experienced declining employment rates over this period, implying\nthat the employment rate of those with disabilities would have declined absent compositional\nchanges. Hence, it is likely that some combination of compositional shifts and subgroup specific\nemployment rate changes affected the overall decline in employment observed in the data.\nTo quantify the relative influence of compositional changes and subgroup specific\ndeclines in employment, we rely on a decomposition technique that breaks the total 8.0\npercentage point employment decline into two components: (1) the change in the composition of\nthe population and (2) the change in subgroup employment rates. The overall employment rate\nin any given year (Et) is the sum of subgroup employment rates (Et ) weighted by subgroup\ng\npopulation shares (St ) over all subgroups (g = 1, 2, ... G). This calculation requires mutually\ng\nexclusive subgroups. The change in overall employment rates from one year (t) to another year\n(t´) is\nG ( ) G ( )\nEt′ − Et = ∑ Et′ St′ − ∑ Et St ..\ng g g g\ng=1 g=1\nTo facilitate decomposition, this change can be rewritten as\n-11-\n\nG (( )( )) G (( ) )\nEt′ − Et = ∑ St′ − St Et − Et + ∑ Et′ − Et St′\ng g g g g g\ng=1 g=1\nG ( ) G ( )\n= ∑ ∆S et + ∑ ∆E St′ .\ng g g g\ng=1 g=1\nIn other words, the impact of the change in subgroup composition (the first term) is the weighted\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:14)(cid:11)(cid:15)(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:16)(cid:2)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:19) S ) over all subgroups, where each subgroup is\ng\nweighted by the deviation of its initial employment rate from the initial overall employment rate\n(et ). A rise in a population share of a subgroup with a below average employment rate will\ng\nreduce the overall employment rate. The change due to changes in subgroup employment rates\n(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:20)(cid:4)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:18)(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:22)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:20)(cid:4)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:14)(cid:11)(cid:15)(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:23)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:4)(cid:15)(cid:9)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:19) E ) over all\ng\nsubgroups, where each subgroup is weighted by its population share in the second year (St’). A\ng\nrise in the employment rate of any subgroup will increase the overall employment rate.\nTo perform the decomposition, we divide the population with disabilities into 16\nmutually exclusive subgroups based on male, female, white, non-white, aged 25-44, aged 45-61,\nhigh school or less, and more than high school.12 Exhibit 5 reports the population shares and\nemployment rates for the 16 mutually exclusive subgroups used in the decomposition as well as\nhow they changed between 1980 and 2000 (in percentage point terms).13 Looking first at\nchanges in population shares, the table points to a shift in the population with disabilities towards\ngreater educational attainment. With the exception of white men aged 25-44, educational\nattainment among all subgroups increased between 1989 and 2000. In most cases this continued\na pattern of improvement begun in the 1980s.\n12 Limited sample sizes prohibit us from splitting the population into mutually exclusive subgroups based\non the full set of sub-groups in the previous sections.\n13Appendix Exhibit 6 provides the figures for the population without disabilities.\n-12-\n\nAs the last five columns of the table show, the patterns for employment rates were much\ndifferent. Of the 16 subgroups displayed in the table, five experienced employment declines\nbetween 1980 and 1989 and 13 experienced declines in employment between 1989 and 2000.\nDuring the 1990s, the most notable declines in employment were among white men and women\naged 25-44 with more than a high school education, 27.6 and 20.0 percentage points,\nrespectively. The smallest declines were among white and non-white women aged 45-61 with\nhigh school or less; employment among white women declined 4.1 percentage points, non-white\nwomen in this group experienced a 3.2 percentage point decline in employment between 1989\nand 2000. Only non-white men 45-61 and non-white women 45-61 with more than high school\nsaw their employment rates rise over the 1990s. In contrast, during the previous decade\nemployment rates rose for all groups except certain non-whites and white men with less high\nschool or less. These simple descriptive statistics point to a broad-based decline in employment\namong those with disabilities, a decline not fully accounted for by employment reductions\namong high-risk groups such as non-whites, older workers, and individuals with below average\neducational attainment.\nExhibit 6 reports the results of the decompositions. For comparison purposes, we perform\nthe decompositions for both business cycle periods in our sample, 1980-1989 and 1989-2000.14\nThe first row of Exhibit 6 shows that between 1989 and 2000, changes in employment rates\nrather than changes in population shares account for the 8.0 percentage point decline in overall\nemployment among those with disabilities. Indeed, changes in subgroup population shares\ncontributed positively, albeit modestly, to changes in the overall employment rate during the\nperiod, boosting it by 0.2 percentage points. Changes in subgroup employment rates contributed\nnegatively to changes in the overall employment rate, reducing it 8.2 percentage points. This\n-13-\n\nexperience contrasts with that of the previous decade when movements in population shares and\nchanges in subgroup employment rates moved together to boost employment among those with\ndisabilities. Between 1980 and 1989, employment among working-age adults increased 5.3\npercentage points; changes in population shares accounted for 2.2 percentage points while\nchanges in employment rates contributed 3.1 percentage points.15\nThe remaining rows of Exhibit 6 display the patterns for each of our 16 subgroups; the\nthird and sixth columns show the contribution of each subgroup to the change in the overall\nemployment rate over the period. For example, white men aged 25-44 with more than a high\nschool education contributed negatively to the employment rate of those with disabilities\nbetween 1989 and 2000, bringing it down 1.5 percentage points. Measured this way, white men\naged 25-44 at all levels of education and white women 25-44 with high school or less contributed\nthe most to the overall decline in employment, accounting for 4.6 percentage points of the 8.0\npercentage point decline. Only 3 groups contributed positively to the overall employment rate:\nnon-white men aged 45-61 in either education group (a total of 0.1 percentage points) and white\nwomen aged 45-61 with more than a high school education (0.6 percentage points).\nAnother useful way to think about the relative contributions of each subgroup to the total\ndecline is to compare their percent contributions to the overall employment decline (columns 4\nand 8 of Exhibit 6) with their population shares (columns 1-3 of Exhibit 5). This comparison\nshows that white men and women of all educational levels contributed disproportionately to the\noverall decline in employment among those with disabilities during the 1990s. For example,\nwhite men with high school or less made up about 12 percent of the population over the 1989-\n14 Decomposition results for those without disabilities are provided in Appendix Exhibit 7.\n15 To check the robustness of our findings, we pooled the data into three-year periods 1987-1989 and 1998-\n2000. The results were very similar. We also tried different education subcategories (less than high school and high\nschool or more), and again the results were very similar. These results are available upon request.\n-14-\n\n2000 period, but accounted for 22.4 percent of the employment decline among those with\ndisabilities. The relative contribution of white men with more than high school was even larger.\nBased on their population shares, they should have accounted for about 5 percent of the overall\nemployment decline between 1989 and 2000. Instead, they accounted for 18.4 percent of the\ndecline, roughly four times their population share. The patterns for white women are similar.\nOverall, this comparison indicates that while nonwhites with lower than average educational\nattainment make up a disproportionate share of the population with disabilities (15.3 percent in\n2000), they accounted for just 4 percent (0.4 percentage points) of the total decline in\nemployment rates among those with disabilities. Taken together these results support the earlier\ndescriptive evidence in finding little evidence that population shifts or narrowly focused\nemployment declines can account for the sharp decline in employment among working-age\nadults with disabilities during the 1990s.\nFinally, some simple counterfactuals exercises illustrate these findings. If population\nshares did not change over this period, and the change in the employment rate for each group\nwere the same, the decline in the employment rate would have been larger, assuming no\nbehavioral or policy responses. Instead of the 8.0 percentage point decline, there would have\nbeen an 8.2 percentage point decline. Conversely, if the employment rate within each group did\nnot change over this period, and the population share changes were the same, the employment\nrate would have increased by 0.2 percentage points.\nThe results of the decompositions underscore the descriptive analyses in Sections III and\nIV, pointing to broad-based reductions in employment rates among nearly every sub-group.\nMore importantly, the results suggest that the largest relative declines in employment were\namong those groups best prepared to take advantage of the economic expansion of the 1990s\n-15-\n\n(i.e., individuals with greater than high school). The groups traditionally least attached to the\nlabor market, nonwhites with high school or less, experienced the smallest relative declines in\nemployment. These patterns contrast sharply with those of the 1980s when large shifts in\neducational attainment and demographic characteristics helped boost employment rates for those\nwith disabilities.\nVI. Within Group Changes in Health\nThe analyses in the previous the sections rule out the possibility that simple shifts in\npopulation shares or employment declines among narrowly defined groups explain the aggregate\nemployment trends for the population with disabilities over the 1990s business cycle. The final\nelement of change we consider is the extent to which the population with disabilities is becoming\nless healthy. The use of self-reported health is not without its problems. However, unlike\nmeasures such as the ability to work, it is not directly tied to the employment variable we are\ntracking in our analysis. Thus, it provides one method of checking whether changes in health,\nunrelated to changes in labor markets, may be driving the employment declines observed in the\n1990s.\nExhibit 7A shows the share of the population with disabilities reporting poor, fair, good,\nvery good, and excellent health. The data are for 1995 through 2000, the only years these\nquestions appear in the CPS.16 Although the time series is too short to draw many conclusions\nabout changes in self-reported health, we see no indication of shifts in this variable. There is no\nvisible consistent upward or downward trend. Exhibit 7B considers employment trends among\nthose with disabilities by self-reported health status, once again asking whether the overall\ndecline in employment can be traced to pronounced reductions among one group, such as those\nwith poor health. As the figure shows, there is little evidence that one subgroup accounts for the\n-16-\n\ndecline. Rather, the reductions in employment appear broad-based or evenly slightly weighted\ntowards those with better health.\n16Appendix Exhibit 8 provides similar information for those without disabilities.\n-17-\n\nVII. Conclusions\nWe began this chapter by asking whether the decline in employment among those with\ndisabilities documented in Chapter 2 was broad-based or narrowly focused, explained by\npopulation shifts or changes in behavior and/or opportunities among those with disabilities, or\nsimply reflective of exogenous deteriorations in health, relatively immune from policy\ncorrections. Our findings point strongly towards changes in behavior and/or opportunities as the\nkey to understanding the recent decline. We show that employment declines were very broad-\nbased across key population subgroups, that the largest contributions to the decline were among\nsubgroups most connected to the labor market, and that shifts in population shares actually\ncontributed positively, rather than negatively, to employment among those with disabilities\nduring the 1990s. These findings tell us that there are no simple answers to the disturbing trend\nin employment. Instead the decline appears to owe to a complex combination of behavioral and\npolicy changes that come together to dramatically alter the connection of people with disabilities\nto the labor market during the 1990s.\n-18-\n\nReferences\nAutor, David and Mark Duggan.

    "text": "Calibrating Policy in an Uncertain Time\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSalt Lake Chamber, Salt Lake City, UT\nApril 12, 2023, 9 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nGood morning. It’s great to be here in Utah. I am especially delighted to be with all of you at\nthe Salt Lake Chamber, this time live and in person. So, thank you very much for the invitation,\nand I look forward to a great discussion.\nTop of mind for many of you are recent stresses in the banking system and what they mean for\nbusinesses, consumers, and the broader economy.\nThe most important thing to know is this: The banking system is sound and resilient. As my\ncolleagues Chair Powell and Vice Chair Barr have said, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Department of the Treasury took decisive actions to\nprotect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system.1 These\nactions demonstrate that we are committed to ensuring that all deposits are safe. We will\ncontinue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our\ntools for any size institution, as needed, to keep the system safe and sound.2 The strength of\nour financial system rests on having a wide range of institutions, including regional and\n1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023b).\n2 With the support of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board also created the Bank Term Funding Program to\nensure that banks that hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par; see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve (2023a). This program, along with the normal discount window, ensures\nthat banks have the liquidity they need.\n1\n\ncommunity banks. And we are committed to supporting all institutions and the valuable role\nthey play in our financial system.\nFinally, as many of you know, the Federal Reserve Board, under the direction of Vice Chair for\nSupervision Michael Barr, is currently conducting a thorough review of the supervision and\nregulation of Silicon Valley Bank before its failure. This review will be completed by May 1, at\nwhich time the Board will share the results publicly.\nWhile the recent banking stresses have received a lot of attention, they are only part of the\neconomic picture right now. In the remainder of my time today, I will discuss the full slate of\nfactors the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) must consider as we work to assess the\neconomy and calibrate monetary policy in this uncertain time.\nBut before I go on, let me say that the remarks I make today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nOngoing Economic Strength and High Inflation\nBy almost any measure, the U.S. economy remains strong. GDP growth, consumer spending,\nand the labor market all continue to outperform expectations. Moreover, these indicators are\nexpanding at rates well above levels consistent with returning inflation to the FOMC’s longer-\nrun goal of 2 percent on average over time.\nWe see this strength most clearly in the labor market. The U.S. economy has added close to\n350,000 jobs per month over the first three months of this year. This far exceeds the 90,000\njobs needed each month to keep up with the growth of the labor force. This has kept\nunemployment historically low and job vacancies unusually high, especially for firms in rapidly\ngrowing sectors including travel, leisure, and hospitality, among others.\nOf course, there are a number of signs that the labor market is starting to cool, but it remains\nextremely tight and is likely to come back into balance only gradually.3\nThe sustained imbalances in the economy have translated into persistently high inflation, well\nabove the Fed’s 2 percent target.4 The most recent data tell the story. Looking at the personal\nconsumption expenditures, or PCE, price index, the Fed’s primary measure of inflation, it rose 5\npercent over the 12 months ending in February, the latest reading we have. That’s down from\n3 Signs of cooling include the following. Average hourly earnings growth over the previous 12 months has\nmoderated from 5.9% in March 2022 to 4.2% in March 2023. The quits rate is down to 2.6% from a high of 3%. And\nthe number of job openings fell below 10 million in February from above 12 million in March 2022.\n4 Federal Open Market Committee (2023) specifies the 2 percent target as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures.\n2\n\nthe peak of 7 percent in the middle of last year, but not yet close to levels consistent with price\nstability.\nAnd American families are feeling the impact. This is apparent in sentiment surveys and well\nsummarized by a single striking fact:5 For most workers, inflation is rising faster than wage\ngrowth, consistently eroding purchasing power and leaving them worse off over time.6\nMy colleagues and I are deeply aware of the toll that high inflation takes on the economy and\nthe lives and livelihoods of all Americans, especially those least able to bear it. And we remain\nresolute and committed to bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal. It is essential for both\nsides of our mandate, and we have the tools and the resolve to get the job done.\nPolicy Decisions under Uncertainty\nAnd that brings me to policy and what lies ahead in terms of our decisions. We have taken\naggressive action over the past year, moving the federal funds rate from near zero to between\n4.75 and 5 percent as of our March meeting. These actions have been warranted and\nconsistent with our commitment to restore price stability.\nWhile the full impact of this policy tightening is still making its way through the system, the\nstrength of the economy and the elevated readings on inflation suggest that there is more work\nto do.\nHow much more depends on several factors, all with considerable uncertainty attached to their\nevolution.\nFor one, there is the banking stress and the impact that it could have on credit conditions.\nHistory tells us that as banks evaluate the changing economic outlook and manage their liquidity\nand balance sheets, they are likely to tighten credit availability.\n5 According to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, higher prices have consistently been the most\ncited reason among respondents over the past 12 months who have indicated that their families were worse off\nfinancially than they were one year earlier. Furthermore, the number of Google searches for “inflation” continues\nto be elevated by historical standards.\n6 The consumer price index (CPI) and PCE price index have risen faster than average hourly earnings over the past\nyear. In addition, for full-time wage and salary workers, between the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of\n2022 (latest available), real weekly earnings fell for those at the 50th percentile and above when earnings are\ndeflated by the headline PCE index, and they fell for those at the 25th percentile and above when earnings are\ndeflated by the headline CPI index.\n3\n\nWe are already starting to see this in the data. Credit standards have risen over the past year\nand are expected to increase further in coming quarters.7 And recent data on lending activity\nalready point to declines in lending volumes in several sectors.8\nHow much credit tightening will ultimately occur is not yet known. What we do know is that\ntighter credit conditions translate into less spending and investment by households and\nbusinesses, resulting in a slower pace of economic growth. So we will need to monitor this\nimpact carefully as we determine our own policy path.\nA second factor affecting the economy and our decisions is developments in the global\neconomy. Global monetary policy tightening, international bank conditions, and greater fiscal\nrestraint abroad all translate into slower global growth.9 This serves as a headwind to U.S.\ngrowth and could also help temper commodity and goods price inflation. Again, the extent of\nthese global headwinds and their impact on U.S. growth and inflation is unknown, so careful\nmonitoring will be required.\nFinally, there is the impact of our own monetary policy actions. The FOMC has increased the\npolicy rates considerably over the past year, and it will likely take some time for those increases\nto take their full effect. But how much more time and how much additional slowing is coming is\nunclear. So like the other factors I have mentioned, we will need to carefully monitor the\nsituation as we assess what it means for policy.\nThe Prudence of Data Dependence\nIn all actions, the FOMC is guided by a commitment to our mandated goals of full employment\nand price stability. When we are off either of our goals, Americans bear the cost, and we have\nan urgency to restore balance. But that urgency must be coupled with an awareness of the\nuncertainty we are facing, and the risks it poses to the economy.\nLooking ahead, there are good reasons to think that policy may have to tighten more to bring\ninflation down. But there are also good reasons to think that the economy may continue to\nslow, even without additional policy adjustments.\n7 According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS), domestic banks have been tightening credit\nstandards for commercial and industrial loans to large and midsize firms, as well as for consumer loans over the\npast year.\n8 Over a two-week period following the recent banking stress, banks cut back corporate and real estate lending as\nthey experienced a large decline in deposits. Moreover, financial institutions participating in the Dallas Fed's\nBanking Conditions Survey reported a decline, on net, in total volume of lending in late March relative to early\nFebruary.\n9 Credit default swap spreads of several major European banks increased in response to recent conditions in the\nbanking sector. On fiscal policy, the European Commission indicated that it supports the pullback from broad-based\nstimulus (see https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_23_2010).\n4\n\nSo, we will need to make decisions calibrated by data. Not just last week’s data or last month’s\ndata, but all the data. Looking back and looking ahead as we navigate the uncertainty that\nsurrounds us. This is what prudent policymaking requires, and what restoring price stability and\nachieving both of our mandates demands.\nThank you.\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2023a. “Federal Reserve Board announces it will\nmake available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the\nability to meet the needs of all their depositors.” Press release, March 12.\nBoard of Governors. 2023b. “Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC.” Joint press\nrelease, March 12.\nFederal Open Market Committee. 2023. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”\nAdopted effective January 24, 2012; as reaffirmed effective January 31, 2023.\n5",

    "text": "FINAL\nLessons from History, Policy for Today\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nEconomic Club of New York Virtual Webinar\nNew York, NY\nMarch 2, 2021\n02:00 PM EST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nIn February of last year, right before COVID-19 hit our shores, I was in\nIreland. Walking around Dublin one day, I happened upon a converted\nwarehouse with artists selling their work. One of the artists had a wall of\nbeautifully colored, tiny framed prints. Each one was etched with the phrase\n“History Will Repeat Itself” followed by an arrow pointing to the future. It\nseemed a pessimistic, almost fatalistic view, so I asked him if he had painted it\nout of prophecy or fear. He answered, somewhat gruffly, “Both.”\nAs an unrelenting optimist, I saw something different in his work—the\npotential for agency. For people and institutions to learn from the past and\nuse those lessons to shape a better future.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have a practical test before us. With much\nwelcomed light at the end of the COVID tunnel, we must work to return the\neconomy to full employment and price stability. This is a tall order. Millions of\nAmericans are out of work and inflation remains well below our target.\nAt the same time, a swell of market and academic commentary has\nstarted to emerge about a quick snapback, an undesirable pickup in inflation,\n1\n\nFINAL\nand the need for the Federal Reserve to withdraw accommodation more\n1\nquickly than expected. I see this as the tug of fear. The reaction to a memory\nof high and rising inflation, an inexorable link between unemployment, wages\nand prices, and a Federal Reserve that once fell behind the policy curve.\nBut the world today is different, and we can’t let those memories, those\nscars, dictate current and future policy. We need to learn from history\nwithout letting it drive our actions. We must consider all the lessons from our\npast, not just the ones that frighten us.\nThis is what I will tackle today.\nBut before I go further, let me remind you that my remarks are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nStudents of History\nThe Old Normal\nI started at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 1996 and\nbecame deeply steeped in the standard macroeconomic logic that many of us\nlearned. It goes like this. There is a level of unemployment in the economy\nbelow which wage and price inflation will start to pick up. Once that begins,\nthe feedback loop between prices and wages and wages and prices will spiral\nand be hard to control. So, prudent central bankers should avoid that\nsituation, even try to stave it off. Given that monetary policy works with a lag,\nthis means we need to be forward-looking and respond to expected future\ninflation to ensure that actual inflation remains close to target.\n1\n2\nSee, for example, discussion in Casselman (2021) and Irwin (2021).\n\nFINAL\nIn this simple model, our key tool was, among others, the Phillips Curve,\nwhich captures the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. The\nPhillips Curve had the additional feature of delivering a non-accelerating\ninflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU, which could be used to gauge the\nexpectations\nlevel of full employment. We also applied expectations theory, which posits\nthat future inflation depends largely on about future inflation.\nWith these tools in hand, it felt straightforward to assess where the\neconomy stood relative to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals. If\nunemployment was below or projected to be below NAIRU, wage and price\ninflation would start to build and economic agents would begin to expect\nhigher future inflation. A responsive and proactive Fed would pull the reins\non growth and the labor market and broader economy would settle at our full\nemployment and price stability goals.\nOf course, many other factors made this very simple system work. First,\nthe real neutral rate of interest, or r-star, was well above zero, roughly in the\nrange of 2 to 3 percent. Combined with inflation expectations above 2\npercent, the Fed had plenty of room on both sides of the business cycle to\nadjust the federal funds rate and stimulate or restrain growth. Second,\ninflation was highly responsive to economic activity. In other words, the\nPhillips curve was steep. So, changes in policy that impacted growth and\nemployment had a concurrent and significant effect on inflation.\nThe New Normal\nCompared with this old normal, our new normal is almost an “opposite\nworld.” Here is what I mean. There is still some level of unemployment below\nwhich wage and price inflation will pick up, but it’s hard to know, a priori,\n3\n\nFINAL\nwhere it is. We saw this in the last expansion, when Fed policymakers\ncontinuously lowered their estimates of the longer-run rate of unemployment\nin the face of modest inflationary pressures.\nThe dynamics of inflation have also changed. Inflation is far less\nresponsive to movements in output and employment than in previous\ndecades. Indeed, despite a near eleven-year expansion and historically low\nunemployment, inflation has remained stubbornly below our 2 percent target\nsince the Great Recession.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThis reflects, in part, a weakening of the traditional links between\nunemployment, wages, and prices. A large literature confirms this, showing\n2\nthat the Phillips Curve has become quite flat in recent years. Declines in\nbargaining power for workers, fierce competition in product markets (think\nAmazon), and a labor force that is far more elastic than most imagined have all\n3\nplayed a role. Each of these factors are likely to continue to persist in the\ncoming years, requiring us to adjust our policies to adapt to the new\nenvironment.\nWe will need to make these adjustments in an environment that also\nlooks quite different than the old normal. The real neutral rate of interest is\nexpected to remain at very low levels, not much above zero, for some time. In\nthis world, keeping inflation expectations well-anchored at 2 percent will be\nessential. As I noted earlier, inflation expectations are an important\n4\ndeterminant of future inflation. So any drift down translates into lower\ninflation, a lower nominal funds rate, and fewer rate cuts when the economy\nneeds them. In this context, long periods of below-target inflation, like the one\nwe are experiencing, are costly.\nAdapting for Today\nThe lessons of the last decade and projections of our future conditions\ntell us that, for the foreseeable future, the Federal Reserve will face an uphill\nbattle using conventional monetary policy to keep the economy healthy, the\n5\nlabor market strong, and inflation at our 2 percent goal.\n2\nSee for example Blanchard (2016), Lansing (2019), Leduc, Marti, and Wilson (2019).\n3\nDaly (2019a, b).\n4\nJordà et al. (2019a, b).\n5\n5\nMertens and Williams (2019), Amano, Carter, and Leduc (2019).\n\nFINAL\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s new policy framework is an\n6\nexplicit recognition of these realities. It reflects the learnings of current and\npast FOMC participants, as well as inputs from our year-long review process\nthat included evidence from research and feedback from the businesses and\n7\ncommunities we serve.\nThe resulting revised framework reemphasizes our commitment to\nmaximum employment and stable prices and makes changes to our policy\nstrategy that will make each of these goals easier to achieve.\nClarifying Maximum Employment\nStarting with maximum employment, the new framework states that\npolicy decisions will be informed by “assessments of the shortfalls of\nemployment from its maximum level” rather than by “deviations from its\nmaximum level.” In other words, in the absence of inflationary pressures, we\nwill not pull back the reins on the economy in response to a strong labor\nmarket.\nThe statement also emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad\nand inclusive goal. In assessing whether it has been reached, there is no single\nnumber that tells the story. Instead, we will examine a wide range of\nindicators—measures like unemployment, labor force participation, job\nfinding, and wage growth—across a broad distribution of workers.\nAs we apply this strategy, our most important virtue will be patience.\nWe will need to continually reassess what the labor market is capable of and\n6 Fed Listens\nSee Board of Governors (2020)\n7\nSee the discussion of the initiative on the Board of Governors\nwebsite: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-\n6\nstrategy-tools-and-communications.htm\n\nFINAL\navoid preemptively tightening monetary policy before millions of Americans\nhave an opportunity to benefit. These efforts are critical to support the broad\neconomy and aid the inclusion of historically less advantaged groups,\nincluding people of color, those lacking college degrees, and others who face\n8\nsystemic barriers to equitable employment and wages.\nGetting to 2 Percent Inflation\nRegarding price stability, the new framework reaffirms the committee’s\ncommitment to a 2 percent inflation objective but adds that this means\nachieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time. To achieve this, the\nFOMC will employ flexible average inflation targeting. Specifically, following\nperiods when inflation is below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will\naim to move inflation above 2 percent for some time.\nThis will ensure that inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2\npercent, even when policy is more frequently constrained by the zero lower\nbound. This approach helps put a floor under inflation expectations,\nenhancing our ability to achieve our full employment and price stability goals.\nPractically, the new framework allows us to retain our vigilance against\ninflation that is too high, while improving our ability to keep inflation from\nfalling too low. It applies the lessons from all of our history and recognizes\nthat persistent misses on either side of the target can leave lasting damage on\nexpectations and the economy.\nAn Unwanted Test\n8\n7\nAaronson et al. (2019), Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n\nFINAL\nAlthough the evolution of the framework I just described predates the\npandemic, it is exactly what we need to support the economy through this\ndifficult time. In addition to its wrenching toll on health, the virus has\nseverely depressed economic activity. Millions of workers remain\nunemployed and hundreds of thousands of businesses shuttered, some of\nthem permanently. Digging beneath the aggregate numbers shows that a\ndisproportionate share of affected workers come from the lower half of the\n9\nwage distribution.\nConsistent with historical barriers to education and employment, these losses\n10\nare also concentrated among communities of color.\nInflation has also been pushed down by the pandemic. After falling\nsharply last year, it has improved as the economy has rebounded. But COVID-\n11\nsensitive sectors remain a drag on overall inflation. And even when those\nsectors have fully recovered, it will likely be some time before inflation is\nsustainably back to 2 percent.\n9\nSimilarly, losses are concentrated among those with less than a college degree, Daly,\nBuckman, and Seitelman (2020).\n10\nGould and Wilson (2020), Kochhar (2020), Powell (2021a).\n11\n8\nShapiro (2020).\n\nFINAL\nGetting fully past this crisis and back on track to achieve our dual\nmandate goals will require monetary policy to be accommodative for some\ntime. We must make sure that everyone who lost their job or left the labor\nforce to care for children or other family members has an opportunity to\n12\nreturn. We also need to offset the downward inflation pressures created by\nthe pandemic and get back to moving inflation towards our average 2 percent\ngoal.\nAnd this brings me back to the fearful swirl about spikes in inflation and\nthe need to preemptively offset them. Of course, we need to be vigilant\nagainst all the risks in the economy, but we also must weight them by their\nlikelihood and expected cost. As for the likelihood of runaway inflation, I\ndon’t see this risk as imminent, and neither do market participants.\nInstead, I view the recent rise in inflation compensation to roughly 2 percent\nas encouraging and in line with our stated goals. It suggests that our\n12\nLofton, Petrosky-Nadeau, and Seitelman (2021). Chair Powell also alluded to this issue in\n9\nthe Q&A following his most recent Congressional testimony (Powell 2021b).\n\nFINAL\ncommitment to flexible average inflation targeting has already gained\nsubstantial credibility.\nBut what about the costs? The memory of the 1970s and 1980s and the\npainful correction it required looms large. But that was more than three\ndecades ago, and times have changed. Today, the costs are tilted the other\nway. Running inflation too low for too long can pull down inflation\nexpectations, reduce policy space, and leave millions of Americans on the\nsidelines along the way.\nHistory Will Repeat Itself, Unless We Learn\nSo, I’ll end by returning to my Irish artist friend. I bought one of his\nprints and put it on my office bookshelf. I keep it as a reminder that the\nweight of the past can be a powerful force, pulling us back to what has been.\nTo shake its grasp requires diligence and intention, an active commitment to\nbe students of history but not victims of it.\nTo do otherwise will fall short, leaving us like the picture, destined to\nrepeat ourselves.\n10\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nBrookings Papers on Economic\nAaroAncstiovnit, yS tephanie, Mary C.

Introduction\nThe muted and inconsistent fluctuations of aggregate real wage growth have been a perennial\npuzzle of macroeconomics. Aggregate real wages exhibit less variability over time than most\nmacroeconomic models predict and movements that do take place appear only modestly related to\nthe business cycle.2 Both of these patterns are apparent in Figure 1 which plots the growth in real\nmedian weekly earnings along with the unemployment rate.\nAs the figure shows, aggregate real wage growth varies much less than the unemployment rate,\na standard measure of business cycle movements.3 In addition, and in contrast to most models,\nthere is no apparent single pattern of comovement between wage growth and the unemployment\nrate over time.4 For example, in the 1980s aggregate real wage growth looks slightly procylical,\nfalling during the deep recessions of the first part of the decade and rising when the unemployment\nrate declined in middle of the decade. From the late 1980‟s through the mid 1990‟s, real wage\ngrowth appears countercyclical, increasing at the same time that the unemployment rate rose. The\nrelationship between real wage growth and unemployment seemed to vanish altogether during the\nsecond half of the 1990s as the unemployment rate hovered near its structural level and wages grew\nrapidly, statistically producing an acyclical relationship. Finally, in the most recent severe\nrecession, real wage growth remained high while unemployment increased, suggesting that\naggregate real wages responded countercyclically.\nIn contrast to the movements of aggregate real wage growth, real wage fluctuations of\nindividuals consistently have been found to be procyclical, rising as the unemployment rate falls\nand falling as the unemployment rate rises. Moreover, in keeping with standard macro theory, the\nsize of the response is non-trivial. For example, several authors including Bils (1985), Solon,\nBarsky, and Parker (1994), and Devereux, (2001) find that a one percent increase in the\n2 Several authors have concluded that wages are modestly tied to business cycle conditions: for example, Lucas (1977); Mankiw\n(1989); and Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992). See Abraham and Haltiwanger (1995) for a survey of empirical studies of real-\nwage growth over the business cycle.\n3 The limited variability of aggregate real wage growth fails the predictions of a variety of macro models including real business\ncycle models (Hansen 1985) and models of frictional unemployment (Shimer 2005). The flipside of this is that unemployment,\nemployment, and hours tend to move more than these models predict, suggesting that most of the adjustments in the labor market\ncome through quantities rather than prices.\n4 While most models expect wages to exhibit some cyclicality the direction depends on the model. For example, Kydland and\nPrescott (1982), Barro and King (1984), Rotemberg and Woodford (1992), and Bartelsman et al (1994) all posit procyclical real\nwages while a countercyclical relationship is predicted by Keynesian with sticky wages. See Swanson (2007) for a brief review of\nthese issues.\n2\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nunemployment rate reduces real-wage growth of individuals by about 1.3 percentage points. This\npattern holds across decades and for various subpopulations of the labor market.\nTo reconcile the different views coming from aggregate and individual real wage fluctuations\nresearchers have noted that movements in aggregate real wages reflect the net result of two separate\neffects. The first, which we will term the wage growth effect, captures the responsiveness of\nindividual wages, or, wages of comparable worker groups, to fluctuations in the economy. In\nsimple terms, if a rising tide lifts all boats, the wage growth effect measures by how much (Hines,\nHoynes, and Krueger 2001). The size of the wage growth effect at any point in the business cycle is\ndetermined by the efficiency of markets, which is itself determined by wage setting practices, wage\nnorms, and government policy. Efficiency wage models, implicit contract models, and insider-\noutsider models as well as the long literature on nominal wage rigidities all focus on understanding\nthe wage growth effect.5 Models of wage bargaining have frequently been used to explain why\naggregate wages adjust much less than employment or hours; nominal rigidities are pointed to as a\nreason for limited cyclical responsiveness of wages in downturns.\nThe second effect, termed the composition effect, denotes the impact that changes in the\ncomposition of the workforce over the business cycle can have on aggregate wage fluctuations. If\nhiring or layoffs are not randomly distributed across all types of workers, composition bias can\nobscure the true relationship between wages and economic conditions. Returning to the boats\nmetaphor, this is the idea that in economic downturns some boats sink; the composition effect\nmeasures the impact of the sinking boats on aggregate real wage movements. Previous studies have\nshown that employment losses during economic downturns disproportionately occur workers with\nlower than average wages (Hines, Hoynes, and Krueger, 2001, for example). This “upskilling”\nimplies less variation in aggregate real wages than would be implied by models where workers are\nhomogeneous and wages adjust uniformly (Altonji and Devereux, 2000). Research has shown that\ncontrolling for composition bias, wages are highly procyclical.6\nAlthough these micro studies indicate that aggregate real wage growth reflects both wage\ngrowth and composition components and that controlling for composition bias makes wages much\n5 Empirical research has focused on nominal wage rigidities (e.g. Card and Hyslop, 1997, Lebow, Saks, and Wilson, 2003, Dickens\net al., 2007, and Barratieri, Basu, and Gottschalk, 2010) as well as the relative size of wage fluctuations for job-stayers and job-\nswitchers (e.g. Bils, 1985, Devereux, 2001). See Pissarides (2009) and Kudlyak (2010) for two useful overviews.\n6 Perry (1972), Bils (1985), and Solon, Barsky, and Parker (1994).\n3\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nmore procyclical, variation in data used, years analyzed, and methods applied have made it difficult\nfor the micro evidence to fully illuminate the drivers of aggregate real wages over time and whether\ntheir contributions change over the business cycle.7 As such, most modern macro theory continues\nto struggle with the challenges of the data presented in Figure 1—small and inconsistent\nresponsiveness of wages to the business cycle.\nIn this context, the aim of our paper is to provide a unified framework in which to examine how\nthe wage growth and composition effects have interacted over time to produce the aggregate real\nwage fluctuations shown in Figure 1. Our paper develops a strategy for netting out these effects and\ntracking their importance over time for both the variance of aggregate real wage growth and for\naggregate real wage cyclicality. The findings are revealing and provide useful guidance for\nthinking about how macroeconomic fluctuations affect aggregate real wage growth.\nThe key conclusions are as follows. The relative importance of the wage growth and\ncomposition effects varies considerably over the business cycle. The wage growth effect is strongly\nprocyclical and accounts for the bulk of the variance of real wage growth over time; the wage\ngrowth effect is dominated by changes in wages among job switchers. In business cycle downturns,\nthe composition effect rises in importance, offsetting more than half of the procyclicality of the\nwage growth effect. Much of the composition effect comes through the part-time employment\nmargin. This was especially important in during the Great Recession. Somewhat surprisingly,\ngiven its central placement in a variety of macroeconomic models of wage fluctuations, the\nunemployment margin is relatively unimportant for the variance and cyclicality of real wage\ngrowth.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data we use:\nthe Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1980 through 2011. In Section 3 we introduce a novel\npercentile decomposition technique that allows us to decompose the change in median wages into\ntractable components while avoiding issues of top coding present in most publically available\nindividual-level data on earnings in the U.S.8 We then show how this technique allows us to focus\non movements in the earnings distribution related to different groups (those who enter and exit the\nworkforce and those who stay employed) and to specifically identify the relative contributions of\n7 Another reason for this is that most of the empirical work has focused on tying down one aspect of the puzzle (e.g., wage growth of\nparticular groups, composition bias) or been restricted to aggregate or individual data with little ability to reconcile the two pieces.\n8 Our decomposition is closely related to, but different from, the one introduced in DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996).\n4\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nthe composition and wage growth effects that drive changes in each of the percentiles of the\nearnings distribution. In Section 4, we present the results of our decomposition of real median\nweekly earnings growth in the U.S. from 1980 through 2011. We conclude with Section 5. Two\nappendices follow: one with the details on the CPS data and the other detailing the mathematical\nderivations of our percentile decomposition.\n2. Studying Wage Growth using the Current Population Survey\nFor our analysis we use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is uniquely\nsuited to our project since it is the only publically available, long-standing, nationally\nrepresentative, high-frequency, micro data source on labor market status and earnings for the U.S.\nIt also has the important advantage of being a key source of information on aggregate U.S. wage\ngrowth.9 The most commonly quoted aggregate measure of wages derived from the CPS, and the\none we focus on in our analysis, is Median Usual Weekly Earnings (MWE) of full-time wage and\nsalary workers.10 MWE is published at a quarterly frequency. Usual Weekly Earnings are defined\nas “…earnings before taxes and other deductions and include any overtime pay, commissions, or\ntips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders).”11\nTo show how the CPS data on aggregate real wage growth compares with alternative aggregate\nwage measures, especially those used in other empirical studies, Figure 2 plots Average Hourly\nEarnings (AHE) of production and non-supervisory workers in the private sector, Compensation Per\nHour (CPH) in the nonfarm business sector, and the Employment Cost Index (ECI) along with\n9Previous research on the drivers of aggregate wage dynamics relied on smaller panel surveys which provide detailed data on\nindividuals. For example, Bils (1985) uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLS/Y). Solon, Barsky, and Parker\n(1994), Devereux (2001), and Hagedorn and Manovskii (2010) use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Gertler and\nTrigari (2009), Barattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk (2010) use data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Card\nand Hyslop (1997), like we do here, use data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).\n10 The focus on full-time wage earners still means that MWE is affected by fluctuations in overtime, overtime pay, as well as a trend\nin the average work week for full-time workers (See Perry, 1972, for a discussion of these issues)\n11 The CPS survey questions related to usual weekly earnings have evolved over time: “Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how\nmuch they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to\nreport earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, other) and how much they usually earn in the\nreported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term \"usual\" is as\nperceived by the respondent. If the respondent asks for a definition of usual, interviewers are instructed to define the term as more\nthan half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months” (BLS, 2011).\n5\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nMWE from the CPS from 1980 through 2011.12 All measures of nominal wages are deflated by the\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures Price Index so that the figure shows growth in real wages.\nAs the figure shows, all of these measures are highly correlated and exhibit similar cyclical\npatterns. The correlation of real wage growth measured by MWE with the other three measures is\n0.6 or higher. Importantly for our work the MWE series appears to capture the coincident\nmovements of the competing series very well. Visual inspection shows that MWE is rarely an\noutlier across the series in terms of fluctuations in growth.13 Of the four measures of real wage\ngrowth in Figure 2, MWE, which is based on the CPS, is the only one for which underlying\nindividual level data is available that covers both the level of earnings of workers as well as their\nlabor market status.\nThe micro data underlying the CPS aggregates can be used cross-sectionally or, with some\neffort, to construct short panels of individual respondents. To explain the type of information\ncontained in each of these short panels it is necessary to briefly review the CPS survey design and\ninterview structure. The CPS is a dwelling-based survey in which households are included for 16\nmonths. Over this period, individuals are interviewed monthly for the first four months, not\ninterviewed for the next eight months, and then interviewed monthly again for the remaining four\nmonths before being retired from the sample.14 As such, we have eight monthly surveys for each\nmember of our panel.\nThe CPS survey and interview structure are illustrated in Table 1 (rows 1-2). The regular\nmonthly surveys collect very basic information about labor market status but no information about\nearnings. Earnings information along with other details of jobs are collected twice during the CPS\nsurvey interval, once in survey month 4 (interview month 4) and again in survey month 16\n(interview month 8) (Table 1, rows 3-4).15 Earnings and job information are collected only for\nindividuals who are employed at the time of the interview. Following other researchers, we rely\nmost heavily on the information collected in these survey months and use the additional information\n12 For example, Gertler and Trigari (2009) focus on AHE for the empirical analysis in their paper while Galí (2011) focuses on CPH\nfor his estimate of the New-Keynesian Wage Phillips Curve. Lebow, Saks, and Wilson (2003) analyze the National Compensation\nSurvey data on which the ECI is based.\n13 The exception to this statement is 1994, when MWE rose much more rapidly than the other series. This coincides with the CPS\nredesign and the way the survey was changed to determine whether someone is a part-time or full-time employee.\n14 Because the CPS is a dwelling-based survey, individuals who change residences are dropped from the sample.\n15 Survey months 4 and 16 (interview months 4 and 8) are commonly referred to as the outgoing rotation groups since they are\nindividuals temporarily moving off the sample frame or permanently retiring from the survey. The matched samples of these\noutgoing rotation groups are known as the MORG files.\n6\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\ncollected in other survey months to refine our labor market status measures as described below. To\nmatch individuals across surveys we follow Madrian and Lefgren (1999) and Nekarda (2009). The\ndetails are provided in Appendix A.16\nIn any quarter, the published aggregate MWE statistic is based on respondents who are either in\nthe fourth or eighth month of the CPS survey tenure (see Table 1). This means that the 4-quarter\ngrowth rate of published MWE is based on a changing sample of individuals. To consider wage\nchanges of a group of individuals, we instead need a matched sample for our analysis. Using the\nshort individual panels, we compute an aggregate “Matched MWE”. This “Matched MWE”\nmeasures the growth in median wages for those individuals who are in survey month 16 and were in\nsurvey month 4 a year ago. Figure 3 plots our matched MWE against the published aggregate,\nshown earlier in Figures 1 and 2. The two measures of MWE are very similar with a correlation of\n0.79. As such, we conclude that the measure of MWE growth we use for our decomposition has the\nsame main characteristics of interest as the published MWE growth. Our data cover 1980 through\n2011.17\nSubgroups used in decomposition\nHaving settled on a wage series, we next turn to organizing our data into groups relevant for the\ndecomposition. Since our goal is to understand which labor market groups drive fluctuations in\naggregate real wages we divide individuals based on reported labor market status in survey months\n4 and 16 (interview months 4 and 8). We are able to distinguish five distinct states: (1) full-time\nemployed in the same job in both periods, (2) full-time employed in a different job from one period\nto the next, and (3), (4), and (5) transitions to or from part-time employment, unemployment, or not\nin the labor force, respectively. 18 See Table 2 for a visual accounting of these groups.\n16 One concern about using the CPS to track individuals over time is that the sample may not be representative of the population.\nSince the CPS is a housing unit survey, when individuals change residences they are dropped from the sample and the new\noccupants of the unit are interviewed. While this does not alter the cross-sectional representativeness of the CPS, it can potentially\ninterfere with representativeness of the individual-based short panels, especially if moving is related to the variables being\nanalyzed. However, work by Nekarda (2009) and Kim (2009) which carefully corrects for this type of sample attrition finds that\nthe biases introduced are empirically modest. Thus, we use the raw CPS matched data as our baseline for analysis.\n17 Due to the scrambling by the Census Bureau of identifiers that we use to match individuals across months, we are unable to\nperform this matching for two sub-periods of our sample, namely October 1985 through September 1986 and September 1995\nthrough August 1996.\n18 We do not differentiate between individuals in any of these subgroups based on their observable characteristics. Hence, our\ncomposition effect is not measured based on efficiency units, as is done in Bowlus, Liu, and Robinson (2002). They, however, do\nnot aim to decompose aggregate wage fluctuations but focus on the sensitivity of parameter estimates to composition bias.\n7\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nAlthough most of these states can be directly measured from the CPS survey data, we need to\nmake an imputation to fill out the data matrix displayed in Table 2. It regards the fraction of full-\ntime workers who stay in the same job versus change jobs over the sample. This distinction is\nimportant given the evidence that wage growth of persons who remain in the same job is less\ncyclical than that of persons who switch jobs. See, for example, Bils (1994), Devereux (2001),\nMartins, Solon, and Thomas (2010), and Hagedorn and Manovskii (2010). To impute the fraction\nof full-time employed individuals who stay in the same job we use the methods developed and used\nby Card and Hyslop (1997), Fallick and Fleischman (2004), and Nagypál (2008). We provide full\ndetails of our imputation in Appendix A.\nSubgroups as share of full-time wage and salary earners\nThe final columns of Table 2 report the average shares (1980-2011) of wage earners who are in\neach of our five categories at the beginning and end of the period (survey months 4 and 16;\ninterview months 4 and 8). The vast majority (over 89 percent) of wage earners are full-time\nemployed at both the beginning and the end of our individual sample frame. About 40 percent of\nworkers in our sample are full-time employed in the same job; about 49 percent are full-time\nemployed but in different jobs in the first and second periods. Of the remaining wage earners, 2.7\npercent of full-time employed at the beginning of the year end up unemployed at the end of it.\nConversely, 2.6 percent of those full-time employed at the end of the year were unemployed at the\nbeginning. There are slightly larger numbers of workers moving in and out of the labor market and\ninto or out of part-time or self-employment to or from full-time employment.\nEarnings levels of subgroups\nThe fact that continuously full-time employed workers account for, on average, about 90 percent\nof all wage earners suggests that they are likely to drive most of the movements in aggregate wages.\nIn our nomenclature this would suggest that aggregate real wage fluctuations are largely determined\nby the wage growth effect. However, as previous researchers have noted, during periods of labor\nmarket upheaval, such as recessions and recoveries, those exiting from (entering into) full-time\nemployment might also influence movements in aggregate wages, even though on average they\nmake up only a small share of overall wage earners. To show the potential of this type of effect we\nexamine from where in the wage distribution flows into and out of full-time employment are\n8\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\ntypically drawn. Specifically, we consider the share of each of our five labor market status groups\nthat comes from below the median wage computed across all workers. The results are reported in\nTable 3.\nLooking first at the margin most commonly associated with the composition effect (transitions\ninto and out of unemployment), the data show that on average about 64.0 percent of full-time\nworkers who become unemployed were making less than median earnings before entering\nunemployment (Row 4, Column I). An even larger fraction (72.8 percent) of those making the\nreverse transition, from unemployment to full-time employment, make below median earnings\n(Row 4, Column II). The difference between the 64.0 and 72.8 percent in part reflects that the\ndisplacement penalty associated with unemployment spells, documented by Farber (1997, 2005).\nRow 4 of Table 3 shows that, on average, the incidence of unemployment occurs\ndisproportionately below median earnings. As a result, if unemployment goes up, workers making\nbelow median earnings lose their jobs in greater numbers than other workers. Holding wages of\nother workers constant, this change in the composition of the workforce serves to increase median\naggregate wages. This is one example of the composition effect.\nThe part-time and self-employed (Row 3 of Table 3) as well as those who move into and out of\nthe labor force (Row 5) contribute to the composition effect in a similar way. Most of their flows\ninto and out of full-time employment occur below the median. Thus, when exits from full-time\nemployment to part-time employment or self-employment and not-in-the-labor-force increase,\nmedian aggregate wages tend to rise. Finally, it is worth noting that since wages for those in the\nsame job and NISJ (Rows 1 and 2) tend to grow over time, fewer of them earn below the median at\nthe end of the period than at the beginning.\nThese results illustrate the potential for both wage growth and composition effects to matter for\naggregate real wage growth. To accurately quantify the importance of these effects and track their\nrelative contributions over time we need a more formal accounting strategy that allows for a flexible\ndecomposition of aggregate wage movements into component parts. We turn to this in the next\nsection.\n9\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\n3. Wage Growth and Composition Effects: Percentile decomposition\nDecompositions of movements in economic aggregates are commonly used to quantify the various\ninfluences on these aggregates. The most common type of decomposition is a shift-share analysis\nwhich can be easily applied when the aggregate being examined is a mean.19 We, however, are\ninterested in decomposing the growth rate (log change) of the median of the wage distribution; as\nsuch, we cannot apply a conventional type of shift-share analysis. As an alternative, we introduce a\npercentile decomposition that functions like a conventional shift-share analysis but works with\ndistribution functions rather than means.\nOur percentile decomposition is similar in spirit to the one introduced by DiNardo, Fortin, and\nLemieux (1996). Our method differs in that it does not require the calculation of counterfactual\npercentiles. Instead, it relies on the application of the mean-value theorem to translate shifts in the\ndistribution function into shifts in percentiles. This difference makes our method more directly\ncomparable to a conventional shift-share analysis as well as somewhat easier to implement than\nDiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996). The difference between the two methodologies is explained\nin detail in Appendix B.\nWe introduce our decomposition in three steps. First, we illustrate how changes in percentiles\nare related to shifts in the underlying distribution function. Second, we show that changes in the\ndistribution function can be decomposed into separate parts which in our case map to the\ncomposition and wage growth effects we are interested in. We conclude the section with a\ndiscussion of how we implement the decomposition to track the dynamics of MWE growth.\nRelating changes in percentiles to changes in distribution functions\nTo understand how our percentile decomposition follows and differs from the traditional shift-\nshare analysis it is useful to refer to Figure 4. The figure plots two log-earnings distribution\nfunctions, ( ) and ( ). The -th percentiles associated with these two distribution functions\nare given by and respectively. To illustrate the relationship between changes in percentiles\nand changes in the underlying distribution functions we assume, without loss of generality, that\n19 See Juhn and Potter (2006) for an example related to the labor force participation rate and Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and\nScarpetta (2004) for an application to labor productivity growth.\n10\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nthere is positive growth in the percentile over the period and that . These percentiles\nsatisfy\n( ) ( ). (1)\nOur decomposition works as follows. We apply a shift-share type decomposition to the changes in\nthe distribution functions. That is we decompose ( ) ( ) and ( ) ( ) into\ncontributions by the different groups we identify. We then apply the mean value theorem to\ntranslate these contributions, measured along the vertical axis in Figure 4, into changes in earnings\nalong the horizontal axis, i.e. . This is what yields the decomposition of the change in the\npercentile of log earnings.\nAs we show in Appendix B, rearranging (1) allows us to write\n. ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/. (2)\nThis result implies that the sum of the changes in each of the distribution functions evaluated\nbetween and equals the sum of the difference in the value of the distribution functions in\nand . In the figure, the vertical lines I and II correspond to the left-hand side terms of (2) while\nthe lines A and B correspond to the right-hand side terms.\nThe left-hand side terms in the above equation can be translated into changes in the percentile\nby the application of the mean value theorem. If the distribution functions ( ) and ( ) are\ncontinuously differentiable, then there exists a , such that , and\n. ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ , ( ) ( )-( ). (3)\nThis allows us to express the change in the percentile from the beginning to the end of the period,\n( ), in terms of shifts in the distribution function from ( ) to ( ). In particular, we\ncan write\n( ) {. ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/}. (4)\n( ) ( )\nThis generalizes to the case in which the population from which is drawn is made up of various\nsubgroups. In that case we can apply a shift-share type decomposition to the right-hand side of the\nabove equation.\n11\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nDecomposing changes in distribution functions by subgroup\nEquation (1) can be rewritten in terms of conditional distribution functions as\n∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | ) . (5)\nAs we derive in detail in Appendix B, this can be rearranged to obtain a generalization of equation\n(2) of the form\n∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} ∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )}\n∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} ∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} (6)\n∫,{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }-* ( ) ( )+\nSimilar to equation (2), the left-hand side of the above equation is expressed in terms of the changes\nin each of the conditional distribution functions evaluated between and . The first two terms\non the right-hand side of (6) are similar those on the right-hand side of (2) in that they reflect\nchanges in the distribution functions at and . The final term on the right-hand side captures\nthe effect of the changes in the shares of the different sub-groups.\nJust like in the example in the previous subsection, we can use the mean value theorem to\ntranslate the left-hand side into changes in the percentile. That is, there exists a , such that\n, and\n∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} ∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )}\n(7)\n[∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | ) ]( ) ( )\nThis then allows us to express the change in the percentile, ( ), as\n( ) {∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} ∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} }\n(8)\n{∫[{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }]* ( ) ( )+ }\nThus, we are able to decompose the change in the percentile in terms of (i) a part that is due to shifts\nin the distribution functions for each of the subgroups that make up the population and (ii) a part\ndue to the changes in the shares of these subgroups in the population.\n12\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nHowever, these shifts and shares parts do not directly correspond to the composition and wage\ngrowth effects that are the focus of our analysis. Extracting these two effects requires an additional\nreshuffling of the right-hand side terms of (8). In order to disentangle the composition effect from\nthe wage growth effect, we have to divide the population of wage earners into three types of\nsubgroups. The first type consists of those who earn a wage both at the beginning and end of the\nperiod. They are subgroups that are part of . The two subgroups in this set are those who are in\nthe same job and who are NISJ. The second type consists of individuals who are full-time wage and\nsalary workers at the beginning of the year and who flow out of these jobs and become either part-\ntime or self employed, unemployed, or drop out of the labor force. These groups are exiters from\nfull-time employment, denoted by the set . . The final type consists of those who flow into full-\ntime wage and salary jobs and were either part-time or self employed, unemployed, or not in the\nlabor force at the beginning of the period. These groups of entrants into full-time jobs are part of\n. By explicitly defining who enters and exits the group of full-time wage earners we are able to\nrewrite (8) as\n( ) {∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} ∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} }\n{∫ ( )[{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }] }\n(9)\n{∫ ( )[{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }] }\n{∫ [{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }]* ( ) ( )+ }\nThe right-hand side of (9) consists of four terms. The first term captures the effect of the shift in the\nearnings distribution for those who are full-time employed both at the beginning and at the end of\nthe period on the change in the percentile. The first part of this term quantifies how much the\npercentile would have changed if the distribution of the population over different groups in\nremained fixed at the one that prevailed at the beginning of the period, i.e. at ( ). The second part\ncaptures the same effect, but instead holding the distribution constant at the one observed at the end\nof the period, ( ). Putting the two parts together, the first term on the right-hand side quantifies\nhow much the percentile changed because of the wage growth of the individuals who were observed\nworking in both periods. This is the wage growth effect. If, for all groups in , ( | )\n13\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\n( | ) as well as ( | ) ( | ), then, just like in Figure 4, there has been a rightward shift\nin the distribution of weekly earnings of those employed at both the beginning and end of the period\nand this contributes positively to the change in the percentile of weekly earnings. In that case, the\nwage growth effect would be positive.\nThe second term on the right-hand side of (9) measures the effect of flows out of full-time\nemployment on the change in the percentile. Two things contribute to this effect. The first is what\nfraction of full-time wage and salary workers who flow out of full-time employment, measured by\n( ) for . The second is where in the earnings distribution these exiters were before leaving\ntheir jobs. If a disproportionate share of exiters come from below the examined percentile, such\nthat ( | ) and ( | ) , their exit will cause the percentile to rise. This is the exit\ncomponent of the composition effect.\nThe third term on the right-hand side of (9) measures the effect of flows into full-time\nemployment on the change in the percentile. As for the second term, two things contribute to this\neffect. The first is the fraction of full-time wage and salary workers at the end of the period who are\nnewly employed, measured by ( ) for . The second is where in the earnings distribution the\nnewly employed locate. Similar to the exit term, if a disproportionate share of newly employed\nworkers locate below the examined percentile, such that ( | ) and ( | ) , the\npercentile itself declines. This is the entry component of the composition effect.\nAs for the last term, if there is more exit than entry, then there is no full replacement of\noutflows. As a result, the share of those in is higher at the end of the period than at the beginning\nof the period. For example, if those in are disproportionately making more than a given\npercentile, such that ( | ) and ( | ) for , then the shortfall of replacement of\noutflows leads to an increase in the percentile since the shortfall is effectively replaced by stayers\nwhose earnings are relatively high. This mechanism is captured by the fourth term, which we call\nthe replacement component of the composition effect.\nIn sum, our decomposition yields exit and entry components for the composition effect for those\nwho move along (i) the part-time and self-employment margin, (ii) the unemployment margin, and\n(iii) the participation margin. It yields a wage growth effect as well as a replacement component for\nthe composition effect for those (iv) persons who remained in the same job, and (v) persons who\nchanged jobs (NISJ).\n14\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nOne final detail is worth noting. Since we do not observe the actual distribution and density\nfunctions needed to construct the right-hand side of equation (9), we estimate them. The estimation\nprocedure we use is consistent with the one used to construct Median Usual Weekly Earnings, as\npublished by the BLS. The BLS rounds the weekly earnings values reported by individuals to the\nnearest multiple of 50.20 It then linearly interpolates the distribution function over the interval in\nwhich the percentile boundary lies, implicitly assuming that the earnings of those who report in the\ninterval that gets rounded to a particular multiple of 50 are uniformly distributed over that interval.\nTo be consistent with this methodology we estimate the distribution and density functions, , , ,\nand , in (9) the same way. That is, we group all earnings observations on the nearest multiple of\nfifty and assume that earnings are uniformly distributed over the intervals that get rounded to each\nof these points.\nThis introduces one problem for our percentile decomposition framework. This way of\nestimating the distribution functions implies that they are not continuously differentiable and, as a\nresult, the mean value theorem that we applied to derive (9) is not applicable. However, we can still\nuse the percentile decomposition. We replace ( | ) and ( | ) by\n( | )\n( | ) ( | )\n, and ( | )\n( | ) ( | )\n. (10)\nIn that case (9) still holds and we can thus decompose changes in earnings percentiles.21 This\nmethod is applicable to any percentile of the earnings distribution. Since we focus in particular on\nthe median in the rest of our analysis, we drop the subscript when we present the results.\n4. Results\nIn the remainder of the paper we present the results of our decomposition of the log changes in\nthe median weekly earnings from the CPS from 1980 through 2011. The results are organized as\nfollows. We begin by reviewing the time series movements of each of the components that go into\n20 According to the BLS: “The estimation procedure places each reported or calculated weekly earnings value into $50-wide\nintervals which are centered around multiples of $50. The actual value is estimated through the linear interpolation of the interval\nin which the quantile boundary lies.” (BLS, 2011)\n21 This estimation method works if . If then we use the value of the density implied by the assumption that\nearnings are uniformly distributed over the intervals that are rounded to the same multiple of 50. The case where\nfor and in which this does not work because of the kinked distribution function does not occur in our data.\n15\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nour analysis. We then describe the key results. First, we consider in detail the composition effect of\nunemployment, since this is the margin most commonly focused on in macroeconomic models that\naim to match the limited variation and cyclicality of aggregate real wages (Gertler and Trigari,\n2009, for example). We then show how other groups contribute to the composition effect. Having\nshown when and by how much the composition effect influences aggregate wages we turn to\nexplaining the wage growth effect, paying particular attention to the role of job switchers. We\nconclude our results section with an adding up of all the effects and discuss both the average\ncontributions of the composition and wage growth effects and how their respective contributions\nchange over the business cycle.\nShare and shift components of the decomposition\nTo begin, recall from the derivation above that what matters for our decomposition of the log\nchange in median earnings are the shares of each subgroup and the (changes) in their earnings\ndistributions. These are the two things displayed in Figures 5 and 6 along with references to the\nelements of the decomposition in equation (9). Figure 5 shows the time series plots of the shares of\nthe full-time employed made up by each subgroup in the sample, namely same job (SJ), not in the\nsame job (NISJ), part-time/self-employed (PT), unemployed (U), and not in the labor force (NILF).\nPanel (a) of the figure shows the share of those classified as “same job” and NISJ as a fraction\nof the full-time employed. 22 Taking into account that the data are normalized at the end of the year\nand that the figure plots the 4-quarter moving average, panel (a) suggests that NISJ transitions are\nprocyclical—they go up when the labor market is strong and then decline during labor market\ndownturns. In Appendix A we describe our imputation results of the composition of NISJ over the\nbusiness cycle. These results suggest that about two-thirds of those classified as NISJ are job-to-job\nswitchers and that they account for this procyclicality of the NISJ share over the business cycle,\nshown in panel (a) of Figure 5. This is consistent with the view that when the labor market is strong\nworkers quit more frequently and leave for higher paid jobs (Akerlof, Rose, and Yellen 1988) and\nwhen the labor market is weak, layoffs increase and a higher number of persons lose their full-time\njob, go through unemployment, and end up in a different full-time job a year later.23\n22 The sudden shift in 1983 is a data anomaly due to the change in occupation codes in the CPS. In particular after 1983 these codes\nwere more detailed, allowing us to be more precise about our “same job” versus “not-in-the-same-job” imputation.\n23 This contrasts somewhat with Hall (2005) who argues that the behavior of quits and layoffs offset such that overall separations are\nbarely cyclical. Our findings suggest that these opposing forces do not cancel out to the same extent for the sample of those\n16\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nThe remaining panels of the figure (panels b-d) plot the time series of entry into and exits out of\nfull-time employment by our three other labor market groups: unemployed, part-time/self\nemployed, and not in the labor force. The first thing to notice is that consistent with Table 2, exiters\nand enterers account for a small share of the total full-time employed. On average, flows into and\nout of unemployment are smaller than those along the part-time and self-employment margin as\nwell as the labor force margin. However, as expected, flows into unemployment (exits from full-\ntime employment into unemployment, panel b) are much more cyclical than those to part-time and\nself employment or out of the labor force (panels c and d). One notable deviation from this general\npattern occurred in 2007, when flows from full-time to part-time employment spiked, leading to\nabout 6 percent of the labor force being part-time employed for economic reasons during 2009 and\n2010. The last time that this rate was so high was in October 1982. What seems to be different\nabout the run-up of the rate of part-time employment in the 2007 recession compared to that in 1982\nis that it consisted more of persons whose full-time status changed to part-time, rather than the\nunemployed and labor force entrants being unable to find full-time employment.24 Exits from full-\ntime employment to NILF vary little with the business cycle and are mostly determined by\ndemographic factors and retirement norms. Entry into full-time employment from NILF is, not\nsurprisingly, slightly more procyclical.\nIn Figure 6 we plot the shifts in the earnings distributions for each of our subgroups. Since we\nare interested in log changes in median earnings these plots show the shares of our five worker\ngroups moving around the overall median. Specifically, Panel (a) of the figure plots the fraction of\nfull-time employed, classified as either “same job” or NISJ, that moves from below median weekly\nearnings to above it. In terms of our notation, it is calculated as\n( ( | ) ( | )) ( ( | ) ( | )) * +. (11)\nAs can be seen from the panel, during strong labor markets a larger share of job-switchers than job-\nstayers break through the median. In downturns and recoveries, this pattern is reversed and a larger\nfraction of those in the same job break through the median. These findings are consistent with the\ntransitioning from full-time to full-time employment; for these movements the cyclicality of quits seems to dominate. The result is\nthat NISJ transitions in our full-time employed sample are procyclical.\n24 This finding is consistent with changes in UI rules in several states that allowed individuals to claim benefits when reducing hours\nof work as well as when losing jobs.\n17\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nprevious discussion that highlighted the importance of quits in NISJ during expansions versus\nlayoffs in contractions.\nPanels (b-d) of Figure 6 show where in the earnings distribution exit and entry for different\nsubgroups occurs. In terms of our notation, these are calculated as\n( ( | ) ( | )) and ( ( | ) ( | )) for * + (12)\nfor exiters from and entrants into full employment respectively. The first thing to note from each of\nthese panels is that the vast majority of those who enter full-time employment from any of these\nstates earn less than MWE. This can also be seen in Table 3, rows 3-5. Surprisingly, entry into and\nexit from unemployment takes place at a higher part of the income distribution than do movements\nfrom and to part-time and self-employment and not-in-the-labor-force. This is evident in from the\nfact that a lower fraction of entries into and exits from full-time employment come from below\nmedian earnings for unemployment than for the other two groups.\nTurning to the dynamics of the earnings of these flows, panel (b) shows that there is\nconsiderable cyclicality in the composition of those exiting (entering) full-time employment into\n(from) unemployment. During recessions, the fraction of workers moving from full-time\nemployment to unemployment (exits), from below MWE, falls. This is consistent with\nMueller (2010) who finds that during recessions the incidence of unemployment among high-\nincome earners increases. This pattern is reversed in expansions, when the share of workers exiting\nfull-time employment to unemployment with earnings below MWE rises. A similar pattern is\nobserved for entries into full-time employment from unemployment but with a lag; the fraction\nmaking this transition from below MWE falls during recessions and rises during expansions. This\nlargely reflects that those high-income earners who end up unemployed during a recession generally\nalso find relatively higher paid full-time jobs when they exit unemployment.\nRelative to the unemployment subgroup, there is very little cyclicality in the position in the\nearnings distribution of those who flow into NILF or part-time and self-employment originate. The\nmain pattern in both series is that the gaps between the entries to and exits (from) full-time\nemployment narrow over time, suggesting that in the decomposition most of the cyclical variation\nin the contributions from the part-time and self-employment and NILF margins will come through\ntheir shares rather than shifts in the earnings distributions.\n18\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nDecomposition of median weekly earnings growth by subgroup\nTo see how the individual patterns displayed in Figures 5 and 6 combine to produce changes in\naggregate real earnings growth in the U.S., we turn to our decomposition. Specifically, we use\nequation (9) to decompose the log-change of median weekly earnings into the wage growth effect\nand the composition effect. The results are displayed in Figure 7. Panel (a) plots the composition\neffect which is the replacement components for the “same job” and NISJ subgroups and the net\ncontribution of the entry and exit components for the other subgroups. Panel (b) plots the wage\ngrowth effect for those in the same job and NISJ.\nGiven the number of moving parts underlying the decomposition we begin with a detailed\ndescription of how the components displayed in Figures 5 and 6 produce the net composition effect\nfor the unemployment margin shown in panel (a) of Figure 7 and for the NISJ wage growth effect\nshown in panel (b) of the same figure. These also are the two margins of adjustment commonly\nthought to explain the bulk of the patterns in aggregate real wage growth.\nComposition effect\nIn equation (9), up to the scaling factor, ⁄ , the net composition effect of the unemployment\nmargin is given by\n( )*( ( | ) ) ( ( | ) )+ ( )*( ( | ) ) ( ( | ) )+. (13)\nHere, ( ) is the share of full-time employed at the beginning of the year who are unemployed at\nthe end of the year and ( ) is the share of full-time employed at the end of the year who were\nunemployed at the start. Both of these shares are plotted in panel (b) of Figure 5. ( | ) and\n( | ) reflect the share of those moving from full-time employment to unemployment who made\nless than the median wage, measured either at the end and the beginning of the year respectively.\n( | ) measures the same share, but for those entering full-time employment from unemployment.\nRecall from panel (b) of Figure 6 that unemployed workers pay a displacement penalty such that\n( | ) ( | ) and ( | ) ( | ). In terms of equation (13), this implies that when\n( ) ( )—exit to and entry from unemployment are roughly equal—the composition effect of\nunemployment pulls down median wage growth since the distribution of earnings for those\ntransitioning from full-time employment to unemployment is higher than for those transitioning\nfrom unemployment to full-time employment. Looking at the line for the unemployment margin in\n19\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nFigure 7 (panel a), this is exactly what happens on average; the unemployment margin reduces\naggregate wage growth. In general then, the composition effect of the unemployed is negative.\nTwo things cause this, on average, negative effect to fluctuate over the business cycle. The first\nis when ( ) moves relative to ( ) For example, as can be seen from panel (b) of Figure 5, in\neconomic downturns ( ) goes up and ( ) goes down so that unemployment increases. These\ncyclical fluctuations make the composition effect of unemployment less negative during recession\nthan during expansions, causing it to move countercyclically.\nThe second is when the difference between ( | ) and ( | ) rises or falls. This happens\nwhen the magnitude of the displacement penalty changes. As can be can be seen from the difference\nbetween the dashed and solid lines in panel (b) of Figure 6, in economic downturns the\ndisplacement penalty rises as the incidence of unemployment moves up the earnings distribution\nand reemployed workers take a bigger wage cut. This partially counteracts the countercyclicality of\nthe composition effect of unemployment induced by the movements of ( ) and ( )\nTurning to the other subgroups displayed in panel (a) of Figure 7, all of them contribute to the\ncountercyclicality of the composition effect. Though small, even the replacement components turn\nout to move countercyclically. In terms of contributions to the composition effect, the part-time and\nself employment margin contributes more to the composition effect for median weekly earnings\ngrowth and cyclicality than the unemployment margin. The magnitude of the part-time and self\nemployment effect relative to other margins owes to the fact that a larger fraction of flows into and\nout of part-time and self-employment occur below MWE (Figure 6, panel (c)). In contrast to the\nunemployment margin, the part-time and self-employment effect does not have offsetting\ncomponents. In business cycle downturns, the share of exits from full-time to part-time rises and\nthere is little change in the earnings difference between entrants to and exits from full-time\nemployment from (to) part-time employment. In line with the shares presented in panel (c) of\nFigure 5, the importance of the part-time and self-employed for the composition effect increased\nsignificantly during the 2007 recession.\nWage growth effect\nThe wage growth effects are displayed in Panel (b) of Figure 7; the figure shows the wage\ngrowth effect for both the same job and NISJ subgroups. We describe the calculation for the NISJ\ngroup, but an analogous strategy applies to the SJ group.\n20\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nThe wage growth effect for NISJ is obtained by combining the information in panel (a) of\nFigures 5 and 6 in the context of equation (9), ignoring the scaling coefficient, to obtain\n( )* ( | ) ( | )+ ( )* ( | ) ( | )+. (14)\nIn particular, the terms in (14) are the share of full-time employed who are NISJ, ( ( )\n( )), from Figure 5 and the movements in the earnings distribution of NISJ at the median from\nFigure 6, * ( | ) ( | )+ * ( | ) ( | )+. The net effect of\ncombining these terms is given by the NISJ line in Panel (b) of Figure 7.\nThe results reveal that those who change jobs over the year contribute more to the wage growth\neffect than those who remain in the same job. This owes to the fact that the NISJ share of full-time\nemployed is larger while on average the earnings changes of NISJ and same job are similar. When\nlabor markets are tight, the NISJ effect is amplified by an increase in the share and an increase in\nthe fraction moving from below to above the MWE. In labor market downturns the wage growth\neffect of NISJ and same job groups converge as both the share of NISJ falls and their earnings gains\nrelative to the same job group subside. In general, during labor market expansions the strong\nperformance in terms of wages of those who are in the “same job” and NISJ (displayed in Figure 6)\nis accentuated by an increase in their share as shown in Figure 5. The result is that the wage growth\neffect shows large procyclical fluctuations, driven primarily by job-changers, most of whom switch\njob-to-job.\nPutting all the effects together\nOur decomposition allows us to express the time series of 12-month log change of real MWE,\n( ), as the sum of the seven components shown in Figure 7. We index these components by\n, where , such that we can write\n( ) ∑ . (15)\nFor each of the individual components, , we discussed the magnitude and cyclicality of their\nfluctuations. The fact that the individual components add up to the aggregate time series that we\nstudy allows us to assess how important they are, on average, over our sample period 1980-2011,\nfor the variance and cyclicality of real MWE growth.\n21\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nTo measure the contribution of each of the components to the variance of real wage growth, we\napply a simple variance decomposition. The additive relationship in equation (15) allows us to\nwrite the variance of aggregate real wage growth as the sum of the covariances between each of the\nindividual components, , and the aggregate, ( ). Column I of Table 4 lists the share of each\nof the components in the variance of real wage growth. Rows 2 through 6 of the table show that\neach of the composition effects only account for a small share of the variance of real wage\nfluctuations. In total, the composition effect accounts for 8.8 percent of the variance of real MWE\ngrowth (row 7, column I). The other 91.2 percent is due to the wage growth effect. In fact, wage\nchanges of those who are NISJ alone account for more than half of the fluctuations in real wage\ngrowth over the past three decades (row 9, column I).\nAs for the cyclicality of real wage growth, we measure it by the coefficient, , from a regression\nof real wage growth on the level of the unemployment rate, . Both real wage growth as well as\nthe unemployment rate are measured in percentage points in this regression. The particular\nregression equation is\n( ) . (16)\nThe coefficient is reported in row 1 of column II of Table 3 and equals -0.112 and is not\nsignificant. This indicates that over the past 30 years real wage growth has only been mildly\nprocyclical. Real wage growth has tended to be high when the unemployment rate was low and\nvice versa. However, this relationship has not been particularly strong, leading to the statistical\ninsignificance of the coefficient.\nBy construction, the cyclicality coefficient, , is the sum of seven component-specific\ncyclicality coefficients, for , obtained using regressions of the form\n. (17)\nThese component-specific coefficients are listed in rows 2 through 10 of column II of Table 4. As\ncan be seen from the table, on the one hand, each of the composition effects, except that for\nunemployment, is significantly countercyclical. On the other, each of the wage growth effects is\nsignificantly procyclical. Though the wage growth effect is more important than the composition\neffect for the cyclicality of real wage growth, half of its movements over the business cycle are\nundone by the composition of entries into and exits out of full-time employment. This is what\n22\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nmakes the aggregate cyclicality coefficient negative, just like that associated with the wage growth\neffect, but statistically insignifant.\nTable 4 quantifies the average importance of the composition and wage growth effects for the\nvariance and cyclicality of real MWE growth over the past 30 years. It hides, however, that the\nrelative importance of these effects varies over the business cycle and differs across recessions and\nexpansions. This variation can be seen in Figure 8 which plots the time series of the contributions\nof the wage growth and composition effects to real wage growth.\nThe first thing that stands out from the figure is that the wage growth effect was especially\nimportant during the strong labor markets of the mid 1980‟s and the second half of the 1990‟s. It‟s\nimpact on real wages was much more subdued during the 2000‟s. Moreover, the second thing that\nFigure 8 reveals is that during the first three of the four recessions in our sample, the offsetting\ncountercyclicality of the composition effect was not particularly large. However, during the 2007\nrecession the composition effect turned from negative to positive, something previously unseen in\nthe data. This large increase in the composition effect means that real wage growth in 2008 and\n2009 was greatly affected by changes in the composition of the workforce. In terms of the\nimportance of the composition effect for growth in median usual weekly earnings the 2007\nrecession is an outlier compared to the three recessions before.\n5. Conclusion\nUsing data from the Current Population Survey from 1980 through 2011 we examined what drives\nthe variation and cyclicality in the growth rate of real wages over time. To do this we employed a\nnovel decomposition technique that allows us to divide changes in percentiles of aggregate usual\nweekly earnings growth into the part associated with the wage growth of persons employed at the\nbeginning and end of the period (the wage growth effect) and the part associated with changes in the\ncomposition of earners (the composition effect).\nOur results show that the relative importance of these two effects varies widely over the\nbusiness cycle. When the labor market is tight, job-changers get high wage changes, making them\naccount for about half of the variation in median weekly earnings growth over our sample. Their\nwage growth as well as that of job stayers is procylical. During labor market downturns this\n23\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nprocylicality is partly offset by the change in the composition of the workforce. As a result,\naggregate wages exhibit only limited cyclicality. Surprisingly, the composition effect works\nprimarily through the part-time employment margin. Remarkably, the unemployment margin\nneither accounts for much of the variation nor much of the cyclicality of median weekly earnings.\nOur conclusion that job switchers are more important for understanding real wage growth than\nflows in and out of unemployment has an important implication for studies that try to reconcile real\nwage cyclicality in macroeconomic models with search frictions. Such studies often, for simplicity,\nassume that the separation rate from employment is exogenously given. However, our results\nsuggest that such an assumption would mean discarding the cyclical fluctuations in the composition\nof these separations that drive the bulk of U.S. wage growth.25 This suggests that, in order to\nunderstand the magnitude of variations in real wage growth, one has to explain the reasons why\npeople switch jobs, especially job-to-job switches, and how this affects their wages.\nReferences\nAbraham, Katharine G., and John C.

Data and Variable Details\nMatching individuals across CPS interviews in different months\nWe use the matching criteria employed by Madrian and Lefgren (1999) for matching the outgoing\nrotations and Moscarini and Thomsson (2008) for matching month-to-month transitions. Our\nmatching procedures are similar to Fallick and Fleischman (2004) and Card and Hyslop (1997). 26\nSpecifically, individuals in our sample must match on age (+3 or -1 between subsequent\ninterviews), race, household ID, and line number.27 Our procedure produces match rates that are\nidentical are quite similar to previous researchers.\nOne thing to note is that our match procedure could introduce some bias into our results due to\ngeographic mobility. Our results are conditional on staying within the same household, and people\nwithin the unemployment, NILF, and NISJ margin are more likely to move. However,\nNekarda (2009) shows that the effect of geographic mobility on aggregate CPS measures such as\nthe job finding rate and the separation rate is small. Nekarda (2009) also incorporates a match\nsimilar to ours, which allows for households to non-report or misreport in months between valid\nmatches.\nConstructing the same-job variable\nVarious researchers have used strategies to identify when individuals switch jobs in the CPS. Card\nand Hyslop (1997) compare 2-digit industry and occupation codes between IM4 and IM828. In\n1994, new variables were introduced to the CPS to help identify month-to-month changes in\nemployment. Fallick and Fleishmann (2004) and Nagypál (2008) use one of these variables—\nwhether an individual still works for the same employer as last month, providing the employer‟s\nname. Both of these studies look at month-to-month transitions. This is also touched on in\nMoscarini and Thomsson (2008)‟s study of occupational mobility. Our “Same Job” definition can\n26 Fallick and Fleischman (2004) require age to be decreased by no more than one year or increased by no more than two years. Card\nand Hyslop (1997) use age plus or minus one year.\n27 Within 1994 and 1995, HHID‟s are only consistent within state, so we add a state constraint within those years. For 2003-2004 we\ndon‟t use the HRSAMPLE and HRSERSUF variables, since they seem to be randomized, and HHID coupled with the demographic\nvariables successfully matches individuals.\n28 From their appendix: “The industry and occupation are matched using detailed (2-digit) industry and occupation codes for all years\nexcept 1982-83, 1983-84, and 1988-89. Matching for the 1983-84 sample is based on 3-digit 1980 census codes; for the 1982-83\nsample, industry is matched using the detailed (2-digit) codes which are comparable across years, while occupation was matched\nusing an algorithm devised to convert 1970 census 3-digit5 occupation codes to their 1980 census counterparts; and for the 1988-\n89 sample, occupation was matched using the detailed codes, and an algorithm was devised to match the detailed industry codes.”\n28\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nbe considered a combination of the month-month SJ calculation of Fallick and Fleischman (2004),\nNagypál (2008) and the year-to-year SJ calculation of Card and Hyslop (1997). We want to use all\navailable information on a matched individual, but we are also constrained by missing data between\nIM4 and IM5.\nOur procedure then is as follows. After 1994, we define a job stayer as an individual observed\nas employed in IMs 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, with the same detailed industry and occupation in each of these\nmonths, and who reports being with the same employer and reports the same job description and job\nduties, or who has missing values for these dependent-coding variables in MIS 6, 7, and 8. Nagypál\n(2008) and Fallick and Fleischman (2004) only use the “same employer” variable, so including\nthese three variables enables a wider definition of job re-negotiation. Prior to 1994, we do not have\nthe dependent coding variables, and industry and occupation data is reported anew each month.\nThus, to get a “same job” measure, we match industry and occupation between IMs 4 and 8, and at\nleast 2 out of the 3 months in IMs 5, 6, and 7, keeping the constraint of employment throughout IMs\n4-8. This gives us a reasonably consistent same job rate across the 1994 boundary, and a slightly\nmore restrictive test than Card and Hyslop (1997), who only constrained industry, occupation, and\nlabor status in IM 4 and IM 8. Our “Same Job” rates are consistent with other estimates in the\nliterature.\nNot-in-the-same-job (NISJ) versus job-to-job (J2J) transitions\nFollowing Fallick and Fleischman (2004) and Nagypál (2008) we consider a job-to-job transition as\none in which a CPS respondent reports to be employed in a particular job in one month and another\njob in the next month. Unfortunately, this definition does not account for the possibility of such a\nworker having moved through a short spell of unemployment or part-time or self employment\nduring the month in between the two responses. Since identifying the fraction of the NISJ\nindividuals who moved directly from one full-time job to another, i.e. job-to-job (J2J) transitions is\nimportant for our study, we impute the fraction of NISJ transitions that are J2J.\nOur imputation method relies heavily on the gross worker flows measurement methodologies\nused in Shimer (2005) and Fujita and Ramey (2009). Given the CPS survey structure (see Table 1)\nindividuals we classify as NISJ consist of four groups: (i) Those who have missing data for IM5,\nIM6, or IM7 (ii) employed in IM4 and employed in another job in MIS8 but either unemployed, not\nin the labor force, or part-time or self employed in IM5, IM6, or IM7, (ii) not in (i) and (ii) and\n29\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nemployed in IM4 in the same job in IM5 and in a different job at IM8, (iii) not in (i) and (ii) and\nemployed in IM4 and in a different job in IM5.\nThose in (ii) are not part of J2J transitions. These are individuals who have not been employed\nfor the whole 12-month period between the two levels of earnings they report. For our imputation,\nwe ignore temporary layoffs and assume that everyone who reports to have the same job as 8\nmonths earlier has remained in that job over the intervening period. Hence, we classify those in (iii)\nas part of J2J transitions.\nThe imputation is made complicated by those in (iv) and (i). We discuss the imputation for those\nin (iv) first. Some of the individuals in that group who changed jobs between IM4 and IM5 actually\nwent through unemployment, dropped out of the labor force, or were part-time of self employed.\nHowever, these episodes are not observed because they occurred during the eight months when the\nindividuals were not part of the CPS sample. Hence, we have to impute what share of those in group\n(iii) did not experience any episodes of unemployment, part-time employment, or self employment\nand did not drop out of the labor force.\nWe impute this share by assuming that labor market status transitions follow a first-order\nMarkov process.29 We denote the different labor market statuses as: (i) full-time employed in the\nsame job as at the beginning of the period, (ii) full-time employed in a different job as at the end\nof the period, (iii) unemployed, (iv) not in the labor force, and (v) part-time or self\nemployed. The arrow → denotes the transition during the 9 months between IM4 and IM5.\nThe first-order Markov assumption allows us to write transition probabilities over multiple\nmonths in terms of monthly transition probabilities. We define these monthly transition probabilities\nin month as\n( ), where * +. (18)\nHere ( ) is the fraction of persons with labor market status at the beginning of the period that\nend up in at the end of the period.\nAs we discussed above, we assume that persons who are in the same job in IM5 as in IM4 have\nbeen continuously employed in that job. This implies that\n29 This assumption means that, due to data-limitations, we do not account for duration dependence of unemployment outflow rates, or\ntenure duration dependence of worker separation rates. Consequently, our imputations should only be interpreted as indicative of\ncyclical fluctuations of the composition of the NISJ group in our sample rather than a precise estimate.\n30\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\n( ) , for * +. (19)\nNote that ( ) is the probability of remaining full-time employed in the same job during the\nmonth and ( ) is the probability of a job-to-job transition.30\nWe construct the Markov transition matrix that is associated with these probabilities based on\nmonthly matched CPS data, similar to Shimer (2007), Fujita and Ramey (2009), and Elsby, Hobijn,\nand Şahin (2010).\nThe share we are imputing is the ratio of two probabilities. The numerator is the probability that\nan individual reports to have changed jobs in IM5 relative to nine months before in IM4 and has not\nflown through , , or . This probability can be written as\n[ → ] ∏ { ( ) ( )} ∏ ( ). (20)\nThe denominator is much harder to impute. It is the probability that an individual reports to have\nchanged jobs in IM5 relative to eight nine months before in IM4 irrespective of what she or he did\nin the meanwhile. It is\n[\n→\n] , -(∏ ( )), - . (21)\nHere, the Markov transition matrix ( ) is given by\n( )\n( ) . ( ) ( )/ ( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) . (22)\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n[ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )]\nThus, only a fraction\n[ → ]⁄ [ → ] (23)\nof those in the third group of individuals classified as NISJ will be imputed as having gone directly\nfrom job to job rather than flowing through unemployment, part-time or self employment, or\ntemporarily leaving the labor force.\n30 This job-to-job transition is slightly different from that reported in Fallick and Fleischman (2004) and Nagypál (2008) because it is\nconditional on full-time employment.\n31\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nAs for those in group (i) we can do the same as for those in (iv). The share of this group that we\nattribute to NISJ is given by\n[ → ]⁄ [ → ]. (24)\nThe numerator and denominator for this group are calculated in a very similar way as for group (iv).\nIn particular\n[ → ] ∏ { ( ) ( )} ∏ ( ), (25)\nand\n[\n→\n] , -(∏ ( )), - . (26)\nThat is, if one or more observations in IM5, IM6, and IM7 are missing for an individual we treat all\nthese observations as missing and impute the share of such individuals that are J2J through the\nassumed first-order Markov transition process.\nThe first-order Markov assumption in our imputation method assumes that a person flowing\nthrough unemployment is just as likely to become unemployed later in the year as someone that did\nnot. In actuality, this person is more likely to become unemployed (again) but the CPS data do not\nallow us to correct for this. Not correcting for this leads to an overestimate of the number of\npersons flowing through unemployment (and non-participation and part-time and self-employment\nfor the same reason). Hence, it is best to interpret our imputed fraction of NISJ flows that are J2J as\na lowerbound estimate.\nFigure A.1 shows the results of our imputation. The figure indicates that, on average, a bit less\nthan two-thirds of NISJ flows are J2J. Just like quits as a share of separations in the Job Openings\nand Labor Turnover Survey, J2J flows are procyclical, increasing during the strong labor market at\nthe end of the 1990‟s, with a bit of a lull during the dip in 1998, and again increasing from 2006\nthrough 2007. Their share sharply dropped during the 2007 recession.31 This is consistent with\nAkerlof, Rose, and Yellen (1988) who argue that job-to-job quits in pursuit of higher wages and job\nsatisfaction drive a large part of U.S. labor market dynamics.\n31 It is important to note that, because we count changes of the job description of a worker who stays with the same employer as a\nchange in jobs, we find more job-to-job switches than studies, like Fallick and Fleishmann (2004) and Nagypál (2008), which\nconsider job-to-job switches conditional on changing employers. Moreover, we only consider switches from one full-time job to\nanother.\n32\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nB. Mathematical details\nDerivation of equation (2)\nEquation (2) can be derived by realizing that\n( ) ( )\n. ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ (27)\n. ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/ . ( ) ( )/\nMoving the first two terms in this expression from the right-hand side to the left-hand side yields\nequation (2).\nDerivation of equation (6)\nThe version of (2) for more than one subgroup, , reads\n∫ ( )[ ( | ) ( | )] ∫ ( )[ ( | ) ( | )]\n(28)\n∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | )\nThe right-hand side of this expression can be rewritten as\n∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | ) ∫ ( ) ( | )\n∫ ( )[ ( | ) ( | )] ∫( ( ) ( )) ( | ) (29)\n∫ ( )[ ( | ) ( | )] ∫( ( ) ( )) ( | )\nCombining terms, we obtain equation (6).\nDerivation of equation (9)\nEquation (9) follows from\n33\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\n( ) {∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} ∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} }\n{∫ [{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }]* ( ) ( )+ }\n{∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} }\n{∫ [{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }]* ( ) ( )+ }\n{∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} }\n(30)\n{∫ [{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }]* ( ) ( )+ }\n{∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} ∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | )} }\n{∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | ) } }\n{∫ ( ){ ( | ) ( | ) } }\n{∫ [{ ( | ) } { ( | ) }]* ( ) ( )+ }\nThis is the equation we are supposed to derive.\nComparison of our percentile decomposition with DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996)\nThe percentile decomposition that we introduced in this paper is not the first one that can be used.\nOur decomposition is almost directly derived from a standard shift-share decomposition in means\nbut then translated into shifts in earnings distribution functions and changes in the composition,\nshares, of the full-time employed.\nAn alternative is the decomposition by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (DFL, 1996). DFL do not\nspecifically explain how their methodology can be used to decompose changes in percentiles. This\nis actually explained is a more general framework in Fortin, Lemieux, and Firpo (2011).\nWhere our decomposition measures changes in the distribution function evaluated at the\npercentile at the beginning and at the end of the period, i.e. lines A and B in figure 4, and then uses\n34\n\nDaly, Hobijn, and Wiles\nthe mean value theorem to translate changes in the distribution function into changes in the\npercentile, the DLF decomposition involves the calculation of counterfactual percentiles.\nThis difference between these two methods is illustrated in figure A.2. The top panel, (a), of the\nfigure illustrates our percentile decomposition in an extended version of figure 4. In addition to the\ndistribution functions at the beginning at the end of the period, Panel (a) of figure A.2 also contains\ntwo counterfactual distribution functions. The first, ( ) ( | ), is the one that would have\nprevailed if all subgroups had their own conditional earnings distribution from the beginning of the\nperiod and the only thing that happened was a shift in the composition of the full-time employed\nfrom ( ) to ( ). The second, ( ) ( | ), is the one that would have prevailed if all subgroups\nhad their own conditional earnings distribution from the end of the period and the only thing that\nhappened was a shift in the composition of the full-time employed from ( ) to ( ). Our\ndecomposition evaluates what is the fraction of earners whose earnings crossed the percentile\nevaluated either at the beginning of the period, , or at the end of the period, .\nIn terms of figure 4, the former fraction is given by A. Figure A.2 shows that this fraction can be\ndecomposed as\n( ) ( )\n{ ( ) ∫ ( ) ( | ) } {∫ ( ) ( | ) ( )}\n(31)\n∫( ( ) ( )) ( | ) ∫ ( ). ( | ) ( | )/\nThus, A is the change in the value of the earnings distribution function at the percentile at the\nshare\nbeginning of the period that is attributable to the change in the shares of the subgroups that make up\nfull-time wage and salary earners. While, A is the change in the earnings distribution function\nshift\ndue to the earnings distribution functions of each of the underlying subgroups changing.\nSimilarly, the fraction of earners whose earnings crossed the percentile at the end of the period,\ngiven by B, can also be decomposed into shift and a share part.\nOur decomposition then aggregates the shift and share parts of A and B uses the mean value\ntheorem to translate those into relative contributions to the changes in the percentile. We then\nreshuffle the shift and share terms to obtain a decomposition in parts that are better interpreted as\nthe composition and the wage growth effects.\n35\n\nDissecting Aggregate Real Wage Fluctuations\nThe DFL decomposition requires the construction of counterfactual percentiles. Define these\ncounterfactual percentiles, ̃ and ̃ as\n( ) ( ) ∫ ( ) ( ̃ | ) ∫ ( ) ( ̃ | ) . (32)\nThus, ̃ would have been the -th earnings percentile if the each of the subgroups had their\nearnings distribution from the beginning of the period and the share of full-time employment at the\nend of the period. Conversely, ̃ would have been the -th earnings percentile if the each of the\nsubgroups had their earnings distribution from the end of the period and the share of full-time\nemployment at the beginning of the period.\nThese counterfactual percentiles are drawn in panel (b) of figure A.2. The DFL decomposition\nthen basically implies that one can decompose the change in the percent from to into a shift\nand a share part in two ways.\nThe first is\n( ) ( ̃ ) ( ̃ ) . (33)\nHere, A is the part of the change in the percentile that is due to shares of each of the subgroups\nshare\nchanging assuming their respective earnings distributions remain the same as at the beginning of the\nperiod.

    "text": "Policymaking in a Time of Uncertainty\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Commonwealth Club of California\nSan Francisco, CA\nNovember 16, 2021\n12:30 PM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThese are unusual times.\nThe very worst of the pandemic looks to be behind us—a welcome relief. But the impact of\nCOVID and its ongoing threat continue to disrupt and delay the full recovery of the economy.\nWorse perhaps is that we don’t know how long any of this will last. We are in flux—limbo—\nwaiting for the pandemic to be done so we can move on to whatever the new future holds.\nBut waiting is hard, and it’s tempting to want to act. To want to respond to what we see today\nas if it’s a clear signal of what we will see tomorrow.\nAction, after all, feels empowering.\nBut feeling empowered and empowering our future are two different things. Acting without\nclarity is risky. It can lead to decisions that have costly unintended consequences, box us into\noutcomes, and make the flux we feel today a more persistent feature of our economic future\nthan it needs to be.\n1\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about how the recognition of ongoing uncertainty affects monetary\npolicy and the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of price stability and full employment. And about\nwhy the Fed is taking a vigilant and measured approach as we navigate the long tail of the\npandemic.\nBut before I get too far along, I want to remind you that the views I will express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nTaking Stock of the Economy We Have\nInflation\nLet me start by taking stock of where we are today.\nHere is the headline: Inflation is high. Both overall and core inflation have been running well\nabove the Fed’s two percent goal. In fact, overall inflation is at its highest level in 30 years, with\nprice increases in some sectors hitting eye-popping rates.\nThe magnitude and persistence of these readings has come as a surprise, but it’s actually not\nthat mysterious. Standard theory tells us that inflation occurs when demand outstrips supply\nand prices rise to adjust.\nSo, the question is less about why it’s happening and more about how long it will persist.\nSpecifically, will it last beyond the pandemic? There are good reasons to think that it won’t. And\nI will focus on three of these reasons in particular—two related to demand and one related to\nsupply.\nLet me start with demand. COVID has changed how and where we spend our money. Public\nhealth policies aimed at stopping the virus—lockdowns, social distancing, mask wearing—have\nkept us from going to the gym, seeing a movie, traveling, and using a host of other services. So\nwe’ve taken to the internet and worked to recreate our normal lives at home. In economics\nparlance, we “rotated” spending, buying an outsized number of goods—things like home\nexercise equipment, video games, lawn furniture, and cars—while leaving behind spending on\nservices.\nThese individual actions, which I am sure feel familiar, show through to the aggregate data.\nOver the past 18 months, consumer spending has been historically tilted towards goods—\n2\n\nsomething you might have noticed when the load of packages stacked up at your door.1 The\nresult is higher prices for a range of things that we want more of today than usual, as we\nmanage our way through COVID.\nOf course, another unusual characteristic of the pandemic is that people have money to spend.\nSome of this reflects the fact that the pandemic has been a highly focused sectoral shock,\ndevastating certain parts of the economy that rely on in-person contact while boosting others\nthat enable working from home and connecting through technology. For workers in these\nthriving sectors, incomes have stayed steady or grown, supporting spending even as the\neconomy struggles.2\nFor other workers and households more negatively affected, financial challenges were met with\nunprecedented fiscal support. Cash grants and expanded unemployment insurance and child tax\ncredits helped those who’ve been hardest hit maintain their financial well-being through the\nworst of the pandemic.3 This has not only benefited workers and households, but it has also\nkept consumer spending high even as labor markets have lagged. In other words, during the\nworst economic shock in U.S. history, demand has remained resilient.\nUnfortunately, the resilience of supply and supply chains been far less robust. COVID-related\ndisruptions have episodically depressed production across the globe. City by city, plants have\nshut down or reduced shifts to curb infections. These disruptions have accumulated and\nsnowballed, leaving many goods in short supply.\nEven when goods are available, it’s been hard to get them delivered. Shipping containers are in\nthe wrong places. Trucking networks are lagging. And ports across the globe are struggling to\nclear backlogs of ships waiting to dock and unload.\nAnd we’re not out of the woods yet. With lagging vaccination rates in many countries, shutting\ndown is often the best way to fight surging infections. These policies, while necessary, leave a\nlong imprint. In fact, a port closure in Vietnam in August meant to curb surging Delta infections\ncontinues to be felt up and down the supply chain.\nPutting all of this together, it’s easy to see why prices are rising. Consumers with income to\nspend have demanded more goods than usual and suppliers have struggled to keep up. But\nwhat does it mean for future inflation?\n1 Data on monthly personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) show\nthat the goods share of nominal PCE was slightly under 31 percent just before the pandemic and has risen about\n3.5 percentage points, to 34.3 percent (averaged over the past 18 months).\n2 BEA data show that monthly disposable personal income has been highly uneven over the past 18 months but is\nup on average since the pandemic started.\n3 Banerjee and Zipperer (2021).\n3\n\nGiven the factors boosting prices that I’ve just described, I expect a moderation in price\npressures as the pandemic recedes. Consumers will likely pivot back to their normal bundles of\ngoods and services—spending some time with their new home entertainment centers, but also\ngoing to movies, concerts, dinners and, hopefully, holiday parties.\nSimilarly, as fiscal support rolls off and many households move their savings back to historically\nnormal levels, demand will likely become more in sync with the overall strength of the\neconomy. Production and supply chains should also catch up and repair, reducing bottlenecks\nand easing the pressure on prices.\nAs these things happen, we should return to the typical dynamics that drive the economy.\nThe Labor Market\nBut what about the labor market? What’s its future?\nOn one hand, labor markets look tight. Unemployment is down, job openings are at all-time\nhighs, and wages are up in many sectors. Help wanted signs are everywhere and workers are\nquitting at record levels. These are all things we typically see only when the economy is “hot”\nand we are nearing full employment.\nOn the other hand, we’re still over four million jobs short of our pre-pandemic peak. And that\ndoesn’t count where we would have been if COVID had never occurred. That’s a number closer\nto six million missing jobs.4\nNow, some have speculated that this is the new normal—a great epiphany that work isn’t all it’s\ncracked up to be, so maybe we won’t work at all. While it’s hard to argue against epiphanies, I’ll\noffer a few alternatives.\nCOVID continues to affect schooling and childcare, workplace safety, transportation, and even\nthe ability of businesses to offer consistent hours and pay. Faced with these barriers, some\nindividuals, especially women and older Americans, have opted to leave the labor force\naltogether.5 Others have stayed but continued to search for jobs that feel safe, predictable,\nconvenient, or simply better suited to their aspirations and interests.6\n4 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016). Labor force participation trends prior to the pandemic suggest that the\nunderlying trend was at or above the high end of their estimated range.\n5 Lofton, Petrosky-Nadeau, and Seitelman (2021), Montes, Smith, and Leigh (2021).\n6 De Smet et al. (2021).\n4\n\nThese behaviors are understandable reactions to an unprecedented shock. As COVID recedes, I\nexpect people to settle in, land a job they want, and return to the labor market to support their\nfamilies and build a career.\nAnd history supports this prediction. Although labor force participation tends to lag behind\nfalling unemployment, workers do come back. We saw this in the last expansion and in most\nexpansions before that.7 In other words, it’s too early to count out the millions of people sitting\non the sidelines.\nTo summarize, although inflation is high and the labor market seems tight, when we dig into the\ndata, it’s easy to see that some of what we observe today reflects the ongoing effects of the\npandemic. This makes it harder to conclude that we are facing a completely new world that will\npersist once the worst of COVID is behind us.\nGetting to the Economy We Want\nOf course, the truth is, none of us is completely certain how the economy will evolve. We can’t\nsay for sure that the eye-popping rates of inflation won’t leave a more lasting imprint on overall\nprice setting. And we don’t know how long it will take for sidelined workers to come back.\nAnd this is a hard place for policymakers. We have the tools to support the economy if it needs\nit, and we have the tools to beat back inflation and cool the labor market if necessary. The\nquestion is, which of these scenarios will turn out to be true?\nIn the face of this uncertainty, many have argued that we should act preemptively—get ahead\nof things, rather than fall behind the curve.\nThis logic has some appeal. If the high readings on inflation last long enough, they could seep\ninto our psychology and change our expectations about future inflation. Households would then\nexpect prices to keep rising and ask for higher wages to offset that. Businesses, of course, would\npass those increases on to consumers in the form of higher prices, causing workers to ask for\neven higher wages. And on it would go, in a vicious wage-price spiral that would end well for no\none.\nAlthough this would be a deeply disturbing trend should it occur, so far, there is little evidence\nthat this is happening now. Despite the large jumps in measured inflation, inflation expectations\nin the longer run remain relatively stable and well-anchored around the Fed’s price stability\n7 Hobijn and Sahin (2021). See also Cajner, Coglianese, and Montes (2021).\n5\n\ngoal.8 This suggests that households and businesses expect inflation to moderate as the global\neconomy emerges from the pandemic. And most importantly, these readings suggest that\npeople understand that the Fed will act if inflation begins to look more persistent.\nBut why not take out some insurance—preemptively raise rates to make sure that a painful\ninflation spiral doesn’t occur? The main answer is that preemptive action isn’t free. Like all\ninsurance, there are costs. And policymakers must balance these costs against the risk of\nwaiting.\nMonetary policy is a blunt tool that acts with a considerable lag. So, raising interest rates today\nwould do little to increase production, fix supply chains, or stop consumers from spending more\non goods than on services. But it would curb demand 12 to 18 months from now. Should\ncurrent high inflation readings and worker shortages turn out to be COVID-related and\ntransitory, higher interest rates would bridle growth, slow recovery in the labor market and\nunnecessarily sideline millions of workers.\nWith the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, the Fed would have limited room to\nrespond to this type of forecast mistake. On the other hand, if we hold rates steady and\ninflation persists, we can raise rates later on. This policy asymmetry makes the potential costs of\nacting prematurely disproportionately high.\nAgainst this calculus, I come down on the side of waiting to gain greater clarity. The Fed is well\npositioned to act should inflation begin to look more persistent. It’s much harder to unwind a\npreemptive action that turns out to be wrong.\nBut “not now” for interest rates does not mean “not ever” for policy. In fact, earlier this month,\nwe announced that we will reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases in response to\nsubstantial improvement in the economy from the depths of the recession. This will slow the\namount of support we are adding to the economy, allowing it to function more on its own.\nOver the next several quarters, as tapering occurs, we will watch how the economy does and\nsee whether inflation eases and workers come back. As we get a clearer signal, we will be ready\nto act accordingly, continuing to provide or remove support as needed to ensure the economy\nsettles at a sustainable place.\nThe Bravest Action We Can Take\nLet me leave you with a few concluding thoughts. As a policymaker and a person, I’m biased\ntoward action. I like to solve problems. So, I understand the desire to immediately confront the\n8 Inflation implied by yields on 10-year and 5-year nominal and inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury securities has been\nrunning close to pre-pandemic values, consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation goal (see\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIFR).\n6\n\nchallenges in front of us. Action gives us a sense of agency, especially at a time when it feels like\nwe have none.\nBut not all motion is forward motion. Reacting in response to things that aren’t likely to last will\nmove us farther from—not closer to—our goals. And while it’s easy to mistake motion for\ncompetence or action for attention, running headlong into a fog can be costly. So in the face of\nunprecedented uncertainty, the best policy is recognizing the need to wait. Although this can be\nhard, in the end, patience is the bravest action we can take.\nThank you.\n7\n\nReferences\nBanerjee, Asha, and Ben Zipperer. 2021. “Social Insurance Programs Cushioned the Blow of the COVID-19\nPandemic in 2020.” EPI Working Economics Blog, September 14.\nBidder, Rhys, Tim Mahedy, and Rob Valletta. 2016. “Trend Job Growth: Where’s Normal?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2016-32 (October 24).\nCajner, Tomaz, John Coglianese, and Joshua Montes. 2021. “The Long-Lived Cyclicality of the Labor Force\nParticipation Rate.” Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2021-047.\nDe Smet, Aaron, Bonnie Dowling, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, and Bill Schaninger. 2021. “‘Great\nAttrition’ or ‘Great Attraction’?

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUCLA Anderson Forecast Webinar\nSeptember 29, 2021\n10:05 AM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nAs Americans, one of our most deeply held beliefs is that anyone, no\nmatter where they come from or who they are, can make it. They just have to\nwork hard and play by the rules. This assumption permeates our political\nsystem, our institutions and our economy.\nBut crises can be illuminating. The pandemic has shined a vivid light on\nthe deep roots of economic inequity, forcing us to recognize that the rules\naren’t the same for everyone. COVID has taken the most from the people and\ncommunities that are least able to bear it. And long standing gaps in economic\nopportunity and well-being have grown deeper and wider.\nAs humans, we are adaptive. We get used to things. We live a certain\nway for long enough, and we begin to believe that’s the way it’s supposed to\nbe. We forget that the gaps we see every day reflect accumulated inequities—\nthe long tail of policy, luck or inattention that has made it easier for some and\nharder for others to reach their potential. And then, an economy that leaves\nlarge numbers of people behind starts to seem normal.\n1\n\nFINAL\nToday, I’m going to talk about why this way of looking at the world\nlimits our potential, and how we can use the lessons of the pandemic to forge\na more equitable society—one with fewer gaps and greater prosperity for all.\nBefore I go on, I’ll remind you that the views I will express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nThe Bridle of Our Assumptions\nNow, before we imagine a more equitable world, it’s important to take\nstock of the one we have. Economists and many others generally assume that\nresources are allocated according to their most productive uses and that all\navailable resources are fully deployed. Unless there is blatant market failure—\ncollusion, discrimination or other obvious barriers to entry—we believe that\nany differences in initial conditions will smooth out over time. In other words,\nno matter where you are born or how you start out, the marketplace will\nensure that you land where you’re supposed to be.\nAnd there are many examples of this being true. Amazing stories of\npeople starting with little and doing a lot—confirming our belief that markets\nwork efficiently and human capital is put to its best uses with few mistakes.\nBut this can be misleading. It can make us think that the world we have\nis all it could ever be. And this bridles our economy’s potential. It leaves\ncountless people contributing less than their talents and interests would\nallow, sometimes sidelining them completely.\nGaps\n2\n\nFINAL\nTo get a sense of what we stand to gain from building a world with few\ngaps, it’s useful to review what some of the disparities look like. Many groups\nfare less well than the averages we hear about each day. But disparities for\nBlack Americans, many of whom bear the costs of both historical and current\ndiscrimination, are especially sizeable. So, their experiences are an important\nstarting point.\nThe differences start at a young age. The average Black child in the\nUnited States is about three times more likely than the average white child to\nlive in a poor household—one with resources below the official poverty line.1\nBlack children are relatively less likely to graduate from high school and even\nless likely to go onto college.2,3\nBlack students who do go to college don’t always finish. In fact, a recent\ncohort study found that at the six-year mark 45% had not graduated and were\nno longer enrolled. By comparison, only 27% of white students had left\nwithout graduating.4\nBut the gaps don’t end with education. They continue on into the labor\nmarket and beyond. Black college graduates are less likely to be employed\nthan white college graduates and, when they do find jobs, are more likely to be\nin occupations that do not utilize, or even require, their skills.5 All of this\n1 U.S. Census Bureau (2021).\n2 For example, in 2019 the high school graduation rate for Black students was 80%, compared to 89% for\nwhite students. National Center for Education Statistics (2021).\n3 In 2019, the college enrollment rate for recent Black high school graduates was a little over 50%, compared\nto roughly 67% for whites. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020).\n4 Shapiro et al. (2017). These differences in completion rates trace back to a variety of factors including\nfinances, academic preparation and support, and representation. National Center for Education Statistics\n(2019), Espinosa, Turk, Taylor, and Chessman (2019).\n5 Williams and Wilson (2019), Abel and Deitz (2019), Daly, Hobijn, and Pedtke (2020), Buckman, Choi, Daly,\nand Seitelman (2021).\n3\n\nFINAL\ntranslates into lower average earnings for Black Americans, even when they\nhave college degrees.\nPerhaps most troubling, college-educated Black workers lose ground\nover their careers. Indeed, in the work I’ve done, we found that the earnings\ngap between Black and white college-educated men doubles over the first 15\nyears of their professional life.6\nIn the end, this means that fewer Black men and women are\ncontributing their full potential to the economy. But it doesn’t stop there.\nHispanic Americans, women, indigenous Americans, people living in rural\nareas, and many other groups persistently fall behind, with lower rates of\neducation, employment and earnings than we might expect if opportunities\nwere equitably available.7\nLeaving these gaps unaddressed is clearly unfair. But it’s also\nunproductive. It keeps millions of people on the sidelines or underutilized,\nand sells the economy short. No entrepreneur would ever stand for it. The\nquestion is, why do we?\nFrom Gaps to Growth\nOne reason is that we don’t fully understand what we’re missing. We\ndon’t regularly calculate the losses from exclusion or the potential gains from\n6 Daly, Hobijn, and Pedtke (2020).\n7 Buckman, Choi, Daly, and Seitelman (2021), Shrider, Kollar, Chen, and Semega (2021), Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (2019), Blau and Kahn (2017), Marré (2017), Glaeser (2011), Akee (2021), Bengali, Daly, Lofton,\nand Valletta (2021). Some of the groups deviate from the general patterns described. For example, Hispanic\nAmerican men have higher employment rates than men from other racial and ethnic groups, and women are\nmore likely to hold college degrees than men.\n4\n\nFINAL\nbeing more inclusive—at least, not on an aggregate, economy-wide level. My\ncolleagues and I recently did just that.\nWe asked a simple question: what would the economic output of the\nnation be if gaps in outcomes by race and ethnicity were erased?8 For each\nyear from 1990 to 2019, we eliminated gaps in employment, hours, education\nand educational utilization. And we gave racial and ethnic minorities the\nvalues of their white counterparts. We then recomputed the potential output\nfor each year. What we found was significant.\nWhen gaps are closed, the gains from equity are nearly $23 trillion over\na 30-year period—a large piece of the economic pie unrealized or simply left\non the table by tolerating the gaps that we see.\nOther studies have found similar potential gains. For example, a 2014\nstudy found that closing racial gaps in income in 2012 would have increased\nGDP by $2.1 trillion that year.9 More recently, a study conducted by leading\nresearchers in the private banking sector found that closing gaps between\nBlack and white adults in wages, higher education, home ownership, and\nentrepreneurship would have led to a GDP boost of $16 trillion over the past\n20 years, and a projected $5 trillion gain over the next five years.10 In other\nwords, a range of studies, using different methods and closing different gaps,\nall point to the same thing: substantial gains from a more inclusive economy.\nBut how will we get there? A recent study done by scholars at Stanford\nUniversity and the University of Chicago provides some clues. They look back\nin time and examine the economic impact of taking down barriers to entry for\n8 Buckman, Choi, Daly, and Seitelman (2021).\n9 Truehaft, Scoggins, and Tran (2014).\n10 Peterson and Mann (2020).\n5\n\nFINAL\nwomen and Black workers in the fifty years spanning 1960 to 2010.11 They\nfind that better allocation of these workers throughout the economy—putting\ntalent where it was needed—accounted for between 20 and 40 percent of the\ntotal growth in U.S. output over the period. Moreover, they showed that most\nof this improvement came from reducing human capital barriers and labor\nmarket discrimination. Simply put, removing barriers for some improved\noutput for all.\nThese and other studies make it clear that using all of our resources\nmore fully improves aggregate prosperity. But the gains are likely to go\nbeyond a boost in the level of GDP. Reducing disparities could also increase\nthe economy’s long-run rate of growth.\nTo understand why, we need to go back to the 1980s, when future Nobel\nlaureate Paul Romer had an idea. He hypothesized that the driver of economic\ngrowth is really ideas—innovations in thinking that lead to the development\nof new technologies, higher productivity, and more and faster growth over the\nlong run.12 In other words, ideas determine how quickly the economic pie\ngrows.\nHis theory tells us that we can boost growth by investing in strategies\nthat foster the development and implementation of ideas. And not just of a\nfew, but of everyone.\nThe first and most obvious strategy to boost the generation of ideas is to\nincrease access to high-quality education and the academic supports needed\nto help students stay on course. Education equips people with the knowledge\n11 Hsieh, Hurst, Jones, and Klenow (2019).\n12 Romer (1990, 1994). See Jones (2019) for an overview of the original work and subsequent literature.\n6\n\nFINAL\nand the skills they need to innovate. And it doesn’t always take a four-year\ndegree. Think of all the computer programmers out there who started coding\nas kids. Investing in students at an early age and offering them a pathway to\nlearn is equally important.13\nAnother way to encourage idea generation is to create more equitable\nways to fund them. Wealth enables people to implement their ideas. But\nwealth gaps are large in our country, and racial and ethnic minorities are\nespecially far behind.14 Gaps in financing or borrowing to fund ideas are also\nlarge.15 This means that whole communities of people have less financial\nsupport for putting their innovations into practice.\nFinally, we need to increase diversity and inclusion in businesses and\ngovernment. A large and growing body of research shows that diverse teams\nenhance performance. Less diverse teams eat into profitability.16 I see this in\nmy own organization every day. The best teams are the most diverse teams—\nones that include a range of views, backgrounds and experiences.\nThe bottom line is this: making sure everyone has a chance to generate\nand nurture their ideas is good for growth, and ultimately delivers greater\nprosperity to us all.\nSwitching Our Lens\n13 García, Heckman, Leaf, and Prados (2020), Rolnick and Grunewald (2003).\n14 Bhutta et al. (2020).\n15 See Federal Reserve Banks (2021), Apgar and Calder (2005).\n16 See for example Kline, Rose, and Walters (2021), Herring (2009).\n7\n\nFINAL\nNow, I want to leave you with a story. A girl from a lower income family\ndoes well in school, reads a lot, likes to learn. But the family finances, and the\nfamily itself, fall on hard times. And the young girl, needing to assist, drops out\nof school. When she tells her teacher she is leaving, he doesn’t blink. He says\nhe always knew that she wouldn’t amount to anything, and that her decision\nhas just confirmed it.\nFast forward a few years, and the girl meets a woman named Betsy. And\nBetsy tells her that the job she wants, to drive a bus, requires a GED, and so do\nmany others. So, the girl gets one. Then, Betsy tells her that many more jobs\nrequire college and she should go. And on it goes, until one day the girl—now\na woman—earns a Ph.D. and heads off into the world to try and make a\ndifference.\nThat girl, as you might have guessed, was me. And I tell you that story to\nshow one thing: the lens we use determines what we do. My teacher and\nBetsy saw me differently. And because they saw me differently, they acted\ndifferently towards me. Betsy paid for my first semester of college. My teacher\nsimply erased me.\nWe can take for granted that the outcomes we see today are inevitable,\nand watch as the pandemic makes existing gaps deeper and our prospects for\nfuture growth even slower. Or we can see them as a sign that resources aren’t\nbeing used to their fullest, and that people with great potential are being kept\neach day from realizing it.\nThe choice is clear. The will is ours.\nThank you.\n8\n\nFINAL\n9\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAbel, Jaison, and Richard Deitz. 2019. “Underemployment in the Early Careers of College\nGraduates following the Great Recession.” Chapter in Education, Skills, and Technical\nChange: Implications for Future US GDP Growth, eds.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of California, Irvine Virtual Event\nIrvine, CA\nOctober 13, 2020\n5:00PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n* This speech is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Laubach,\na devoted public servant and tireless advocate for crafting policy that works for everyone.\nIntroduction\nHello everyone. Thank you so much for the opportunity to join you\ntoday. It means more to me than you might expect.\nI’ve spent almost 25 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nAnd back in 2006, when I was working in our research department, I got a big\nopportunity.\nOur president at the time, Janet Yellen, was coming to UC Irvine to\ndeliver a speech on economic inequality right before the midterm election.1 I\nhad a chance to work on her remarks, and it was a defining moment in my\ncareer.\nSo to be here again, at UC Irvine, as the current president of the San\nFrancisco Fed, delivering a speech of my own on inequality, weeks before\nanother important election, feels like a full-circle moment for me. And I thank\nyou very much for the opportunity.\n1 Yellen (2006).\n1\n\nFINAL\nNow, I’d like to say that we’ve made a lot of progress since Janet’s\nspeech in 2006. But inequality is still a pressing issue for our nation—one that\nfeels even more urgent in the wake of the health and economic hardships\ncaused by COVID-19, and the social reckoning sparked by the deaths of George\nFloyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others.\nNot every American gets the same chance at life, liberty, and the pursuit\nof happiness. And this difference in opportunity translates into differences in\noutcomes. It leaves us with two Americas: one for those who have, and one for\nthose who have not. This is our shared reality, a reality we have to\nacknowledge and confront—as individuals, as institutions, and as a nation.\nAs a monetary policymaker and the leader of the San Francisco Fed, I’m\nregularly—and rightly—asked about how the Federal Reserve contributes to\nthe inequality we observe. So today, I will take this on directly: inequality, the\nrole of the Fed, and how we must collectively move toward a better, more\ninclusive economic future.\nBut before I begin, I’ll remind you that the remarks I’m delivering are\nmy own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe root of the question\nLet’s start by looking at a few recent facts that suggest the Federal\nReserve might have a role in generating economic inequality.\nCOVID-19 hit our shores in January. And by March, we saw severe\nimpacts on health and economic activity. Both the Fed and Congress took\nimmediate and unprecedented action.\n2\n\nFINAL\nThe Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to close to zero and\nimplemented a wide array of measures to facilitate the flow of credit in the\neconomy.2 Congress provided almost $3 trillion in fiscal support to shore up\nhouseholds, businesses, and state and local governments. Together these\nmeasures were a bridge through the immediate economic hardships caused\nby COVID-19.\nBut what has happened since then?\nAs the economy has slowly reopened, employment growth has\nrebounded, exceeding most expectations. But this growth has erased only\nabout half of the original losses. In September, employment was still down by\nalmost 11 million people from its recent peak. Those are bigger losses than we\nsaw during the Great Recession. In contrast, after dropping nearly one-third of\ntheir value in February and March, financial markets have completely\nrecovered, with all major U.S. stock indexes retracing their declines.\nLooking at the two recoveries I have just described—the economic one\nand the financial one—it seems unfair. Another example of Wall Street\nwinning and Main Street losing. Of a few advancing while so many others fall\nbehind.3\nSo how do we alter this imbalance? What can we do to ensure the\nproceeds of economic growth are more equitably distributed in our society?\nThis is the right question to ask of policymakers. And while I can’t\nprovide a simple playbook or recipe, I will lay out the issues I see before us\nand discuss what the Federal Reserve, our fiscal agents, and each of us must\ndo if we are going to create a more equitable future.\n2 Board of Governors (2020a, 2020b).\n3 Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins (2020).\n3\n\nFINAL\nThis isn’t just a COVID-19 phenomenon\nFirst, it’s important to note that, while COVID-19 has spotlighted and\nmagnified the inequities in our nation, these disparities have existed for\ndecades. Income and wealth inequality in the United States have been rising\nalmost without pause since 1980. Let me offer a few illustrations.\nOver the past 40 years, the income of households near the bottom of the\ndistribution—the 10th percentile—rose by about 20 percent. In contrast,\nhouseholds near the top of the distribution—the 90th percentile—saw their\nincomes rise by 66 percent.4\nThese differences in returns have added up to more inequality. In 2019,\nthe top 10 percent of adults in the United States took home almost half of the\npretax income generated in the economy—nearly five times their share of\npopulation.5\nLooking at wealth, the disparities are even wider. About one-quarter of\nAmericans have essentially no wealth—near zero or even a negative net\nworth.6 The remainder of households have some wealth, but this is quite\nunevenly distributed. At the end of 2019, the top 10 percent of American\nhouseholds owned nearly 70 percent of all wealth held in the United States.7\nWe’re not the only country experiencing these trends. Inequality has\nincreased in countries with economic systems similar to ours, like the United\n4 Semega et al. (2020).\n5 Based on data from the World Inequality Database, developed by Thomas Piketty,\nEmmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman, and collaborators. https://wid.world/\n6 Bhutta et al. (2020).\n7 Calculated from the Federal Reserve Board’s Distributional Financial Accounts.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/efa/efa-distributional-financial-accounts.htm\n4\n\nFINAL\nKingdom. And it’s also happened, albeit to a lesser extent, in countries with\neconomic systems very different from ours, like Denmark and Sweden.8\nA range of structural factors have contributed to the worldwide\nincreases in inequality we observe. These include automation, growing\ndemand for college-educated workers, and globalized labor, product, and\ncapital markets.9\nBut global trends alone can’t explain the severe run-up in economic\ninequality we’re experiencing in the United States. We have additional and\nunique challenges—struggles we see play out on the news every day.\nSystemic biases related to race, ethnicity, gender, and class have led to\nunequal access to education, jobs, income, and wealth.10 And these inequities\nhave compounded over generations, as children born into poverty or low-\nincome households carry that disadvantage through to adulthood and pass it\non to their children.11\nThese trends—and their persistence over time—reflect fundamental\nchoices we’ve made about public education, taxation, and the social safety net.\nFundamental choices about how we manage our society.\nSo if these are our choices, what can institutions like the Federal\nReserve do to change the landscape? The answer is: quite a lot.\n8 See the World Inequality Database. https://wid.world/\n9 See, for example, Autor (2019), Nolan, Richiardi, and Valenzuela (2019), and Dabla-Norris\net al. (2015).\n10 See, for example, relevant chapters in Nolan, Salverda, and Smeeding (2011); also\nAliprantis and Carroll (2019), Butler, Mayer, and Weston (2020).\n11 Bengali and Daly (2013), Chetty et al. (2014).\n5\n\nFINAL\nInequality and monetary policy\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate—full employment and price\nstability. We achieve these goals primarily by adjusting the short-term\ninterest rate.12 Our interest rate decisions make it more or less expensive for\nconsumers and businesses to borrow money. This guides spending decisions,\nwhich impacts hiring, wages, and ultimately inflation.\nWhen it’s working well, our policies provide the foundation for a\npositive feedback loop—consumers spend, firms invest and hire more\nworkers, and a wide range of households build income and wealth. This is the\nvirtuous cycle of growth that ultimately delivers a strong, sustainable, and\ninclusive economy.\nBut how do our policies work in practice? To get a sense of this, let’s\nconsider the last expansion—the longest in recorded U.S. history. After taking\nsignificant measures to stabilize the economy in the wake of the 2008\nfinancial crisis, the FOMC committed to a period of sustained low interest\nrates to support the labor market and return inflation to 2 percent.\nThe benefits were material. The length and strength of the expansion\npushed the unemployment rate to near-historic lows. This created real\nopportunities for a large number of sidelined Americans, many of whom were\nthought to be permanently out of the labor force or lacking the right skills to\nwork in an evolving job market.13\n12 The Federal Reserve has a variety of additional tools beyond simple interest rate\nmovements. These include forward guidance and asset purchases, along with lender-of-\nlast-resort activities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.

By early 2019, employers were hiring African\nAmerican and Hispanic workers at rates equal to or higher than those of white\nworkers.14 This reduced long-standing unemployment gaps, narrowing them\nto historic lows. The same thing happened for those with a high school\ndiploma: hiring rates rose, unemployment fell, and gaps narrowed relative to\ncollege-educated workers.15\nBy the end of the expansion, these improved employment outcomes\nwere leading to faster growth in wages and income. Between 2016 and 2019,\nmedian wage growth for low-wage workers was more rapid than for high-\nwage workers, reversing a pattern that had dominated in previous years. This\nnarrowed the relative gaps in wages between those in the lowest earnings\nquartile and all other groups.16\nThe better-than-average wage growth translated into better-than-\naverage growth in household incomes. In 2019, median household income for\nBlack and Hispanic households rose by more than 7 percent, compared to less\nthan 6 percent for white households.17\nFinally, these improvements also showed through to wealth. As the\neconomy continued to expand, so did the value of assets, including housing,\nbusinesses, and stock market holdings. Gains on assets were especially rapid\nfor those at the bottom of the wealth distribution.18 Between 2016 and 2019,\nfamilies with the lowest net worth saw the largest growth in their holdings.\n14 Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n15 Aaronson et al.

(2020).\n7\n\nFINAL\nThis late-cycle pattern gave less-wealthy households a chance to reap some of\nthe benefits that had been captured disproportionately by higher net-worth\nindividuals earlier in the cycle.\nNow, these are a lot of numbers. But they all point to a single thing:\nnearly 11 years of uninterrupted growth helped a broad range of Americans\nget a foothold in the economy—finding work, gaining income, and building\nwealth. These are unequivocally good outcomes.\nBut they are not enough. Simply chipping away at the mountain of\ninequality that has built up over the past several decades can only get us so\nfar. Even with a historically long expansion, large differences in earnings,\nincome, and wealth remain—especially for people of color. And these gaps are\nonly being widened by COVID-19.\nA framework for the future\nSo what more can we do? How can we build a society that delivers on\nthe promise of equal opportunity and inclusive success?\nFirst, the Fed has a critical role to play. Full employment, the idea that\neveryone who wants a job can get a job, is the foundation for ensuring more\nequitable outcomes.\nTo better achieve this goal, the Federal Reserve released a new strategic\nframework in August that lays out our approach to monetary policy for the\nnext several years.19 A key component of this framework is the recognition\nthat maximum employment is not a fixed target. It is a broad-based and\ninclusive goal that changes as the economy evolves.\n19 Board of Governors (2020c).\n8\n\nFINAL\nWe’ve committed to finding full employment experientially, by seeing it\nin wages and prices. When we’ve achieved 2 percent inflation on average, we\nwill know that we have approached our maximum and that the economy is\nfirmly on its sustainable path.\nIn other words, in the absence of sustained 2 percent inflation or\nemerging risks, such as to financial stability, we will not take the punch bowl\naway while so many remain on the economic sidelines.\nBut the most critical aspect of our new framework is not about specific\npolicies. Rather, it is about commitment. The commitment to regularly review\nour strategy to ensure it continues meeting the needs of the American people.\nThe ingredients of this ongoing review are simple. We need to listen,\nresearch, and engage. Keep our minds open to what we hear, bring the best\ndata and analysis to the problems we find, and have hard, action-oriented\nconversations around the issues holding us back from achieving our full\neconomic potential.20\nA job for all\nBut even with all of these actions, the Federal Reserve cannot fully solve\nthe inequity problems before us. For that, we need everyone.\nOur social safety net was originally crafted in the wake of the Great\nDepression. It collectively recognized that, at any point, any one of us might\n20 Recent Federal Reserve System efforts include the Fed Listens initiative, summarized at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications.htm, and the Racism and the Economy webinar sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, and Minneapolis,\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/events/2020/racism-and-the-economy-series-kickoff-\nevent.\n9\n\nFINAL\nneed help. That safety net and its expansions over time have become integral\nto the stability of the economy.21\nBut a net that simply catches people when they fall is no longer\nsufficient. Too many people are left out from the start—without resources,\nwithout opportunity, without a fair chance. So we need a net that lifts.\nHow do we build this? We invest in infrastructure—opportunity\ninfrastructure—that includes health, education, and digital connectivity.\nHealthy people are productive people. Education is a lifelong asset. And digital\naccess is a public good. Investing in this critical infrastructure will help level\nthe playing field, reduce inequality, and boost the potential output of our\nnation.22\nWe are a rich enough country that we can afford to do this.\nWe are a poor enough country that we can’t afford not to.\nThe challenge\nLet me conclude with a reflection.

I stood in the classroom\nwith my hand over my heart, and I said the words, “with liberty and justice for\nall.”\nI believed those words. I cherished those words.

We find that after the 1970s but prior to the global financial crisis of the\n2000s, the Okun’s Law relationship between output and unemployment became more\nhomogenous across countries. These changes presumably reflected institutional and\ntechnological changes. But, at least in the short term, the global financial crisis undid much\nof this convergence, in part because the affected countries adopted different labor market\npolicies in response to the global demand shock.\nKeywords: Okun’s Law, Labor Markets, Labor Hoarding.\nJEL Codes: E24, E27\nI. Introduction\nThe impact of the global financial crisis on labor markets varied widely from country\nto country. For example, in the United States, the unemployment rate at its highest level was\nabout five percentage points above its pre-recession level. The rate rose much less in the\nUnited Kingdom and barely changed in Germany—despite larger declines in gross domestic\nproduct.\nIn this note, we summarize a few key cross-country differences using the perspective\nof Okun’s Law. Okun’s Law, the reduced form empirical relationship between changes in\nthe unemployment rate and changes in output growth, provides a natural measure of how\nlabor markets in different countries responded to the large, arguably common, global\nfinancial shock. It also provides an organizing framework for discussing these differences.\nWe find that, after the 1970s but prior to the Great Recession, the relationship\nbetween output and the unemployment rate became more homogenous across countries.\nThese changes presumably reflected institutional and technological changes. But, at least in\n1 This note was prepared for a special issue of the National Institute Economic Review, and is a slightly expanded version of\nan FRBSF Economic Letter (Daly et al, 2013b). We thank Bart Hobijn, Dawn Holland, Simon Kirby, Ron Smith, Garry\nYoung, and conference participants at the Bank of England for helpful comments.\n\n2\nthe short term, the global financial crisis undid much of this convergence, in part because the\naffected countries adopted different labor market policies in response to the global demand\nshock.\nWe then decompose the Okun relationship using a simple output identity, that output\ngrowth is the sum of growth in workers, hours per worker, and productivity. This identity\nsuggests some potential reasons for the changes during and since the financial crisis. For\nalmost all countries, increases in the unemployment rate were associated with larger\ndeclines—in some cases, substantially larger—in hours per worker in the crisis period than\nthe pre-crisis period. The experiences in the U.S., U.K. and Germany offer three contrasting\nlessons about this process of adjustment.\nII. Interpreting Okun’s Law\nArthur Okun (1962) observed half a century ago that changes in the unemployment\nrate have a consistent and predictable relationship with changes in real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Since then, what is now called “Okun’s Law” has become a standard rule of\nthumb used by monetary policymakers and economic forecasters.2\nOkun’s Law is estimated in different ways in the literature. Okun estimated the\nrelationship in growth rates, but it is often estimated in levels (relating output and\nunemployment “gaps”). And, since it’s a reduced-form relationship, either the\nunemployment rate or output can be put on the left-hand side. In what follows, we focus on\nthe following relationship between output growth and the change in the unemployment rate:\n∆(cid:1877) (cid:3404) (cid:2009)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)∆(cid:1847) (cid:3397)(cid:2013) (1)\n(cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)\nLower case variables are logs of upper case (level) variables and  is the four-quarter change.\nSo y is the 4-quarter log-change in real output, and U is the 4-quarter change in the rate\nt t\nof unemployment.\n2 See, for example, Bernanke (2012) and Congressional Budget Office (2014). Knotek (2007) and Ball, Loungani, and\nLeigh (2013) provide references to the substantial literature.\n\n3\nDaly et al (2013a) discuss the merits of estimating the relationship in the form of (1),\nfrom the perspective of growth accounting. Loosely speaking, a 1 percentage point change in\nthe unemployment rate leads to a direct 1 percent reduction in the number of workers. From\nthe production function, a 1 percent reduction in labor input should lead to about a 2/3\npercent reduction in output, where 2/3 is labor’s (approximate) share. A coefficient of β that\nis substantially greater than 2/3 in absolute value reflects other margins that adjust at the\nsame time, and hence, are correlated with changes in the unemployment rate. In terms of the\nnumber of workers, these margins include labor-force participation, immigration, and\nmultiple job holders. As we discuss further below, other margins include variations in hours\nper worker or imply cyclical movements in productivity.3\nWe will refer to β as Okun’s “coefficient.” In the data, this coefficient is always\nnegative, indicating that increases in the unemployment rate are associated with slower-than-\nusual growth in output. The discussion in the previous paragraph makes clear that this\nnegative relationship is hardly surprising. We expect a higher unemployment rate to be\nassociated with lower hours worked which, other things equal, means less output.\nResearch has found that estimates of the Okun’s Law relationship vary markedly\nacross countries (e.g., IMF 2010 and Gordon 2011). We discuss cross-country estimates in\nSections III and IV. The association between changes in the unemployment rate, hours\nworked, and productivity should depend on institutional, industrial, and other relations that\naffect how businesses and households adjust to shocks. IMF (2010) provides a detailed\ndiscussion of policies that affect these relations and, thereby, Okun’s Law. Thus, the Okun\ncoefficient provides a convenient, quantitative summary of how these institutional and other\ndifferences affect cyclical adjustment. Moreover, given the major shock of the global\nfinancial crisis, it provides a lens on the different sources of adjustment used in different\ncountries.\nWe make use the following identity to look at Okun’s Law in more detail:\n∆(cid:1877) ≡ ∆(cid:1866) (cid:3397)(cid:4666)∆(cid:1864) (cid:3398)∆(cid:1866) (cid:4667)(cid:3397)(cid:4666)∆(cid:1877) (cid:3398)∆(cid:1864) (cid:4667) (2)\n(cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)\n3 Basu and Fernald (2001) and Gali and van Rens (2014) discuss the literature on cyclical productivity.\n\n4\nn is the 4-quarter (log) change in total employment, (h -n) is the 4-quarter (log) change\nt t t\nin hours per worker, and (y -h) is the 4-quarter (log) change in labor productivity.\nt t\nThis identity focuses on three levers businesses might use to adjust output in response\nto a decline in demand: The number of workers they employ, the number of hours each\nemployee works, and (possibly as a residual) their rate of productivity. When demand\nchanges, the use of these levers is likely to depend on a range of factors. These include labor\nlaws and contracts that affect an employer’s ability to lay off workers or change hours, as\nwell as the bargaining environment. They are also likely to depend on the persistence of\nshocks to demand. For example, businesses are more likely to adjust the number of\nemployees if the drop in demand is viewed as permanent. In contrast, for temporary shocks,\nthey might “hoard labor” to have it ready for the eventual recovery. Productivity changes in\nresponse to a change in demand can be a residual, to the extent firms cannot or choose not to\nadjust total hours commensurate with changes in demand—perhaps reflecting labor hoarding.\nProductivity changes may also be intentional if, for example, competitive pressures create\nincentives to raise productivity and lower production costs.\nSome responses to a downturn in demand might be captured only indirectly. For\nexample, depending on the institutional environment, firms may be able to cut wages, reduce\ncosts on other production factors, and/or squeeze their profit margins. These choices are\nlikely to influence the adjustments made in the output identity (2). And general equilibrium\neffects might matter. For example, the monetary or fiscal policy reaction function may affect\nthe persistence of a downturn in demand, thereby affecting the choice of margins by a firm.\nIn the context of all of the factors, equation (2) nevertheless summarizes how businesses\nadapt to changes in demand.\nThese changes, in turn, have implications for Okun’s Law. Specifically, we can\nproject each of the terms in (2) on changes in unemployment:\n∆(cid:1866) (cid:3404) (cid:2009)(cid:3032)(cid:3040)(cid:3043) (cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:3032)(cid:3040)(cid:3043)∆(cid:1847) (cid:3397)(cid:2013) (cid:3032)(cid:3040)(cid:3043)\n(cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)\n(cid:4666)(cid:1864) (cid:3398)(cid:1866) (cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:2009)(cid:3035)(cid:3042)(cid:3048)(cid:3045)(cid:3046) (cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:3035)(cid:3042)(cid:3048)(cid:3045)(cid:3046)∆(cid:1847) (cid:3397)(cid:2013)(cid:3035)(cid:3042)(cid:3048)(cid:3045)(cid:3046) (3)\n(cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)\n(cid:4666)(cid:1877) (cid:3398)(cid:1864) (cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:2009)(cid:3013)(cid:3017) (cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:3013)(cid:3017)∆(cid:1847) (cid:3397)(cid:2013)(cid:3013)(cid:3017)\n(cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)\nBy construction, the Okun coefficient β(cid:3552) is the sum of the three coefficients from (3):\n\n5\nβ(cid:3552) (cid:3404) (cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3032)(cid:3040)(cid:3043) (cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3035)(cid:3042)(cid:3048)(cid:3045)(cid:3046) (cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3013)(cid:3017)\nThus, the estimates in (3) give us a lens to discuss why Okun’s coefficient might be\nchanging across countries.\nIII. Pre-crisis, advanced economies gradually looking more alike\nSince the 1970s, several broad developments have affected labor markets and may\nhave changed the cyclical relationship between the unemployment rate and changes in output.\nIn many countries, labor markets have become more flexible and the power of unions has\nwaned. Those might reduce the importance of labor hoarding (e.g., Gali and van Rens,\n2014). From the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s, economies across the world experienced a\nsimultaneous decline in the volatility of output and a reduction in inflation, a period known as\nthe Great Moderation. Whether the decline in volatility reflected good policy or good luck\n(low variance of shocks), it would presumably affect incentives to hoard labor. The cyclical\nlink between changes in the unemployment rate and changes in employment depend, in part,\non the cyclical response of labor-force participation. Female labor force participation in\nadvanced economies had surged since the 1960s, but began to stabilize in the mid-1990s and\nthen declined; that might have influenced the responsiveness of the participation margin over\nthe business cycle. Meanwhile, in the past ten years, aging populations in advanced\neconomies have driven broader declines in overall participation rates.4 For these and possibly\nother reasons, Okun’s Law is likely to evolve over time.\nFigure 1 shows how the distribution of Okun coefficients has evolved across 15\nOECD economies over time, based on equation (1). Country by country, it estimates\nequation (1) as a simple OLS regression of the 4-quarter (log) change in real GDP on the 4-\nquarter change in unemployment, using rolling windows of 40 quarters. (See the appendix\nfor details on the data.) The figure shows the end dates of the rolling windows, which range\nfrom 1979:Q4 through 2013:Q1.\n4 Movements in the labor-force participation may have a cyclical dimension that influences the relationship between changes\nin unemployment and changes in the number of people working. For example, in the Great Recession, some older people\nwho lose jobs may decide to retire—and cease to be counted as unemployed.\n\n6\nEach estimated  shows how much output tends to change, relative to trend, for each\none-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate. The figure displays the average\nvalue of this relation across the 15 countries. The figure also depicts the dispersion of the\nOkun relation across countries by plotting the relation for the bottom and top quarter of\ncountries in the sample, denoted 25th and 75th percentile respectively.\nEarly in the sample, before the Great Moderation, the Okun relation in the typical\ncountry was large. A one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was typically\nassociated with nearly a three percentage point decline in output growth. This suggests that\ncountries were substantially relying on margins other than unemployment to adjust\nproduction to shocks. But around that average value, countries differed greatly as shown by\nthe inter-quartile range.\nStarting with samples ending in the mid-1980s, the average Okun coefficient fell\nsharply. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the coefficient gradually declined further to\nnearly one-to-one at its lowest point. And differences across countries narrowed\nconsiderably. A simple standard deviation across estimated Okun’s coefficients confirms\nthese patterns, with a substantial decline in its value between 1980 and 2005.\nSeveral factors may contribute to explaining the decline in the Okun relation before\n2007, including globalization, greater labor mobility, and overall liberalization of employee-\nemployer relations. In addition, over the past decade, employment protection has declined, a\nfeature visible in regulatory changes concerning individual and collective job dismissals (see,\ne.g. OECD 2013). These factors have generally increased labor- and product-market\nflexibility. As a result, when output changed, more of the adjustment took place through\nemployment, which in turn showed up in the unemployment rate.\nThen came the global financial crisis. Data since 2007 indicate that the Okun relation\nrose to levels last seen in the 1980s. Countries adopted different policies during and after the\ncrisis, reflecting institutional or philosophical differences; in the next section, we discuss a\nfew of these policies. Of course, the figure to some extent could also reflect institutional\ndifferences across countries that were relatively unimportant for Okun’s Law in the decade or\n\n7\nso prior to the crisis, but then those differences became important in response the financial\nshock. As a reduced-form relationship, Okun’s Law could depend on the source of the\nshocks hitting the economy.5 In any event, as output fell, some of these policies prevented\nunemployment from rising as sharply as it typically did before the crisis. In addition to the\nrise in the Okun coefficient, the different approaches countries took increased the dispersion\nin the Okun relation as shown by the widening in the interquartile range. The next section\ndiscusses some of those differences.\n5 Daly et al (2013a) discuss conditional estimates of Okun’s Law for the United States.\n\n8\nFigure 1 –\nNarrowing and then widening of the output and unemployment relation\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nNote: Figure summarizes the distribution of Okun coefficients estimated country-by-\ncountry with 40-quarter rolling regressions that end at the date shown. For each of 15 OECD\ncountries, the coefficient is from regressing four-quarter changes in the log of output on four-\nquarter changes in the unemployment rate. The figure shows the unweighted mean\ncoefficient, and 25th and 75th percentiles.\nSome previous literature has also explored whether Okun’s Law has changed over\ntime. For example, IMF (2010) uses rolling regressions and reports changes in several\ncountries. However, they do not explicitly compare the coefficients across countries as in\nFigure 1, and, below, we implement a different decomposition to understand these changes.\nIn contrast, Ball, Loungani, and Leigh (2013) argue that Okun’s Law is remarkably stable\nwithin countries over time. However, they begin their analysis a decade after we do (with\ndata that start in 1980, and simply compare 1980-1995 with 1995-2011.

Up until the last few years of the sample, it’s not\nclear that one should find large changes across subsamples.\nIV. The Great Recession: The Great Divergence?\nThe global financial crisis both raised the average 15-country Okun coefficient and\nincreased its cross-country variability. Did these changes reflect a reversal of the factors\nbehind the pre-2007 declines? To better understand what happened following the global\nfinancial crisis, we break down the estimate of the Okun coefficient into three parts using\nequation (3). Those regressions decompose the coefficient into the parts relating changes in\noutput to movements in total employment, in hours per worker, and in labor productivity:\nDecomposing the Okun coefficient into these three factors helps clarify the differences across\ncountries. Although we show more countries, for concreteness we focus the discussion on\nthe United States, Great Britain, and Germany.\nTo begin, Figure 2 shows individual Okun coefficients for the 15 countries in our\nsample. The red bars show the pre-crisis period from 1996:Q1 through 2006:Q4. Consistent\nwith Figure 1, those bars hover around -1 with a range from about -1½ to -½. The blue dots\nshow the coefficients estimated over the period of the global financial crisis, from 2007:Q1\nthrough 2013:Q1. In all but two cases (the United States and New Zealand), the coefficient is\nmore negative in the crisis period. In several cases, including the U.K. and Germany, the\ncoefficient is much more negative in the crisis period.\nFigures 3-5 decomposes the bars in Figure 2 into the responses of each of the three\nfactors from equation (3), namely (cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3032)(cid:3040)(cid:3043),(cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3035)(cid:3042)(cid:3048)(cid:3045)(cid:3046),(cid:1853)(cid:1866)(cid:1856) (cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3013)(cid:3017). Not surprisingly, perhaps, Figure\n3 shows that the magnitude of the Okun coefficient—indeed, its systematic negative sign—is\nmostly a result of the total employment component. In both the pre-crisis and later periods, a\none-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is typically associated with a decline\nof about one percentage point or more in a country’s employment rate. Such a relationship is\nintuitively obvious, but variations in such factors as labor force participation and immigration\n\n10\nmean that the association need not be one-to-one in practice. Daly et al (2013a) discuss the\nquantitative importance of some of these margins in the U.S. case.\nFigures 4 and 5 shows that hours per worker and productivity contribute to the Okun\nrelation, but prior to the Great Recession were less quantitatively important. Indeed, even the\nsign varied across countries. In the United States, hours per worker are procyclical—they\ntend to fall in a downturn, when unemployment rises. In others, including France, Germany,\nand Italy, hours per worker prior to the Great Recession tended to rise in a downturn,\nsuggesting that the employed workforce was used more intensively. In terms of productivity,\nsome recent literature has discussed the apparent change in the cyclicality of U.S.\nproductivity, from procyclical (a negative (cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3013)(cid:3017)) to countercyclical (a positive coefficient).6\nFigure 4 shows that the U.S. was not alone in having countercyclical productivity since the\nmid-1990s. In contrast, in France, Germany, Italy, and several other countries, productivity\ntended to fall substantially when the unemployment rate rises.\nDuring and since the Great Recession, countries have adjusted all three factors, but\nhave placed different emphasis on them. The U.S. adjustment was largely in line with its pre-\nrecession experience. Increases in unemployment were associated with reductions in\nemployment, falling hours per worker, and slightly higher productivity. The coefficients\nchange little relative to the pre-recession period.\nAcross countries, Figure 4 shows that a major difference in the post-2006 period is the\nuse of the hours-per-worker margin. When unemployment rose, all countries reduced hours\nper worker, in some cases substantially. The productivity and employment responses varied\nless systematically across countries before and after the crisis.\nLooking specifically at the United Kingdom, the declines in employment, hours, and\nproductivity were all larger than in the pre-recession period. Compared with the US, the main\ndifference was that the U.K. adjusted productivity far more, with a larger increase (in\nabsolute value) of (cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3013)(cid:3017). In Germany, the pre-and-post-crisis responses were particularly large.\nBoth hours per worker and productivity fell much more following the crisis, explaining why\n6 See Gali and van Rens (2014) for references. Daly et al (2013a) discuss the changing (cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3013)(cid:3017) coefficient in the U.S. context.\n\n11\nGermany saw big output changes during the crisis and recovery period with relatively little\nchange in the unemployment rate. This partly reflects Germany’s widespread adoption of\nprocedures that permitted employers to adjust worker hours easily (Burda and Hunt 2011).\nGermany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are good examples of three\nways businesses in advanced economies responded to the global financial crisis. In Germany,\nthe pattern reflects explicit policy decisions. In other countries, the reasons for the differences\nare less clear. For example, it may reflect different social models in the U.K. and the U.S.\nabout retaining jobs versus retaining wages.7 And of course, productivity growth in the U.K.\nhas been puzzlingly weak since the crisis began (see, e.g., the discussion in Bean, 2014). In\nall cases, the differences among countries in the methods businesses used to adjust output are\ndirectly reflected in the path of each country’s unemployment rate.\nV. Conclusion\nThe global financial crisis reversed the steady cross-country convergence of the Okun\nrelation observed since the 1970s. This is not explained by a reversal of secular trends in\nlabor markets. Rather, it reflects how countries responded to the crisis. Differences in the\ninstitutional framework in possible combination with government policy responses to the\ncrisis led some countries to emphasize shrinking the workforce, others to reducing hours per\nworker, and still others to letting labor productivity adjust. These differences in emphasis\nprobably contributed to divergent paths of recovery from the crisis; future work can help\ndeepen our understanding of the key differences.\nGiven the financial roots of the crisis, one policy response has been to reevaluate\nfinancial market regulation. The results in this note point to a similar issue—that events of\nrecent years should lead to a consideration of how labor-market institutions can be improved.\n7 For example, Elsby et al (2014) find much more procyclicality of real wages in the U.K. than the U.S. during the Great\nRecession.\n\n12\nData Appendix\nThe data for Figure 1 consists of a balanced panel of 15 countries: Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States. All data are quarterly. Figure 1\nuses data running from the first quarter of 1970 to the first quarter of 2013.\nReal GDP, the unemployment rate, hours per worker, and total number of workers are\nobtained from the OECD. To construct productivity as GDP per hour, we construct total\nhours as the product of hours per worker and the total number of employees.\nFor all series except unemployment, all growth rates are 100 times the 4-quarter\nchange in logs. The unemployment rate enters all regression as a simple 4-quarter change.\nReferences\nBall, Laurence M, Daniel Leigh, and Prakash Loungani (2013). “Okun’s Law: Fit at Fifty?”\nNBER Working Paper No. 18668, January.\nCharlie Bean (2014). “Sustaining the recovery.” Speech given to the North East Chamber of\nCommerce President's Club Talk, Rockcliffe Hall Hotel, Darlington, March 10.\nBasu, Susanto and John Fernald (2001). \"Why Is Productivity Procyclical?

Thank you, Spence, for that kind introduction.\nIt’s wonderful to be here today. I am honored to be speaking with a wide array of audiences—the\nparticipants of the 35th Annual Spencer Fox Eccles Convocation, members of the Utah Chapter of the\nNational Association of Corporate Directors, and members of the broader Salt Lake community. Thank\nyou so much for having me.\nI last visited Utah back in April. The new Administration had begun to provide early details of its\npolicy initiatives, and businesses, households, and communities were working hard to understand their\nimpacts. Uncertainty was a common refrain. Worries about paralysis, stagnation, even recession\ndominated the news. The national conversation had shifted from confidence to concern.1\nThen I landed in Salt Lake.\nDriving through town, I saw activity. Lots of it. Full parking lots, busy retail outlets, and, most\nnotably, construction cranes.\nCranes tell us a lot. It’s expensive to put up cranes and to keep them working. Businesses only\ndo it when they see promise in the future. Active cranes, and more being assembled, meant that people\nwere adapting, planning, and continuing to move forward. The world had changed, uncertainty had risen,\nbut it did not mean stasis—at least not here in Utah.\nThat dynamic, the ability to move forward even when things are evolving, is the topic of my\nremarks today. How to steadily keep moving in the face of change.\nBut before I go further, I want to remind you that the views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\n1 For example, small business optimism was high early in the year but deteriorated in March and April (National Federation of\nIndependent Business 2025).\n2\n\nSteps for Steadiness\nYou’ll notice, I said, steadily moving forward. Not heedlessly, recklessly, or haphazardly. But\nsteadily, taking time to consider the situation, assess the risks and the opportunities, and plot a course that\nworks in the evolving environment.\nIt turns out, that’s what businesses here in Utah had done. As I learned during my visit, they had\nstepped back, evaluated the changing landscape, and kept the cranes going. Purposefully and with\nintention.\nSo, how do you make those types of decisions, when uncertainty and change surround you? The\nfirst step is to know your goals. If you’re working on a degree program, your goals could be building and\ndeveloping your skills and interests. For businesses, it might be expanding your market or increasing\nbrand value. As a monetary policymaker, I’m focused on the dual mandate that Congress gave us: price\nstability and maximum employment.\nYour goals are your foundation. An anchor that keeps you tethered to your values and aspirations,\nand focused on what is important in times of change.\nWith those goals in mind, you assess. Understand the change you face. Is it going to affect you\ndirectly, is it going to last, what are the implications? As students, AI is probably on your mind. Asking\nhow it will impact your studies and your career goals is essential to making good decisions. As corporate\ndirectors, you’re likely also thinking about AI, as well as immigration, tariffs, deregulation, and taxes. As\na policymaker, I am focused on all of those developments and how they might shape the economy today\nand in the future.\nThis reflection, questioning, and analysis enables us to assess the tradeoffs and decide the next\nsteps. Take more classes. Put up a crane. Change the interest rate.\nAnd then it all begins again. Anchor. Assess. Decide. The virtuous cycle of remaining steady\nthrough change.\n3\n\nThe Path for Policy\nNow, you might wonder if this really works. Does steadiness really deliver reliable outcomes?\nI submit that Utah is proof. You can see it in the data. Utah is a national leader in growth and\nemployment.2 A place where entrepreneurs take smart risks—think Silicon Slopes, the Olympics, and\ncountless other businesses and initiatives. A role model for steadiness and success that lasts.\nMonetary policy makers also must practice steadiness. Making reasoned decisions that support\nour mandated goals over time.\nIndeed, we’ve relied on steadiness to navigate the changing economic landscape over the course\nof this year.\nAs I mentioned, Congress legislated two monetary policy goals for the Federal Reserve: stable\nprices and maximum employment. No matter what happens in the economy, these goals are our anchor.\nAll of our decisions are made in support of achieving those objectives for the American people.3\nThe challenge, of course, is determining how best to do that. Especially when the economy is\nrapidly evolving and we don’t have perfect clarity about how conditions will evolve. And this is where\nit’s important to step back and assess.\nEarlier in the year, there was a lot we didn’t know. Measures of uncertainty were rising sharply.4\nHouseholds and businesses were worried that tariff and immigration policies could rekindle inflation or\nslow the labor market and growth. Commentators and financial market participants wondered if the Fed\nwould need to step in, raising interest rates to combat inflation or lowering them to support growth.\nUp until last week, the FOMC did neither. Instead, we looked at inflation and how much it\nexceeded our goal for price stability. We looked at unemployment and how close it was to our maximum\n2 According to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, payroll employment growth in Utah was 1.7% over the 12\nmonths through August 2025, nearly double the national pace of 0.9%. The most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis show\nthat Utah’s real GDP grew 3.4% over the four quarters through the first quarter of this year, well above the national pace of 2.0% over the same\nperiod.\n3 Board of Governors (2025a).\n4 See, for example, Mertens (2025).\n4\n\nemployment objective. We considered the Administration’s emerging policies, consulting history,\neconomic models, scenario analysis, and the range of incoming data. Most importantly, we talked to\npeople. We asked businesses how they were feeling, but also what they were doing. We talked to\nconsumers, workers, and communities, and listened to what they told us about their concerns and their\nactions.\nWhat we determined was that the economy was doing okay. We didn’t have to race in, but we\nneeded to continue to monitor. Risks were on the horizon, but there were also positives in the mix, and it\nwas appropriate to watch how conditions evolved. Most importantly, it was critical to stay focused on our\ncommitment to bring inflation back to our 2 percent goal. So, we left the interest rate unchanged, keeping\npolicy modestly restrictive, continuing to put downward pressure on inflation. And we actively watched\nthe labor market to ensure there were no signs of stumbling.\nDeciding to collect more information is not a passive state. It is prudent preparation for taking\naction when the time is right. That moment came last week. At our most recent FOMC meeting, we\nlowered the policy rate by 25 basis points. A decision I fully supported.\nThe decision was based on information and data. Growth, consumer spending, and the labor\nmarket had slowed, 5 and inflation had risen less than expected, remaining largely confined to sectors\ndirectly affected by tariffs.6 The risks to the economy had shifted, and it was time to act.\nManaging change isn’t a one-time thing. You must keep at it. Moving forward, it is likely that\nfurther policy adjustments will be needed as we work to restore price stability while providing needed\nsupport to the labor market. This comes through in our most recent projections, released last week.7 But\n5 Growth in real personal consumption expenditures fell from 3.1% last year to 1.0% for the first half of this year (annualized), while\nreal GDP growth fell from 2.5% to 1.4%. The annualized rate of payroll employment growth fell from 1.3% last year to 0.2% over the past four\nmonths (through August).\n6 Private forecasters have revised their inflation forecasts down in recent months (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 2025). Recent\nincreases in inflation have been evident primarily for goods (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 2025).\n7 The FOMC’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections shows that Committee members in general expect further cuts this year\nand next (Board of Governors 2025b).\n5\n\nthese are projections, not promises, and making good decisions will require us to anchor on our objectives,\nassess the tradeoffs, and decide, again and again.\nSteady, Not Static\nSo, let me return to where I began. Flying into Salt Lake last April. On the ride over, I caught up\non the news. It felt pessimistic, worried about change, nervous about uncertainty. The cranes said\nsomething different.\nAs you start your academic year, I want you to think about those cranes. Remind yourself that\nchange and uncertainty are normal parts of life. And that people move through them all the time.\nBut you can’t leave it to luck. Being steady through change takes intention. And it takes\ncommitment. Commitment to your goals, to collecting the evidence, to deciding. And most of all, it takes\na commitment to be humble. Willing to repeat the process of anchoring, assessing, and deciding each\ntime a new change comes your way.\nIn my view, this is the success of the Eccles family. It is the success of the businesses who put up\nthose cranes. And it is also your success. The success that you’ve started as you begin another academic\nyear.\nThank you and I look forward to our discussion.\n6\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2025a. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy.” Adopted effective January 24, 2012; as amended effective August 22, 2025.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2025b. “Summary of Economic Projections.” September 17.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. 2025. “Third Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 2025. “PCE Inflation Contributions from Goods and Services.”\nMertens, Thomas. 2025. “SF FedViews: July 17, 2025.” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nNational Federation of Independent Business. 2025. “Small Business Economic Trends.” August.\n7",

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Commonwealth Club\nSan Francisco, CA\nMarch 26, 2019\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction and warm welcome. Good afternoon,\neveryone. The Commonwealth Club’s history of providing forums for healthy public\ndebate is well known, not only in the Bay Area but across the country. So it’s a real\nhonor to be addressing you today.\nI became President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\njust about six months ago. The monetary policy decisions we make at the Federal\nOpen Market Committee eight times a year have wide-ranging implications. In fact,\nour work touches the lives of every American and countless global citizens. So this is\na responsibility I take very seriously. And I’m here this afternoon to talk about how I\nsee our economic landscape and what I’ll be paying attention to in the year ahead.\nBut first, I need to issue the standard disclaimer: the remarks I’m about to\ndeliver are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the\nFederal Reserve System.\n1\n\nCurrent Conditions\nLet me begin by telling you about the Federal Reserve’s mission, and how we\njudge success. Our job is to promote a healthy and stable economy, and we do this by\npursuing two goals.\nThe first goal is maximum employment. This generally means that everyone\nwho wants a job can get one. The second goal is price stability, which the Federal\nReserve defines as an inflation rate of 2 percent.1 This allows the dollar in your pocket\nto hold its value over time. Taken together, we call this our dual mandate: maximum\nemployment and price stability.\nSo given that mandate and our two goals, it’s reasonable to ask, how’s the Fed\nbeen doing?\nLet’s start with the overall health of the economy. We’re on track to set a\nrecord for the longest period without a recession in U.S. history. It will extend past\nthe 10-year mark this summer. The economy looks to have grown just over 3 percent\nin 2018, well above its sustainable pace. And while I see some signs of slowing on the\nhorizon this year, I expect annual growth will come in around 2 percent—in line with\nits long-run trend.2\nThe strength of the economy has led to a robust labor market. In fact, the\nperformance of the labor market has been nothing short of extraordinary. For\nexample, last year we saw nearly 2.7 million jobs added to the payrolls. In addition to\nbeing a big number, that’s more than twice the amount we need to keep pace with\nnew entrants and reentrants coming in to the labor force.3 Meanwhile, unemployment\nremains near its 50-year low.\n1 Board of Governors (2012).\n2 Fernald (2019).\n3 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016).\n2\n\nEconomic models—as well as historical data—tell us that a\nprolonged economic expansion and a very tight labor market should be pushing\ninflation up to, or even above, our 2 percent goal. But that’s not what we’re\nexperiencing today. Inflation has remained low—lower than our 2 percent target—for\nmost of the past decade. We’ve grazed 2 percent here and there, including briefly last\nyear. But it hasn’t been sustainable.\nSo on our dual mandate report card, I feel good about where we are on\nemployment—but a little less so about inflation.\nDisrupted Links\nSo what’s up with inflation? Is it time to throw out our models and start from\nscratch? Have the fundamental laws of supply and demand broken down? And what\ndoes all of this mean for monetary policy? That’s what I’m going to spend the rest of\nmy time today addressing—the inflation puzzle and what we should make of it.\nLet’s start by considering how the links between employment and inflation\nhave traditionally functioned. To do that, we have to go back to Econ 101, and review\nhow monetary policy affects the economy.\nIn short, the Federal Reserve sets interest rates. These interest rates determine\nborrowing costs. Borrowing costs drive consumer and business spending, which in\nturn determines the level of economic activity. When economic activity is high, the\nlabor market heats up. A hot labor market allows workers to demand higher wages.\nAnd employers pass these wage gains on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\nThose are the basics of how things work—in theory, at least. But as a\npolicymaker, I have to focus on the practical. And in the real world, things crop up\nthat disrupt the simple linkages between monetary policy and the economy. Because\nI’m an economist, I like to call these things “wedges.” And understanding these\nwedges goes a long way toward understanding the inflation puzzle we’re facing.\n3\n\nWage and Price Wedges\nWhile there are several wedges that complicate the simple theory connecting\nmonetary policy to the economy, the ones I will focus on today relate to employment,\nwages, and prices.\nAs a Reserve Bank President, I spend a lot of time talking to businesses,\nworkers, and community members about what they’re experiencing. And what’s loud\nand clear these days is that the labor market is changing.\nAn example I hear again and again is the increasing demand from employees\nfor alternative forms of compensation. Employers are being asked to provide benefits\nlike free transportation, flexible workweeks, unlimited time off, and help with things\nlike student loan repayment and even housing. Many employers are providing these\nbenefits in an effort to attract and retain talent. And for some firms, they’ve become a\nmeaningful part of employee compensation packages.\nThe challenge for policymakers is that these alternative forms of payment aren’t\nbeing captured in the traditional measures we use to track wages and salaries.\nThis creates a wedge between the strong labor market we observe and our\navailable indicators of wage growth, and it mutes the signal we’re receiving about the\nstrength of the economy.\nAnother important wedge that’s been evolving over several decades is the loss\nof worker bargaining power.4 Declining unionization—along with increased\nautomation and globalization—have made it harder for workers to push for higher\npay, even in very healthy job markets.5 This weakens the link between employment\nand wage growth.\nOf course, workers aren’t the only group affected by these changing dynamics.\nMany firms have lost pricing power in a global marketplace, facing ever-increasing\n4 Krueger (2018) and Farber et al. (2018).\n5 Haldane (2018).\n4\n\ncompetition to hold onto customers.6 This means they have a harder\ntime passing along rising costs, such as wages, to final goods prices.\nAll of these wedges are contributing to the situation we have today: a strong\neconomy with a tight labor market—but muted inflation.7\nThe Fed Wedge\nThere’s another wedge weakening the link between economic activity and\ninflation, and it might surprise you. It’s the Fed.\nThe actions of the Federal Reserve—and the success of its monetary\npolicymaking decisions—have played an important role in keeping inflation tethered\naround 2 percent, in good times and bad.\nTo explain how, we need to go back to one of those bad times. In the 1970s, a\nseries of economic shocks hit. One shock was an oil embargo that pushed up oil\nprices. Because of the cost-of-living adjustments written into many workers’ contracts,\nthis automatically translated into wage increases. These wage increases led to price\nincreases. And when the Fed didn’t react aggressively enough to stem the rising\ninflation, a vicious cycle began.\nPeople started to think high inflation was just a fact of life. Inflation eventually\npeaked in the double digits. It wasn’t until the Fed raised interest rates dramatically\nthat inflation finally started to decline. But, as some will remember, that was a painful\nprocess.\nOnce inflation was under control, the Fed committed to keeping it that way.\nThis commitment became a well-known and accepted position that people could\ndepend on. And it ushered in the conditions that dominate today—the era of well-\nanchored inflation expectations.\n6 Cavallo (2018), Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido (2010), and Rogoff (2006).\n7 Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi (2019), Galí and Gambetti (2018), Leduc and Wilson (2017), Blanchard (2016), and Coibion\nand Gorodnichenko (2015).\n5\n\nWe see this shift in the data. Inflation expectations—of both\nbusinesses and consumers—started trending down in the late 1980s, and have\nremained close to the Fed’s 2 percent target since the mid-1990s.8\nWell-anchored inflation expectations have great benefits. When people know\nthat the Fed is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent, they’re more likely to see\ninflation fluctuations as temporary, and stop short of building them into contracts like\nwage and rental agreements.\nIn other words, when the Fed is credible, it’s easier for the economic system to\nabsorb shocks. This keeps inflation from plummeting when the economy is weak, and\na lid on inflation when the economy is strong.9\nBut here’s the twist. When the Federal Reserve is doing its job well, the link\nbetween economic activity and inflation is weaker—much like we see today. This is\nthe essence of the “Fed wedge.”\nMaintaining Credibility in a Low-Inflation Environment\nSo what does all of this mean for monetary policy?\nAs I mentioned earlier, inflation has generally been low for the past decade. In\nfact, for the past seven years, inflation has consistently come in below our 2 percent\ntarget.\nThis may not seem like much of a problem at first glance. After all, isn’t it a\ngood thing when prices stay roughly the same?\nBut too-low inflation has its own risks. It makes the chance of deflation—or\nnegative inflation—more likely. And it makes it harder for the Fed to adjust interest\nrates in the face of economic shocks.10\n8 Andreasen and Christensen (2016), Nechio (2015), and Williams (2006).\n9 Jordà et al. (2019).\n10 Bernanke (2002).\n6\n\nThe bigger problem is that the Fed has explicitly stated that 2\npercent is our goal, and that this goal is symmetric. This means we care just as much\nabout long periods of too-low inflation as we do about long periods of too-high\ninflation.11\nInflation consistently below target tugs at inflation expectations. While there is\nno sign today that the anchor has drifted down significantly, we are seeing signs that\ninflation expectations are edging lower.12 This bears close watching.\nWe need to be vigilant on this front, and work to deliver 2 percent inflation on\na sustained basis. The Federal Reserve’s continued credibility with consumers and\nbusinesses depends on it.\nConclusion\nLet me end with a few closing thoughts. The Federal Reserve’s credibility is\none of our most important assets. It isn’t just about having people believe the things\nwe say—though of course that’s important. Fed credibility is the foundation of our\nability to make effective monetary policy.\nThe American people put a lot of trust in the Federal Reserve System. We\nworked hard to earn that trust. We intend to keep earning it every day.\nThank you.\n11 Board of Governors (2019).\n12 Daly (2019), Williams (2019), and Cao and Shapiro (2016).\n7\n\nReferences\nAndreasen, Martin M., and Jens H.E.

This has\ncontributed to slower labor force growth and resulted in considerable gaps between labor force\nparticipation in the U.S. and its industrialized peers. In this paper we examine the drivers of this trend,\nfocusing specifically on prime-age men (aged 25–54). We compare non-participation rates across four\ngenerations – the Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials – and decompose\ngenerational gaps into “push” and “pull” factors that are intended to be descriptive, rather than causal, by\ndesign. We define pull factors as those that draw men out of the labor force such as schooling or\ncaretaking. Push factors are those that limit labor market opportunities, such as skills mismatch or\ndisability. Our findings suggest that both pull and push factors are important with the most notable being\nskills mismatch, caretaking responsibilities, and prolonged continuing education.\nKeywords: labor force participation, prime-age men, cohort analysis\nJEL codes: J11, J16, J21, J82\nThe views in this paper are solely the responsibility of the authors and should not be interpreted as\nreflecting the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System.\n1\n\nIntroduction\nIn 1960, 1 in 35 men between the ages of 25 and 54 were on the sidelines of the labor force. By 2023, that\nnumber rose to 1 in 9. This has significant implications for the economy because prime-age men make up\nover one third of the work force, so forces affecting labor force participation for prime-age men will have\nan outsized impact on the economy as a whole. In the short run, missing workers increase labor market\ntightness, and in the long run this shortfall has a negative consequence for the growth of the U.S. economy.\nIf prime-age men in the present day participated in the labor force at the same rate as their counterparts\nin 1960, there would have been around 5.0 million more prime-age men in the labor force in 2023. By way\nof comparison, the average gap between the number of job vacancies and the unemployed in 2023 was\n3.3 million workers. Based purely on numbers, the amount of “missing” prime-age men would be more\nthan enough to fill this vacancy gap.\nThe rise in the male labor force non-participation rate is also a critical national issue, both for the well-\nbeing of individuals, families, and communities and for the economy’s ability to grow. Employment, and\nmore broadly labor force attachment, is one of the primary ways that individuals gain human capital and\nincrease their earnings and earnings potential. The labor force attachment of prime-age individuals (those\nbetween the ages of 25 and 54) is of particular importance because these are core years for generating\nlabor income and workforce experience. The non-participation rate for prime-age men has been steadily\nincreasing since the 1950s (Figure 1). In the 1950s, on average just 2.9% of prime-age men were non-\nparticipants (not working and not looking for work). By 2023, this fraction had risen to 10.9%, more than\nthree times as high. Notably, this pattern of increased labor force non-participation is more prominent for\ngroups of prime-age men that tend to have less favorable economic outcomes, such as black men and men\nwithout a college degree.\nFigure 1. Labor force non-participation rate for prime-age men\nNote: Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and authors’ calculations.\n2\n\nIn this paper we consider key drivers of this long-term increase in non-participation. Studying why men no\nlonger participate will help understand whether non-participation trends will continue, slow, or reverse.\nThis topic has a robust body of existing work. Past researchers have noted the role of industry structure,\npartially due to increased import competition from China (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2013), robotization\n(Acemoglu and Restrepo 2017), skills mismatch (Valletta and Barlow 2018, Council of Economic Advisors\n2016), health concerns and disability (Binder and Bound 2019, Krueger 2017), improved leisure technology\n(Aguiar, Bils, Charles and Hurst 2021), a rise in temporary spells of non-participation (Coglianese 2018), as\nwell as population aging (Van Zandweghe 2012, Abraham and Kearney 2020).1 Our work adds to this\nliterature in two dimensions: first, we focus on generational comparisons, which naturally side-steps\nexplanations based on age structure and is studied less often in the existing literature, and second, we\nfocus on a range of composite drivers or factors to explain the rise in non-participation.\nOur analysis focuses on four generations – the Silent Generation (born 1928 – 1945), Baby Boomers (born\n1946 – 1964), Generation X (born 1965 – 1980), and Millennials (born 1981 – 1996). Figure 2 plots non-\nparticipation rates for prime-age men over the life cycle for these four generations. The life cycle curves\ndemonstrate that, for the most part, non-participation rates have been rising in each successive generation\nat each age, which is particularly evident for Millennial men in their late 20’s and early 30’s.\nFigure 2. Life cycle non-participation rate for prime-age men by generation\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\n1 If “gig” work is under-measured or under-reported in common surveys such as the CPS (meaning that “gig”\nworkers get incorrectly classified as ‘non-participants’ rather than as ‘employed’), a rise in “gig” work (Abraham et\nal. 2021) could make the measured labor force participation rate lower than the true participation rate. This would\ncontribute upward pressure to the non-participation rate, but the presence of this kind of mis-classification is\ndifficult to measure. Moreover, rising “gig” work is likely relevant only towards the end of our sample, but non-\nparticipation has been rising throughout.\n3\n\nFigure 2 also shows that younger men across earlier generations tend to have somewhat higher non-\nparticipation rates that decline until about age 30 and then increase for the rest of their lifespans.\nMillennial men, on the other hand, start with much higher non-participation rates in their late 20’s that\nrapidly decrease and reach a minimum later in life, around the mid-30’s, increasing only slightly after that.\nComparing life cycle dynamics across generations suggests that the trends in rising non-participation rates\nreflect a phenomenon that is unlikely to naturally wane as time passes, though non-participation rates for\nolder Millennials show some progress. With that in mind, the goal of this paper is to study the drivers of\ngenerational gaps in non-participation rates and to understand why life cycle non-participation dynamics\nof Millennial men look different from the dynamics of earlier generations.\nTo accomplish this, we consider a number of factors, synthesizing them into those that draw individuals\nout of the labor force by choice (such as delaying entry into the labor force due to schooling, training, or\nshifting caretaking responsibilities2; pull factors) and factors that push or leave individuals out of the labor\nforce (such as skills mismatch, a lack of available jobs, or having a disability; push factors). We use “push”\nand “pull” as descriptive groupings to frame our analysis, not as labels that imply causality in either\ndirection. Our approach allows us to distinguish gaps that policymakers might want to close from those\nthat reflect personal choices or circumstances that are unlikely to be targets of policy intervention.\nWe formalize the evidence for our push and pull factors with regression models that estimate how each\nfactor relates to labor force non-participation patterns conditional on age, demographics, and\nmacroeconomic conditions. The analysis is based on over 45 years (1976-2023) of microdata from the U.S.\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS). As Figure 2 shows, non-participation has a clear life cycle pattern and has\nshifted up systematically across generations. While the literature has focused on explaining unconditional\ntime-series patterns, our generational analysis allows us to see how the effects of each push and pull factor\nchange over time across the age distribution.\nWhen we explain generational gaps in non-participation with push and pull factors, we find that all the\npush and pull factors we consider have some role in changing non-participation rates. Notably, a\nsubstantial portion of the larger gap for younger Millennials relative to earlier generations is explained by\nprolonged continuing education (a pull factor). Skills mismatch (a push factor) and caretaking (a pull factor)\nalso play an important role at all ages.\nAn implication of our findings is that there is not one easy solution to bolster prime-age male labor force\nparticipation. While the solutions still elude us, the impacts are clear. Families left more vulnerable to\neconomic decline, a rising share of prime-age workers on publicly provided benefits, and slower labor\nforce and potential output growth for the nation. Understanding the phenomenon and the extent to which\nthe outcomes we observe reflect incentives that pull individuals out of the labor force or constraints that\npush them and keep them out remains important work.\n2 We classify caretaking as a pull factor because for prime-age men in particular, being out of the labor force for\nreasons related to caretaking may be likely to reflect a lifestyle choice, given prevailing social norms over the\nsample we study. We recognize that this characterization is not applicable to every case and that there is some\nambiguity in whether caretaking is a push or pull factor.\n4\n\nBasic trends in non-participation rates\nLabor force status in the U.S. is measured in a monthly survey of individuals from about 60,000 households\n(the CPS) by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS releases the underlying monthly data, which\nare available at the individual level and include information about individuals’ labor market status and\ndemographic characteristics. We use the monthly microdata from 1976 on in our calculations and analysis\n(with some exceptions due to the availability of specific variables, as noted when relevant). Our analysis\nfocuses on male respondents who were prime-age at the time of their interview.\nThe broad rise in non-participation seen in Figure 1 holds across groups of prime-age men, such as race\nand ethnicity and age group (Council of Economic Advisors 2016); however, research suggests that labor\nforce participation rates across race, education levels, and age groups often evolve differently with a wide\nrange of reasons affecting the behavior of each group (Pérez-Arce and Prados 2020). This variation in non-\nparticipation rates by demographic groups is relevant for our subsequent analysis.\nFigure 3 demonstrates increasing non-participation rates across white, Black, and Hispanic prime-age\nmen. From the late 1970’s until 2023, rates for Black men rose from about 11% to about 16%, for Hispanic\nmen from about 7% to 9%, and for white men from about 5% to 10%. Rates for Black prime-age men are\nthe highest overall and increased at a somewhat faster pace than the rates for white and Hispanic men.\nHispanic males experienced the slowest pace of increase in non-participation rates, and as a result, their\nnon-participation rate fell below that for whites starting in the early 2000’s.\nFigure 3. Labor force non-participation rate for prime-age men by race and ethnicity\nNote: Linear trend lines shown in lighter shade. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\n5\n\nWhile labor force non-participation tends to increase during recessions and slowly and partially recover\nduring expansions, demographic groups have a different degree of reaction to the business cycle. Hispanic\nand Black men are more sensitive to business cycles. Non-participation rates of these groups react more\nstrongly to economic ups and downs than do rates for white men, as seen by the higher volatility of the\ngreen and, especially, red lines around their trends in Figure 3. This mirrors well-documented findings that\nBlack individuals have higher and more cyclical unemployment rates than individuals of other races and\nethnicities, though there has been some improvement over the past decades (Cajner et al. 2017, Duzhak\n2021). Given the upward trend in non-participation, rates generally do not return to their pre-recession\nvalues during subsequent recoveries (the exception being after the COVID 19 pandemic and recession);\nhowever, the long recovery from the 2007-2009 recession significantly lowered non-participation rates to\nbelow or close to overall trends for most groups. We observe a similar fall in non-participation rates after\nthe pandemic-induced recession. During that time, non-participation rates for Black men decreased to a\nlevel not seen since 2007, and rates for other groups fell as well. These cyclical patterns have motivated a\nnumber of studies to examine whether the decline in the labor force participation rate is cyclical or\nstructural. Findings suggest a mix of both, and there does not seem to be a strong consensus\n(Congressional Budget Office 2014, Aaronson et al. 2012, Van Zandweghe 2012).\nFigure 4. Life cycle non-participation rate for prime-age men by generation and race/ethnicity\nWhite Black Hispanic\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nWhile life cycle patterns in non-participation rates vary by demographic group, we continue to see\nsystematic generational gaps in these life cycle patterns across groups. This indicates that demographics\nalone cannot explain why non-participation has risen across generations and also underscores the idea\nthat the simple passage of time is unlikely to bring down non-participation rates. Figure 4 is analogous to\nFigure 2 but shows trends for Black, white, and Hispanic prime-age men across generations. As we saw in\nthe time series in Figure 3, non-participation rates are higher for Black individuals. Non-participation rates\nfor Hispanic men show less pronounced changes between generations, except for young Millennials,\nwhose non-participation rates across the life cycle look much like those for white Millennials. These less\npronounced generational differences in Hispanic non-participation rates are likely driven by the changing\ndemographic composition of the U.S. labor force. Foreign-born Hispanic men have one of the highest labor\nforce participation rates, as many come to the U.S. to find jobs to support their families abroad. After the\n1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the flow of immigrants from Latin America increased significantly.\nIf in 1960 the share of the Hispanic population born in Latin America was 0.5%, by 2019 this number\n6\n\nincreased to 6.5% (Hanson et al. 2023). This flow of foreign-born Hispanic men likely helped hold down\nnon-participation rates for this group, at least through Generation X.\nFigure 5. Non-participation rate for prime-age men by education\nNote: Linear trend lines shown in lighter shade. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nNon-participation rates also vary by educational attainment, with college graduates typically having the\nlowest rates. Those with no post-secondary education experienced a faster rise in non-participation, seen\nin the steeper slope for that education category in Figure 5. In fact, non-participation rates for men with\nat most a high school degree increased at more than twice the speed of those with at least a college\ndegree, reaching about 16% by the end of our sample as opposed to 6% for college graduates. The gap in\nnon-participation rates between the most and least educated has widened as a result. The figure also\nshows that the non-participation rate for individuals with at least a college degree increases the least\nduring recessions (in percentage points), indicating that the rate for this group is the least sensitive to\nbusiness cycle fluctuations. Though non-participation growth rates and levels are higher for those with\nless education, we also know that the fraction of individuals with a college degree is higher in younger\ngenerations. As these younger generations age and make up more of the prime-age population, that may\nput downward pressure on non-participation rates overall. Figure 6 supports the idea of lower non-\nparticipation rates for men with more years of education by comparing non-participation rates over the\nlife cycle by educational attainment. The non-participation “curves” look very different for each education\ngroup. For men with post-secondary degrees, non-participation rates are highest at younger ages (i.e., 25–\n30), lowest around the late 30’s, and then increase as men start reaching the age for retirement. Men with\nthe fewest years of education have non-participation rates that remain flat or slightly upward sloping at\nyounger ages. Rates then rise steadily with age, reaching a much higher level at older ages, although rates\n7\n\nfor high school educated Millennial men have remained largely flat. The patterns for men with some\ncollege education are a mix of what we see for the high school or less group and the college or more group.\nThough the shapes and levels of these life cycle trends differ by educational attainment, we still see rising\nnon-participation across generations in each group.\nFigure 6. Life cycle non-participation rate for prime-age men by generation and education\nHigh school or less Some college College or more\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nThe same conclusion holds when we compare prime-age men in other groups as well. For example, non-\nparticipation rates for rural populations of prime-age men for all generations reach a higher level at older\nages than rates in urban populations, but generational participation gaps persist across both groups (Figure\nA5).3 The time series and corresponding generational patterns shown above broadly suggest that\ndemographics help us interpret the overall rise in non-participation we see but are not the only force\nbehind the generational shifts.\nDrivers of rising non-participation rates\nMethods\nThe rise in male labor force non-participation in the U.S. is a much studied but still puzzling phenomenon.\nResearch has pointed to various potential drivers that contribute to the overall trend, but none of them\nalone can explain the persistence of the trend over time (Krause and Sawhill 2017, Binder and Bound 2019,\nand Abraham and Kearney 2020 make related points). Rather than focus on any one factor, we consider a\nnumber of factors that push and pull individuals out of the labor force. To put the patterns above together,\nwe formalize our study of prime-age men’s non-participation with a regression framework that allows us\nto account for generational differences, demographics, and age effects. With this method, we can both\ncontrol for population shifts in demographic, push, and pull factors across generations as well as compare\nhow non-participation’s sensitivity to these factors differs within and across generations.\nWe rely on individual-level regressions using the microdata from the CPS that control for a set of key\ndemographic factors that our summary figures above suggest may explain variation in non-participation\n3 The Appendix contains time series figures of demographic breakdowns by residence (urban and rural) and marital\nstatus, as well as figures showing generational lifecycle non-participation rates.\n8\n\nrates. Our core model estimates the relationship between age and labor force non-participation for prime-\nage men in each generation separately. The structure of our specification is:\n𝑁𝐼𝐿𝐹 =𝛽 𝑨 +𝛽 𝑿 + 𝛽 𝑈𝑅 + 𝛾 + 𝜖 (1)\n𝑖𝑠𝑡 1 𝑖𝑡 2 𝑖𝑡 3 𝑡 𝑠 𝑖𝑠𝑡\nwhere NILF is a 0/1 indicator for being out of the labor force, A is a full set of age indicators (with\ncoefficient vector 𝛽 ), 𝑿 is a set of demographic characteristics (indicators for race/ethnicity, educational\n1\nattainment, marital status, urban/rural residence, and state-specific female labor force participation\nrates), and 𝛾 are state fixed effects. The subscripts i, s, and t index the individual, state, and time (in\n𝑠\nmonths).\nBecause we want to focus on factors not relating to the business cycle, we control for market conditions\nwith the national unemployment rate (UR).4 The regressions and all summary figures are weighted using\nthe standard monthly weights in the CPS microdata and standard errors are clustered by birth year. With\nthis specification, the coefficients tell us how much a change in a given explanatory variable is expected to\nchange the probability of being out of the labor force (where a coefficient of 0.01 is a 1 percentage point\nincrease in the probability of non-participation).\nBaseline specification results\nTable 1 shows selected coefficients. The results in the table corroborate the patterns in the figures above.\nRelative to white prime-age males, the probability of being out of the labor force is higher for Black men\nand men who are not white, Black, or Hispanic (the ‘other’ group). Notably, the relationships between\nrace/ethnicity and non-participation are mostly getting weaker for each subsequent generation with\nHispanic men being an exception. Non-participation rates are lower for those with some college and lower\nstill for those with a college degree or more relative to men with a high school degree or less. Unmarried\nmen have higher non-participation rates than do married men, and men living in rural areas are more likely\nto be out of the labor force than urban residents. Female labor force participation is negatively correlated\nwith prime-age men’s non-participation (positively correlated with prime-age men’s participation) for all\ngenerations but the Silent Generation, reflecting that after about 2000, non-participation rates for men\nand women started to trend in a similar way. Finally, as we saw earlier, non-participation rates do move\nwith the business cycle: the coefficient on the national unemployment rate is generally positive and\nsignificant.\n4 Some research indicates that prevailing economic conditions at the time of graduation have a sustained effect on\nearnings (Kahn 2010, Schwandt and von Wachter 2019), and could plausibly also affect labor force participation\ndecisions. We do not include these conditions as a control since our ability to observe an individual’s labor force\nentry decision is limited.\n9\n\nTable 1.

Since we are\ninterested in adjusted non-participation rates at each age rather than the marginal effect at each age, we plot\n11\n\ncharacteristics, we find that non-participation rates are systematically higher across the age distribution in\neach subsequent generation. Moreover, the non-participation rate gaps between each generation with\nthe demographic controls are quite similar to the gaps obtained by taking simple means in Figure 2. In\nboth figures, we see that life cycle dynamics differ for Millennials. In earlier generations, non-participation\nrates decline slightly through about age 30 and then increase with age. For Millennials, non-participation\nrates start out notably higher than rates for same-aged men in other generations and decline at a faster\npace. After reaching a minimum at a slightly older age than in prior generations, non-participation rates\nfor Millennials slowly increase. At the same time, there are a few notable differences between the raw and\nregression-adjusted results. First, regression-adjusted curves start at lower non-participation rates.\nSecond, the regression-adjusted rates for men in their 20’s do not decline as much as the simple means in\nFigure 2. As a result, the adjusted curves are flatter for younger men, particularly from the Millennial\ngeneration. This reflects the impact of demographic factors on non-participation rates, particularly those\nfactors that are more prevalent at younger ages. Additionally, for Millennials, adjusted rates reach a\nminimum much sooner (around age 30) than when using simple means (around age 35). This keeps\nregression-adjusted rates for Millennials above those of the prior generation, unlike the convergence seen\nin the unadjusted means in Figure 2.\nForces that push and pull prime-age men out of the labor force\nThe finding that non-participation rate gaps are similar with and without demographic controls is\nconsistent with the notion that demographic changes cannot explain all of the persistent rise in non-\nparticipation rates. As there is still a sizable portion of the generational differences that cannot be\nexplained by demographic and regional factors, we are still left with the question: what keeps prime-age\nmen out of the labor force?\nWe explore two potential classes of factors that could help explain rising non-participation across\ngenerations: 1) not participating or delaying labor market entry due to the draw of other opportunities or\nobligations (pull factors), and 2) leaving (or not entering) the labor force due to the lack of opportunities\n(push factors). The main factors we consider are delayed entry due to continuing education, caretaking\n(pull factors), having a disability, and skills mismatch or lack of available jobs (push factors).6\nTo do this, we consider each push and pull factor in turn, augmenting Equation (1) with variables that proxy\nfor the particular push or pull factor (𝑭 ):\n𝒊𝒔𝒕\n𝑁𝐼𝐿𝐹 =𝛽 𝐴 +𝛽 𝑿 + 𝛽 𝑈𝑅 + 𝛾 +𝛽 𝑭 + 𝜖 (2)\n𝑖𝑠𝑡 1 𝑖𝑡 2 𝑖𝑡 3 𝑡 𝑠 4 𝒊𝒔𝒕 𝑖𝑠𝑡\nPull factor: additional years of schooling\nPrime-age men may be drawn out of the labor force or delay entry to pursue additional education. Lower\nlabor force participation in younger generations due to schooling is not necessarily a bad outcome because\nadjusted average age effects. For a given age, a, this is calculated as the average model-predicted non-participation\nrate assuming (counterfactually) that everyone were age a.\n6 The length of the sample varies by individual push and pull factors. For consistency and as a robustness check,\nAppendix Table A1 presents results with all controls and factors together, thereby using a common set of years and\nage ranges for all factors. The key comparisons are qualitatively similar in these results.\n12\n\nthose who complete more years of school will probably re-join the labor force later and will likely have\nbetter long-term outcomes (e.g. Card 1999, Valletta 2019).\nFigure 8. Generational difference in life cycle non-participation rate by reason for non-participation\nA. Millennial and Baby Boomer prime-age men B. Millennial and Generation X prime-age men\nNote: Figure based on respondent-given reasons for not being in the labor force at the time of the survey interview.\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nEducational attainment beyond high school (e.g., college and vocational and technical training) has\nincreased over time. Figure 8 illustrates how this is reflected in higher temporary absence from the labor\nforce due to schooling. Examining the difference between Millennials’ and Baby Boomers’ non-\nparticipation rates shows that education explains a large portion of the gap at younger ages, a pattern\ncommon across most racial/ethnic groups. This gap shrinks at older ages, reaching near zero at around age\n40.\nWe see this pattern of initially large and then shrinking generational differences in non-participation due\nto schooling for all education groups. This suggests that the pattern is not only due to more men attending\ncollege, but also due to increased attendance of technical programs, two-year colleges, and graduate\nschools. In fact, for 25–30 year old men who indicated being out of the labor force due to schooling, across\nall years in our sample, between 11% and 21% had a high school degree or less at the time of survey, 35%–\n45% had some college, and 34%–49% had a bachelor’s degree or more. To corroborate this analytically,\nwe run a version of Equation (1) with “non-participation due to schooling” as the dependent variable\n(results available upon request). We find that having some college education and having a bachelor’s\ndegree or more both increase the probability of being out of the labor force due to schooling, relative to\nhaving a high school degree or less. The impact of post-secondary education is significant across all\ngenerations and the coefficients increase with each generation, suggesting that this pull factor has become\na stronger force over time. Thus, as a larger share of the population pursues additional education, being\nout of the labor force due to schooling will likely continue to drive up the non-participation rate for\nyounger men in subsequent generations. As a matter of fact, the National Student Clearinghouse Research\n13\n\nCenter reported that 2024 enrollment numbers were notably higher for both college and certificate\nprograms, particularly for students aged 21 and up.7\nProlonged education explains some of the atypical shape of the life cycle non-participation rate profile for\nMillennial men (seen in Figure 2 and described above). To explain the difference, we perform a\ncounterfactual exercise where we calculate what would have happened if Millennial men were out of the\nlabor force due to schooling at the same rate as men in Generation X of the same age. Figure 9 shows the\ncounterfactual as a black dotted line. It demonstrates that in the absence of their higher rate of non-\nparticipation due to schooling, Millennials’ non-participation profile would look more like the parallel\nupward shift seen between previous generations. Furthermore, these men will likely join the labor force\nat higher rates than their counterparts with less education because labor force participation rises with\neducational attainment. This helps explain why non-participation rates for Millennials have risen less with\nage and have bridged the gap to Generation X.\nFigure 9. Life cycle non-participation rate for prime-age men by generation with a counterfactual for\nMillennial men\nNote: The counterfactual assumes Millennial men are out of the labor force due to schooling at the same rate as\nmen from Generation X of the same age.\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nHowever, even after accounting for schooling, younger generations of prime-age men have higher non-\nparticipation rates than earlier generations do, so this pull factor cannot explain the full difference in\ngenerational gaps. Therefore, other reasons must still contribute to the gap in non-participation, as we can\nsee in the sizable persistent gaps attributable to caretaking and the catch-all ‘other’ reasons (Figure 8). As\nMillennials have stayed in school longer than men in previous generations have, they may also delay other\n7 See https://nscresearchcenter.org/current-term-enrollment-estimates/.\n14\n\nmilestones of adulthood, such as marriage and having children. In the next section, we will discuss how\nthis social phenomenon has impacted male labor force participation rates.\nPull factor: caretaking and family obligations\nAn increasing share of prime-age men cite caretaking the main reason for being out of the labor force. At\nthe same time, the share of prime-age women out of the labor force to take care of family members\ndecreased from around 91% in the late 1970s to 61% in 2023. An aging population and shifts in childcare\nresponsibilities may have increased the number of prime-age men caring for their children and other\nrelatives, putting upward pressure on non-participation rates relative to earlier generations. Accordingly,\nwe find that the fraction of men not participating due to caretaking is higher in each generation, with\nroughly parallel upward shifts from one generation to the next.\nTo understand what might be driving these patterns at an individual level, we examine how factors that\ncapture the need and the capacity to be a caregiver interact with labor force non-participation. These\nfactors are whether there are children in the household and if so, of what ages, and whether any other\nhousehold member is employed.8 The former captures the need for caretaking, and the latter captures\nthe capacity of prime-age men to leave the labor force to be caretakers. We add these as separate\ncategorical variables (main effects) and as interactions to our baseline specification. For the presence of\nchildren, we use four categories: 1) no children present (the omitted category), 2) one or more children\naged 0-5 present, 3) one or more children aged 6-17 present, and 4) one or more children in both age\ngroups present. For the employment of other household members, we have two categories, defined from\nthe perspective of the prime-age man: 1) no other household members are employed9 (the omitted\ncategory), and 2) at least one other household member is employed. This variable is a proxy for the\nemployment status and earnings capacity of a prime-age man’s partner, and thus also a proxy for\nhousehold income or wealth. These concepts, along with the female labor force participation rate, are\nimportant controls given generational lifecycle changes in the entry of women into the labor force (Goldin\nand Mitchell 2017) and the effects this may have on the prevalence of dual earner households, including\nthose in which women earn higher wages than male partners (Hotchkiss et al. 2017), and changes in\nchildcare needs.\nFor this analysis, we use data back to 1982, as this is the first year in which we can reliably identify the\nages of a household’s children. We additionally restrict the sample to prime-age men age 42 and younger,\nwhich is the age of the oldest Millennial in our sample. This makes the samples of men used in each\ngeneration’s regression more comparable, which is important because of strong life cycle patterns in\nmarriage and non-linearities in household composition.10 For example, younger and older prime-age men\nare less likely to have young children at home than men in the middle of the prime-age range.\n8 We focus on caregiving for young children because identifying households in which prime-age men face eldercare\nobligations is more difficult. For example, older relatives requiring care may live in a different household.\n9 “no other household members are employed” does not imply that the prime-age man in question is employed.\nHe may be employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force.\n10 Note that using data starting in 1982 means that the age range for the Silent Generation is 37–42. Though this\nage range is less comparable to the age range in the other generations, results for the Silent Generation still\nprovide a useful comparison.\n15\n\nTable 2.

The regressions are weighted using the\nstandard monthly weights in the CPS microdata and standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered by birth year.\nMeans of key controls shown at the bottom of the table.\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nThe results are in Table 2. Unmarried prime-age men are more likely to be out of the labor force than\nmarried prime-age men. This echoes our baseline results (Table 1), though here the relationship between\nbeing unmarried and non-participation is weaker for all generations. This likely reflects the correlation\n16\n\nbetween marriage and having children and that prime-age men with children are more likely to be in the\nlabor force (discussed further below).11 The pattern that unmarried prime-age men are more likely to be\nout of the labor force than married prime-age men has been documented in prior work, such as Rothstein\n(2019), Binder and Bound (2019), and Lafortune et al. (2024), who document participation rate gaps across\nvarious groups. Results from Blandin, Jones, and Yang (2023) suggest that this may result from marriage\nitself encouraging employment (and thus labor force participation) rather than from assortative matching\nor the selection of which prime-age men marry and which do not. (Binder and Bound 2019 make a similar\npoint.) Our results do not take a stand on the direction of causality, we merely note the association with\nnon-participation and how the strength of this association has changed across generations. While the\nincrease in non-participation associated with being unmarried is somewhat smaller in later generations\n(4.5 and 4.7 percentage points for Generation X and Millennials compared to 5.7 and 6.0 for the Silent\nGeneration and Baby Boomers), men in younger generations are getting married later and at lower rates\nconditional on age (bottom panel of Table 2), which contributes to higher non-participation in younger\ngenerations.\nPrime-age men in households with children are less likely to be out of the labor force than prime-age men\nin households with no children (as seen in prior work, for example Rothstein 2019). The forces drawing\nprime-age men with children into the labor force are larger in later generations, as seen by the general\nrise in coefficient magnitudes across generations. This would lower labor force non-participation in earlier\ngenerations; however, men in younger generations tend to have kids later in life. As a result, these\nyounger generations of men are generally less likely than men in older generations to have kids,\nconditional on age (bottom panel of Table 2). Since having kids is associated with lower rates of non-\nparticipation, Millennials’ lower likelihood of having children will tend to raise their non-participation\nrates relative to earlier generations.\nAs with the presence of children, living in a household in which another member is employed is associated\nwith lower non-participation rates for prime-age men. This relationship is stronger in each subsequent\ngeneration. Millennial men living with a working household member are 5.7 percentage points less likely\nto be out of the labor force compared to men in households with no other earners, whereas the\ncomparable value for Baby Boomer men is 2.7. Further, Millennial men are more likely than men in older\ngenerations to be in a household in which there is another earner (bottom panel of Table 2), which could\nbe a combination of more young men living with family (consistent with findings in Binder and Bound\n2019 and Rothstein 2019) and a cultural shift towards dual-earner couples. In this case, both the change\nin population characteristics and in the non-participation rate’s sensitivity to the presence of other\nhousehold earners put downward pressure on non-participation rates for Millennials.\nWhen both the need and capacity to leave the labor force to be a caretaker are present, our results\nsupport the idea that caretaking pulls prime-age men out of the labor force. The coefficients on the\ninteraction terms are positive, indicating that the tendency for prime-age men who have kids to be in the\nlabor force is notably weaker for men who live with an employed household member (who is very likely a\nworking partner). There is some evidence that this pull factor is stronger when children are younger, as\nthe coefficients on the interaction terms are larger for households in which the oldest child is at most five.\n11 Another difference between Tables 1 and 2 is that Table 2 includes only men up to age 42 for all generations to\nmatch the age range available for Millennials. This age range restriction is only a partial reason for the reduction in\nthe coefficients on ‘not married’ between Tables 1 and 2.\n17\n\nWe also find that the magnitudes of the interaction term coefficients are notably larger for later\ngenerations, suggesting that the caretaking pull factor has strengthened. This is consistent with Fry (2023),\nwho shows that there has been a slight increase from 1989 to 2021 in the fraction of men who are stay-\nat-home dads (defined as men aged 18 to 69 who are not working and who have children at home). Still,\nprime-age men in later generations are notably less likely to have kids in the first place, which would\ncounteract some of the upward pressure in non-participation rates from the rise in the interaction term\ncoefficients.\nOne possible reason that non-participation rates of men with kids fall less when men also have a working\npartner is limited generosity of policies related to childcare. We can test for suggestive evidence of this\nnarrative by running a similar analysis with a sample of Canadian prime-age men, since childcare is\nrelatively less expensive in Canada than in the U.S. (OECD 2024), and Canadian parental leave and\nchildcare access policies are more generous than in the U.S. (Morrissey 2017). Using data from the\nCanadian Labour Force Survey (LFS, the Canadian analog of the CPS in the U.S.), we find that, unlike in the\nU.S., the interaction term coefficients are negative (for all generations except for the Silent Generation).\nThis means that the relationship between having kids and the likelihood of non-participation tilts away\nfrom non-participation for men with an employed partner (Appendix Table A2).12 This pattern is consistent\nwith relatively more supportive childcare policies in Canada bolstering labor force attachment. Moreover,\nthis relationship becomes notably stronger for younger generations, which may reflect more recent\nincreases in the generosity of some parental leave and childcare policies in Canada. For example, maternal\nand parental leave policies were expanded substantially in the mid-1980s and 1990s (Baker and Milligan\n2008) and Quebec introduced low-cost early education and childcare starting in the late 1990s.\nResearchers have found that these policies improved labor market attachment and outcomes, though the\nexisting research focuses on women and mothers (Baker and Milligan 2008, Morrissey 2017). While\nCanada differs from the U.S. in more than just access to childcare, this is consistent, though merely\nsuggestive, that the better childcare options in Canada allow these Canadian men to remain in the labor\nforce.\nOverall, caretaking as a pull factor should be interpreted within the context of women’s rising labor force\nattachment across generations. As more women (including those who are married, have children, or both)\nhave entered the workforce, that could in theory substitute for the employment and labor income of their\nmale partners. Our results and those of others suggest that on net, this is unlikely (Juhn and Potter 2006,\nCouncil of Economic Advisors 2016 are examples). We find, as others have, that male labor force\nparticipation decisions are positively related to the prevailing female labor force participation rate (Table\n1) and at an individual level, that men with another employed household member are more, not less,\nlikely to be in the labor force. Our results on the pull factor created by caretaking needs and capacity add\nnuance to the findings that women’s participation is not substituting for men’s. Our results are saying that\nthis overall pattern is tempered somewhat, though not fully, for cases in which men face both the need\nand capacity to be a caretaker.\n12 See the note in Appendix Table A2 for sample and variable details. In particular, ‘having an employed partner’ is\ntechnically ‘the prime-age male respondent lives in a household with a household head and/or partner of that\nhousehold head who is employed.’\n18\n\nPush factor: disability\nDisability can create barriers to labor force participation or push prime-age men out of the labor force. It\nis the most common reason prime-age men are out of the labor force (Appendix Figure A1). In 2023, 38%\nof non-participating prime-age men listed disability as the main reason.\nThe link between disability and weaker labor market outcomes is well-documented. For example, Bengali\net al. (2021) show that individuals with disabilities are much less likely to be employed than those without\ndisabilities and have substantially lower earnings (based on data from 2009-2020). Focusing specifically\non prime-age men, Kreuger (2017) finds that prime-age men who are not in the labor force are much more\nlikely to have a disability than prime-age men who are in the labor force (34% of non-participants\ncompared to 3-6% for the employed and unemployed) and are more likely to report being in poor health.13\nIn addition, individuals who are not working due to having a disability are less likely to re-join the labor\nforce, therefore permanently increasing non-participation of men in this group (e.g. Autor and Duggan\n2003, Burkhauser, Daly, and Ziebarth 2016); however, there is some evidence that at least on the margin,\nstrong labor markets can improve employment and earnings outcomes for those with disabilities. Bengali\net al. (2021) and Ne’eman and Maestas (2023) find that at the end of the recovery from the 2007-2009\nrecession and during the recovery from the 2020 recession (both examples of strong labor markets when\nlabor demand barriers arguably eased), labor market outcomes for individuals with disabilities\nimproved.14 Together, these findings are consistent with the idea that individuals with disabilities face\nbarriers to labor market participation due to physical and cognitive conditions that restrict the ability to\nwork (the labor supply side) and to labor demand constraints, both forces that push prime-age men out\nof the labor force.\nOur evidence suggests that disability is a notable push factor (see Figure 8; disability is the majority of the\n‘other’ category). Starting in 1994, disability is included as a separately coded reason that respondents\ncan give for being out of the labor force. Since this level of detail has been available, disability has been\nthe most-frequently given reason for non-participation among prime-age men, ranging from 46% in 1994\nto 38% in 2023 (Appendix Figure A1). Moreover, supplementary calculations from the CPS Annual Social\nand Economic Supplement (ASEC) also indicate that having a disability can be a strong factor pushing men\nout of the labor force. In 2023, about 45% of non-participating prime-age men reported having a disability\nin the prior year, and almost 70% of prime-age men who indicated having a disability in the prior year were\nout of the labor force when surveyed.15\nComparing this push factor across generations, Figure 10 shows the predicted probability of being out of\nthe labor force due to disability as the primary reason by age and generation, after adjusting for\ndemographics. Comparing generations, the patterns are quite similar, as this probability increases notably\n13 Related to health more broadly, Butcher and Park (2008) study the relationship between obesity, which has\nincreased over time and which may create conditions that limit an individual’s ability to do work, and non-\nemployment over time. Their findings suggest that the rise in obesity can explain some of the rise in non-\nemployment.\n14 The labor force participation rate for individuals with a disability rose in the years following the 2020 recession,\nfrom 21% in 2020 to over 24% in 2023 (BLS). Rising participation of this group contributes to the overall recent\nincrease in participation and could matter going forward if the trend continues.\n15 This measure of disability comes from a question asking about work-limiting disabilities that was introduced in\nthe 1988 ASEC survey. There are well-documented limitations of this measure (see Bengali et al. 2021, for\nexample), but using it is still instructive for our purposes.\n19\n\nwith age. The figure also shows that Millennial men are more likely than their counterparts in earlier\ngenerations to identify being out of the labor force due to disability.16 Despite this pattern, we hesitate to\nmake strong claims about the extent to which disability prevalence may have driven changes in non-\nparticipation across generations. Disability is difficult to measure in the CPS, and other CPS measures of\ndisability prevalence, such as from the CPS ASEC, show a less systematic increase in age-specific disability\nprevalence across generations (though prevalence for Millennials is generally above that for men in\nGeneration X, Appendix Figure A8). Further, in supplementary regressions with CPS ASEC data the (strong\npositive) relationship between having a disability and being out of the labor force is quite similar for Baby\nBoomers and Millennials and actually a bit weaker than the relationship for Generation X (Appendix Table\nA3).17\nFigure 10. Percent of prime-age men out of the labor force due to disability over the life cycle by\ngeneration, regression adjusted for demographics\nNote: Regressions run as in Table 1, but as a logit specification with a different dependent variable. The dependent\nvariable is an indicator that the respondent gave disability as the primary reason for non-participation. Regressions\nare based on data from 1994 forward. Age effects shown (with 95% confidence intervals) are adjusted average\npredictions.\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\n16 This trend is also seen in the raw data, though the percent of older Millennials out of the labor force due to\ndisability is similar to that for men in Generation X of the same age (Appendix Figure A7).\n17 This coefficient comparison is based on regressions that restrict ages in all generations to the age range available\nfor Millennials (25–42). Using all prime-age men from prior generations, we find that the relationship between\nhaving a disability and non-participation is weaker for Millennials than it is for all prior generations (not shown).\n20\n\nDisability as a push factor interacts closely with participation in disability insurance programs.18 At the\nmargin, disability insurance availability and generosity can add to the strength of the push factor by\nlowering the cost of leaving the labor force. We examine the relationship between disability insurance\ngenerosity and labor force non-participation to assess whether this one component of labor force\nparticipation decisions that is related to disability can help explain generational trends in non-\nparticipation.\nA robust literature has explored the connection between higher disability insurance use and lower labor\nforce participation (for example Autor and Duggan 2003; for a recent review, see Abraham and Kearney\n2020). Several papers have used natural experiments and plausibly random variation to argue that\nenrollment in disability insurance programs causally lowers labor force participation (Maestas, Mullen,\nand Strand 2013, French and Song 2014, Autor et al. 2016).\nTo explore this relationship across generations, we return to our basic CPS monthly data and add the ratio\nof disability insurance payments to earnings to our baseline specification in Equation (2) to proxy for\ndisability insurance generosity. Specifically, for disability insurance payments, we use the average monthly\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payment awarded to new male awardees of this program.19 For\nearnings, we use median earnings of male full-time wage and salary workers from the BLS.20 Though there\nare weaknesses with this ratio as an approximation of disability insurance generosity, it will capture major\nchanges in how disability insurance payments compare to the outside option. (For example, a ratio based\non aggregate earnings and payments will necessarily miss individual-level variation in both. Moreover, to\nthe extent that median earnings exceed the value of the outside option for marginal disability insurance\nrecipients, that would understate the true degree of disability insurance generosity.) Furthermore, using\nthe measure of the proportion of people who are awarded or currently receive disability insurance as a\nproxy for disability insurance generosity yields similar results.\nWe find that for most generations, prime-age men facing a more generous disability insurance option are\nmore likely to be out of the labor force (Table 3). Furthermore, the impact of disability insurance\ngenerosity increases for each generation up to Millennial men. Results suggest that for prime-age men in\nthe Baby Boomer generation, an increase of 2 percentage points (roughly one standard deviation) in the\naward amount as a percent of earnings is associated with a 0.7 percentage point increase in the probability\nof being out of the labor force. For men in Generation X, the impact increases to 0.8 percentage points.\nIn addition to more generous SSDI potentially increasing the value of being out of the labor force, the SSDI\nprogram experienced notable growth in the mid-1980s through the 1990s, years that mostly affected\nBaby Boomers and men in Generation X. This could contribute to the stronger positive relationship\nbetween SSDI generosity and non-participation for these generations of men, particularly since receipt of\nSSDI tends to be an absorbing state. For the Millennial generation, however, the relationship is negative\nand insignificant, meaning that more generous disability insurance does not have a strong association\n18 Note that listing disability as a reason for not participating in the labor force does not necessarily mean that the\nindividual is receiving disability insurance.\n19 Award amounts for SSDI are provided by the Social Security Administration and are available monthly for our full\nsample. There is also the Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) program for low-income disabled individuals, but\ndue to data availability, we focus on data from the SSDI program.\n20 The BLS reports median weekly earnings, which we scale up to a monthly amount by multiplying by 52/12.\nEarnings are only reported at a quarterly frequency, so we make a simple approximation and use the quarterly\nvalue for each month in the quarter.\n21\n\nwith non-participation.21 Binder and Bound (2019) find that rising disability insurance program use\nexplains relatively little of the rise in non-participation of younger prime-age men, so our findings for\nMillennials could be driven by the Millennial sample being younger (at most age 42) and the fact that SSDI\nrecipiency is quite low for those age 42 and younger (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2025);\nhowever, when we restrict the sample to those 42 and younger for all generations (the oldest Millennials\nin our sample are 42), we observe a similar sign flip for Millennials.\nAdditionally, the disability insurance award amount as a fraction of earnings has been falling over a time\nwhen many Millennial males were in the prime-age range (though this fraction is still higher than for\nearlier generations, bottom panel of Table 3 and Appendix Figure A9). The ratio of new disability insurance\nrecipients to the population has also fallen substantially over a similar period (Appendix Figure A10). So,\nMillennial prime-age men may be less likely to think about disability insurance as a feasible option, at least\non the margin. This is consistent with Abel and Deitz (2024) who study labor force detachment (those who\nhave been non-participants for at least one year) and find that recent improvements are driven by declines\nin detachment due to illness and disability. They posit that the strong recovery from the 2007–2009\nrecession improved the outside option of working (from more labor market opportunities and higher\nwages), making disability insurance relatively less attractive. Since the change in the replacement rate\nitself and the change in non-participation’s responsiveness to the replacement rate move in opposite\ndirections during the 2000’s, disability insurance may have little explanatory power for the overall\nincrease in non-participation rates for Millennials but may be more relevant for earlier generations.\nTable 3.

Means of key\ncontrols shown at the bottom of the table.\nSource: Current Population Survey, Social Security Administration, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and authors’\ncalculations.\n21 When we use the ASEC sample, which allows us to identify individuals with disabilities directly, we find that\nmore generous disability insurance is associated with a higher likelihood of non-participation for all generations\nand that those with disabilities have a stronger response to changes in disability insurance generosity than those\nwithout disabilities (Appendix Table A4).\n22\n\nPush factor: skills mismatch\nEven though skills necessary to perform the job vary across industries and occupations, one of the\ndeterminant factors for these skills is educational attainment. Some jobs, primarily in manufacturing,\nconstruction, and mining, mainly use manual labor and do not require a post-secondary degree. Others,\nsuch as jobs in professional and health services, primarily employ college graduates and those with\nprofessional degrees. Past work has highlighted falling demand for less-skilled workers as a reason for\nincreases in the non-participation rate (Valletta and Barlow 2018, Tuzemen 2019, Juhn and Potter 2006),\nattributing the decline in demand in part to import competition and technology advancements (Acemoglu\nand Restrepo 2017, Abraham and Kearney 2020). The resulting decline in wages associated with this falling\ndemand could provide further disincentive for labor force participation for prime-age men whose skills\nhave become less sought after (Council of Economic Advisors 2016). Lower real wages for younger\ngenerations and therefore lower expectations for the wage growth over their life cycle discourage some\nmen from actively seeking employment (Hotchkiss 2024). Both demand for and supply of skills have\nchanged over the past five decades. Educational attainment, representing supply of skills, has shifted\ntowards more educated workers, as seen in Figure 11. The share of most and least educated males\nconverged to a similar value in 2020, and in 2022, for the first time, the number of college-educated prime-\nage men exceeded the number with at most a high school degree.\nFigure 11. Share of education groups out of prime-age male population\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nWe use three groups of educational attainment to approximate skill: individuals who have at most a high\nschool degree, those with some college education, and individuals who have at least an undergraduate\ndegree. Prime-age men with less education are more likely to face challenges in the labor market and thus\nare more likely to stay out of or leave the labor market. We use this group as a proxy for individuals facing\nlabor market barriers related to skills mismatch.\nFigure 12 presents generational non-participation rates by educational attainment that control for\ndemographics and economic conditions as in Table 1. We continue to find that non-participation rates, for\n23\n\nall educational attainment groups, are systematically higher across the age distribution for more recent\ngenerations. However, non-participation rates of low-skilled men with at most a high school degree rise\nsteadily with age, whereas rates of men with at least a bachelor’s degree fall until individuals reach their\nearly 30’s and then slowly increase. This initial decline is in part due to young men transitioning into the\nlabor market after receiving additional education.\nFigure 12. Life cycle non-participation rate for prime-age men by generation, regression adjusted for\ndemographics\nHigh school or less Some college College or more\nNote: Regressions run separately for each education group but are otherwise as in Table 1. Age effects shown (with 95%\nconfidence intervals) are adjusted average predictions.\nSource: Current Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\nAdditionally, Figure 12 demonstrates that the biggest generational gaps exist among prime-age men with\nno college degree, particularly for those with high school education or less. For this group the gap in non-\nparticipation rates between Millennials and Baby Boomers at age 25 is 9.4 percentage points, whereas the\ngap for individuals with at least a college degree is 3.2 percentage points. By age 40, the Millennial-to-\nBoomer gap shrinks to 6 percentage points for the lowest education group, and to 2.3 percentage points\nfor the highest education group. Therefore, a large portion of the generational non-participation gap\ncomes from lower skilled workers. These results support the idea that low-skilled men face more\ndifficulties participating in the work force than high-skilled men do, and that this difficulty has increased\nfor each generation. Furthermore, some men might get discouraged from supplying their labor due to low\nwages. For low skilled workers the market wage is often times close to the minimum wage. In real terms\nminimum wages have been declining, therefore getting closer to lower skilled workers’ reservation wage.\nThat makes their decision to participate in the labor market even more sensitive to widening of the\nminimum wage gap. At the same time, to get a better understanding of the skill mismatch, we also examine\nthe demand for various skills by looking at changing industry composition.\nDemand for goods-producing jobs has decreased, as the employment share in these industries has\nsubstantially declined. Prior work links these changes in industry structure and falling demand for jobs that\nprime-age men traditionally hold to lower labor force participation (Valletta and Barlow 2018). The\nchanging landscape of goods-producing employment is well-demonstrated in Figure 13, with a steady\ndecline in the share of manufacturing jobs that stabilizes after the Great Recession. This has an important\nimplication for the job prospects of prime-age men, since goods-producing industries such as\nmanufacturing, mining, and construction have a high concentration of male workers. For instance, in 2022,\n24\n\nthe share of male workers in these industries was close to 80%. Manufacturing and mining, due to their\nhistorically high unionization levels, usually provide relatively higher salaries for low-skilled workers. Falling\nemployment in these industries may discourage some lower-skilled workers from searching for jobs all\ntogether. Autor et al. (2025) show that many manufacturing workers who lost their job did not transition\ninto the services sector. Rather, it was new workers who took new service-sector jobs in these\ncommunities, thus leaving former manufacturing workers vulnerable to the skills mismatch produced by\nchanging industries composition.\nFigure 13: Employment share in goods-producing industries\nSource: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and authors’ calculations.\nTo capture the impact of changes in the share of jobs in goods producing industries on workers at different\nskill levels, we include the share of employment in mining, construction, and manufacturing industries\n(“Goods employment share”) at the state and month level and interact this share with educational\nattainment. We also include the difference between the mean and the minimum hourly wage (deflated to\n$2022 using headline PCE) at the state and quarter level, and its interaction with educational attainment,\nto account for earnings inequality resulting from shifts in the demand and supply of low-skill workers.\nInteracting the factors with the level of education expands Equation (2) and gives us Equation (3) below.\n𝑁𝐼𝐿𝐹 =𝛽 𝐴 +𝛽 𝑿 + 𝛽 𝑈𝑅 + 𝛾 +𝛽 𝑭 +𝛽 𝑭 ∗𝐸𝑑𝑢𝑐 + 𝜖 (3)\n𝑖𝑠𝑡 1 𝑖𝑡 2 𝑖𝑡 3 𝑡 𝑠 4 𝒊𝒔𝒕 5 𝑠𝑡 𝑖𝑡 𝑖𝑠𝑡\nThe vector 𝑭 includes factors related to skill mismatch for state s at time t.\n𝑠𝑡\n25\n\nTable 4.

Means of key controls shown at the bottom of the table.\nSource: Current Population Survey, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (employment shares, wages), Department of\nLabor (minimum wages), and authors’ calculations.\nTable 4 displays the regression coefficients for three generations. These regressions omit the Silent\nGeneration due to the shorter sample necessitated by variable availability limitations (data on\nemployment shares at the state level are only available starting in 1990). The first two rows examine the\nrole of men’s skills acquired through education across the generations. Estimation results indicate that\nmen with higher skills (approximated by those with more education) are less likely to be out of the labor\n26\n\nforce, as we saw in our earlier results. Larger magnitudes of regression coefficients suggest the increasing\nimportance of education.22 The growing impact is well seen for Millennials, whose regression coefficients\nare notably larger in magnitude than those for Generation X, capturing both declines in the share of less\neducated men, as well as changing demands for skilled workers.\nThe impact of labor demand shifting away from goods-producing jobs is particularly evident in the\nestimates of the goods employment share and its interaction with education. Estimated coefficients show\nthat a decreasing share of employment in these sectors consistently increases the probability of prime-\nage men being out of the labor force across generations.23 The effect is even bigger for Millennial men and\nthose with less education. College educated men do not show any significant additional sensitivity to\nchanges in the goods employment share, likely due to their lower exposure to these types of jobs.24 A\nlarger participation penalty for less educated Millennial men when the employment share of goods-\nproducing jobs falls might stem from a bigger exposure of these workers to large employment losses in\nconstruction and manufacturing industries following the Great Recession. These job losses were\nconcentrated among workers with less education and, in some cases such as construction, employment\nlevels for workers with less education never recovered to their pre-recession levels.\nOther types of low-skilled workers that might be affected are those that seek employment of minimum\nwage jobs. Our results show that an increase in the gap between minimum and average real wages in the\nstate of residence increases the probability of being out of the labor force. Not surprisingly, this effect\nmostly affects workers with lower education, as evident in the sign of the interaction coefficients.\nFurthermore, this effect for the lowest education group is stronger for younger generations. For example,\nfor Baby Boomers, a ten dollar increase in the minimum wage gap is predicted to increase labor force non-\nparticipation of prime-age men with lower skills by 1.6 percentage points and to decrease the probability\nof high skilled non-participation by 4.3 percentage points. For Millennial prime-age men, these\nprobabilities change to an increase of 2.1 percentage points and a decrease of 0.2 percentage points\nrespectively. These numbers also suggest that high-skilled workers with more education from earlier\ngenerations were shielded more from the effects of lower minimum wages than Millennial college\neducated prime-age men. The fact that less skilled workers are less likely to be in the labor force if their\nstate’s minimum wage falls relative to the average wage supports the hypothesis that lack of skills, as\nmeasured by education, can push prime-age men out of the labor force, as they get discouraged by lower\npay or as the local labor market demand shifts towards relatively more skilled workers.\n22 The mostly larger coefficients for the Baby Boomer generation are likely due to the somewhat older sample for\nthis group.\n23 Another way to capture workers skill mismatch is to use the non-cognitive, routine occupation employment\nshare instead of the goods employment share (as in Valletta 2019: occupations in construction and extraction;\ninstallation, maintenance, and repair; production; and transportation and material moving). Doing so yields\nqualitatively similar results, although the main effect of the occupational share for Millennials is close to that for\nGeneration X.\n24 We also test for differential experience of men from the rust belt and find that these men are more likely to be\nout of the labor force and their non-participation is more sensitive to changes in industry composition than for men\nfrom the other parts of the U.S.\n27\n\nDiscussion\nThroughout the paper, we analyzed how non-participation gaps across generations can be explained by\nvarious factors that push and pull prime-age men out of the labor force. As part of this discussion, we\nreferenced how both changes in population characteristics (the mean of each factor) and changes in the\nsensitivity of non-participation to each factor (the regression coefficients) could affect overall non-\nparticipation across generations. In this section, we make this decomposition explicit, comparing the\nmagnitudes of generational non-participation differences due to changes in means and changes in\ncoefficients for each push and pull factor. That way we can gain a better understanding of where policy can\nhave the greatest impact.\nThe regression results from Tables 2–4 show how characteristics related to push and pull factors influence\nnon-participation rates for individuals within a generation. To make comparisons across generations, we\nuse a decomposition similar to that used in Daly, Hobijn, and Pedtke (2020) (based on methods from\nBlinder 1973 and Oaxaca 1973). This method breaks down the difference in non-participation rates\nbetween two generations (G1 and G2) into a component due to the differences in observed characteristics\n(often called the “explained component” in the literature), a component due to differences in the\nrelationships between non-participation and the explanatory variables (often called the “unexplained\ncomponent” in the literature), and the interaction between changes in both characteristics and\ncoefficients:\n𝑵̅̅̅𝑰̅𝑳̅̅𝑭̅ −𝑵̅̅̅𝑰̅𝑳̅̅𝑭̅ = 𝛽̂ ∗ (𝑿̅ −𝑿̅ )+𝑿̅ ∗ (𝛽̂ −𝛽̂ )+(𝑿̅ −𝑿̅ )∗ (𝛽̂ −𝛽̂ )\n𝐺1 𝐺2 𝐺2 𝐺1 𝐺2 𝐺2 𝐺1 𝐺2 𝐺1 𝐺2 𝐺1 𝐺2\n=𝛽̂ ∗Δ𝑿̅+𝑿̅ ∗Δ𝛽̂ +Δ𝑿̅Δ𝛽̂\n𝐺2 𝐺2\n=𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑠+𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠+𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛\nThe three components can be further broken down into differences due to groups of explanatory variables.\nTo implement this decomposition, we run a variant of Equation (2) that includes all of the measures from\nthe individual regressions in Tables 2–4 above. Due to restrictions imposed by the availability of the\nemployment share variables, we compare Millennials (G1) to Generation X (G2), as we have observations\nfor a comparable set of ages for these groups (age 25–42).\nThe results of this decomposition are in Table 5.25 The top panel shows the total average non-participation\nrate gap between Millennials and Generation X, 2.9 percentage points. About 80% of that 2.9 percentage\npoint gap is explained by our regression model and is attributable to differences in observable population\ncharacteristics, holding the coefficients fixed. Differences in the coefficients are estimated to have a\nnegative effect. As a result, Millennials would have had a lower non-participation rate than men in\nGeneration X by about 0.3 percentage points (about 11%). The interaction between changes in population\ncharacteristics and changes in coefficients compound to account for about 30% of the gap. Panel B breaks\ndown these contributions within each type (means, coefficients, and interactions). To simplify the table,\nwe group explanatory variables into demographics (age, marital status, race, and urban/rural residence),\nskills (educational attainment, the goods employment share, its interaction with educational attainment,\n25 In this specification that puts all push and pull factor variables into the same regression, the coefficients on the\ncontrols and push and pull factor variables are quite similar to those in the regressions run with each set of push\nand pull factors separately. One notable exception is the coefficient on the SSDI replacement rate. In the combined\nregression, the point estimates shrink in magnitude and are not statistically significant. See Appendix Table A1.\n28\n\nthe real minimum wage gap, and its interaction with educational attainment), caretaking (the presence of\nchildren, other household earners, and their interaction), disability insurance generosity, and other\ncontrols (state dummies, the national unemployment rate, the female labor force participation rate, and\nthe constant term).\nTable 5.

Samples in all generations are restricted to prime-age men age 42 and\nyounger. Regressions are based on data from 1990 forward. The regressions are weighted using the standard\nmonthly weights in the CPS microdata and standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered by birth year.\nSource: Current Population Survey, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, Social Security\nAdministration, and authors’ calculations.\nThe left-most columns of panel B show how much of the non-participation rate gap differences in each\ngeneration’s population characteristics can explain. The results indicate changes in skills and caretaking\nvariable means contributed the most to explaining the intergenerational gap in prime-age men’s non-\nparticipation rates. The contribution of the variables related to skills largely stems from the rise in non-\nparticipation associated with the decline in the share of manufacturing jobs as well as the increase in the\nreal minimum wage gap, both of which capture a rise in the potential for skills mismatch. For caretaking,\nMillennial men are less likely to have children than their counterparts in the prior generation, increasing\nnon-participation rates and dominating the countervailing decline in non-participation associated with\nMillennials being more likely to live in a household with another earner. Changes in demographic\ncharacteristics generally increased non-participation rates, contributing about 24% to explained changes.\nFinally, changes in the average generosity of disability insurance made only a small (and statistically\ninsignificant) contribution to explaining the non-participation gap.\nThe next two columns show the contribution of each factor due to changes in the coefficients on, or non-\nparticipation’s sensitivity to, the push and pull factors. While the overall contribution of changes in\nsensitivities is relatively small (about -11%), contributions of disaggregated groups of factors can be quite\nlarge. The constant term, which captures differences between the two generations not accounted for in\nthe model, is included in the ‘controls’ grouping. Changes attributable to the constant term dominate, and\nits sign means that differences not accounted for in the model increase non-participation rates for\nMillennials. From the perspective of our model, the difference driven by the constant term is essentially a\nresidual, or a generational fixed effect. Secular trends in prime-age male non-participation that are not\n30\n\ndirectly tied to the push and pull factors we consider may be part of the explanation.26 While determining\nthe exact nature of the unexplained difference remains for future work, the non-participation rate’s\nsensitivity to the push and pull factors we study (skills, disability insurance, and caretaking) nonetheless\ncollectively counteracts these unaccounted differences, meaning that changes in sensitivities for\nMillennials tend to lower non-participation rates. For example, skill mismatch characteristics such as a\nstronger inverse relationship between non-participation rates and the goods employment share suggests\nlower non-participation rates for Millennial prime-age men. This, however, is assuming goods employment\nshares were the same as in Generation X, while in fact, the shares have declined substantially.\nThe last two columns show how the interaction of changes in observable means together with changes in\nsensitivities contributed to the intergenerational nonparticipation gap. Two contributions stand out in\nterms of their magnitudes – interactions related to demographics and interactions related to skills\nmismatch. For example, marriage rates (included in the demographics category) are lower for Millennials,\nwhich tends to increase non-participation since men who are not married are more likely to be out of the\nlabor force. Moreover, since the relationship between not being married and non-participation\nstrengthened a bit in the Millennial generation (Appendix Table A1), these two changes compound and\nresult in a positive contribution from the interaction term for demographics. In the skills mismatch\ncategory, part of the positive contribution is the result of a lower share of goods employment interacting\nwith a stronger negative coefficient for the same category.\nThese findings allow us to think about gaps that policy might be able to address and those that are less\nlikely to be affected by policy changes. For example, policy may have less influence on those who are ill or\nhave a disability. Though disability insurance generosity is (in theory) easy to change with policy levers,\nour findings suggest that changes in generosity have minimal impacts on non-participation rate gaps. On\nthe other hand, skills mismatch is a push factor that has natural ties to policy and could notably affect non-\nparticipation. Since we find that having some college education (such as a two-year degree or technical\ntraining) or more affords a substantial boost to labor force participation, increasing educational and\ntraining options could improve labor force participation.\nOur results show that rising non-participation is an issue stemming from both push and pull factors, so\nresearch and solutions cannot focus on just one or the other. Our work helps us understand where the\nparticipation gaps are and what factors to target to make the biggest changes.\nThe rise in non-participation matters for output growth over the business cycle and for structural growth\ngoing forward because rising non-participation will further restrict the pool of workers who are supporting\na growing number of aging individuals. In the end, rising non-participation is not driven exclusively by any\none factor, either within a generation or between generations. Push and pull factors will always coexist\nbut vary in how much they respond to policy and in how prominent they are in each generation. Thus,\n26 The breakdown in Figure 8 of generational changes in respondent-provided reasons for non-participation\nprovides some hints. For example, averaging across ages 25–41 in the figure, the category ‘disability, illness, and\nother reasons’ accounts for 55% of the difference in non-participation between Millennials and Generation X. (At\nage 42, the difference in the non-participation rate between Millennials and Generation X is essentially zero, which\ndistorts the average share accounted for by the combined ‘other’ category.) These reasons are not directly included\nin our model and thus could be picked up in the ‘controls’ category in Table 5. That said, our results in the section\non disability and disability insurance caution against heavily attributing the contributions from the ‘controls’\ncategory to disability alone. Other possibilities include a rise in the prevalence of temporary non-participation\nspells (Coglianese 2018) and changes in culture, globalization, and automation that are difficult to measure directly.\n31\n\neffective policy and research should be cognizant that each factors’ relative importance will fluctuate over\ntime.\n32\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Jonathan Davis, and Luojia Hu (2012) “Explaining the Decline in the U.S. Labor Force\nParticipation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago Fed Letter 296.\nAaronson, Stephanie, Bruce Fallick, Andrew Figura, and Jonathan F.

Such features\nare integral to constructing models of the macroeconomy. In this paper we document\nsecular shifts in the margins firms use, in aggregate, to adjust to shocks that have\nconsequences for the economy’s cyclical behavior. These new business cycle facts on\nthe comovement of output and its inputs are a natural complement to analyzing output\nand its expenditure components. Our findings shed light on the changing cyclicality of\nproductivity in response to different shocks.\nJEL classification codes: E23, E24, E32, J20\nKeywords: growthaccounting,outputandemploymentfluctuations,cyclicalproductivity,\nOkun’s Law, local projections, instrumental variables, classical minimum distance\n∗ WethankValerieRameyandparticipantsattheSED2013,2013NBERSummerInstitute,the2014EuropeanEconomicAssociation\nmeetings,andseveralacademicinstitutionsforhelpfulcommentsonthispaper.

I\nThe literature has primarily documented historical characteristics of the business cycle\n1991 1992\n(Kydland and Prescott, ; Backus and Kehoe, ; and Backus, Kehoe and Kydland,\n1994\n) that tend to focus on the statistical properties of output, its covariation with the\nexpenditure side of GDP (consumption, investment, government expenditures and net\nexports), and its covariation with monetary aggregates (to determine whether monetary\npolicy is neutral). Models of the business cycle, analysis of the welfare costs of business\ncycles, and studies of the role of economic policy primarily build upon such statistical\nproperties.\n1962\nYet we have known at least since Okun ( ) that movements in output and unemploy-\n50\nment are closely intertwined and have remained so for much of the last years, as Ball,\n2013\nLeigh and Loungani ( ) and others have shown. The introduction, for example, of search\nand matching frictions in labor markets based on the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model\n2000 1\n(Pissarides, , Chapter ), have moved business cycle models to make stronger connec-\ntions with movements in the unemployment rate at a more fundamental level (Andolfatto,\n1996 2010 2010\n; Barnichon, ; and Blanchard and Gal´ı, , among others).\nThis paper investigates the cyclical properties of the U.S. economy but through the lens\nof the aggregate production function. What do firms do in response to different shocks?\nHow do they allocate resources between labor and capital? Between hours per worker and\nworkers? Between utilization and productivity? Do they respond differently when hit by a\nspike in oil prices than when they face credit constraints, or changes in technology?\nThis shift in focus speaks directly to the manner different economies have recovered\nfrom the Great Recession and the challenges that lay ahead. For example, the surprising\ngains in employment experienced in the U.S. over the last few years are equally matched\nby dismal readings in productivity that have some researchers ringing the alarm bells of\n2014 2014\nhysteresis and secular stagnation (see, e.g., Eggertsson and Mehrotra, ; Summers, ;\n2015\nand others), presaging an era of low productivity growth (see, e.g., Gordon, ).\n2\n\n50\nIn the next few sections we investigate fundamental moments calculated over the last\nyears between the unemployment rate and the various components of output viewed from\nthe production side. This benchmark analysis reveals that the phenomenon of the Great\n2000\nModeration, first discovered by McConnell and Pe´rez-Quiro´s ( ) (and later coined in\n2003\nStock and Watson, ), is clearly visible in the manner firms behave. We will show, among\nother things, that firms have shifted from adjustments in hours-per-worker to adjustments\nin their work force. Not surprisingly, as firms trim staffing levels (usually by letting go of\nthe least productive workers), productivity improves, thereby giving rise to another well\n2015\ndocumented feature of the American business cycle (Fernald and Wang, ): productivity\nhas shifted from being procyclical to being countercyclical. Our work will provide a more\ndetailed explanation for this shift.\nThese changes could have strong implications for how we build economic models to\nthe extent that they reflect shifts in corporate behavior rather than shifts in the shocks\n2\nfirms typically face. Therefore, it is important to document two features of the post-WW\n1 2\nexperience: ( ) the extent to which firms respond differently to different shocks; and, ( )\nthe extent to which the nature of shocks that hit the economy has changed over time.\nAbsent a fully specified macroeconomic model, it may seem a hopeless task to disentan-\ngle how firms respond to different shocks. One of the main contributions of this paper is to\npropose a novel empirical strategy based on modern semiparametric time series methods\nandidentificationthroughinstrumentalvariables. Inparticular, weuselocalprojections(see\n2005\nJorda`, ) and instruments that have featured in the literature for a collection of economic\n1\nshocks. These shocks are: ( ) an interest rate shock (identified as in Romer and Romer,\n2004 2014 2003\nand updated by Cloyne and Hu¨rtgen, ); an oil shock (based on Hamilton, ); a\n2012\nshock to credit conditions (based on Gilchrist and Zakrajs˘ek, ); and a shock to total\n2014\nfactor productivity adjusted for utilization (based on Fernald, b). Using these shocks,\nwe are able to trace the response of output and its components as well as the response of the\nunemployment rate. These responses can then be used to replicate our historical analysis\nbut conditional on different experiments using Classical Minimum Distance (CMD). We\nwill show that the nature of the shock has important implications for the margins firms\nprefer to use to make adjustments.\nThe origins of the Great Moderation are still a matter of lively debate. Our goal is not to\narbitrate among alternative explanations of the Great Moderation. Rather, the goal is to\ninvestigate how shifts in the distribution of these shocks have affected output fluctuations\nin the context of the behavioral changes we document.\n50\nThe stability of Okun’s law over the last years, a convenient staff for policy makers,\n3\n\nhides the tremendous transformation of the aggregate American corporate landscape. We\nfeel such transformation has yet to be fully incorporated into the way macroeconomic\nmodels are built, calibrated and tested. Changes in labor markets, technology, and finance\nwill undoubtedly continue to shape this new landscape. We view our contribution as\nsetting the foundations over which better macroeconomic models can be formulated.\n2 mpirical approach\n. E\nFluctuations and the statistical properties of aggregate output are a focal point in macroe-\nconomics. Much of our paper explores the factors behind the movements in output over\nthe business cycle. In particular, we depart from a mechanical decomposition of aggregate\noutput in total hours worked and labor productivity. Similarly, we also consider how total\n1\nhours worked can be decomposed in number of workers and hours per worker. Based\non this decomposition, we shed light on the importance of taking into account how the\nvarious margins of adjustment respond to different macroeconomic shocks and how their\nresponses help understand output fluctuations and the path followed by the economy.\nOver the past few decades an increasing number of central banks have developed and\nestimatedmedium-scaleNewKeynesianDSGEmodelsinordertostudyoutputfluctuations\nand the business cycle. These models are well suited for theoretical analysis and seem to\nprovide sound empirical and forecasting properties. One common shortcoming of these\nmodels, however, is the small, or complete lack of a, role for unemployment as well as for\nthe margins that firms use to adjust to shocks. More recently, Gal´ı, Smets and Wouters\n2011\n( ) fill this gap by developing and estimating a large-scale DSGE model that allows for\n2010\nchanges to the unemployment rate, while Barnichon ( ) considers a partial-equilibrium\nmodel that allows for firms to adjust both the intensive and the extensive margins. These\n2015\npapers, among others (e.g. Fernald and Wang, ), highlight the importance of allowing\nfor adjustments the on these margins to better understand the dynamics of the aggregate\noutput.\nAconvenientstartingplatformfromwhichtoanalyzethecyclicalpropertiesofaggregate\nproduction and its components is with Okun’s Law. Tobin’s quote at the beginning of\nthe paper summarizes a sentiment that has been revived many times over the years – the\n1\nInadditiontotheaggregatemarginsofadjustmentfromthepointofviewoffirms,thereareseveralother\nhouseholdmarginsofadjustment.

The baseline specification of Okun’s Law relates the growth rate in real\n∆ ∆\noutput, y, with the change in the rate of unemployment, U:\n∆ y = µ+β ∆ U+ε. ( 1 )\nThe coefficient β directly captures the (reduced-form) comovement of output and unem-\nployment. The unemployment rate is perhaps one of the better cyclical indicators there\nis.\n1\nIt is easy to show that β in expression ( ) is equal to the sum of the β’s from component-\nwise Okun regressions based on the mechanical decomposition of aggregate output growth\n1\ndiscussed earlier. For example, the OLS estimate of β from equation ( ) equals the sum\n∆\nof the coefficients from the linear projections of growth in hours, denoted l, and growth\nin labor productivity, denoted ∆ LP = (∆ y − ∆ l), on unemployment changes, denoted\n∆ U. That is, βˆ = βˆl + βˆLP, where the coefficients βˆl and βˆLP come from the following\n2\nregressions:\n∆ l = βl∆ U+(cid:101)l and ∆ y−∆ l = βLP∆ U+(cid:101)LP. ( 2 )\nIn the short-run, changes in the number of workers will be approximately the negative\nof changes in the unemployed and therefore a reasonable guess for βˆl would be a coefficient\nof −1 or slightly higher. Thus, output should change by about −(1−α)∆ U where α is the\ncapital-share. Assuming the value of the labor-share at about 1/3, the change in output\nshould be about −(2/3)∆ U. In that case, βˆl would be roughly −1, and βˆLP would be\nroughly α, that is 1/3. These back-of-the-envelope values are helpful benchmarks to keep in\n1 2\nmind as we take expressions ( ) and ( ) to the data. In addition, they are helpful reminders\nof appropriate values to be used in common calibration exercises.\n2 1\n. . Instrumental Variable Local Projections\nThe elasticity of the growth rate in each component of output with respect to changes\nin the unemployment rate measures the sensitivity of that component to business cycle\nfluctuations in the practical sense. These fluctuations are the result of a variety of shocks\nthat hit the economy. The extent to which we can isolate the dynamic response of the\ncomponents of output and of the unemployment rate to each type of shock allows one to\n2 To see this, note that the Okun coefficient is cov(∆y,∆U)/var(∆U) = cov(∆l,∆U)/var(∆U) +\ncov(∆y−∆l,∆U)/var(∆U) = βˆl+βˆLP.\n5\n\nmeasure shock-specific Okun elasticities. These elasticities educate us about the margins\nbusinesses favor in response to one shock or another.\nEstimating these shock-specific elasticities from the data requires combining statistical\n2005\ntools in a novel manner. First, we use local projections (Jorda`, ) to obtain estimates\nof the dynamic responses of output, its components and the unemployment rate. These\nresponses are calculated for a variety of treatments, that is, perturbations caused by a variety\nof economic factors. In order to properly identify each treatment experiment, we extend\nthe original local projection framework by using instrumental variables (see, e.g. Jorda`,\n2005 2015 2013\n; Jorda`, Schularick and Taylor, ; and Owyang, Ramey and Zubairy, ). The\nunderlying notion is that, for example, shocks to the interest rate will likely have different\n2004\nimplications than shocks to oil prices (e.g., Gal´ı, Lopez-Salido and Voiles, and He and\n2013\nKrishnamurthy, ). Sometimes firms will adjust via hours worked. Other times they\nwill adjust staffing levels instead. Or maybe they will prefer to adjust via labor productivity.\nWith the responses of the components of output and the unemployment rate obtained\nfrom instrumental variable local projections (LP-IV), we estimate shock-specific Okun\nelasticities using a classical minimum distance approach (CMD). LP-IV estimates of the\nresponses are basically moments of the sample. Each shock-specific elasticity is itself a\nfunctionofthesemoments. TheLP-IVapproachprovidesasimplewaytobothachieveiden-\ntification and also to obtain the covariance matrix of the responses. Using this covariance\nmatrix estimate, we construct optimally weighted estimates of shock-specific elasticities\nbased on CMD and thus provide formal classical inference for these parameter estimates as\nwell.\nMore specifically, let X with j = 1,...,J denote output and its different components\njt\nand hence let x = logX . That is, x ∈ {∆ y , ∆ l , ∆ n , ∆ h , ∆ LP}. Denote the year on year\njt jt jt t t t t t\n3 ∆ ∆\ndifference as . Thus x is the smooth yearly rate of change of X (which we will\n4 4 jt jt\ndiscuss as percentage changes). Okun Law elasticities for each of the components can be\nestimated using regressions of the type:\n∆ x = µ +β ∆ U +ε . ( 3 )\n4 jt j j 4 t jt\nThroughout the paper we define cyclicality with respect to the unemployment rate based\non this regression. Since the unemployment rate falls in booms and rises in recessions, a\nnegative value for βˆ means that the variable is procyclical, i.e., it tends to rise in booms and\nj\nfall in recessions. Otherwise, we say the variable is countercyclical.\n3\nCalculationsbasedonquarter-to-quarterchangesyieldqualitativelysimilarresults.\n6\n\n3\nNext, instead of evaluating expression ( ) using fluctuations in the raw data, suppose\nthat we isolate fluctuations in x and U that are explained by a given perturbation δ to a\njt t i\ntreatment variable w for i = 1,...,4 corresponding to each of the four factors we consider.\nit\nAs an example, think of the treatment variable as a monetary policy intervention. We\nare interested in calculating the average change in the future values of x and U when\njt t\nw = w +δ compared to w = w . The difference in average responses under the treatment\nit i i it i\nand control scenarios summarizes counterfactual movements in x and U from which to\njt t\nobtain shock-specific Okun elasticities, as we will show momentarily.\nLet the generic notation s ∈ {∆ U , ∆ x ,..., ∆ x }, where ∆ is the h-\nt+h h t+h h 1,t+h h J,t+h h\ndifference operator and where the size of the intervention is denoted δ. In addition,\ni\ndefine R as a vector of controls that includes exogenous and predetermined values of s\nt t\nand w , although in general, one could potentially include additional variables. We define\nit\nI(s,h,w ,δ,R) as:\ni i\nI(s,h,w ,δ,R) ≡ E(s |w = w +δ;R )−E(s |w = w ;R ), ( 4 )\ni i t+h it i i t t+h it i t\nfor each experiment i = 1,...,4 as it evolves over h = 0,...,H−1 periods after impact.\nIn general, for a given experiment δ, I(s,h,w ,δ,R) could vary with the level of the\ni i i\n25\nintervention variable, w , as well as the values of the control set, R . A basis points (bps)\ni t\n6\ndecline in interest rates when the level is at % may have a different effect than when rates\n1\nare at %, for example. Moreover, the same rate cut may have different effects in recession\nthan in expansion. However, in what follows and to maintain the discussion accessible, we\n4\napproximate the expectations in expression ( ) using a linear model. Linearity makes the\neffects of δ invariant to w and R . For that reason, we simply write I(s,h,δ ) from here on.\ni i t i\nIf the observables in R where sufficient to identify exogenous movements in w , the\nt it\n4\nexpectations in expression ( ) could be calculated using the a set of regressions such as:\ns = αs +w λs +R Γs +es i = 1,...,4;h = 0,1,...,H−1 ( 5 )\nt+h ih it ih t ih t+h\nwhere recall that s ∈ {∆ U , ∆ x ,..., ∆ x }. It is easy to see that Iˆ(s,h,δ ) =\nt+h h t+h h 1,t+h h J,t+h i\nλˆs δ.\nih i\nHowever, we recognize that unobservable variables correlated with the intervention\n5\nvariable, w , and the outcome, s , could bias estimates based on expression ( ). In order\nit t\n5\nto ward off against such a situation, we will estimate expression ( ) using instrumental\nvariables (IV) for each of the types of intervention considered, and denote the approach\nLP-IV. Instrumental variables have been used for identification in the VAR literature (see,\n7\n\n2013 2015\ne.g. Mertens and Ravn, and Gertler and Karadi, ) and with local projections (see,\n2013 2015\ne.g. Owyang, Ramey and Zubairy, and Jorda`, Schularick and Taylor, ). We note\n5 8\nthat when we estimate expressions such as ( ) using IV methods we will allow up to lags\nof the outcome variable, the unemployment rate and the intervention variable. The horizon\n4 0 1 8\nover which we calculate ( ) goes from h = , ,..., .\n1\nThe four interventions that we consider are: ( ) to monetary policy measured by interest\n3\nrates on the -month treasury bill rate instrumented by the series of shocks from Romer and\n2004 2014 2\nRomer ( ) and extended in Cloyne and Hu¨rtgen ( ); ( ) to credit conditions measured\nby the average (cross-sectional) credit spread on senior unsecured corporate bonds issued\n2012\nby nonfinancial firms obtained from Gilchrist and Zakrajs˘ek ( ) and instrumented\n3\nwith the shock series provided therein; ( ) to oil markets measured by the West Texas\nIntermediate (WTI) oil price instrumented by the series of supply shocks identified by\n2003 4\nHamilton ( ); and ( ) to technology measured by shocks to utilization-adjusted TFP or\n(cid:63) 2006\nTFP as constructed in Basu, Fernald and Kimball ( ).\nLP-IV estimates of λs can then be used to estimate shock-specific Okun elasticities using\nih\nClassical Minimum Distance (CMD). More specifically, collect estimates λˆs into a vector\nih\nλ ˆs = (λˆs ,...,λˆs )(cid:48) . Thus, λ ˆs is of dimension 9×1. Moreover, under standard IV regularity\ni i,0 i,8 i\n2010\nassumptions (see, e.g. Wooldridge ( )):\n√\nT(λ ˆs −λs) → d N(0, Ωs) i = 1,...,4;s = 1,...,J,U.

A great deal of the\nij\ntechnical details necessary to obtain this result has been omitted for clarity. Moreover,\nalthough not explicitly stated, we have used standard assumptions used in the majority of\nempirical work. Generalizations of this estimation procedure to potential pathologies in\n9 10\nthe data are possible but would distract from the main result. Expressions ( ) and ( ) are\n8\neasily implementable using standard econometrics software –expression ( ) is a weighted\nleast-squares step. Before concluding the section we take a moment to note that the\nresults presented in this section have wide applicability. For example, one could consider\nestimating the parameters of a more complex DSGE model by exploiting structurally\nidentified impulse responses estimated using LP-IV and then deriving the CMD conditions\nthat match the deep parameters in the first-order conditions of the DSGE model with the\nimpulse response coefficients. This generalization is well beyond the scope of this paper,\nhowever.\n2 2\n. . Data\nThe data for the analysis that follows comes from relatively new, detailed, and carefully\nconstructed quarterly growth-accounting data for the U.S. business sector from Fernald\n2014 1949 1 2015 2\n( a). Our dataset, which runs from Q through Q , contains observations on\neach component described in earlier, as well as the components in which labor productivity\ncan be further decomposed, as we briefly discussed. The construction of the data is as\n1\nconsistent as possible with production theory. Further details appear in Appendix A. .\nHowever, several features of these data are worth highlighting here.\nFirst, output is constructed as the geometric average of the expenditure and income\nsides of the national accounts. Hence, labor productivity in our data is slightly different\nfrom that reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which uses the expenditure side\n4\nonly.\n4 In principle, these two measures should be the same, but in practice they are not. Nalewaik (2010)\narguesthatincome-sidedatamayprovideamoreaccuratereadoneconomicactivityaroundturningpoints.\nGreenaway-McGrevy(2011)andAruobaetal.(2013)recommendtakingaweightedaverageofthetwo.\n9\n\n2014\nSecond, in addition to standard growth-accounting terms, the Fernald ( a) dataset\nhasanempiricalmeasureoffactorutilization. Utilizationhereisaquarterlyimplementation\n2006\nof what Basu, Fernald and Kimball ( ) measured annually. The authors wrote down\na dynamic cost-minimizing model of the firm where labor and capital are quasi-fixed. If\nthe firm wants more input in the short run, it can adjust an observable intensity margin\nof hours per worker; or unobserved margins of labor effort and the workweek of capital.\nThe first-order conditions imply that the firm uses all margins simultaneously. Hence,\nobservable hours per worker can proxy for unobservable utilization margins. Basu, Fernald\n2006 2014\nand Kimball ( ) and Fernald ( b) implement this measure using detrended hours per\nworker at a detailed industry level, with different parameters across industries. Because of\nthe industry dimension, variations in measured utilization are not perfectly correlated with\n5\naggregate hours per worker.\nThird, asnoted, thedatacoversthebusinesssector. Fromthepointofviewoffirms, little\nis lost by focusing on the business sector, since that is the cyclical portion of the economy,\nas well as the portion where the usual firm-level assumptions apply. The hours data come\nfrom the BLS Labor Productivity and Costs release, which in turn decomposes hours into\nemployment and hours per worker. These employment and hours data are based primarily\n6\non surveys of establishments.\nWhen comparing the household and establishment surveys, it is important to be con-\nsistent in coverage, since the household data cover the total civilian economy whereas the\nestablishment-side data in the Labor Productivity and Costs release by the BLS (and in\n2014\nthe Fernald, a dataset) covers the narrower business sector. To be consistent, we use\nunpublished (but freely available on request) BLS data on employment and hours in the\nnon-business civilian sector. By adding these measures to the corresponding productivity-\nand-costmeasures,wecancreateanestablishment-basedmeasureofhoursandemployment\n7\nto compare with the household data. We find that the establishment and household sur-\nveys are broadly consistent with one another. Hence, the changes we identify appear robust\n5\nThedifferencesinparametersacrossindustries,perse,donotcontradicttheassumptionofanaggregate\nproductionfunction.

Theshocksarethepredictionerrorsmade\nby Federal Reserve staff when producing Greenbook forecasts. Exogenous fluctuations in\ncredit conditions are measured using the bond spread shock from Gilchrist and Zakrajs˘ek\n2012\n( ). This variable consists of the (option-adjusted) excess bond premium. Exogenous\n2003\nfluctuations in the supply of oil come from Hamilton ( ) and consist of an adjustment\nintended to identify supply side shocks using price data. Exogenous fluctuations in total\n2014\nfactor productivity come from Fernald ( a) and represent shocks to adjusted TFP or\n(cid:63)\nTFP . A detailed explanation of how these shocks are obtained, a discussion on the\nexclusion restriction and instrument validity are provided in the original sources.\n3 djusting to shocks\n. A\nWe begin this section by first evaluating whether the responses of the outcome variables\n1\nto each of our four shocks are consistent with basic economic intuition. Figure provides\nthe responses of output growth, the unemployment rate, and the treatment variable using\nLP-IV for each of the four experiments, namely shocks to interest rates, credit, oil, and\ntechnology. The responses of the subcategories of output are omitted in the interest of\n1\nspace, but are available upon request. Figure is based on the full sample up to the Great\n1949 1 2007 4 2015 2 3\nRecession, that is, Q – Q . Results extended to Q appear in Appendix A. .\n1\nFigure is organized as follows. Each row provides the response of output (left-hand\ncolumn), the unemployment rate (middle column), and the response of impulse variable\nreceiving the shock (right-hand column). All responses are consistent with economic\nintuition. Increases in interest rates, bond spread and oil prices cause output to decline and\nthe unemployment rate to increase whereas a positive technology shock has the opposite\n3\neffect. Note that for the first quarters unemployment is mildly positive. However, this\nis entirely consistent with the initial displacement of workers caused by new technology\n8 This conclusion contrasts with claims by Hagedorn and Manovskii (2011), who appear to find sizable\ndifferences in cyclicality across the two surveys. If true, that would be a major concern for productivity\nanalysts.

The table is organized as follows. Column ( ) provides the traditional static results\n2 5\nbased on the full sample analysis. These results are a natural benchmark. Columns ( )-( )\n1\nreport LP-IV estimates based on the responses in Figure in combination with the CMD\n2 1 2\nprocedure described in Section . . More specifically, column ( ) reports Okun elasticities\n3 4\nto shocks in interest rates; column ( ) to credit shocks; column ( ) to oil shocks; and column\n5\n( ) to technology shocks.\n1\nThe estimates in column ( ) are best thought of as an average over the full sample, that\nis, they average across all sorts of shocks and business cycle states. Loosely speaking, they\ncan also be thought of as the values to which the component-wise Okun coefficients are\nexpected to settle to over time. Standard errors are reported in parenthesis. These are\ncalculated by CMD using the optimal weighting matrix obtained from the LP-IV procedure\n10\nas explained in expression ( ). Finally, the table reports the smallest value of the F-statistic\nfor the instruments in the first stage. For all variables, this value is well above conventional\n9\ncritical values for standard weak instrument testing.\n1\nEach row in the table is organized by component. Row ( ), labeled “Output” reports\n2 3\nthe usual Okun coefficient, which is decomposed into rows ( ) and ( ), total hours worked\n2\nand labor productivity respectively. Finally, the total hours category, row ( ), is further\n2\ndecomposed into adjustments via total workers, row ( a) and adjustments via hours per\n2\nworker, row ( b).\n1\nEstimates of the Okun coefficient reported in Table are exactly additive, meaning that\n1 2 3\nthe coefficient estimate in row ( ) is the sum of the coefficients in rows ( ) and ( ). Similarly,\n2 2 2\nthe coefficient in row ( ) is the sum of the coefficients in rows ( a) and ( b). This feature is\n2 5\nmechanical, but does not apply for the elasticities reported in columns ( )–( ). There are no\nintrinsic restrictions that would ensure similar additivity. And yet, the coefficient estimates\nare roughly additive, a good back-of-the-envelope check of the results based on our new\nestimation procedure.\n1\nItishelpfultodiscussthestaticOkunpatternsreportedincolumn( )first.

About % of the decline in\ntotal hours reflects adjustments in employees. The coefficient for this category reported in\n2 1 63 0 42\nrow ( a) is - . versus the - . value corresponding to the hours per employee margin\n2\nreported in row ( b). Thus while most of the adjustment of total hours takes place at the\nextensive rather than the intensive margins, both matter quantitatively.\n0 27 3\nThe labor productivity coefficient of - . in row ( ) is roughly an order of magnitude\nsmaller. Over the full sample, productivity is thus modestly procyclical, i.e., it tends to rise\nin booms, when unemployment falls; and it tends to fall in recessions, when unemployment\nrises. This weak procyclicality of labor productivity is consistent with the stylized facts\n2001\nfrom the macro literature (see, e.g., Basu and Fernald, for a discussion and references).\nCompared to the static results, note that the shock-specific Okun elasticities for output\n1 1\nin row ( ) are generally larger (in absolute terms) than those reported in column ( ). An\n2\nexogenous increase in interest rates (column ( )) causes output to decline by more for a\n-2.15 whereas output measured with real income is -2.26. In both cases the estimates are not significantly\ndifferentfromthebenchmarkestimatesreportedinTable1.\n14\n\n3 06 2 32\ngiven increase in the unemployment rate (- . versus - . ), a result that seems to be\n111 027\nlargely driven by a larger decline in labor productivity (- . versus - . ). The response of\n251 205\ntotal hours is more comparable (- . versus - . ).\n3\nInterestingly, a tightening of credit conditions, reported in column ( ), has a similar\n377 232\neffect on output (- . vs. - . for the static case). In contrast to the monetary experiment,\n3 12 2 05\ntotal hours become more responsive (- . vs. - . ) mostly through bodies, whereas\n0 04 0 27\nlabor productivity is far less responsive (- . vs. - . ). On the other hand, oil prices\nand technology exhibit Okun elasticities that mirror almost perfectly the static estimates\n1\nreported in column ( ) in every category. Both of these type of shocks are probably closer\nto what one could consider a standard supply shock.\n3 1\n. . Economic implications\nAdjustments through the intensive versus the extensive labor margins are pivotal to un-\n2009\nderstand the economy’s response to interest rate shocks, see e.g. Gal´ı and Gambetti ( )\n2010\nand Barnichon ( ) who highlight this point by constructing models that allow firms to\n2010\nadjust their labor use through alternative margins. Barnichon ( ), in particular, builds a\nmodel that allows firms and households to adjust on their effort, and firms to adjust hours\nper worker and the number of employees in response to different shocks. In his model,\nbecause the adjustment of employees is subject to hiring frictions, firms first rely on the\nintensive margin, adjusting hours worked. Workers, however, have a convex disutility in\nhours and effort. Firms cannot therefore rely solely on these two margins and also resort to\nadjustments in the number of employees.\nIn response to a positive non-technology shock (a monetary shock, in his model), firms\nfirst increase intensive margins (hours and productivity) before increasing the number of\nemployees. As a result, the model predicts a negative relation between unemployment and\nboth hours per worker and labor productivity. These predictions are consistent with the\n1 2\nresults reported in Table , column ( ): the coefficients of hours per employee and of labor\nproductivity are both negative and statistically significant.\nA positive technology shock, on the other hand, raises firms’ productivity. Initially\nfirms meet demand by decreasing hours per worker and effort, eventually adjusting down\nthe number of employees. Consequently, labor productivity undershoots its long term\nequilibrium initially. In this case, the model predicts a negative relationship between\nhours per employee and unemployment, but the correlation between the latter and labor\nproductivity is undetermined. These features are in line with the findings reported on Table\n15\n\n1 5\n, column ( ). The coefficient on hours per worker is negative, but the coefficient on labor\nproductivity is not statistically significant.\n2010\nWhile Barnichon ( ) does not consider oil prices nor bond spread shocks, one can use\n1\nhis model to gather some intuition about the patterns reported on Table . Consider first\nan increase in oil prices. Since it is costly to adjust the employment margin, firms would\nfirst reduce effort and hours per worker, and later also reduce employment. This helps\n4\njustify the findings of column ( ) and the negative association between unemployment\nand both hours per employee and labor productivity, although the latter is not statistically\nsignificant.\nTurning to the bond spread, if a positive shock implies solely an increase in credit\nfunding costs to firms, the model would predict dynamics similar to those following an oil\nprice increase. Firms adjust to higher funding costs by lowering investment and production,\nwith an initial reduction in hours per worker and effort before then reducing employment.\nThe prediction that the relationship between unemployment, and hours per worker and\n1\nlabor productivity are negative are supported by the data, as reported in Table , column\n3\n( ).\nThese results straddle a period of time many refer to as the Great Moderation. It is\ntherefore important to examine the robustness of our findings to a more careful analysis\n1985 1985\nwhere the sample is partitioned in . The choice of the break point is rather\nuncontroversial, as it coincides with the date favored by, e.g., McConnell and Pe´rez-Quiro´s\n2000 2003 2009 2010\n( ), Stock and Watson ( ), Gal´ı and Gambetti ( ), and Barnichon ( ). This\nanalysis is done in the next section.\n4 he reat oderation\n. T G M\nThis section examines the stability of the benchmark results presented in the previous\n1949 1 1984 4 1985 1\nsection. The specific subsamples that we consider are from Q to Q and Q to\n2007 4\nQ , thus omitting the Great Recession as before. The corresponding impulse response\nfunctions for output, unemployment, total hours and labor productivity are provided in\n2 1\nAppendix A. , broken down by subsample and organized as in Figure .\n2 1 1\nTable presents the results organized by component just as in Table . Columns ( )\n2 1 1\nand ( ) provide the subsample estimates corresponding to column ( ) in Table to provide\n1 2\na benchmark. As before, columns ( ) and ( ) are best thought of as averages across all\nshocks and business cycles over each subsample. The remaining columns redo the exercises\n1 3 4\nreported in Table for each subsample and type of shock. In particular, columns ( ) and ( )\n16\n\n1984 1984\nreport responses to a monetary shock in the pre- and post- subsamples respectively.\n5 6 7\nSimilarly, columns ( ) and ( ) report responses to the bond spread shock; columns ( ) and\n8 9 10\n( ) report responses to an oil price shock; and columns ( ) and ( ) report responses to a\ntechnology shock.\n1 1\nThe static estimates of the Okun coefficient reported in row ( ) and columns ( ) and\n2 2 38 2 12\n( ) suggest little difference across samples, - . vs. - . . This is not always the case\nwhen focusing across shocks nor is this apparent stability visible even in the subcomponent\n1 2\nanalysis for columns ( ) and ( ). To the best of our knowledge, this important feature has\nnot been highlighted in the literature before.\n1 2\nConsider the static results in columns ( ) and ( ) first. The coefficient for total hours\n1 96 2 89\nbecomes about 1/3 larger (from - . to - . ) with the Great Moderation. The brunt of\n1 56 2 35\nthe change is in the number of employees (- . to - . ) rather than hours per employee,\n0 40 0 54\nwhich remain largely constant (- . to - . ). It is striking that with the advent of the\nso-called “gig-economy” and more flexible work schedules, on aggregate the declines in\ninnovation and workers’ bargaining power appear to have a much larger effect. The more\n0 42\ninteresting shift happens in labor productivity. It shifts from being procyclical (- . ) to\n0 77\nbecoming strongly countercyclical ( . ), a result that others have noted (see, e.g. Stiroh,\n2009 2010 2014 2015\n; Gordon, ; Gal´ı and van Rens, ; and Fernald and Wang, ).\nThe literature has suggested that the changing cyclicality of labor productivity can\nbe explained by the changing role of monetary shocks during the Great Moderation.\n2010 2009\nBarnichon ( ) and Gal´ı and Gambetti ( ) argue that during the Great Moderation,\nstructural changes in the economy (such as, the decline in hiring and firing costs, rising\nshare of temporary workers, the decline of unions and the increase in flexibility in labor\nmarkets) may have changed how the economy responds to monetary shocks, and even\nchanged the sign of the correlation between labor productivity and unemployment. In\n2004\naddition, Gal´ı, Lopez-Salido and Voiles ( ) argue that monetary policy has become more\naccommodative to technology shocks, reducing the response of the unemployment to the\nlatter shocks.\n9 10\nHow do our results compare against this literature? Columns ( ) and ( ), which corre-\nspond to the Okun elasticities from technology shocks, provide support to the arguments\n2004 1\nin Gal´ı, Lopez-Salido and Voiles ( ) and others. The Okun coefficient ir row ( ) goes\n309 019 3 10\nfrom - . to . . Moreover, turning to columns ( )–( ), the pattern that emerges is very\nrevealing. In this respect, labor productivity is, if anything, more procyclical since the\nGreat Moderation started when one considers monetary, credit, and oil related shocks. The\n3\ncoefficients reported in row ( ) either remain about the same or become more negative. The\n17\n\ncountercyclicality of productivity seems to be a phenomenon that is largely associated with\n005 042\ntechnology, whose coefficients goes from . to . .\n1\nThe results reported in Table suggest that the unconditional negative relationship\nbetween labor productivity and unemployment in the full sample results can only be\nobtained in response to monetary shocks, as all other shocks at hand yield statistically\ninconclusive results. This finding, however, disappears in the subsample analysis.\nTaking a broader perspective, two results stand out. First, the magnitude of the Okun\ncoefficient comes mainly from the strong response of hours worked rather than from labor\nproductivity. The hours response is roughly twice as large as that allowed for in typical\nDynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models with unemployment, which reflect\nthe back-of-the-envelope arithmetic discussed in the previous section. Most models do not\nallow for enough margins of adjustment. Second, the Okun coefficient is relatively stable\nover time. This is surprising given the Great Moderation, and the shift in the cyclicality of\nlabor productivity from procyclical to countercyclical.\n5 he distribution of shocks since the reat oderation\n. T G M\nThe Great Moderation has been associated to a number of explanations. Firms’ willingness\nto adjust workforce over workweek is a good example, a willingness often blamed on a\ncombination of deunionization and skill-biased technological change (see, e.g. Acemoglu,\n2001\nAghion and Violante, ). However, shifts in the bargaining power of workers are a plau-\nsible explanation for the U.S. and the U.K., but the Great Moderation transcended to almost\n2005\nevery advanced economy (Stock and Watson, ), even those where unions remained\nstrong. Explanations have naturally turned to phenomena with a more international reach.\nAmong them, better monetary policy through inflation targeting (Boivin and Giannoni,\n2006 2010\n), more stable commodity prices (Nakov and Pescatori, ), and even dumb luck\n2004\n(Ahmed, Levin and Wilson, ). The debate rages on.\nMany of the explanations on the causes of the Great Moderation are often complemen-\ntary rather than exclusionary. Our focus has been to examine the manner firms adjust to\neach of these potential explanations, and hence, characterize firm behavior rather than\narbitrating across explanations. In this section, the focus is on describing shifts in the\ndistribution of the main drivers examined in the previous section: interest rates, oil prices\n(expressed as a growth rate), bond premiums and productivity (also expressed as a growth\nrate).\n18\n\nselpmas\n4891-tsoP\ndna\n-erP\n.seiticitsale\nnukO\ncfiiceps-kcohS\n:2\nelbaT\n(cid:63)PFT\necirp\nliO\ndaerps\ndnoB\nsetar\ntseretnI\ncitatS\n)01(\n)9(\n)8(\n)7(\n)6(\n)5(\n)4(\n)3(\n)2(\n)1(\n4891-tsoP\n4891-erP\n4891-tsoP\n4891-erP\n4891-tsoP\n4891-erP\n4891-tsoP\n4891-erP\n4891-tsoP\n4891-erP\n91.0\n∗∗∗90.3-\n∗∗∗46.4-\n∗∗∗45.2-\n∗∗∗98.5-\n∗∗∗41.1-\n∗∗∗10.7-\n∗∗∗27.2-\n∗∗∗21.2-\n∗∗∗83.2-\ntuptuO\n)1(\n)79.0(\n)47.0(\n)20.1(\n)35.0(\n)93.1(\n)03.0(\n)03.1(\n)56.0(\n)12.0(\n)11.0(\n71.1-\n∗∗∗95.2-\n∗∗∗72.3-\n∗∗∗80.2-\n∗∗∗49.3-\n∗∗∗98.1-\n∗∗∗93.4-\n∗∗∗00.2-\n∗∗∗98.2-\n∗∗∗69.1-\nsruoH\n)2(\n)09.0(\n)05.0(\n)97.0(\n)83.0(\n)20.1(\n)32.0(\n)60.1(\n)94.0(\n)31.0(\n)70.0(\n56.0-\n∗∗∗81.1-\n∗∗96.1-\n∗∗∗53.1-\n∗∗∗24.3-\n∗∗∗00.1-\n∗∗∗72.3-\n∗∗∗82.1-\n∗∗∗53.2-\n∗∗∗65.1-\nseeyolpmE\n)a2(\n)15.0(\n)42.0(\n)15.0(\n)71.0(\n)26.0(\n)01.0(\n)36.0(\n)32.0(\n)01.0(\n)70.0(\n∗∗26.1-\n∗∗∗07.0-\n∗∗∗65.1-\n61.0-\n40.1-\n∗∗∗33.0-\n96.0-\n91.0-\n∗∗∗45.0-\n∗∗∗04.0-\neeyolpme\nrep\nsruoH\n)b2(\n)05.0(\n)12.0(\n)54.0(\n)51.0(\n)65.0(\n)60.0(\n)35.0(\n)31.0(\n)90.0(\n)40.0(\n24.0\n50.0\n62.1-\n90.0-\n48.0-\n03.0-\n06.0-\n57.0-\n∗∗∗77.0\n∗∗∗24.0-\nytivitcudorp\nrobaL\n)3(\n)77.0(\n)93.0(\n)77.0(\n)03.0(\n)21.1(\n)52.0(\n)70.1(\n)74.0(\n)12.0(\n)11.0(\n48\n041\n48\n041\n48\n04\n48\n65\n29\n441\nN\nnmulocni1elbaTnidetroperstluserehtotdnopserroc)2(dna)1(snmuloC\n.levelecnedfinoc%09/59/99ehttaecnacfiingissetacidni\n∗/∗∗/∗∗∗\n:setoN\ndnaPLgnisusetamitsestroper)01(dna)9(snmuloC\n.snoitcnufesnopsereslupmignitluserehtdnaVIPLgnisusetamitsetroper)8(-)3(snmuloC\n.)1(\nehtelihw,4Q4891ot1Q9491morfsnurelpmas4891-erpehT\n.sesehtnerapnidetropererasrorredradnatS\n.snoitcnufesnopsereslupmignitlusereht\ndna4Q4891ot1Q9691morfnurselpmas4891-erpesohw,daerpsdnobdnaetartseretniroftpecxe,4Q7002ot1Q5891morfsnurelpmas4891-tsop\n.ylevitcepser,4Q4891ot1Q3791morf\n19\n\n1984\nWe begin with summary statistics stratified by era, before and after , and reported\n3\nin Table .

Simple tests of the equality of means across samples suggest that\n1\nfor bond spread and technology shocks, the center of the distributions have shifted in a\nsignificant manner. Interest rates are much less volatile and relatively more symmetric\nabout the mean than they used to be. Not surprisingly, interest rates are highly persistent.\nAlthough the mean for oil prices has not shifted significantly, the volatility of oil prices is\n(cid:63)\nmuch higher during the Great Moderation era. Bond spreads have nearly doubled. TFP is\n1984\ngrowing considerably slower in the post- era, with negative skewness.\nTable 3: Summary statistics before and after the Great Moderation\nInterest Rate Oil prices Bond Spread TFP*\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n1984 1984 1984 1984 1984 1984 1984 1984\nPre- Post- Pre- Post- Pre- Post- Pre- Post-\nMean 5 . 00 4 . 70 1 . 60 1 . 30 1 . 10 1 . 70 1 . 50 1 . 10\np-value [ 0 . 49 ] [ 0 . 81 ] [ 0 . 00 ] [ 0 . 06 ]\nS.D. 3 . 30 1 . 90 8 . 50 13 . 50 0 . 30 0 . 70 1 . 70 1 . 40\nSkewness 1 . 10 - 0 . 20 7 . 20 - 0 . 80 1 . 40 1 . 40 0 . 10 - 0 . 70\nρ 0 . 97 0 . 97 0 . 18 0 . 16 0 . 83 0 . 93 0 . 69 0 . 74\n1\n144 92 144 92 48 92 144 92\nN\nNotes: Meanreferstothesamplemean;p-valuereferstothep-valueofthenullthatthesamplemeanbetween\nsamples is the same; S.D. refers to standard deviation; Skewness refers to the skewness coefficient; and ρ\n1\nrefers to the coefficient of first order serial correlation. The pre-1984 sample runs from 1949Q1 to 1984Q4,\nwhile the post-1984 sample runs from 1985Q1 to 2007Q4, except for interest rate and bond spread, whose\npre-1984samplesrunfrom1969Q1to1984Q4andfrom1973Q1to1984Q4,respectively.\nThe main takeaway from the analysis can therefore be summarized as follows. Although\nthere have been noticeable differences in the distribution of the treatment factors that we\nconsidered in the analysis, to a great extent the overall effect of each of all these factors\n(with perhaps the exception of interest rates), has not changed as dramatically as one would\nexpect. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the overall estimate of the Okun coefficient\n2\nacross samples reported in Table has not varied very much even though, as we document\nin that table, the margins that, on aggregate, firms use to adjust to shocks appear to have\nshifted considerably.\nAltogether, we find both that the nature of shocks hitting the economy and firms’\nresponses to these shocks have changed. In some cases, such as for the bond spread and oil\n20\n\nprice shocks, the coefficients on some of the margins have shifted considerably. Something\n2\nsimilar can be said about technology shocks. Table shows that the coefficients estimated\n1984\nover the Great Moderation yield a clear departure from the pre- patterns. Therefore,\nthese findings provide some evidence that, at least in response to these shocks, shifts in the\nfirms’ aggregate behavior have played a role in explaining the differences between firms’\n1984\nresponses between the pre- and the post- periods.\nThe different dynamics of interest rate shocks come as no surprise since, as shown\n1996 2011\nby Leeper, Sims and Zha ( ) and Gal´ı, Smets and Wouters ( ), monetary shocks\nhave played a different role during the Great Moderation, and have been responsible for a\n2\nsmaller fraction of the variances of output and unemployment. In addition, Table shows\nthat the components of the Okun coefficient seem to also have changed during that period\nin response to an interest rate shock, with an increase (in absolute value) in the coefficients\nof both the Okun coefficient and number of employees.\n6 hat explains the cyclicality of productivity\n. W ?\n4\nAs Section showed, the cyclicality of labor productivity has switched over the sample. It\nwent from being procyclical to becoming countercyclical. We explore the mechanisms that\nmay explain this switch in more detail in this section. To do this, we move from simple\nidentities to a more formal growth accounting framework as in Basu, Fernald and Kimball\n2006\n( ).\nSpecifically, suppose output Y depends on three terms: capital services W ×K, effective\nlabor services L× Q×Φ , and technology, A. Capital services, in turn, depend on the\nstock of capital, K, and the workweek of capital (the number of hours capital is actually\nin operation), W. Effective labor services depend on hours L; the average “quality” of\nΦ\neach hour, Q (which captures age, experience, and other observables); and effort per\nΦ\nquality-adjusted hour. Note that capital utilization shows up in W and labor hoarding in .\nA is technology. We suppress time subscripts for simplicity. The production function can\ntherefore be expressed as:\nY = F(W ×K;L×Q×Φ ;A). ( 11 )\n1\nNext, take log differences and impose the usual growth-accounting assumptions: ( ) that\n2\nthe representative firm produces with constant returns; ( ) that it faces perfect competition;\n3\nand ( ) that it takes factor prices as given. Under these assumptions, cost-minimization\n21\n\nimplies that output elasticities are equal to factor shares. We denote the capital’s share by α\nand the labor’s share by (1−α). In the Cobb-Douglas case, the factor shares are constant.\nIn the more general case the shares and the output elasticities change over time. We explore\n11\nthis time variation further in the empirical analysis that follows.\n11\nWith these assumptions, the production function in equation ( ) takes the form (ex-\npressed in growth rates):\n∆ y = α(∆ k+∆ w)+(1−α)(∆ l+∆ φ+∆ q)+∆ a, ( 12 )\n∆\nwhere, again, we use lower case to indicate the logs of the variables and to denote first\ndifferences. We have normalized the elasticity of output with respect to technology to be\none.\n∆\nWe define the standard measure of total factor productivity (TFP) growth, z, as output\ngrowth less share-weighted input growth. That is:\n∆ z = ∆ y−α ∆ k−(1−α)(∆ l+∆ q).\nDefining the contribution of factor utilization (the workweek of capital and labor effort)\ntogrowthas ∆ υ ≡ α ∆ w+(1−α)∆ φ,wecanthenuseexpression( 12 )towrite ∆ z = ∆ υ+∆ a.\nThat is, TFP growth reflects variations in factor utilization and in technology. We will refer\n∆ (cid:63)\nto the empirical counterpart of a as “utilization-adjusted TFP” or TFP , which is the\nshorthand we have been using for referring to technology shocks in earlier parts of the\n∆\npaper. a is technology for the case of perfect competition and an aggregate production\n12\nfunction. This is the measure we have used in the preceding analysis.\nExpression ( 12 ) can now be rearranged in terms of labor productivity, (∆ y−∆ l), where:\n∆ y−∆ l = α(∆ k−∆ l)+(1−α)∆ q+(α ∆ w+(1−α)∆ φ)+∆ a\n≡ α(∆ k−∆ l)+(1−α)∆ q+∆ υ+∆ a.

Thus, Table reports the labor productivity estimates in row ( ) of Table to help\nthe reader, and then provides a similar analysis for each of the subcomponents of labor\n13\nproductivity using expression ( ).\n4\nTable is quite revealing. Once again, while labor productivity coefficients for interest\nrates and credit shocks look similar on the surface, there are dramatic changes taking place\n1 2\nin the subcomponents. First, we discuss the overall shifts reported in columns ( ) and ( )\nfor the static case. The shift in the cyclicality of labor productivity is largely explained\n(cid:63) 1985\nby shifts in utilization rates. TFP is slightly more countercyclical after . The shift is\n3 4\nmore dramatic when considering the interest rate estimates in columns ( ) and ( ). Notice\n3 2 (cid:63) 0 57 0 90\nthat row ( c ) corresponding to TFP switches from being countercyclical (- . to . ).\n3\nInterestingly, although labor productivity has similar values in row ( ) for interest rate and\n3 2\nbond spread shocks, the switch in row ( c ) for the bond spread is exactly the opposite of\n(cid:63)\nthat just discussed for interest rates. TFP goes from being countercyclical to procyclical\n048 044\ninstead ( . to - . ).\nOil markets offer a different perspective. Here labor productivity becomes much more\nprocyclical, in large part explained by the shift in the utilization margin. Estimates in row\n3 1 065 236 (cid:63) 014 096\n( c ) switch from - . to - . even as TFP is becoming more countercyclical, . to . .\nSince workers could be displaced more easily as unemployment increases, labor produc-\ntivity also rises, becoming countercyclical. The change in cyclicality of labor productivity\ncomes as a result of a change in all of its components, particularly factor utilization. The\nincrease in the coefficients of capital deepening, of labor quality, and of utilization basically\nreflects a compositional effect. As unemployment rises and the number of employees\ndeclines, capital deepening (capital-labor ratio) and labor quality increase as qualified\nworkers are more likely to remain employed. Utilization is still negatively correlated with\n1984\nunemployment, although this correlation is weaker in the post- sample—the larger\ndisplacement of workers is accompanied by a smaller decline in factor utilization, relative\n1984\nto the pre- sample.\n7 onclusion\n. C\n2 100\nTheU.S.economyhasgeneratedgrowthofabout %percapitaover years, aremarkable\nfeat of stability. Underneath that stability, punctuated by the avatars of geopolitical events,\n24\n\nfinancial crises and the business cycle, hides an ever-changing economy. Through the lens\nof the economy’s production function, we have investigated the manner labor and capital\n2\nmarkets interact in the face of technological and institutional change since WW , focusing\non the before and the after of the Great Moderation.\nLongstanding relationships among the big macroeconomic aggregates, such as Okun’s\nLaw, have stood remarkably still over this period. Yet beneath this deceiving calm, currents\nof change criss-crossed the economic ocean floor. Enduring benchmarks on which macroe-\nconomic models have been designed and calibrated turn out to have evolved in some ways\nknown and unknown. The latter have been the focus of this paper.\nOur paper makes several contributions. We show that firms have increasingly preferred\nto adjust workforce over workweek, and therefore hours have become more responsive\nto unemployment fluctuations. Intensive and extensive margins play important roles:\nutilization rates, capital deepening and labor quality all vary in ways that had not been fully\n2010 2009\nappreciated (exceptions include Barnichon, and Gal´ı and Gambetti, ). Productivity,\none of the fundamental forces of prosperity, has switched from being countercyclical to\nbeing procyclical. The implications of such a shift are difficult to underestimate. It begs\nthe question: Does countercyclical policy matter not just in the short-run, but also in the\nmedium and long-runs? Our results indicate that much depends on the nature of the shock\nthe economy experiences in any given moment.\nOur paper makes other contributions. On the methodological front, we have provided a\nnew approach to investigate how fundamental moments of the economy vary depending\non the shock experienced. In addition, we have discussed a different approach to evaluating\nthe relative explanatory power of exogenous forces, whose impact and volatility have also\nchanged. In aggregate, firms adjust to different shocks differently.\nFactor utilization turns out to play an important role, in particular, providing important\nevidence in support of a large literature that emphasizes the importance of unobserved\nvariations in factor intensity as an explanation for movements in productivity (see Basu and\n2001\nFernald, and references therein). Moreover, this result ties into many DSGE models\nthat find that a utilization margin helps propagate shocks.\n25\n\neferences\nR\n2001\nAaronson, Daniel, and Daniel G.

Fernald ( a) Quarterly Growth-Accounting Data\nThesedataareavailableathttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/jfernald/\nquarterly_tfp.xls. They include quarterly growth-accounting measures for the business-\nsector, including output, hours worked, labor quality (or composition), capital input, and\n1947 2\ntotal factor productivity from :Q on. In addition, they include a measure of factor\n2006\nutilization that follows Basu, Fernald and Kimball ( ). They are typically updated one\n2011 4\nto two months after the end of the quarter (for example, data through :Q were posted\n2 2012\non February , , following the release of BLS Labor Productivity and Costs data for the\nfourth quarter). Once aggregated to an annual frequency, they are fairly close to the annual\nBLS multifactor productivity estimates, although there are some differences in coverage\n13\nand implementation.\n2014\nThe data are described in greater detail in Fernald ( a). Key data sources for\nestimating (unadjusted) quarterly TFP for the U.S. business sector are:\n(i) Business output: We use income and expenditure side measures of real output. The\n135 136\nexpenditure side, which corresponds to GDP is reported in NIPA Tables . . and . .\n(gross value added by sector). Nominal business income (the business counterpart\n1 3 5\nof GDI) is GDI less nominal non-business output from Table . . . Real GDI and\nbusiness income uses the expenditure-side deflators.\n(ii) Hours: From the quarterly BLS productivity and cost release.\n13\n(iii) Capitalinput: Weightedgrowthin typesofdisaggregatedquarterlycapital. Weights\nareestimatedfactor payments(which, inturn, useestimatedusercosts). The quarterly\nnational income and product accounts (produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis,\n6\nBEA) provide quarterly investment data for types of non-residential equipment\n5\nand software; and for types of non-residential structures. I use these data to create\nperpetual-inventory series on (end of previous quarter, i.e., beginning of current\nquarter) capital stocks by different type of asset. In addition, I use quarterly NIPA\n13 Tonamesixminordifferences: (i)BLScoversprivatebusiness,Fernald(2014a)coverstotalbusiness.

For a review of the\nmethodologyandhistoryoftheBLSmeasures,seeDeanandHarper(2001).\n31\n\ndata on inventory stocks and interpolate/extrapolate the annual BLS estimates of\nland input. Note that the data also allow me to calculate sub-aggregates, such as\nequipment and software capital, or structures capital.\n(iv) Factor shares: Interpolated and, where necessary, extrapolated from the annual data\non factor shares, α and (1−α), from the BLS multifactor productivity database.\n(v) Labor composition: Interpolated and extrapolated from annual measures in the BLS\nmultifactor productivity data.\nTo estimate a quarterly series on utilization, the key data source is the following:\n(cid:16) (cid:17)\n(vi) Hours-per-worker\nHi\nby industry i from the monthly employment report of the\nNi\n(cid:16) (cid:17)\nBLS. These are used to estimate a series on industry utilization ∆ ln Υ = β ∆ ln Hi ,\ni i Ni\nwhere βi is a coefficient estimated by Basu, Fernald and Kimball ( 2006 ). Fernald\n( 2014 b) then calculates an aggregate utilization adjustment as ∆ ln Υ = Σ w ∆ ln Υ ,\ni i i\n2006\nwhere is the industry weight from Basu, Fernald and Kimball ( ) (taken as the\naverage value over the full sample).\nThe resulting utilization-adjusted series differs conceptually from the Basu, Fernald and\n2006\nKimball ( ) purified technology series along several dimensions. Those authors use\ndetailed industry data to construct estimates of industry technology change that control for\nvariable factor utilization and deviations from constant returns and perfect competition.\nThey then aggregate these residuals to estimate aggregate technology change. Thus, they do\nnot assume the existence of a constant-returns aggregate production function. The industry\n2006\ndata needed to undertake the Basu, Fernald and Kimball ( ) estimates are available only\nannually, not quarterly. As a result, the quarterly series estimated here does not control for\n14\ndeviations from constant returns and perfect competition.\nFor this paper, we modify the labor-quality adjusted TFP and utilization-adjusted TFP\n2014\nmeasures relative to the figures in the downloadable spreadsheet. The Fernald ( a)\ndataset uses two measures of labor “quality” to adjust for the composition of the workforce\nby age, education, and other observable demographics. The first measure is interpolated\nfrom the annual estimates available from the BLS and is available for the entire sample. The\nsecond is a true quarterly measure from the Current Population Survey, which implements\n2001\nthe quarterly composition adjustment from Aaronson and Sullivan ( ). Although\n14\nTheoutputdataalsodiffer,bothinvintageanddatasource,fromtheannualdatausedbyBasu,Fernald\nandKimball(2006).\n32\n\n1979\ntheoretically preferable, this second measure is available only since . Especially when\nwe look at time variation in coefficients, it is important to have a consistent measure. Hence,\nwe adjust TFP and utilization adjusted TFP to use the consistent, interpolated BLS measure.\n2 1984\nA. . Adjusting to shocks: pre- and post-\n1 5\nFigure A reports estimates of the responses based on equation ( ) for output, unemploy-\nment rate, total hours and labor productivity based on LPIVs for the interest rate, credit\n(cid:63)\nspread and oil price shocks, and based on LPs for the TFP shock. These impulse response\nfunctions provide input to the construction of the corresponding coefficients reported on\n2\nmain text Table . We do not report the impulse responses for the remaining components\nof output in the interest of space, although they are available upon request.\n1\nFigure A is organized as follows. Each row provides the response of output, unemploy-\nment, total hours and labor productivity to each type of shock. For each variable, the panel\n1984\nreports the impulse response function estimated in the pre- and the post- subsamples.\n1984\nSolid circles indicate that the response in the pre- sample is statistically significant\n10 1984\nat the % level, while open circles indicate that the response in the post- sample is\n10\nstatistically significant at the % level.\n3\nA. . Including the Great Recession\nThroughout the paper, at the cost of loosing data points, we have excluded data since the\nGreat Recession. This was so because we did not want to have the turmoil of the Great\nRecession years possibly biasing our results.\n1 2 1984\nIn this Section we redo the main text Tables and but allow the post- sample to\n1985 2015 2\ninclude the Great Recession and the recovery, i.e., the sample runs from to Q .\n1 2\nResults are reported in Tables A and A . For completeness, in these tables we also include\nresults corresponding to the components of labor productivity (in analogy to the main text\n4\nTable ).\nIn very general terms, results change somewhat in the sample including the Great\nRecession. A few differences worth noting arise.\n1\nStarting with Table A , the full sample analysis yields a positive and statistically\n10\nsignificant (at %) coefficient for labor productivity in response to the bond spread shock,\nwhile in the pre-Great Recession sample, this coefficient was negative and not statistically\nsignificant. The inclusion of the Great Recession and recovery period implies the addition\nof data points in which these bond spread shocks were the most volatile.

The severity of the crisis and the singularity of movements\nin bond spreads in that period may have affected the economy through other channels than\nthose allowed for in the model, for example, by possibly affecting households’ confidence\n2013 2015\n(e.g., Angeletos and La’O, and Benhabib, Wang and Wen, ). These singular\ndevelopments may be behind the aforementioned change in magnitude and statistical\n2\nsignificance in the correlation between labor productivity and unemployment. Table A\nconcurs with this discussion by showing that the positive and statistically significant\ncoefficient on labor productivity in response to the bond spread shock appears in the\n1985 2015\n- subsample only.\n2\nIn addition, Table A also shows a somewhat changed role for interest rate shocks, with\n1985 2007\nmuch more muted coefficients relative to the results for the - sample reported\n2\nin Table . This comes as no surprise, as since and during the Great recession, the use of\ninterest rates as a monetary policy tool has been limited.\n35\n\nTable A1: Dynamic component-wise responses to different shocks\nIncluding the Great Recession\n1\nTable Interest rates Bond spread Oil price TFP*\n1 2 3 4 5\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n1 221∗∗∗ 352∗∗∗ 214∗∗∗ 243∗∗∗ 278∗∗∗\n( ) Output - . - . - . - . - .\n009 089 050 049 062\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n2 208∗∗∗ 264∗∗∗ 264∗∗∗ 213∗∗∗ 242∗∗∗\n( ) Hours - . - . - . - . - .\n006 069 038 039 047\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n2 166∗∗∗ 129∗∗∗ 221∗∗∗ 133∗∗∗ 146∗∗∗\n( a) Employees - . - . - . - . - .\n006 038 024 021 026\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n2 041∗∗∗ 045 047∗∗∗ 056∗∗∗ 076∗∗∗\n( b) Hours per employee - . - . - . - . - .\n003 026 011 014 018\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n3 013 130∗ 051∗ 007 023\n( ) Labor productivity - . - . . . - .\n009 055 025 028 033\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n3 064∗∗∗ 084∗∗∗ 058∗∗∗ 073∗∗∗ 062∗∗∗\n( a) Capital deepening . . . . .\n002 019 012 012 015\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n3 006∗∗∗ 029∗∗ 017∗∗∗ 004 019∗∗∗\n( b) Labor quality . . . . .\n001 010 004 004 005\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n3 082∗∗∗ 248∗∗∗ 016 076∗ 134∗∗∗\n( c) TFP - . - . - . - . - .\n009 063 030 033 041\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n3 1 130∗∗∗ 068 076∗∗ 092∗∗ 248∗∗∗\n( c ) Utilization - . - . - . - . - .\n009 055 024 029 040\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n3 2 048∗∗∗ 100 042 044 084∗\n( c ) TFP* . - . . . .\n008 060 028 027 034\n( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . ) ( . )\n218 287 185\nMin.

    "text": "The Singularity of the Dual Mandate\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBoise State University\nBoise, ID\nSeptember 29, 2022\n1:45pm MDT\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back here in Boise and to be on campus at Boise State.\nSo, thank you very much for the opportunity. I look forward to your questions and to our\ndiscussion.\nI’d like to start by talking briefly about the Federal Reserve’s congressionally mandated goals,\nwhich together form what is known as our dual mandate. One part of that mandate is full\nemployment. The other is price stability.1\nNow, these goals are often characterized as tradeoffs. More of one means less of the other.\nBut for most people, they are deeply intertwined.\nI know this from my many years as a policymaker. But I also know it from experience.\nI grew up in Ballwin, Missouri, during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. Rapidly rising prices\nmade it hard for working families like mine to afford the things we needed. Eventually, the\nFederal Reserve raised interest rates and inflation came down. But the abruptness and\nmagnitude of the response caused two painful recessions. Unemployment soared. Jobs\nbecame tough to find. And one impossible situation gave way to another.\nI didn’t know it then, but this experience would teach me an enduring lesson, one that I would\ncarry with me over the course of my career as a policymaker. The lesson is that economic\nsecurity depends on both jobs and stable prices. Together, these two pillars form the\nfoundation for everything else.\n1 In August of 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released a long-run statement that defined full employment\nand price stability goals (see Board of Governors 2022a).\n1\n\nSeen in this light, the Federal Reserve actually has a singular purpose: to keep the economy on\na sustainable path by delivering low, stable prices and durable labor market strength.\nToday, I am going to discuss this singular purpose and how price stability and full employment\nwork together to support it. But before I continue, let me remind you that the views I will\nexpress are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nInextricably Linked\nIf you travel almost anywhere in the United States these days, you’ll hear two things about the\neconomy. The first is that the labor market is strong. The second is that inflation is high.\nBoth of these things are true.\nVirtually anyone who wants a job can find one.2 Unemployment is extremely low and has been\nso for some time. Job growth continues to run well above 300,000 per month, about 200,000\njobs more than we need to keep pace with new graduates and others entering the labor force.3\nAll of this adds up to about twice as many vacant positions nationwide as there are people\nwanting to fill them. As any business owner will tell you, this puts considerable pressure on\nwages and salaries.\nSo it’s a great time to be a worker, right?\nWell, not so much. Inflation is high, running well over the Fed’s average 2 percent target for\nwell over a year now. This can be traced back to a number of factors, but it boils down to a\nlarge and persistent imbalance between demand and supply. Demand has been supported by\npandemic-related monetary and fiscal relief, robust household savings and, over the past year,\na very strong labor market. At the same time, domestic and global supply have been highly\nconstrained, hit by a series of negative shocks, including the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and\nsevere labor shortages.\nPersistent high inflation across a broad range of goods and services is eroding the purchasing\npower of earnings, even those that are rising. This erosion is insidious—a gradual, but\npersistent chipping away of living standards. The picture makes this clear (see Figure 1). Price\ninflation measured by the consumer price index, or CPI, has been rising far faster than average\n2 As of July 2022, there were 1.98 job openings per unemployed worker. And the economy has been adding about\n487,000 jobs per month on average over the past year.\n3 About 80,000 new jobs are needed to keep the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent over the next year, according\nto the Atlanta Fed Job Calculator (https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/calculator).\n2\n\nhourly earnings. Indeed, average real wages, which take account of inflation, have declined by\n9 percent over the past two years. This means that the average worker in the U.S. economy has\nlost rather than gained ground, all while the labor market remains historically strong.\nThe story is even starker when we look at prices for basic necessities like food and energy.\nThese prices have been climbing about twice as fast as overall inflation and around three times\nas fast as average hourly earnings. The toll of this type of inflation falls on everyone, but it does\nnot fall uniformly.4 It lands hardest on those with low and moderate incomes, who spend a far\nlarger fraction of their monthly budget on basic needs.5\nThis corroding of real wages is more than just painful. It also undermines the basic American\npromise, which says that if you work hard, you can get ahead. Inflation traps people in an\nendless loop of running fast and falling behind, unrelated to effort or input.\nEventually, this sense of falling behind starts to affect decisionmaking.\n4 Low- and moderate-income families spend, on average, about 75 to 80 percent of their budgets on necessities,\ncompared to 65 percent for high-income families (see Council of Economic Advisors and Office of Management\nand Budget 2021).\n5 Inflation also erodes savings in fixed-income assets. This cost is not shared equally across the population since\nportfolio compositions differ across groups (see, for example, Diwan, Duzhak, and Mertens 2021). In particular,\nolder and less wealthy citizens tend to have a higher share of checkable deposits as a fraction of their financial\nassets (see Board of Governors 2022c).\n3\n\nDistortions and Decisions\nAs people struggle to keep up with rising prices, earning money becomes the central factor in\ndetermining which jobs they choose.\nNow, in some ways this seems fine. We work so we can buy things—to support ourselves, take\ncare of our families, and give back to our communities. But when wages dominate all other\nconsiderations, like the type of job we do or the chance for future mobility, they become a\nwedge—putting space between what people need today and what they want for their future.\nWorkers everywhere are facing these choices. I recently heard an example at a gathering of\nlocal business leaders. One of them was from a large restaurant group with locations in\nmultiple cities. It offered competitive salaries, health benefits, and lots of opportunities for\nprofessional growth. But longtime employees who had been advancing through the ranks and\nbuilding careers with the organization were suddenly leaving. When the owner asked them\nwhy, he learned they were no longer able to afford rent near the city and had to move much\nfarther away. Then gas prices started to rise and commuting so far became unsustainable. So\nmany of them left to take lower-paying fast-food jobs nearer to where they lived. These jobs\nhad fewer benefits and little opportunity for upward mobility. But what choice did they have?\nThey had to manage their short-term budget pressures, even when it meant giving up jobs with\nbrighter long-term prospects.\nThe effect of these choices, multiplied across large numbers of workers, has an impact on firms.\nBusinesses are experiencing considerable churn in their employee base, often losing workers as\nfast as they can train them.6 Their response is predictable: raise wages as much as possible to\ntry and retain staff; divide jobs into simpler tasks that require less training; and accelerate the\nsearch for ways to automate or outsource in order to reduce future worker demand. In the\nmeantime, produce less and expand more slowly.\nUnfortunately, the distortions from high inflation don’t stop there. They also influence longer-\nterm decision making in a way that lingers well after inflation has come down. One of the\nclearest examples of this long-term impact can be seen in trends in postsecondary schooling.\nEnrollments in two and four-year colleges, certification programs, and technical training are all\nfalling.7 This is happening for many reasons, but two key factors are affordability and\nopportunity cost. Postsecondary education is already expensive. But it is even more costly\nwhen people have to give up earnings and still pay more for gas, food, and rent. And when\n6 According to the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, more people have been quitting\ntheir jobs over the past year than in any year since the survey started in December 2000\n(https://www.bls.gov/jlt/).\n7 Enrollment in postsecondary education has declined as of the spring of this year (see National Student\nClearinghouse Research Center 2022).\n4\n\nfirms are avidly bidding up wages to compete for workers, the equation just doesn’t add up.\nAnd so young people are taking jobs and delaying or opting out of school.8\nAnd here again, these individual choices bubble up to firms. Their strategic decisions about\nwhere to locate, expand, and invest are shaped by the projected availability of workers,\nespecially skilled ones. As they plan for their future, declining school enrollments will factor\ninto all of these decisions.\nIn other words, persistently high inflation is painful and it's disruptive. It seeps into everything,\nincluding investment, production, and growth. Over time, it accumulates into a mountain of\nmisallocations and lost opportunities. And it adds up to a smaller economic pie for all.\nAnd this is why price stability is so crucial. It allows households and businesses to make\ndecisions based on preferences, ideas, drive, and talent and lays the foundation for sustainable\ngrowth and durable expansion now and in the future. Price stability is like an asset that pays\ndividends year after year. And protecting it supports everyone.\nReturning to Two Percent\nBut when you have been far away from something for a while, it can seem hard to find your\nway back. And this is the concern that many have about inflation. People worry that\nsomething has been lost, and the only way to regain it is to induce a painful recession like the\nones we saw in the 1980s.9\nBut the circumstances back then were different. Policymakers had two major problems. One\nwas that inflation was high and rising. Another was that inflation had been elevated for more\nthan a decade and had seeped into the psychology of American consumers and businesses.\nEveryone expected high inflation to continue. So as inflation went up, longer-term inflation\nexpectations went up with it.10 The Fed had no choice but to “rip the Band-Aid” off and\ndramatically slow the economy in order to reset inflation psychology.11\n8 A hot labor market can tilt incentives towards short-run economic gains at the expense of longer-term\nsustainable progress (Aaronson et al. 2019). For example, as shown by Blom, Cadena, and Keys (2021), business\ncycle conditions affect college students’ choice of their major. And changes in labor markets and overall economic\nactivity affect enrollment rates (see, for example, Dellas and Koubi 2003 and Dellas and Sakellaris 2003).\n9 Goodfriend and King (2005) describe the recessions in the early 1980s that followed the pursuit to lower the rate\nof inflation.\n10 The co-movement between inflation expectations and inflation can be found in Daly (2022). Erceg and Levin\n(2003) show that learning about persistent versus transitory shifts in the interest rate rule can account for this\neffect.\n11 For an account of the Volcker disinflation, see Silber (2012).\n5\n\nToday, we are in a better place. Of course, inflation has been too high for too long, coming in\nabove target for more than a year. But inflation expectations, especially at the longer end,\nhave remained stable and well anchored around the Fed’s 2-percent inflation goal. This means\nthat, so far, inflation psychology has not been lost and the public continues to believe the Fed\nhas the tools and the resolve to restore price stability.12\nBut we cannot take this for granted. The longer inflation remains high, the more likely it is to\nchange people’s expectations and undermine confidence.13 14 And that is a problem we must\navoid.\nThe question of course, is how?\nNavigating the economy toward a more sustainable path necessitates higher interest rates and\na downshift in the pace of economic activity and the labor market. But for now, inducing a\ndeep recession does not seem warranted by conditions, nor is it necessary to achieve our\ngoals.\nAnd this is crucial. Decades of research show the heavy toll that deep recessions take on\npeople and families.15 Whole generations of workers feel lasting effects. The impact is striking\n(see Figure 2). People who enter the labor market during a recession come in on lower rungs of\nthe career ladder and earn wages well below their peers who enter during expansions.16\nEveryone is affected; college graduates, non-college graduates, all genders and races. But\nthose historically less advantaged, including those with less than a high school education and\npeople of color, are especially hard hit.17 And these effects are not short-lived. They persist\nthroughout an individual’s career. The more severe the recession, the greater the potential\nharm.\n12 Empirical evidence points to anchored long-term inflation expectations (see, for example, Armantier et al.\n2022).\n13 People tend to form inflation expectations based on the inflation experience during their lifetime (see\nMalmendier and Nagel 2016).\n14 For example, Jordà et al. (2022) shows that wage inflation responds to inflation expectations. Lansing (2022)\npoints out the risk that inflation might become more persistent.\n15 There is a long literature on the cost of economic fluctuations (see, for example, Okun 1973, Lucas 1987, and\nHassan and Mertens 2017). The cost of recessions falls primarily on households at the lower end of the wealth\nspectrum (see Krueger, Mitman, and Perri 2016).\n16 Recessions have a particularly detrimental and long-lasting effect on the career trajectories of young workers\n(for example, von Wachter 2012, Altonji, Kahn, and Speer 2016, and Schwandt and von Wachter 2019). People\nentering the labor market during a recession earn persistently lower wages throughout their career and enter into\nlower-level occupations (see Kahn 2010 and Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2012).\n17 For increases in unemployment rates across subgroups, see Duzhak (2021). Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller (2012)\nstudy the Great Recession in comparison to previous recessions.\n6\n\nAvoiding this kind of harsh recession will not be easy, but we must try.\nAnd we’ve done it before. The expansion that started in the 1990s is a notable example.18\nAfter the Fed tightened policy to keep prices stable, growth slowed but no recession ensued.\nAnd a decade of sustained growth followed.\nNo doubt, the job will be harder this time. We are facing a myriad of risks. Ongoing battles\nwith COVID globally, the war in Ukraine, and impending recession in Europe, all while central\nbanks across the globe are tightening monetary policy to combat high and rising prices.19 These\nrisks, combined with stubbornly persistent supply chain issues, ongoing strength in the labor\nmarket, and robust consumer spending, narrow the path for a smooth landing. But they do not\nclose it.20\nResolute to our goals, the Fed has raised the benchmark interest rate rapidly this year, and\nprojects additional increases will be needed.21 These are necessary and appropriate\nadjustments, taken to put the economy back on a solid footing.\n18 For an account of the end of tightening cycles, see Blinder (2022).\n19 Policy tightening by central banks around the world can lead to more restrictive policy in the United States (see\nObstfeld 2022).\n20 Past recessions have been preceded by an inversion of the yield curve (see Bauer and Mertens 2018). The most\nreliable measure currently does not indicate an inversion, suggesting that a relatively soft landing is still possible\n(see Bauer and Mertens 2022). Bok et al. (2022) discusses the possibility of a reduction in the number of\nvacancies without a pronounced increase in the number of unemployed workers.\n21 See the latest Summary of Economic Projections (Board of Governors 2022b). The FOMC has raised the federal\nfunds rate in 75 basis-point steps three times and, together with other rate hikes, by a total of 3 percentage points\nthis year.\n7\n\nWe are already starting to see the effects—housing markets are cooling, the labor market is\neasing, and projections of future growth are softening. Of course, the full impact of our policies\nwill unfold over time.22 So, we will need to remain attentive to the data, and recognize the\nsigns that enough has been done or more is needed. History tells us that the costs of errors are\nhigh. Too little could allow inflation expectations to drift, requiring even more difficult policy\nactions in the future. And too much could end in overtightening and an unnecessary and\npainful downturn. Successful policy will require vigorous analysis, extreme data dependence,\nand a resolute commitment to delivering on our mandate.\nTwo Mandates, One Goal\nThe enduring lesson of my childhood is that people need both jobs and stable prices. That is\nwhy the dual mandate is not a choice between two desirable things. It is a balance meant to\ndeliver on a singular goal—a sustainable and expanding economy that works for everyone.\nThat is the foundation of economic security. And that is what the Federal Reserve is working to\nachieve.\nThank you.\n22 For a discussion of the lag in monetary policy, see, for example, Greenspan (2004). Empirical estimates can be\nfound in Barnichon and Matthes (2018).\n8\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C. Daly, William Wascher, David W.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:15 a.m. PDT\nJune 22, 2025\nDynamic Central Bank Communication\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nWestern Economic Association International Annual Conference\nSan Francisco, California\nJune 22, 2025\n10:15 a.m. PDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n1\n\nIntroduction\nGood morning and welcome to San Francisco.\nIt’s a complete pleasure to be here today and an honor to be speaking at the WEAI 100th annual\nconference. That’s quite a milestone, and a testament to the association’s enduring contributions to\neconomic research. So, well done and happy anniversary.\nNow, when Maury first invited me to speak, I thought of many topics worthy of focus. But one\nrose above all others, perhaps because it’s perennial, and that is central bank communication.\nAs researchers, and educators, you understand the importance of communicating. It is a large part\nof your jobs.\nFor central bankers, this value has often been harder to recognize. Even doubted.\nCommunication has always come with questions: Should we communicate? How often? And what should\nwe say?\nOn the question of “should we,” my answer is simple. Absolutely. Public institutions have an\nunequivocal obligation to share information. Central banks are no exception. It is a duty of public service\nto be transparent about and accountable for our actions.\nBut this itself is not a license to reflexively do more and more. Communication is also a\nresponsibility, and it comes with an imperative to improve understanding. How to balance these\nobjectives is the topic of my remarks today. I look forward to an active discussion.\nBefore I go any further, I would like to remind you that the views I express today are my own and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System. I also want to emphasize that today I'm speaking broadly about central bank\ncommunication—my remarks are not about the Fed's ongoing framework review.\n2\n\nThe Evolution of Communication\nNow, to understand where central banks might go, it is useful to know where we’ve been. And\nhere I will narrow my focus to the Federal Reserve and the FOMC.\nFor most of its history, the FOMC has worked under a veil of secrecy. This was intentional.\nFederal Reserve officials were either silent or purposely vague,1 letting financial markets learn about\npolicies through inference, by watching movements in market interest rates.2 The prevailing view was\nthat less transparency promoted candid internal debate, minimized disruptive financial market reactions,\nand provided flexibility to respond to unexpected events.3 Moreover, many policymakers thought that\nthey needed to surprise markets for policy to have an effect.4\nToday, the Federal Reserve is significantly more transparent, an evolution that has taken place\nover the past 30 years. This timeline tells the story.5 The FOMC now publishes meeting statements and\nminutes, economic projections and projected interest rate paths, a statement on longer-run goals and\nmonetary policy strategy, and of course, an explicit inflation target.6 The Chair also holds post-meeting\npress conferences, and FOMC participants regularly provide their own commentary and views during\ninter-meeting periods.\n1 As late as the June 2003 FOMC meeting, then-Chair Alan Greenspan advised participants to be “very vague” in response to questions\nabout the conduct of monetary policy. See Federal Open Market Committee (2003). Chair Greenspan generally adhered to this approach,\nreputedly joking to reporters that “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said” (Appelbaum 2012).\n2 The FOMC released its first post-meeting statement in February 1994 and began to release a statement after every regularly\nscheduled meeting in May 1999.\n3 See the discussion in Federal Reserve History (2024) and Blinder et al. (2024).\n4 Poole (2005).\n5 For a broad overview of the evolution of transparency see Daly (2022).\n6 Board of Governors (2024).\n3\n\nThese enhanced communications have had considerable benefits. First, they have increased the\npublic’s understanding of the Federal Reserve’s mandates and commitments. Second, as research has\ndocumented, clear monetary policy communication has helped anchor inflation expectations and helped\nthe FOMC navigate economic shocks more effectively.7 Finally, these communications have allowed\nhouseholds, businesses, and financial markets8 to understand how policy makers see the economy and\nhow they might react if things evolve differently than expected. Ultimately, improving their ability to\nmake good decisions.\nTogether this has improved transparency, credibility and accountability.9 All of which have\nhelped build trust.\n7 Bundick and Smith (2023).\n8 For instance, Swanson (2006). Also, recent work at the San Francisco Fed shows that the quarterly release of participant projections\non the outlook for the economy and interest rates reduces investor uncertainty about the future path of interest rates. This effect is especially large\naround and following recessions, when uncertainty may be higher. The research will be discussed in a forthcoming FRBSF Economic Letter by\nAbdelrahman, Fresquet Kohan, Mertens, and Oliveira, based on past work by Mertens and Williams (2021).\n9 The reaction function of the FOMC is largely communicated through FOMC statements, the public remarks of the Chair and other\nFOMC participants, and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).\n4\n\nGiven the success, many have asked if we should do more. Academics, analysts, and policy\nmakers have offered a variety of suggestions.10 The ideas range from publishing details about the forecast\nand the risks, to doing scenario analysis,11 to simplifying the message and using social media to build\nunderstanding.12\nThe question is, how should we balance the need for transparency with the responsibility of\nimproving understanding? To answer this question, I return to two periods of economic history.\nHistory Lessons\nLet me start with the Global Financial Crisis, or GFC. As you likely remember, the recovery from\nthe recession was painfully slow. Then-Chair Ben Bernanke and others grappled with how to implement\nmonetary policy that was constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates. Borrowing from\nacademic research, they implemented a variety of alternative tools, including regular communications and\nstrong forward guidance. This helped guide policy expectations toward a more accommodative stance,\nwhich helped support the recovery.13\nThese detailed and definitive communications made sense. After all, inflation was below target,\nemployment growth was weak, and markets weren’t sure how long the FOMC would be accommodative.\nIn fact, markets regularly assumed interest rates would rise faster than FOMC participants expected.\nFOMC communications made the policy path clear and offered the support the economy needed to move\nback toward the dual mandate goals.\nIn that moment, the problem was clear, and the treatment was forceful. The success installed\nmany of the communication tools as permanent features of the FOMC.\n10 See the presentations at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Second Thomas Laubach Research Conference.\n11 Several central banks have started using scenarios in their communication with the public, including the Bank of Canada (2025),\nBank of England (2025), and Sveriges Riksbank (2025). But only Sweden’s Riksbank has included a policy path in the scenarios. Former Fed\nChair Ben Bernanke (2025) proposed the FOMC follow a similar tack.\n12 Gorodnichenko, Pham, and Talavera (2025).\n13 See Campbell et al. (2017) and Bernanke (2020).\n5\n\nThen, about a decade later, the pandemic hit. Economic activity plummeted and financial markets\nteetered. The Fed cut interest rates close to zero and took emergency steps to support the flow of credit\nand liquidity. We committed to using the full range of our tools until the crisis had passed and economic\nrecovery was well under way.\nNotably, that included a commitment to keep interest rates near zero until we were confident that\nthe economy was on track to achieve our employment and price stability goals.14 We were very specific\nin our guidance, following what we had learned from the Global Financial Crisis. Our policies and\ncommunications helped stabilize markets, threw a lifeline to businesses and households, and put the\neconomy on a quicker path to recovery.15\nThis all worked, until it didn’t.\nYou know what happened. In 2021, inflation surged, and we needed to pivot. We raised rates\naggressively and communicated strongly that we were resolute to restore price stability. These efforts\nhave been successful and inflation is now near our 2 percent goal.\nBut looking back it could have been easier, especially on the people we serve. Our strong forward\nguidance in the aftermath of the pandemic firmly set public expectations, but then when the economy\nshifted, and inflation soared, it left people unsure about how we would respond.16 While there were many\ndrivers of the global runup in inflation, and the subsequent rise in inflation expectations, our guidance\nlikely didn’t help, at least initially.17\nThe lesson for me from that period is that being definitive in highly uncertain times comes with a\nprice. And we need to evaluate that price as we make future decisions about what to say. Words have\npower, which is a great tool. But words can be harder to reverse than the interest rate. They set\nexpectations, which can be hard to change in the event the economy evolves differently than we expect.18\n14 Powell (2020).\n15 Milstein and Wessel (2024) and Clarida, Duygan-Bump, and Scotti (2021).\n16 This concern fed into the rise in short- and medium-term inflation, which rose precipitously in this period.\n17 Glick, Leduc, and Pepper (2022). See Bernanke and Blanchard (2023) for a full review of the post-pandemic inflation episode.\n18 Walsh (2025).\n6\n\nPrinciples of Communication\nSo, what do these two periods of history tell us? Mostly this: There is no single, simple answer.\nEffective communication requires a dynamic approach and continuous evaluation. What works in one\nsituation may not work as effectively in another. Communication must be consistent enough that people\ncan follow, and dynamic enough that it can adjust to the circumstances we face.\nSo, how should we choose when and what to do? For this, I look to principles.\nThe first is clarity. Anything we do should improve the public’s understanding of our goals,\nexpectations, risks, or reaction function. We should always have a purpose for communicating and a way\nto evaluate our effectiveness. Second, any communication should enhance transparency, revealing how\nwe think, how we make decisions, and why we reach the conclusions we do. This is the foundation of\naccountability. The final principle is flexibility. The economy is dynamic, and our communications must\nmatch it. Providing guidance about what we know, humility about what we don’t, and a commitment to\nrespond to the world we get, even if it is different from the one we expect.\nLike many things, these principles will sometimes be in tension, and central banks will have to\nbalance the tradeoffs. In those moments, we need to return to why we do this at all. To be open and\naccountable to the public we serve.\nConclusion\nI started at the Fed in 1996. I quickly learned that we were an institution that did a lot and said\nlittle. But that didn’t always serve the public. So, we changed.\nBut our journey shouldn’t stop here. Public institutions, like the Fed, have a responsibility to\ncontinually revisit how we communicate and how we can do better. It’s the right thing to do, and as\nhistory has taught us, it’s the best thing to do.\n7\n\nAnd with that I would like to turn it over to Emi and Ellen. Thank you and I look forward to our\ndiscussion.\n8\n\nReferences\nAppelbaum, Binyamin. 2012. “A Fed Focused on the Value of Clarity.” New York Times News Analysis,\nDecember 13.\nBank of Canada. 2025.

    "text": "Monetary Policy: Progress Is Not Victory\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, NY\nOctober 5, 2023, 12 PM EDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nGood afternoon. It’s terrific to be here and be speaking once again to the Economic Club of New York.\nSo, thank you very much for the invitation, and I look forward to a great discussion.\nBefore we get started, I would like to take a few minutes to describe how I see the current economic\nenvironment and the uncertainties and tradeoffs we face as we calibrate policy. The key takeaway is\nthat the moment calls for optionality. We must keep our minds open so that we can respond to\nconditions as they evolve. Vigilance and agility are paramount to finishing the job—the job being, of\ncourse, to restore price stability as gently as we can.\nThe good news is—at this point—we have time to get it right. The economy and policy are in a much\nbetter place. Growth and inflation are gradually slowing and the risks to the outlook are largely\nbalanced. Monetary policy is restrictive and financial conditions are tight. So, we don’t have to rush to\nany decisions.\nBut progress isn’t victory. And we must remain resolute to finish the job. A gradual return to 2 percent\ninflation is in our sights, but it is not yet in our grasp. That is the final mile.\nBut before I go further, let me say that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nProgress to Date\nI mentioned that the economy and policy are in a better place. So, let me begin by taking stock of where\nwe have been and how far we have come.\n1\n\nAs you may remember, in March 2022—just 18 months ago—the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) had a problem. Headline and core inflation had risen to multidecade highs and were projected\nto keep rising. Inflation expectations, especially at the short end, were close behind.1 And there were\nconcerns that this could generate a more worrisome increase in medium- and longer-run inflation\nexpectations.\nSo, the FOMC began to rapidly adjust monetary policy.2\nSince that time, we have raised the federal funds rate by 525 basis points to its highest level in 22 years.3\nThese cumulative increases have moved policy into restrictive territory. Indeed, the real federal funds\nrate, as measured by the nominal funds rate less one-year-ahead inflation expectations, exceeds almost\nall measures of its neutral value.4\nWe are seeing the effects of this tightening on the economy. Headline and core inflation have both\ndeclined significantly, bringing us much closer to our 2 percent target.5 As my contacts in the Twelfth\nDistrict tell me, this is having an immediate positive effect on households, businesses, and communities\nwho have been struggling on the treadmill of constantly rising prices and falling purchasing power. The\nrelief they’re seeing in their wallets is translating directly into more positive views about future inflation.\nWe see this nationally in short-run inflation expectations, which have been falling almost one for one\nwith the declines in inflation.6\nPerhaps most encouragingly, the welcomed decline in inflation has come without significant\ndeterioration in economic growth or the labor market. The economy and labor market are slowing, but\nnot severely or abruptly. These developments have led market participants, businesses, and households\nto replace fears of recession with hopes for a soft landing, a sea change from earlier this year.7\nThis is unequivocally good news. But to ensure that we fully achieve the outcomes we want—sustainable\nprice stability and a healthy and balanced labor market—we need to finish the job.\nSo, what will this require?\n1 Household expectations of near-term inflation began rising following a surge in commodity prices in 2021. For more information, see Glick et\nal. (2021).\n2 The FOMC first signaled that policy would need to be tightened in November 2021. It started the tightening cycle in its March 2022 meeting.\n3 The current range of the federal funds rate is 5.25 to 5.5 percent.\n4 A range of common measures for business and consumer inflation expectations currently puts one-year-ahead inflation expectations between\n2.5 percent and 3.6 percent, leading to a real funds rate between 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent. This is notably above the median Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP) estimate of the neutral rate of 0.50 percent.\n5 Federal Open Market Committee (2023) specifies the 2 percent target as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index\n(PCEPI). As of August 2023, the 12-month change in overall PCEPI moderated to 3.5 percent from a high of 7.1 percent in June 2022. Similarly,\ncore PCEPI, which excludes volatile food and energy categories, fell from a peak of 5.6 percent to 3.9 percent.\n6 Business and consumer short-term inflation expectations have fallen notably since the beginning of the current tightening cycle. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Business Inflation Expectations shows one-year-ahead expected inflation moderating from 3.8 percent in\nMarch 2022 to 2.5 percent in the latest reading. Similarly, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers show a moderation in one-year-\nahead expected inflation from 5.4 percent in March 2022 to 3.2 percent in the latest reading.\n7 For example, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers’ index for expected business conditions, which measures household sentiment\nfor economic growth in the coming year, improved notably since earlier this year and reached its highest value since the beginning of the\ncurrent tightening cycle as of September 2023. Additionally, the latest Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecasters\nshows respondents placing less probability on a downturn in real GDP in the second half of 2023 relative to earlier in the year.\n2\n\nA Balanced Approach\nVigilance and agility.\nLet’s start with vigilance. We need to be vigilant in assessing the odds that the good data we’ve been\nseeing is a new trend, rather than just a temporary relief that will stall out too early, leaving us short of\nour goals. Either is possible.\nI’ve discussed the recent positive data and the progress we’ve made. But why might these positive\ndevelopments plateau? Put simply, the economy still has considerable momentum and a ways to go to\ncome back into balance.\nHeadline data tell the story. In the labor market, even with the recent slowing, job growth remains well\nabove what is needed to keep pace with labor force growth, and other indicators point to ongoing\nstrength.8 Inflation is similar. While overall inflation has fallen a lot, it continues to be almost 2\npercentage points higher than our target.\nNow, it’s possible that the slowing we are seeing will translate into a steady march toward our goals. But\nin the case of inflation, there are real risks to this projection. Many components are coming down just as\nexpected and should continue to slow. But nonhousing core services, often called supercore, has been\nrelatively sticky and remains far above its pre-pandemic level.9 Although it often lags other inflation, we\nwill need to see some progress in this category to be fully confident we are on the path back to price\nstability. 10, 11\nWhat does this mean for policy? Well, this is where agility comes in. We need to be positioned and\nprepared for however the economy evolves. We need to have options.\nIf we continue to see a cooling labor market and inflation heading back to our target, we can hold\ninterest rates steady and let the effects of policy continue to work. Importantly, even if we hold rates\nwhere they are today, policy will grow increasingly restrictive as inflation and inflation expectations fall.\nSo, holding rates steady is an active policy action.12\nLikewise, if financial conditions, which have tightened considerably in the past 90 days, remain tight, the\nneed for us to take further action is diminished.\nIn contrast, if the deceleration of growth and inflation stalls, activity begins to reaccelerate, or financial\nconditions loosen too much, we can react to those data and raise rates further until we are confident\nthat monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to complete the job.\n8 About 100,000 new jobs per month are needed to keep the unemployment rate at its current level of 3.8 percent over the next year, according\nto the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Jobs Calculator. The U.S. economy added an average of 150,000 jobs over the three months ending in\nAugust 2023.\n9 The 12-month change in the price index for core nonhousing services has been above 4 percent since April 2021.\n10 In August 2023, consumer spending on core nonhousing services was about 50 percent of total spending. Moreover, this category contributed\naround 2.1 percentage points, or 60 percent, to the 12-month change in overall PCEPI inflation.\n11 If the contribution of core nonhousing services to the 12-month change in overall PCEPI inflation remained at its current level and\ncontributions from all other categories returned to their pre-pandemic (2016–2019) averages, overall inflation would only moderate to\napproximately 2.6 percent.\n12 The restrictiveness of policy is measured by the real interest rate, which is the nominal federal funds rate less one-year-ahead expected\ninflation. If the nominal funds rate is held steady while inflation and inflation expectations continue to moderate, the real interest rate will rise,\nmaking monetary policy more restrictive.\n3\n\nIn other words, rather than a prejudged path of what policy will be, we need an open mind and\noptionality.\nThe Final Mile\nWhen I travel around my District and across the nation, I see the progress we’ve made in the past year.\nAnd that is worth acknowledging.\nBut as I said at the start, progress alone is not victory. And it will take vigilance and agility to complete\nthe final mile.\nThank you.\nReferences\nFederal Open Market Committee. 2023. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”\nAdopted effective January 24, 2012; as reaffirmed effective January 31, 2023.\nGlick, Reuven, Noah Kouchekinia, Sylvain Leduc, and Zheng Liu. 2021. “Do Households Expect Inflation\nWhen Commodities Surge?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2021-19, (July 12).\n4",

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSymposium on Asian Banking and Finance\nSingapore\nJune 3, 2019\n9:45AM SGT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction, Ravi, and for being the gracious\nhost of this year’s symposium.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco have partnered on this event for the past several years. But this\nis my first time making the trip to Singapore – and I’m really excited to be\nhere.\nNow, before I begin, I have to give the standard disclaimer: the remarks\nI’m about to deliver are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nNavigating headwinds\nBanking for the common good. It’s a natural evolution of the\nconversations we’ve been having at this event, and many like it, for the past\nseveral years.\n1\n\nFINAL\nBeing more customer-focused… using finance to create inclusive\ngrowth… understanding the role that organizational culture plays in all of it…\nthese are hot topics for both the financial services industry and regulatory\ninstitutions.1 And progress has been made.2\nYet consumers remain wary – even a little skeptical – of financial firms.\nI’ve got a front row seat for this in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are a lot\nof people willing to turn to Big Tech – and away from Big Banks – when it\ncomes to managing their finances. A study last year found that 58 percent of\nAmericans would be willing to move their banking to non-traditional financial\ncompanies like Amazon or Google.3\nAnd it makes sense. Banks are still repairing the breach of trust caused\nby the global financial crisis. Repeated scandals showed that banks weren’t\nalways good actors. Poor corporate culture and profit-first practices created\nsignificant consequences for consumers.4 People lost homes, retirement\nsavings, college funds… a sense of security. It left deep scars.\nSince then, much-needed regulations have improved the resiliency of\nthe financial system, making future crises less likely. This has helped boost\nconfidence in the industry.\nBut the world didn’t stand still while banks worked to recover their\ncredibility with the public. Technology-based competitors emerged with\ncustomer-centric approaches to finance.\n1 Bailey (2018), Menon (2019), and Lagarde (2019).\n2 De Nederlandsche Bank (2015) and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (2016).\n3 Center for the Digital Future at USC Annenberg (2018).\n4 Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2018) and Williams (2018).\n2\n\nFINAL\nThey offered targeted products, tailor-made to serve the needs of a\ndiverse customer base. They worked to keep costs low, and efficiency and\nconvenience high. Notably, these firms also talked about the broader good,\nand how their business models help promote a better future.5\nPutting these things together, traditional financial institutions are facing\nsome pretty strong headwinds. And they’re headwinds that can’t be addressed\nthrough regulatory guardrails alone.\nSo what can be done?\nHere’s my view: banks – large and small – need to become owners.\nOwners who are committed to – and accountable for – doing right by their\ncustomers and their communities.\nYou might be thinking that sounds like a lot. Or maybe that it’s even too\nhigh of a standard. But speaking from experience, I can tell you: it is possible.\nBecoming owners\nThe Federal Reserve System faced its own challenges in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis. Public trust in our institution plummeted, and it’s been slow to\ncome back.6 And like private-sector firms, we face an ever-changing\nlandscape, and a highly competitive environment for the best ideas and talent.\nThis was especially true at our Bank, with its proximity to Silicon Valley.\nSo about four years ago, the San Francisco Fed decided to take a hard\nlook at our own organization. What was working? What wasn’t? Our culture\nsoon emerged as one of the biggest areas in need of improvement. So we\ndecided to change it.\n5 Menon (2019).\n6 Saad (2019) and Gallup (2019).\n3\n\nFINAL\nWe started with the basics. We focused not only on what employees do,\nbut also how they do it. And we emphasized skills and behaviors that would\nenable our best work… things like collaboration, emotional intelligence,\ninfluence, and critical thinking.\nThis was our starting point – our foundation. But something was still\nmissing.\nTo really get to the next level, it became clear we needed to do more. We\nneeded to become owners. Ready to hold ourselves accountable to our\nmission, vision, and values – no excuses. Prepared to trust our employees to\ndo the right thing – even when no one is watching, and even when there isn’t a\ndetailed rulebook to follow.\nThis transition to a culture of owners hasn’t been easy. And we’re far\nfrom done. But embracing this mindset has changed us – and for the better. So\nI want to share with you what we’ve learned.\nDefining your values\nThe first step in becoming an owner is defining your values. What do\nyou believe in? How will you go about achieving your mission and vision?\nAt the Federal Reserve, we’re tasked with a dual mandate – promoting\nfull employment and price stability. We also support safe and sound banking\nand payment systems. That’s our mission.\nAt the San Francisco Fed, we want to be the best in public service. That’s\nour vision.\nOur values are something different – but equally important.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThey’re spelled out on a banner that greets every person who walks into\nour lobby each day. It says: “Our work touches every American and countless\nglobal citizens.”\nThat’s our core value – service. Service to the people and the\ncommunities we represent. That’s the reason we show up to work every day.\nThat’s our touchstone.\nBuilding trust\nDefining your values is essential. But it’s only the beginning of building a\nculture of ownership.\nTo give values life, and make them real for every individual you work\nwith, you have to take action. And those actions have to be rooted in trust –\nthe trust that your people will act in the interest of others and the\norganization.\nLet me give you an example. This is what the San Francisco Fed’s\nemployee handbook used to look like. It was created with the best of\nintentions: to help people become successful members of our team. But what\nit turned into is pretty intimidating.\nIt’s heavy. It has a lot of rules. Worst of all, it sends the message that we\nneed to micro-manage and monitor the very people we’re counting on to be\nour ambassadors – our employees.\nThis is the opposite of trust.\nSo we threw the whole thing out.\nHere’s the new one. Big difference. I can carry it around with me, for one\nthing.\n5\n\nFINAL\nGone are the lists of dos and don’ts. In their place is a new mindset – one\nthat defaults to the positive. It describes our values, and calls on employees to\nuphold them using their best judgment. Most importantly, the new handbook\nmoves away from solving for potential bad behavior, and instead emphasizes\nthe expectation of good behavior.\nWe followed the new handbook with more radical moves. We told\npeople they could “dress for their day,” and “flex for their day,” and “stop\ndoing it” if certain processes no longer added value.\nNot surprisingly, all these changes caused some heartburn. You might\nbe thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if people take\nadvantage? What if we can no longer get our work done?\nI get it. Conducting business this way requires a lot of trust at every\nlevel of the organization. And people are going to bump into each other as\nthey figure things out.\nSo it’s important to have a plan in place for mitigating those conflicts.\nPart of this can be achieved by simply acknowledging that growing pains are a\nnatural part of the process.\nBut it’s equally important for leaders to model how situations should be\nevaluated when judgment – rather than a rule book – is the deciding factor.\nEmployees take their cues from the top, especially during times of change.\nSo it’s essential for all of us to hold ourselves accountable to the values\nwe’ve defined, even if it’s uncomfortable or unpopular in the short term.\nIf you’re willing to do this, I know you’ll be pleasantly surprised.\nLiving without a detailed rulebook is possible – if you’ve defined the\nright values, and empowered employees to act in the best interest of your\norganization and its customers.\n6\n\nFINAL\nThey’ll do the right thing – even if no one is watching, and even when\nthey face uncharted territory.\nCommitting to a growth mindset\nSo once you’ve defined your values, and built an environment of trust,\nhow do you keep growing? How do you stay agile?\nThere are two essential ingredients for success: diversity of thought,\nand inclusion of ideas.\nNow, I’m not talking about optical diversity, where you simply set the\ntable with people who look different. I mean true diversity, where you\nencourage new ideas and differences of opinion, and include them equally in\nthe discussion.\nPut simply: listening to a wide variety of viewpoints produces better\noutcomes. It ensures you’re considering all angles. And it makes you aware of\nissues and problems that aren’t even on your radar.\nI’ve found this particularly valuable as a new leader.\nI’m naturally a fast talker. I love nothing more than batting ideas back\nand forth like a ping pong ball. I’ll get excited, interrupt, draw on a whiteboard\n– it’s an event, a brainstorming mania.\nBut I recently had an epiphany. Not everyone is like me. And in my\nexcitement to jump in first, I was crowding out lots of other good ideas. I was\ninadvertently pushing people onto the sidelines.\nSo I started writing notes to myself, reminding me to slow down. I’ve\nworked harder to include more introverted voices, or remote employees who\nfind it difficult to interject on the phone. And I’ve told others around me to\nhold me accountable to this goal.\n7\n\nFINAL\nIt’s a work in progress. But I’m happy to report that a number of quieter\nvoices have emerged and become valuable contributors at my table. And\nthey’re helping to transform our organization.\nMaking the business case\nThis is what’s working for us at the San Francisco Fed.\nBut you may be thinking: Sure, this sounds great for a public service\norganization. Your job is to pursue the common good. How would this work in\nthe private sector, at a profit-making bank?\nAnd I’d like to answer that question with two stories.\nThe CEO of the online retailer Zappos once wrote an article in the\nHarvard Business Review to explain how his company had earned its\nreputation for delivering best-in-class customer service.7 And he told a story\nabout a woman who called in after forgetting to mail back a pair of shoes she’d\nplanned to return. There’d been a death in her family. So the Zappos rep sent\nher flowers.\nThat’s the kind of thing that’s possible when employees are empowered\nto act as ambassadors for your values. Yes, that phone rep may have spent $50\nto do the right thing – but as the CEO himself said: “now she’s a customer for\nlife.”\nThis works for shoes. And I can tell you from personal experience that it\nalso works for banks.\nWhen I was 16 years old, I needed a checking account. I was working\nfull-time and needed to pay rent and utilities – and they only took checks.\n7 Hsieh (2010).\n8\n\nFINAL\nSo I found myself at a bank in Ballwin, Missouri, where I grew up. And\nwhen I talked to the new accounts clerk, I found out that minors couldn’t open\nan account without a parent’s signature – bank policy.\nBut both of my parents were out of the picture. When I explained my\nsituation to the clerk, she decided to take a chance.\nShe opened my account. Helped me fill out the deposit form, and select\nmy checks. She even took a few minutes to explain the basics of banking, so I\ncould avoid any overdrafts and fees.\nShe wasn’t a manager. She didn’t have to do this. But she did. She led\nwith her values, and the values of her organization. She put my need for a\nchecking account at the center of her business.\nAnd that stuck with me. I stayed a customer at her bank for almost 20\nyears.\nAligning interests\nWe have a phrase in economics – incentive compatibility – that\ndescribes this situation. It’s the moment when the planets align, and what’s\ngood for me, is good for you, is good for society.\nWe’re at that moment now for the financial services industry.\nIf you’re willing to become an owner… if you’re willing to put your\ncustomers and communities at the center of your business… banking for the\ncommon good will move beyond the title of this conference, and become the\nnew industry norm.\nThank you.\n9\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority. 2016.

The reduction in\noccupational crowding appears to be most important in explaining this trend. Recent wage\nconvergence was most rapid among younger workers with less than 10 years experience; for this group\nthe black-white wage gap declined by 1.40 percentage points per year. Among younger workers\ngreater occupational diversity and a reduction in unexplained or residual differences are important in\nexplaining this trend. For both younger and older workers, general wage inequality tempered the rate\nof wage convergence between blacks and whites during the 1990s.\n\nBlack-White Wage Inequality in the 1990s:\nA Decade of Progress\nI. Introduction\nFollowing the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other measures aimed at reducing\nlabor market discrimination during the 1960s, the differential in average weekly wages between black\nand white men in the United States narrowed substantially. Among male workers aged 18-64, the\nblack-white wage gap fell from 50 percent in 1967 to 30 percent in 1974, or by about one percent per\nyear.1 After 1974, however, the proportional difference in black and white wages remained essentially\nconstant at 30 percent through the end of the 1980s. Following more than a decade of stasis, the\nblack-white wage gap once again began to decline during the 1990s, narrowing at a rate approaching\none percent a year.\nA great deal of past research has focused on why the black-white wage gap did not continue to\ndecline following the initial progress made through the mid-1970s. One of the earliest studies in this\narea (Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce 1991) concluded that a key factor undermining progress towards wage\nconvergence between blacks and whites during the 1980s was a broader trend of rising wage inequality\nin American society. The authors found that growing disparity in returns-to-skill combined with\ndisproportionate representation of blacks in the lower end of the skill distribution combined to hold\ndown growth in the average weekly earnings of blacks relative to whites during the 1980s. According\n1 The figures cited in this paragraph are based on calculations presented and explained later in the\ntext.\n3\n\nto Juhn, et al., the damping effect of societal inequality on the wage gap during the decade of the 1980s\nwas sufficient to offset gains made by blacks along other dimensions, such as acquisition of schooling.\nThis paper documents the recent progress in black-white wage convergence and following\nJuhn, et al. (1991) considers the role of overall societal income inequality, sectoral employment, and\nindividual characteristics in reducing the racial gap in earnings during the decade of the 1990s. We\ninitially replicate the findings of Juhn et al. using Current Population Survey (CPS) data and then\nmove on to document important changes in the trend of the black-white wage gap which have occurred\nsince 1990. In future research, we hope to revisit the issue of educational quality and individual skills\nand their role in this context using other data.2\nII. Data\nThe CPS data we employ in the analysis has well-known advantages and disadvantages. The\nprimary advantage of these data is that they are designed to obtain accurate national measures of labor\nmarket outcomes. The primary disadvantage in this context is that the measures of direct skills available\nin the survey are limited to constructed measures of experience and years of completed education.3\nWe use information from the 1968-1998 March CPS to obtain three decades of data representative of\nthe years 1967 through 1997. The March CPS demographic supplement contains retrospective\n2 There is a large literature on the role of education and school quality on the evolution of the\nblack-white wage gap; see Card and Krueger (1992a, 1992b), Grogger (1996), and Maxwell\n(194) for examples. However, given the limitations of the CPS data, our analysis will not\naddress these issues.\n3 Relative to other data sets such as the High School and Beyond (HSB), the CPS does not\nsurvey respondents in a detailed fashion regarding their educational experiences or contain\nstandardized test outcomes. Therefore, information is not available to extensively investigate\nthe role of changes in educational quality on the wage gap.\n4\n\nearnings information collected for the previous year.\nSince we are primarily interested in long-term trends in wages rather than changes in earnings\nvolatility associated with entry and exit from the labor market, we impose a number of sample\nrestrictions. We include black and white male workers ages 18-64 who worked at least one week in\nthe previous calendar year, usually worked full-time, and participated in the labor force for at least\nthirty-nine weeks. To avoid problems associated with top-coding, we exclude individuals in the top\nand bottom one percent of the earnings distribution. Throughout the paper we focus on the average\nweekly wage, calculated as the annual wage divided by the number of weeks worked. The annual\nearnings measures are deflated using the personal consumption expenditure deflator from the National\nIncome and Product Accounts. We refer to the log of the deflated average weekly wage as the wage.\nIn the initial analysis we focus on the log weekly wage adjusted for potential experience, where\npotential experience is calculated as the lesser of age minus education minus seven, and age minus 17.\nLater in the paper, we investigate the role of differential employment by industry and occupation as a\nsource of racial earnings inequality. To do so, we construct a set of indicator variables for two-digit\nindustry of employment and the major occupational group of each individual’s job. In all cases the\nvariable definitions and the sample selection criteria we employ are similar to those employed in Juhn,\nMurphy, and Pierce 1991.\nIII. Trends in the Black-White Wage Gap\nWe first consider black-white log wage ratios for the years from 1967 through 1997 for two\ngroups, all male workers and male workers with 10 or fewer years of potential experience. Like\nprevious researchers, we find that among all workers, the black-white gap in earnings declined sharply\n5\n\nfrom the late 1960s through the mid-1970s (Figure 1). Similarly, we find little wage convergence\nbetween blacks and whites from the mid-1970s through the end of the 1980s (the period examined\nmost recently by other researchers). Since the end of the recession in 1991, however, there have been\nthree observations of the unadjusted wage gap which were less than .30 (.27, .29, and .27).\nHistorically, those are the lowest wage gaps observed for black and white males. While these are\nmodest reductions for minority workers as a whole, they nonetheless represent progress in wage\nconvergence after two decades of stagnation.\nOne possible explanation for the recent decline in wage differentials between blacks and whites\nis simply that older cohorts of less-educated blacks are being replaced by younger, better educated\nblack workers. To get a sense of the role that cohort effects have played in the recent improvement in\nthe black-white wage gap, Figure 1 also shows the unadjusted differential for those with less than 10\nyears of experience. Again, a pattern of fairly rapid narrowing of the black-white wage gap among\nthese workers from the late 1960s through the mid-1970s is observed. This pattern reverses during the\n1980s, when the unadjusted wage gap actually increases. Looking at the 1990s, however, reveals new\nblack workers gaining on their white counterparts. Between 1989 and 1997, there are three instances\nof historical lows for the unadjusted wage gap among workers with less than ten years of experience\n(.20, .12, and .18).\nTable 1 provides a more detailed analysis of the evolution of the black-white wage gap by\nyears of potential labor market experience. The wage gaps reported in the table represent averages\nover five-year intervals of the CPS data. Although other observations might be drawn from the table,\nwe focus on two issues: (1) How has the wage gap varied over time for different levels of experience?\n6\n\n(2) How have different cohorts faired? The answers to these questions are important for interpreting\nthe meaning of the recent wage convergence. For example, if we find that the recent wage\nconvergence is entirely attributable to the entry of younger cohorts of more highly educated workers, it\nwould suggest that the narrowing wage gap is skill-related. On the other hand, if the wage convergence\nis observed as given cohorts move through time, this would suggest that some of the convergence is due\nto a lessening of discrimination towards all groups.\nLooking across the rows of Table 1, it is apparent that in historical perspective, the unadjusted\nblack-white wage gap among workers of all skill levels has declined markedly. For all workers, the\ndecline from .44 in the interval from 1968 through 1972 to .31 in the period from 1993 through 1997\nrepresents a decrease of 30 percent. For the different skill levels in the table, the reductions in wage\ninequality range from one-third to two-thirds depending on the particular group examined.\nIn contrast, by examining the diagonals of the table, one may follow different cohorts over time\nas they age and acquire additional years of potential experience. For example, the group of minority\nworkers who had less than six years of potential experience in the 1968-1972 interval experienced a\nwage gap of 36 percent. By the time of the 93-97 interval, when their potential experience ranged from\n26 to 30 years, the wage gap they experienced had fallen to 31 percent, a reduction of 14 percent.\nThe evidence provided in Table 1 suggests that recent black entrants to the labor market are\neither better educated or more skilled than older workers as their wage convergence is the greatest\namong all skill levels. It is also apparent that the returns to the types of skills offered by blacks in the\nlabor market appear to have risen in value over time and that this is most apparent among the youngest\nworkers. Thus, there is an overall pattern of convergence independent of age and experience, but\n7\n\nthose experiencing the greatest convergence are the most recent entrants to the labor market. This\npreliminary evidence suggests that either an increase in skills among blacks relative to whites or a higher\nrate of return for the skills offered by blacks relative to those offered by whites is likely to be important\nin explaining convergence in the wage gap. The evidence in Table 1 also suggests that either\ndiscrimination or racial differences in other dimensions such as their occupation have been decreasing\nover time.\nIV. Wages and Observable Characteristics\nA. Education\nOne measure of skill is completed years of education. It has been long established that higher\nlevels of education are associated with greater earnings. Recent research has shown that the premium\nearned by those with more education has grown dramatically during the past 15 years. While returns to\neducation have risen for all workers, recent entrants to the labor market have experienced the most\ndramatic increases (Juhn et al. 1993). Figure 2 shows the trends in the log wage ratio for college\neducated and non-college educated workers. As can be seen in the figure, the returns to education\namong all workers have been rising steadily since the mid 1980s. The college wage premium is highest\nfor workers with less than ten years of experience.\nTo the extent that blacks have become more highly educated over time, perhaps due to a\nlessening of premarket discrimination in the educational system, their wages should converge with those\nof whites and vice versa. Table 2 provides information on the distribution of educational levels for\nblack and white workers in our sample across four categories: less than high school, high school\ngraduates, some college, and college graduates. This information is broken out for blacks and whites\n8\n\ninto groups of all workers and workers with no more than 10 years of experience.\nThere are a number of striking trends in these tables. First, there has been an enormous\nreduction in the past 30 years in the proportion of American workers, black and white, who have not\ncompleted high school. Among all blacks in 1968, 63 percent had not completed high school. By the\nlast year of our sample, 1998, that figure had declined to less than 15 percent, a reduction of 77\npercent! A similar reduction occurred among white workers in our sample. In 1968, about 37 percent\nof all white workers had less than a high school education. By 1998, that figure had declined to 12\npercent, which represents a reduction of 68 percent. While the reduction for both groups is\nremarkable, the trend is more important for blacks because of the relatively larger share that did not\npreviously graduate.\nIn the last year of our sample, the proportion of whites and blacks with high school degrees or\nsome college are similar. However, whites have more college graduates. This trend holds even among\nnew entrants. As shown in Table 2, relative to all black workers, those with less than ten years of\nexperience in our sample in 1998 have a higher rate of college completion and fewer high school\nincompletions. However, even among new entrants the rate of college graduation is lower among\nblacks than among whites. One would expect that some portion of the convergence in the black-white\nwage gap is connected to improved rates of high school graduation among blacks and the increasing\nnumber who pursue college.\nB. Employment by Industry and Occupation\nTable 3 shows the evolution of black and white employment by two-digit industry since 1968.\nAs might be expected, some industries contain larger shares of blacks than whites— personal services,\n9\n\npublic service, and transportation are notable examples. But even in those cases, the proportions of\nblacks and whites who find employment in specific industries appear fairly similar. Time series variation\nin employment concentration by industry also is apparent in Table 3. However, in general, the trends\nare similar for whites and blacks. For example, white employment in manufacturing decreased by 13\npercentage points and black employment in manufacturing by 11 percentage points during our sample\nperiod. Thus, while changes over time for blacks and whites are not identical, the primary pattern\nobserved in Table 3 appears to be the decline in manufacturing’s share of total employment rather than\nmarked differences across racial groups in employment by industry. Similar conclusions can be drawn\nfrom the information on less experienced workers contained in Table 3.\nBroad industry groupings such as those shown in Table 3 may mask changes in the\noccupational structure across industries. Table 4 provides information on employment by race and\noccupation since 1968. What can be seen in Table 4 is that the black and white employment differs by\noccupation. Blacks are proportionately under represented among professional and managerial\noccupations. However, over time the proportion of blacks employed in professional and managerial\njobs has increased. On the other side of the occupational distribution, the proportion of blacks\nemployed as laborers has decreased over time, while the share of blacks employed as operatives has\nincreased. In more industrial settings, blacks tend to be concentrated in operative rather than craftsmen\npositions. .\nFor proportional changes in employment by industry or occupation to play a significant role in\nexplaining movements in wage inequality rates of pay must either differ across occupations and\nindustries or must evolve differently. Figure 3 considers the weekly wage of several industries. Among\n10\n\nthose considered, professional services are characterized by both the highest rates of pay and largest\nincreases over time. In real terms, retail trade has the lowest pay, and wages in that sector have\nremained essentially flat for the last three decades. Rates of pay across industries clearly differ enough\nthat large shifts in employment would be expected to impact overall wage inequality.\nSimilarly, Figure 4 considers real weekly wages of several occupations. Blacks had historically\nworked disproportionately as farm and nonfarm laborers, the two lowest paying occupations shown in\nthe figure. Recently, substantial declines have occurred in their employment as laborers with\ncorresponding increases in operative and craftsmen jobs. Although the rate of increase in pay for those\noccupations do not appear large, it is clear that the substantial shifts in occupational structure\nexperienced by blacks should raise their wages relative to whites.\nV. Explained and Residual Portions of the Wage Gap\nEven in these basic dimensions, it is difficult to determine which trends are most important in\nexplaining the movement of the relative wages of blacks and whites with descriptive evidence.\nHowever, standard decomposition techniques can be used to identify the portion of the wage gap\nwhich is attributable to observable factors and the residual due to other sources in any given year.\nHere, we follow Juhn, et al. (1991) and estimate an earnings equation each year for white workers of\nthe form:\nY ’ X $ % µ (1)\nit it t it\nwhere Y represents log weekly wages, X represents observable characteristics, and µ is a mean zero\n11\n\nerror term.4 The difference (D) in white and black log earnings in any year can then be written as:\nD ’ Y & Y ’ X $ & ( X $ % L ) (2)\nt wt bt wt t bt t bt\nor simplifying as:\nD ’ Y & Y ’ )X $ & L (3)\nt wt bt t t bt\nwhere )X = (X - X ). In equation (3), )X $ represents the portion of the wage gap due to\nt w t b t t t\nobservables and L represents the residual gap.\nb t\nWe estimate equation (3) for all workers and for workers with less than 10 years of potential\nexperience. Figures 5 and 6 summarize the results of these estimations.5 Figure 5 shows the total wage\ngap as well as the unexplained residual for all male workers. The vertical difference in the two lines in\nthe graph represent how much inequality would be reduced if all observable factors included in the\nestimations were equalized across blacks and whites. Over the period of the sample, both gaps decline\nthrough the mid-1970s and appear to have remained roughly constant through the late 1980s. Since\nthe late 1980s, the trend in both the unadjusted and residual wage gap appears to be slightly\ndownward.\nIn Figure 6, similar information is shown for those with less than 10 years of potential\nexperience. For these younger workers, the residual component of the wage gap appears to be\n4The regressors included in the estimations are region of residence, a quartic in potential experience,\neducation, industry, and occupation.\n5A compete set of the underlying results is available from the authors upon request.\n12\n\ntrending downward more strongly since 1990 after trending upwards since the early 1970s, although\nthe series is characterized by considerable noise.\nTo gain an understanding of whether these trends are statistically meaningful and, if so, their\nsource, we extend equation (3) to account for differences in the wage gap in three periods relative to\nthe average throughout the sample. We use the average throughout the sample to avoid choosing a\nbase year for comparison. We divide our 30-year sample into three time intervals for the analysis,\n1968-1979, 1980-1989, and 1990-1998. We estimate the equation\nD ) & D ’ ()X ) & )X) $ % )X ) ($ ) & $) & (L ) & L ) (4)\nt t t t bt b\nas a pooled regression over all periods including linear splines to capture the effects in the three\nsubperiods of the sample. The change in the residual gap is represented by (L -L ). The overall gap is\nbt3 b\ndecomposed into three components, the portion due to changes in levels of observable factors ()X -\nt3\n)X)$, the portion due to changes in rates of compensation, )X ($ -$), and the total residual gap.\nt3’ t’\nThe first row of Table 5 shows that in the first ten years of our sample, the total wage gap\ndeclined by an average of 1.2 percentage points per year. During the next decade, the wage gap\nincreased by .24 percentage point per year. Since 1990, the overall wage gap has declined by .59\npercentage point per year. In explaining the slowdown in convergence in the 1980s, like previous\nauthors, we find that the overall rate of convergence due to observables declined and that the residual\ngap widened. Within the observable component, the slowdown in the rate of convergence in the 1980s\nappears to have been associated with declining skill prices.\nDuring the 1990s, the overall trend towards the widening of black-white wage inequality\n13\n\nobserved in the 1980s has been reversed. Racial wage inequality has been declining. This result\nappears primarily to be attributable to convergence in black and white education levels and industry and\noccupation of employment.\nThe effects of education and experience as opposed to sector of employment are also detailed\nin the paper. One reason to separate the effects of education and experience from the effects of\nindustry and occupation is that the patterns might be interpreted differently with respect to\ndiscrimination. If an individual is paid less due to lower education, most economists agree this is not\nevidence of market discrimination. However, if after controlling for education and experience, blacks\nare clustered in industries or occupations characterized by lower pay, this may be interpreted as\nevidence of segregation in employment. In the 1990s, the primary factor among the observable\ncharacteristics which appears to be statistically important in explaining the reduction of the wage gap is\nthe convergence in the distributions of employment of blacks and whites during the sample period.\nAmong workers with less than ten years of labor market experience, the historical pattern of\nchange in the total wage gap is similar to that for all workers. In the period from 1968 through 1979,\nthe wage gap converged at an average of 1.34 percentage points a year. During the decade of the 80s,\nthe gap widened at .66 percent per year. The rate of convergence during the 1990s has been dramatic,\nat 1.40 percent per year.\nIn terms of the factors influencing convergence, much like the larger group of all workers,\nequalization of the distributions of employment by industry and occupation explains .38 of the 1.40\npercentage point per year decline in inequality. The largest factor influencing the reduction in the wage\ngap, however, is a decline in residual inequality which would account for a 1.21 percentage point\n14\n\nreduction in the gap since 1990.\nVI. Male Wage Inequality and the Black-White Wage Gap\nThe residual black-white wage gap is thought to capture both the effects of labor market\ndiscrimination and wage variation associated with unobserved characteristics related to productivity.\nHowever, as Juhn et al. (1993) note, this ignores the effect of changes in the prices of unmeasured\nskills. Based on evidence that dispersion has been increasing in returns to observed skill levels one\nmight expect that returns to unobserved skills also are changing. In particular, if blacks and whites\ndiffer in unobserved skills with blacks being positioned lower than whites in that distribution, and the\nreturns to those attributes are increasing, then this may change the wage gap between the groups.\nBecause such changes in the return-to-skill are not black-specific but represent a society wide change\nin wage inequality, conceptually, one would want to attribute that portion of the change in the residual\ngap to social inequality rather than discrimination.\nSimple evidence that unobserved skills matter in this context can be found by examining within\ngroup variation in earnings for specific educational levels of workers. Among groups such as high\nschool graduates or college graduates, some workers are more skilled than others, and based on\nmarginal productivity theory, the more capable workers are, the more they earn. If the distribution of\nearnings for individuals of a specific educational level are stratified based on unobserved skills and the\nreturns to those skills change over time, then the wage growth of workers at different strata should vary\nover time.\nFigure 7 examines the relative wage trajectories of college-educated workers at various\npercentiles of our sample over time. Each of the series has been indexed to zero in 1968. Over the\n15\n\nperiod of our sample, workers at the 10th percentile have experienced wage reductions while those at\nthe 50th and 90th percentiles have experienced net wage increases. While it is clear from looking at the\nfigure that the distribution of wages for college graduates has widened, it is also clear that wages of the\nworkers at the 10th percentile of the distribution have recovered sharply since the recession of the early\n90s. Figure 8 depicts similar information for high school graduates. Wages at the 10th and 50th\npercentiles have decreased during the period covered by the sample. Since the recession of the early\n1990s, the earnings of all groups have been increasing, with the sharpest gains in the last several years\nexperienced by workers at the bottom of the distribution.\nFigures 7 and 8 show that within groups, wage variation has increased in net but has narrowed\nin recent years. To get some sense of changes in inequality throughout the distribution of wages, we\nsubtract the effects of education and experience and calculate the average growth of wages in four\nsubperiods of our sample (1968-1980, 1980-1985, 1986-1992, and 1993-1998). Figure 9 shows the\naverage wage growth throughout the distribution of earnings for the first two subperiods. In the period\nfrom 1968-1980, wage growth throughout the distribution was clearly much more equal than during the\nperiod from 1980-1985. In both periods, wages below the 50th percentile fell in real terms, but the\npattern was much more pronounced from 1980-1985.\nFigure 10 makes a similar comparison of wage growth in the periods from 1986-1993 and\n1993-1998. Each of these latter periods appears different in that workers in approximately the bottom\n15 to 20 percent of the distribution experience relative wage growth and, at least through the bottom\nthird of the distribution in the period from 1993-1996, do not appear to experience meaningful wage\nerosion. In both periods, wages in the middle of the distribution appear to decline while those in the\n16\n\nupper percentiles experience the greatest wage growth.\nThe relationship between these trends in wage dispersion and the black-white wage gap\ndepends on the position of blacks relative to whites in those distributions. If blacks occupy\npredominantly lower-paying positions within an educational category, such as high school graduates or\ncollege graduates, then the evidence shown in Figures 7 and 8 would indicate that their pay should be\nincreasing at a relatively faster rate than the workers in the middle of the income distribution, and this\nmay help reduce the wage gap. However, those gains might be experienced by all low-wage workers\nwithin an educational category so that such effects should not be attributed to a reduction in\ndiscrimination.\nSimilarly, if after adjusting for education and experience blacks tend to be in the lower\npercentiles of the wage distribution, the information in Figure 10 indicates that they might be expected\nto gain relative to whites in the middle of the distribution but not close the wage gap with workers at the\ntop of the distribution. Nonetheless, depending on the relative distributions of blacks and whites, the\nwage gains experienced by all workers at the lower end of the distribution may help close the racial\nwage gap.\nTable 6 contains descriptive information on the evolution of the black distribution of wages\nrelative to the wage distribution of whites. For various percentiles in the black distribution of wages, the\ncorresponding percentage of whites earning less than that amount is calculated for specific years of the\nsample; the percentages reported in the right margin of the table are an average of all years, not just the\nyears listed.\nOver time, the distribution of black wages has become more like that of whites, although\n17\n\nconsiderable progress has yet to be made before they are equal. For example, in the first year of our\nsample, 1968, only 7 percent of whites earned less than the bottom quarter of black workers. By\n1998, 16 percent of whites earned less than the bottom quarter of black workers. Similarly, in 1968,\n63 percent of whites earned less than dollar value of the 90th percentile of the black wage distribution.\nIn 1998, 81 percent of whites earned less than the 90th percentile of black wages.\nThe descriptive evidence suggests that blacks should be gaining relative to whites as they move\nup through the white distribution of wages. However, as blacks move into more middle income\npositions, the trend towards wage inequality which has affected all workers would also be expected to\naffect them.\nA. Decomposing the Residual Gap\nHere, we decompose the residual gap in earnings from Table 5 into two components intended\nto capture changing earnings inequality experienced by all workers as opposed to shifts in the\ndistribution of black workers relative to whites. We follow the decomposition technique developed in\nJuhn, et al. (1991) and later used by Rodgers (1997). While we provide a brief derivation following\ntheir work, more detail can be found in those sources.\nRewrite equation (1) expressing the error term, µ as the multiple of its standard deviation, F ,\ni t, i t\nand the standardized residual, 2 = µ /F and\ni t i t i t ,\nY ’ X $ % F 2 (5)\nit it t it it\nThen equation (4) can be rewritten as:\n18\n\nD ) &D’()X ) & )X)$ % )X ) ($ ) & $) % )2 ) (F ) & F) % ()2 ) & )2)F (6)\nt t t t t it t\nwhere )2 = 2 - 2 ,. There are four terms in the decomposition. The first term represents the\nt ` b t w t\neffect of a changing quantity of observable factors holding returns constant at the average for the\nsample. The second term represents the effect of changing returns holding observables constant.\nThese first two terms were calculated earlier and were shown in Table 5. The third and fourth terms\ndecompose the residual gap into two additional components. The third term captures the effect of a\nchanging deviation of earnings holding the relative distribution constant. Juhn, et al. (1991) refer to this\nas the unobservable price effect and is meant to capture the impact of changing overall societal\ninequality on the movement in the black-white wage gap. The last term captures the effect of changes\nin the relative distributions of blacks and whites holding the standard deviation of earnings constant.\nThis term represents changes in the wage gap over time due to equalization of the percentile rankings of\nblacks and whites in the wage distribution.\nTable 7 extends the information contained in Table 5 by providing this additional decomposition\nof the change in the residual wage gap. Focusing on what Juhn et al. (1991) refer to as an unobserved\nprice effect, a trend towards widening inequality appears to be inhibiting closure of the black-white\nwage gap for the period from 1990-98. For the group of male workers with less experience, the major\nfactor explaining the reduction in the wage gap in the last decade is due to the changing positions of\nblacks relative to whites in the earnings distribution. The estimation procedures we use do not directly\nexplain why blacks are rising in the earnings distribution relative to whites, but a common interpretation\nis that the portion of the residual gap not explained by price effects is attributable to a lessening of racial\n19\n\ndiscrimination. The annual rate of decline in the black-white wage gap which might be attributed to\ndeclining discrimination, as shown in Table 7, is (an insignificant) .44 percent for all workers and (a\nsignificant) 1.27 percent for workers with less experience.\nVII. Conclusions\nAfter narrowing sharply following the passage of the Civil Rights Act 1964, the wage gap\nbetween black and white males remained essentially constant—at about 30 percent—fore nearly 20\nyears. Since 1992, however, the black-white wage gap has narrowed substantially, and as of 1998,\nwas at its lowest level in history.\nA major reason for this change in trend is a reduction in the concentration of employment of\nblacks in industries and occupations with lower pay. Overall, our results indicate that the wages of\nblack and white male workers converged at a rate of 0.59 percentage point per year between 1990\nand 1998. The rate of convergence for younger workers was more rapid at 1.40 percentage points per\nyear. As with the whole sample of male workers, a more favorable distribution of employment by\nindustry and occupation was an in explaining this convergence.\nFor both the group of all male workers and for younger workers, we find that an general\nincrease in wage inequality has been working against the trend towards black-white wage convergence.\nAlso, among younger workers, much of the convergence in the black-white wage gap is due to\nunexplained sources. Common interpretations of this residual are that it is due to factors such as a\nlessening of discrimination or unmeasured differences in productivity, perhaps due to the more\nwidespread adoption of technology in the workplace.\nAfter more than a decade of stasis, the trend observed for the 1990s warrants further\n20\n\ninvestigation. Coming to a better understanding of the factors which may be influencing residual\ninequality, particularly among younger workers, provides an interesting subject for future research.\n21\n\nReferences\nCard, David and Krueger, Alan B. 1992a. “Does School Quality Matter?

There has been much debate about the cross-sectional and time-\nseries patterns found in these data, particularly with respect to the relationship between SWB and relative\nstatus. Part of this debate concerns how well SWB data measures true utility or preferences. In a recent\npaper, Daly, Wilson, and Johnson (2007) propose using data on suicide as a revealed preference\n(outcome-based) measure of well-being and find strong evidence that reference-group income negatively\naffects suicide risk. In this paper, we compare and contrast the empirical patterns of SWB and suicide\ndata. We find that the two have very little in common in aggregate data (time series and cross-sectional),\nbut have a strikingly strong relationship in terms of their determinants in individual-level, multivariate\nregressions.\nThis latter result cross-validates suicide and SWB micro data as useful and complementary indicators of\nlatent utility.\nKeywords: Happiness and unhappiness trends, suicide, utility, relative income.\nJEL Codes: I31, D6, H0, J0\n1\n\nHappiness, Unhappiness, and Suicide: An Empirical Assessment\nI. Introduction\nOver the past decade economists have dramatically increased their interest in and use of subjective well-\nbeing data to track individual and aggregate welfare and to examine issues related to preference formation\nand utility. Empirical research has included comparing subjective assessments of well-being over time\n(e.g., time series patterns in happiness, unhappiness, life-satisfaction) and analyzing the individual and\ngroup-specific correlates of these measures in the cross-section. The work has produced intriguing\nresults—aggregate happiness does not rise monotonically with income (Easterlin 1995, Blanchflower and\nOswald 2004), individuals care about their own and others’ income (Luttmer 2005; McBride 2001; Clark\nand Oswald 1996; Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2005), and preferences seem to adapt to the environment (Gardner\nand Oswald 2007). Despite widespread interest in these results outside of economics, they have been slow\nto affect mainstream economic theory and its application.\nAn important barrier to greater acceptance of the findings from subjective well-being research has been\nconcerns about data quality. Subjective survey questions, by design, elicit information about individuals’\nfeelings, attitudes, opinions, and views. Critics argue that these features introduce systematic and non-\nsystematic measurement errors that make it difficult to compare answers to such questions over time or\nacross individuals (see Bertrand and Mullainathan 2001 for a broad critique of subjective survey data). In\nthe subjective well-being surveys, for example, in which respondents are asked to “rate” or “score” their\nhappiness or life satisfaction, errors can arise from language ambiguities (respondents may not all agree\non the exact meaning of terms like “happiness” and “life satisfaction”), scale comparability (one person’s\n“very satisfied” may be higher, lower, or equal to another person’s “satisfied”), ambiguity regarding the\ntime period over which respondents base their answers, respondent candidness, and the difficulty of\ndrawing cardinal inferences from ordinal survey responses.1 These problems have prompted some to\ndiscount the results from subjective well-being research and have left a larger number unconvinced of the\nrobustness of the findings.\nAt issue with each of these concerns is whether subjective well-being reports accurately capture the\nunderlying latent variable that is utility. Since we are not able to observe the latent variable, debates\nabout whether it can be accurately measured are hard to resolve. This has led researchers to seek\nalternative, outcome-based (i.e., non-subjective) sources of data to verify or reject the findings from\n1Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) argue that even when questions are well-stated and well-understood, respondents\nmay make cognitive errors that bias their answers and limit their usefulness as dependent variables in outcome\nstudies.\n2\n\nsubjective surveys. These alternative data sources include laboratory experimental work and naturally\noccurring phenomena. Experiments have the advantage of controlling the environment so as to reduce\nmeasurement error but have the disadvantage of small sample sizes and contrived situations. Outcome-\nbased studies, such as those looking at mortality and status (Miller and Paxson 2006) or the consumption\nof positional goods (Carlsson, Johansson-Stenman, and Martinsson 2007), have the advantage of tracking\nactual occurrences, rather than attitudes or laboratory responses, but carry the disadvantage of embodying\nmany potential determinants unrelated to preferences.\nIn the vein of outcome-based studies, Daly, Wilson, and Johnson (2007) consider whether suicide data\ncan be used to address questions regarding interdependent preferences. They argue that suicide represents\na revealed choice that can be considered a direct measure of well-being. Using individual-level\nlongitudinal data, they find that relative income does matter for suicide risk, confirming results from\nsubjective well-being and experimental work. An obvious concern regarding suicide data, however, is\nthat the preferences of suicide victims, who arguably are at the extreme lower tail of the well-being\ndistribution, may not be representative of the overall population.\nIn this paper we attempt to resolve some of the uncertainty regarding the reasonableness of the subjective\nwell-being and suicide data by performing a type of cross-validation exercise across the two data types.\nAt the root of our study is an interest in knowing whether the two data series capture the latent variable on\nwell-being that would allow one to infer preferences from their relationships with other variables. To\nmove toward an answer, we assess how subjective well-being and suicide data match up over a range of\nanalyses. We look first at the aggregate patterns, both in the time-series and in population-based cross-\nsections. We then consider micro-multivariate patterns in the data by comparing the results from parallel\nindividual-level regressions.\nUnder the principles of cross-validation, failure to find a systematic relationship between these data\nmeans we keep searching, since a negative result could be driven by either or both of the series. If,\nhowever, we find a strong relationship across these sources, then we have additional support for the\nnotion that the results reflect true preferences of the general population. Previewing our results, we find\nessentially no relationship between the suicide rate and the subjective well-being data in the aggregate\ntime series patterns. We find a weak relationship between suicide in the aggregate cross-sectional results,\nbut it is inconsistent across variables. In contrast, at the micro level, we find a strikingly strong\nrelationship between the relative risks on the variables associated with greater suicide risk and higher\nlikelihood of unhappiness. Our results suggest that while researchers should be cautious about inferences\n3\n\nbased on time series data from SWB surveys or suicide rates, the findings from micro data on SWB and\nsuicide appear to be quite reflective of typical preferences in society.\nII. Data\nOur analysis is based on information from two main sources. The data on subjective well-being come\nfrom the General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is a survey of American demographics, behaviors,\nattitudes, and opinions, administered since 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center out of the\nUniversity of Chicago. It is structured to be a representative sample of the U.S. population; it was\nadministered to about 1,500 respondents per year from 1972-1993 (excluding 1979, 1981, and 1992),\n3,000 from 1994 through 2004, and about 4,500 respondents in 2006.2 Our analysis relies on a wide\nrange of variables from the GSS including demographic and income variables. Our key interest is the\nquestion on subjective well-being. This question reads: “Taken all together, how would you say things\nare these days—would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” To underscore\nthe purely ordinal content of the responses and avoid letting any connotations of the answer choices\ninfluence how we treat the data or discuss the results, we simply recode the responses “very happy,”\n“pretty happy,” and “not too happy” as “high”, “medium”, and “low,” respectively.\nResults for suicide come from three different sources, all of which are based on U.S. Death Certificate\ndata. The time series of U.S. suicide rates, available from 1950 to 2006, come from U.S. Vital Statistics\n(VS). The VS data are useful for plotting trends but have limited demographic information (age, race,\ngender) so are not useful for more detailed comparisons. For more detailed analyses we rely on two\nadditional sources that we have used in other work (Daly, Wilson, and Johnson 2007). The first is the\nMortality Detail Files (MDF), which are produced by the National Center for Health Statistics and\ndistributed by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). For any given\nyear, the MDF is essentially the data from all death certificates recorded in the United States in that year\n(see U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1992). These data include a variety of important\ndemographic and employment-related variables, and so we rely on them for cross-sectional descriptive\nanalysis. Finally, we use the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) for individual level\nregressions. The NLMS consists of files from the Current Population Surveys (CPS) from 1978 to 1998,\nmatched to the National Death Index (NDI), a national database containing the universe of U.S. death\ncertificates. The matching process appends to individual CPS records (1) whether the person has died\nwithin the follow-up period (1979 through 1998), (2) date of death (if deceased), and (3) cause of death (if\n2 Note that only about one half the total respondents were asked about their happiness from 2002 through 2004, and\nabout two-thirds were asked in 2006.\n4\n\ndeceased). Importantly, suicide rates computed from VS, the MDF, and the NLMS are very similar and\nassure us that the data sources are interchangeable for research purposes.\nIII. Aggregate Patterns in Subjective Well-Being and Suicide Data\nTime Series\nTo get a sense of how subjective well-being and suicide line up it is useful to look at a simple time series\nplot. Figure 1, panel A shows three series: (1) percent highest happiness – the percent of respondents in\nthe high happiness category, (2) percent lowest happiness– the percent in the low category, and (3) the\nsuicide rate – the number of suicides per 100,000 population. The data span the period from 1972 to\n2006. The most striking pattern in Figure 1 is the relative constancy of all three series. Over the period\nof more than 30 years, the proportions of reported happiness, unhappiness, and suicide have hardly\nchanged.3 On average over the period, about 30% of GSS respondents reported being in the highest of the\nthree happiness categories and about 14% reported being in the lowest category. The average suicide rate\nwas 12 per 100,000.\nThe broad characterization of little change over time masks considerable year to year variability in reports\non subjective well-being. The percentage of respondents reporting being in the highest and lowest\ncategory fluctuates considerably from year to year, raising concerns about the signal, versus noise, that\ncan be gleaned from annual comparisons. On the positive side, the percent highest and percent lowest\ntend to exhibit negative co-movement at a yearly frequency, as one would expect. The suicide data are\nfar smoother than the subjective well-being data. As such, neither of the subjective well-being measures\nco-move with suicide at high frequency intervals.\nTo make it easier to observe lower frequency co-movement among our series, Figure 1, panel B shows\ndemeaned and smoothed (HP-filtered) plots. At low frequencies, percent highest and percent lowest co-\nmove negatively up until the middle of the 1990s. After 1996, these percentages start to move together,\nimplying that that the fraction reporting that they are in the middle of the happiness distribution is\nshrinking.4 Comparing trends in the suicide rate to those in subjective well-being reveal little co-\nmovement across these series. The suicide rate has mostly moved independently, trending down over\n3 The relative stability of the subjective well-being responses underlies the “Easterlin Paradox,” the lack of a long-\nterm relationship between income and happiness.\n4 See Stevensen and Wolfers (2008) for a more detailed analysis of happiness inequality over time.\n5\n\ntime. Other investigations suggest that this downward trend is more likely related to improvement in and\naccess to antidepressants rather than to any underlying changes in the happiness of the population.5\nOverall, we find little evidence of a relationship between reports of happiness and unhappiness from the\nGSS and suicide data over time. Although we find some evidence that happiness and unhappiness move\ntogether over time, the direction of that movement changes from negative to positive over the sample,\nraising concerns about the signal that can be extracted from these time series. The key message we take\naway from these time series comparisons is that they are not likely to be fruitful for pinning down\nunderlying preferences or parameters of the utility function.\nCross-Sectional\nWe next turn to assessing how happiness, unhappiness, and suicide compare in terms of their simple\nbivariate relationships with important demographic and socioeconomic variables in the cross section.\nSpecifically, we examine whether the demographic and labor market characteristics of suicide victims\npositively correlate, in a simple bivariate sense, with the characteristics of GSS respondents reporting low\nhappiness and/or negatively correlate with the characteristics of those reporting high happiness. The\nresults of this analysis are reported in Table 1.\nIn terms of age, the results suggest a similar profile for suicide and happiness: the age-group-specific\nshare of respondents reporting in the highest happiness category, percent highest, rises with age, while\nsuicide risk falls with age. Seemingly inconsistent with the percent highest and suicide categories, the\nage profile for percent lowest is not monotonically downward sloping, suggesting some asymmetry in the\nlow and high happiness reporting. Turning to race, whites have the highest suicide rate, followed by\nblacks and then other races. The SWB data tell a very different story about race: a much larger\npercentage of whites report being in the highest happiness category and a much lower fraction report\nbeing in the lowest category than do blacks, while the percentages for other racial groups lie in between\nwhites and blacks. As with race, the gender pattern of suicide and SWB diverge considerably. Men are\nmuch more likely to commit suicide than women, but the percentages reporting high and low levels of\nhappiness are quite similar.6\n5 The downward trend in suicide may also be related to improved recognition of suicidal behavior or ailments that\ncreate suicidal feelings, improved therapeutic treatments for these conditions, and improved suicide prevention\nnetworks.\n6 The difference between men and women in suicide rates may be the result of difference in means of suicide. Men\nare more likely to use means that have higher completion rates (jumping, guns, drowning) while woman are more\nlikely to use means with higher probabilities of survival (overdose, cutting). In fact, attempt rates are actually two to\nthree times higher for women than men.\n6\n\nThe remainder of the table compares more behavioral or circumstantial correlates of well-being that\ngenerally are thought to affect preferences and/or utility: marital status and educational attainment.\nBeing married has a consistent effect on suicide and subjective well-being, reducing suicide risk and\nreported unhappiness and raising reported happiness. For the other marital statuses, the effects on suicide\nand subjective well-being are less clearly aligned. For example, although being single/never married\nraises suicide risk considerably relative to being separated/divorced/widowed, it has the opposite or no\neffect on reported happiness and unhappiness.7 The effects of educational attainment on suicide and\nSWB appear more similar. Although the relationship is far from one to one, in general, higher educational\nattainment lowers suicide risk and unhappiness and increases reported happiness.\nOverall, we find a weak relationship between the cross-sectional aggregate patterns in the suicide and\nSWB data. The low association between these series both in the time series and across several aggregate\ncorrelates is worrisome, and raises concern that either suicide data or SWB data, or both, may not be good\nindicators of the latent variable that they are often used to measure—utility of a typical member of the\npopulation. With this in mind, we consider how these data compare in individual level, multivariate\nanalyses.\nIV. Micro, Multivariate Relationships Across Suicide and Subjective Well-Being Data\nThe lack of a strong and consistent relationship between aggregate trends and between correlates of\nsuicide and subjective well-being data does not necessarily imply the absence of a micro, multivariate\nrelationship. Aggregation bias and limited numbers of data points may be obscuring or failing to pick out\ntrue individual-level relationships. To investigate this possibility we use individual-level data from\nrepeated cross-sections of the GSS and the NLMS. For the GSS, we have data from 1972-2006 and a\ntotal of about 37,000 sample members. For the NLMS, we have data from 1978-1998 and a sample size\nof about 900,000. Of these 900,000 individuals, about 63,000 died by the end of the follow-up period\n(Dec. 31, 1998) and roughly 1,300 of these died of suicide. We restrict our samples from both data sets to\nworking-age (18 to 65 year old) individuals since much of our focus in this analysis is on variables like\nlabor market status and relative income that are likely to be most relevant for the preferences of the\nworking-age population.\n7 The Mortality Detail Files data do not allow one to compute separate suicide rates for separated, divorced, and\nwidowed.\n7\n\nUsing the maximum set of variables that the GSS and NLMS have in common, we set up parallel\nregressions on suicide and subjective well-being data. We then compare the results from these\nregressions as a way of cross-validating the ability of suicide and SWB data to represent the underlying\nlatent variable on well-being. Our starting point is the familiar latent variable model in which U is an\ni\nunobservable index of well-being for an individual i. We model U as a linear function of a vector of\ni\nexplanatory variables, X: U = X β. The probability that U is below any individual-level threshold, θ\ni i i i i i\n—say the threshold below which the individual would report being “not too happy” or the threshold\nbelow which the individual would commit suicide—is then:\nProb[U < θ] = Prob[X β + θ < 0]. (1)\ni i i i\nOur objective here is to estimate the vector β = dU /dX, the relative risk of U falling below the threshold\ni i i\nin question, for the thresholds of suicide, reported happiness, and reported unhappiness. We compare the\nestimates from parallel regressions, using both the SWB and suicide data, arguing that a close relationship\nbetween the results supports both the reasonableness of the data sources and the robustness of the findings\nregarding determinants of utility.\nFor reported happiness and unhappiness, we estimate equation (1) using an ordered probit model on the\nGSS data. We do ordered probit on the full 3-value scale of happiness responses rather than separate\nprobits for high (vs. low or medium) or low (vs. high or medium) for the sake of exposition as well as\nestimation efficiency. In unreported results, we have verified that the estimated coefficients from the\nseparate probits look very similar to each other and to those of the ordered probit. To ease comparability\nwith the suicide regressions, we order the dependent variable with low at the top and high at the bottom,\nso it can be thought of as a measure of unhappiness. For suicide risk, we estimate a Cox Proportional\nHazards (PH) model, given the longitudinal nature of the NLMS data.\nTo be able to directly compare the results obtained from the GSS and NLMS, we transform the probit and\nPH coefficients into their corresponding relative risk estimates. The relative risk for a given variable x in\ni\nthe vector of independent variables, X, is defined as\ni\n[Pr(Event|x = x ∀j ≠i,x =1)/Pr(Event|x = x ∀j ≠i,x =0)], where x denotes the sample\nj j i j j i j\nmean. For the Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models, the relative risks are the hazard ratios\n(RR=HR=eλ, where λ is the coefficient in the PH model). For the Ordered Probit model, the relative risks\nare 1.0 plus the probit marginal effects, evaluated at the sample mean.\n8\n\nThe relative risk for a particular characteristic is interpreted as the probability of the event for an\nindividual with that characteristic relative to the probability for an individual in the omitted category. For\nexample, our regressions include dummy variables for whether individuals have more or less than a\nsecondary education, the omitted category being those who have a secondary (but not post-secondary)\neducation. In the regressions, we obtain a relative risk for the less than secondary education group of\n1.178 in the ordered probit for unhappiness and 1.092 for the PH model of suicide. These relative risks\nimply that those with less than a secondary education had a 17.8% higher risk of reporting lowest\nhappiness and a 9.2% higher risk of suicide compared with someone with a secondary (but not post-\nsecondary) education. The X vector in both regressions are computed similarly and include age, race,\ni\ngender, marital status, urban/rural residence, veteran status, education, employment status, family income,\nand year fixed effects. The full results and p-values are reported in Appendix Table A1.\nThe results are summarized in Figure 2, panels A-C. Panel A shows the relative risks for the basic\ndemographic variables. The solid bars in the figure are the relative risks estimated from the ordered probit\nregression on reported unhappiness. The black, hollow boxes show the relative risks of suicide estimated\nfrom the Cox PH regressions. In all cases, the omitted category has a relative risk of one. Although there\nare some differences in the magnitude of the coefficients in some cases, the results show strikingly similar\npatterns in the effects of age, gender, marital status, urban/rural residence, and veteran status across the\ntwo data sources. Race is the one exception, where the results move in opposite directions.\nPanel B of Figure 2 shows the relative risks for educational attainment and several labor market status\nvariables. The educational profiles of relative risks are nearly identical, confirming the expected pattern\nthat unhappiness and suicide risk both fall with education. The results for the labor market status\nvariables also exhibit a very close association across suicide and SWB, particularly for the “employed but\nnot working” and unemployed categories. There is less of an association in the “unable to work” group,\nbut this may reflect differences in measurement of this status across data sources.8\nThe final comparison shown in Figure 2 is on own income. Here we plot the relative risks in terms of the\nimplied income gradient in each data source. Again, the pattern of the results shows a close association in\nthe effects of income on unhappiness and suicide risk. Both reported unhappiness and suicide risk fall\nwith income. Moreover, in both cases, with the exception of the first income category, the effect of\nadditional income declines as income grows—consistent with diminishing marginal utility of income.\n8 The unable to work category is computed using a single variable in the NLMS but the combination of two\nvariables in the GSS.\n9\n\nThe last aspect of our analysis returns to the question discussed in the introduction of whether and how\nrelative income affects suicide risk and unhappiness (full results shown in Columns 3 and 4 of Appendix\nTable A1). We add relative income to the regressions. The relative income variable for the GSS is the\nrespondent’s self-assessment of their own family income relative to the “typical American family,” with\npossible answers of far above, above, about, below, or far below average. It should be noted that it is not\nobvious what reference group the “typical American family” represents and whether this is taken to be the\nnational average, local area average, or something else. In the NLMS regressions, we capture relative\nincome by including, in addition to own family income, the average family income for their county of\nresidence. Note this is an abbreviated version of regressions reported in Daly, Wilson, and Johnson\n(2007), which obtained very similar coefficients on variables in common.9 The GSS findings indicate\nthat higher perceived relative income reduces the likelihood of reporting low happiness. Similarly,\nhaving low relative income—i.e., high county income relative to own income— increases the risk of\nsuicide. Consistent with previous work on relative income, both of these regressions show that relative\nincome is statistically significant, controlling for a wide range of demographic variables and own income.\nThe micro data results show a strikingly strong association between the results obtained from suicide and\nSWB data. The similar pattern found in both data sources cross-validates the value of these alternative\ndata sources for assessing determinants of latent well-being in general and supports the findings of\ndiminishing marginal utility and the importance of relative income in particular.\nV. Suicide and Happiness\nThe micro results suggest that the same factors that shift people down the happiness continuum also\nincrease their suicide risk. These results suggest that suicide data may be a useful way to assess the\npreferences of the general population, not just those in the extreme lower tail of the distribution. To\nformalize this idea, Daly, Wilson, and Johnson (2007) developed a theoretical framework describing how\none can make inferences about the preferences of the general population from the behavior of suicide\nvictims.\nThe formal model embodies the idea that suicide is an outcome of an individual’s dynamic optimization\nproblem weighing the present discounted value of current and expected future lifetime utility against the\nvalue of exiting life right now. Individuals differ in their inherent levels of happiness (set points) or\n9 Daly, Wilson, and Johnson 2007 performed a wide variety of robustness checks intended to rule out the\npossibility of spurious correlations. These checks confirmed the interpretation of the relative income\nfindings for suicide risk.\n10\n\nsuicide thresholds—θ in equation (1) above—and in their observable circumstances (X). The linear\ni i\npreferences of the general population—the β’s of equation (1), can be estimated by observing how\nchanges in X affect the propensity to commit suicide, under the identifying assumption that the β’s are the\nsame for suicide victims and the rest of the population. Figure 3 provides a diagram of the model. Prior\nto empirical work, we cannot know whether individuals who commit suicide differ only in θ or in both θ\nand β. The results from the cross-validation exercise above support the idea that β’s are the same between\nthose who commit suicide and those who do not.\nFigure 3.

Summary and Future Work\nThere are three key findings that emerge from the empirical patterns uncovered in this analysis. First,\nthere is little relationship between the suicide rate and subjective well-being in the time series. Second,\nthere is a weak and inconsistent relationship between the correlates of the suicide rate and subjective well-\nbeing data in the aggregate cross-section. Finally, there is a strikingly strong relationship between the\ncorrelates of suicide risk and unhappiness/happiness in the multivariate micro analysis. The micro results\ncross-validate the usefulness of subjective well-being and suicide data for individual-level analyses. The\nresults suggest that prior work using micro subjective well-being data to address relative income status\nquestions are robust to concerns raised about reporting errors. However, we also find that caution is\nwarranted when making inferences from the time series patterns in the subjective well-being data, at least\n11\n\nthose obtained from the GSS. Going forward, we see the results of this study as supportive of additional\nand complementary work on preferences using both subjective well-being and suicide data.\n12\n\nReferences\nBertrand, Marianne, and Sendhil Mullainathan. \"Do People Mean What They Say?

    "text": "FINAL\n“Ambassadors of Hope”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Preuss School Graduation\nVirtual Presentation\nJune 18, 2020\n4:00PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nHi everyone. I’m honored to be your graduation speaker today. It’s truly\na gift to me.\nNow typically, graduation speeches have a certain rhythm to them.\nThere’s a little humor, some advice, lots of celebration, big congratulations.\nAnd almost always, there’s a central theme tied around encouragement,\naspiration, or maybe perspective.\nBut today, I’ve decided to depart from the usual rhythm and go straight\nto what we all need most right now: HOPE. Hope for ourselves, hope for our\nworld, hope for a brighter future.\nI know I’m not alone in needing hope. I saw it in your words that you\nsent in last month – on how you felt about graduating during a global\npandemic.\nIn the midst of the expected emotions at graduation, the ones I’ve seen\nand felt myself – things like accomplished, motivated, excited – there were\nothers that reflect the times we’re in. Words like, anxious, disappointed… one\nperson said robbed.\n1\n\nFINAL\nAnd these were your feelings when we were only dealing with COVID-\n19. Before the pain, the tensions, and the unrest surrounding the deaths of\nGeorge Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. Deaths that underscore\nand spotlight the systemic racism, inequality, and injustice that plague our\nsociety.\nI’m guessing that if I asked you today, you might not even have the\nwords to fully describe how you feel anymore. And that’s okay. I’ve been\ntrying to figure out my own feelings, and find my own right words, for weeks.\nIt’s understandable. Our world is in a hard place right now. And we have\nno clear sense of when and how better days will emerge.\nBut to better days we must go. Not by accident. But with purpose and\nconviction. As agents of change. As ambassadors of hope.\nWhy hope? What makes hope the foundational element for change? It’s\nactually very simple: hope is the stubborn – and I mean double-underlined\nstubborn – belief that whatever is happening today does not have to\ndetermine tomorrow. Hope is what allows you to set an intention for change\nand know that change is possible. So at its heart, hope is agency.\nYou start off with loads of hope when you’re young. I know I did. Just\nthink of all the things you’ve done with complete abandon, knowing in your\nheart that they would work out in the end.\nThen the disappointments come, and the frustrations. You learn that\nchange can be slow, and that maybe goals aren’t as easy to reach as you\nexpected. And these experiences leave little dents… maybe a bruise. And they\ncan chip away at your hope.\n2\n\nFINAL\nBut here’s the thing I came to tell you. Hope is not a rock or some other\ninanimate object that erodes or diminishes over time, outside of our control.\nHope is a living thing. And we must choose to nurture it. It takes care and\nintention to thrive.\nSo how do you do it? How do you maintain hope? How do you make it\ngrow, and get bigger and stronger over time?\nYou keep a box of diamonds.\nYou might remember my box of diamonds. I talked to you about it when\nI visited Preuss in October. They’re the memories from my life, big and small,\nthat make me feel joyous, filled up, boundless. They remind me of my\nhumanness, of my goodness, and of the kindness in the world. They remind\nme that, no matter what’s going on, I belong.\nSometimes my diamonds are physical – like my grandfather’s pocket\nknife, or the last $20 bill my grandma gave me for groceries before she passed\naway. Sometimes they are small and fleeting moments, like the compassion of\na UPS driver who saw I was upset one day and stopped his truck to ask if I was\nokay. And sometimes they are grand, like the day I married my wife.\nThe best thing about diamonds is that they are everywhere. You just\nhave to remember to stop and collect them. You have to be intentional about\nspotting them, and reflecting on them, and putting them in your real or virtual\nmemory box. All so they will be ready to take out when you need them – to\nhelp you through frustration or anger, to fill you back up, to soothe your grief\nwhen the world feels lost.\nThis is the practice of choosing hope.\n3\n\nFINAL\nI’ve been taking out my box of diamonds a lot over the past few months.\nLooking at each one. Recalling where I got them and how I felt when I found\nthem. All trying to feel strong in these challenging times.\nSo it’s fitting that I am here today to give your graduation speech.\nBecause last October, I had the enormous joy of meeting you. On that day, we\ntook a picture together. I rushed home and printed that picture, and it still\nhangs on my wall. It was a day I won’t forget. It is one of my diamonds.\nToday, more than anything, I want to say thank you. And I want you to\nremember that you make a difference even when you don’t realize it. You give\nothers strength and fortitude just by being who you are. By graduating in a\npandemic. By being the first in your family to head for college. And for being\nbrave and vulnerable enough to allow yourselves to feel excited, anxious,\nmotivated, disappointed, and even robbed all on the same day.\nBut before I close and for just a moment, I want you to put every other\nemotion aside except for one. I want you to only feel joy. Because today is your\nday. It’s filled with love, and pride, and gratitude from your families, from your\nfriends, from your teachers, and from your community. You have\naccomplished so much, and today is your day to celebrate.\nThe world will be here when you’re done – and it will need you to be\nstrong and ready. It will need you to show up, speak out, and fight for a better\nfuture on whatever path you choose to take.\nBut that’s for tomorrow.\nSo take today. Hold on to it. Let it fill you up. And then, let’s join together\nto be ambassadors of hope. The world needs us.\nThank you – and congratulations. I can’t wait to see what you do.\n4",

For the period\n1969 to 1989, rising dispersion of men’s earnings and increases in nontraditional family structures\n(notably single parenthood) respectively explain up to about three-fourths and one-half of rising\ninequality in family income and poverty. In contrast to results from most previous research, we\nfind that the increase in women’s labor force participation offset rising inequality in family income,\nwith its impact moving down the income distribution over time. Moreover, inequality grew at a\nslower rate in the 1990s than in earlier decades, largely due to slower deterioration in the relative\nearnings of men from low-income families.\n\nInequality and Poverty in the United States:\nThe Effects of Rising Male Wage Dispersion and Changing Family Behavior\nIntroduction\nSince the late 1960s, inequality in family income has risen substantially in the United\nStates. Although some of the rising dispersion has been associated with gains in the upper portion\nof the income distribution (Burkhauser et al. 1999), dispersion in the bottom portion of the\ndistribution has grown substantially. This increase in dispersion in the lower tail increased poverty\nrates during the 1980s, especially among families with children (Blank and Card 1993), suggesting\nimportant implications of rising inequality for social welfare and policy.\nRising dispersion in individual earnings has been offered as a leading explanation for rising\ninequality in family income (see for example Karoly and Burtless 1995). As the same time,\nhowever, the U.S. has witnessed extensive changes in family structure and behavior that also may\nhave contributed to rising inequality in family income. These changes include pronounced\nincreases in women’s labor force attachment and in the share of households consisting of a single\nadult with children.\nIn this paper, we assess the effects of the changing distribution of men’s earnings, rising\nlabor force participation by women, and changes in family structure and living arrangements on\nfamily income inequality and poverty. We focus on these three factors, rather than a wider list of\npossible causes, due to their primacy in past research and their potential behavioral links. Our\ndata span the years 1967-1998, and we largely abstract from business cycle effects on inequality\nby focusing on the business cycle peak or near-peak years of 1969, 1979, 1989, and 1998. In\naddition to a reexamination of the causes of rising income inequality during the 1970s and 1980s,\n\n-2-\nan important contribution of this paper is to update the analyses and examine whether the\ndeterioration in the relative status of low-income families that occurred in these decades extended\ninto the 1990s as well.\nOur methodology relies on the imposition of specific counterfactuals on the observed\ndistribution of income. In particular, we assess the impact of changes in the distribution of men’s\nearnings using a rank-based distributional exchange (similar to Burtless 1999), and we assess the\nimpact of changing family behavior and underlying characteristics using the conditional density\nestimation method of DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996; henceforth “DFL”). This combined\napproach enables us to examine the impact of the modelled factors in a relatively unified\nframework that accounts for inter-related impacts through conditional estimation and sequential\ndecomposition. The technique also enables us to estimate the effects of the modelled factors on\nthe complete distribution of family income, hence its specific features, such as dispersion in the\nlower half (including the poverty rate). Compared with past research in this area, our findings\nprovide a more extensive and precise depiction of the impact of the modelled factors on the\ndistribution of family income, and they serve to clarify conflicting results from past literature,\nnotably in regard to the effect of rising labor force participation by women on family income\ninequality.\nThe paper proceeds by first describing our data and trends in income inequality. We\ndescribe the decomposition methodology used in Section II and present results in Section III. In\nSection IV, we summarize the results and discuss implications for future research.\n\n-3-\nI. Data and Trends\nWe use data from the March Annual Demographic Supplements to the Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS) for the years 1968-1999 (income years 1967-1998). The CPS is the\nmonthly survey of about 60,000 U.S. households that is used for tabulations of official labor force\nseries and related statistics. The March supplement collects detailed information on income and\nwork experience in the previous calendar year. In the formal decomposition analysis, we focus on\nthe years 1969, 1979, 1989, and 1998, which largely span our sample frame. These years\nrepresent either business cycle peaks or ongoing expansions, so that our analysis of changes over\ntime will be relatively unaffected by underlying business-cycle determinants of inequality. For\nconsistency with past work in this area, we restricted the sample to families in which the male or\nfemale head is between the ages of 16 and 64.1\nOur measure of economic well-being starts with total pre-tax, post-transfer income for the\nfamily unit.2 We apply the concept of equivalent personal income, which adjusts available income\nfor family size and economies of scale in consumption. Letting Y denote our measure of total\nf\n1We excluded families with elderly heads because the determinants and dynamics of family\nstructure, labor supply, and family income are different for elderly individuals and couples than\nthey are for families with working-age adults, as are the policy options for addressing income\ndispersion and poverty. Although the exact age range varies, this is a common restriction in\npapers that investigate the impact of earnings dispersion and family behavior on the distribution of\nfamily income (see for example Cancian and Reed 1998, Danziger and Gottschalk 1993); our use\nof this restriction enhances the comparability of our work with past work. Elderly individuals\nliving with families headed by their working-age relatives are included in our sample.\n2The CPS does not provide information on post-tax income. Although exclusion of tax\ncollections may distort measurement of changes in the distribution of disposable income over\ntime, Gottschalk and Smeeding (1997, page 670) argue that in the U.S., “changes in taxes and\ntransfers account for only a small part of the trend in inequality during the 1980s and 1990s.” In\nSection III, we discuss indirect evidence on the impact of government transfers during the 1990s.\n\n-4-\nfamily income and F denote family size, our measure of family equivalent income (Y) for each\nindividual in a family is:\n(1)\nwhere 0 (cid:0) (cid:0) (cid:0) 1 (see Buhmann et al. 1988). For the results reported in this paper, we set (cid:0)=0.5.\nThis value lies at the midpoint of the range of assumptions regarding economies of scale in family\nconsumption, and it has the virtue of being nearly identical to the implied equivalence scale used\nin the Census Bureau’s official poverty thresholds (Ruggles 1990).3 We apply this calculation for\nall families identified in our data except for multi-generational families that share living quarters,\nfor whom income and family size are totalled across the sub-families.4 We use the CPS sampling\nweights, which are designed to ensure that the sample is representative of the associated\npopulation. All income values are expressed in 1998 dollars, using the GDP deflator for personal\nconsumption expenditures.\nA key feature of the U.S. distribution of family income is the percentage of families or\nindividuals who fall below the income cutoff that represents the official poverty line. We identify\nall individuals in a family as being in poverty if family equivalent income (defined above) falls\nbelow the official federal poverty threshold for a single-person family. Although this\n3 The boundary values of (cid:0)—0 and 1—imply, respectively, infinite and no economies of scale\nin family consumption. To test the sensitivity of our results to our specific equivalence scale, we\nalso estimated our primary model with (cid:0) set equal to 0.25 and 0.75 (see Section III).\n4 This accounts for income sharing across related families in such households, moving our\nmeasure of family income closer to a measure of total household income. Focusing entirely on\nhousehold income might show less increase in inequality over our sample frame, but existing\nresults suggest the differences are likely to be small (Burkhauser et al. 1999).\n\n-5-\nsimplification causes our tabulations of poverty rates to differ slightly from the official U.S.\npoverty rate, our approach has the benefit of making our inequality and poverty measures\ncomparable through the use of identical equivalence scales.\nThe two panels of Figure 1 display statistics for family equivalent income for the years\n1967-1998, with each series normalized so that the 1967 value equals 100. For the income\nvariables, we focus on standard dispersion measures—the coefficient of variation, the Gini and\nTheil coefficients, the mean logarithmic deviation, and several percentile dispersion ratios—and\ndisplay the median as well.5 All of the dispersion measures increased substantially between 1969\nand 1998.6 The trend toward increasing inequality was most evident in the bottom half of the\nincome distribution, as indicated by the especially pronounced rise in the mean logarithmic\ndeviation (which is relatively sensitive to dispersion toward the bottom of the distribution) and the\n50-10 income ratio. Consistent with increased dispersion in the lower tail, an upward trend in\npoverty also was present during this period, although the cyclical variability is high. Comparing\nthe business cycle peak or near-peak years of 1969, 1979, 1989, and 1998 indicates that the\nlargest increases in inequality occurred during the 1980s. Pronounced increases were associated\nwith recessionary periods; inequality subsequently increased further during the 1980s expansion\n5 The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. The Gini and\nTheil measures and the mean logarithmic deviation are standard parametric indices of inequality\nused in previous work (see Cowell 2000 for discussion of alternative inequality measures). Our\npercentile dispersion measures are expressed as the ratio of incomes at the indicated percentiles of\nthe distribution of family equivalent income.\n6 The maximum recordable income levels (“topcodes”) changed somewhat during our sample\nframe; see Appendix A for a description of our approach to mitigating their impact.\n\n-6-\nbut fell a bit during the 1990s expansion (see Appendix A for the exact yearly figures for the\ninequality series).\nFigure 2 provides a visual representation of the distribution of real family equivalent\nincome in 1969, 1989, and 1998.7 The figure displays kernel density estimates of the distribution\nof family income for these years.8 The distribution widened substantially between 1969 and 1989,\nwith pronounced hollowing of the middle and density shifts to both tails. Much of the density\nmass moved to the right, reflecting improvements in real equivalent income for many families\n(Burkhauser et al. 1999). However, due to the median shift, the figure somewhat masks the\ndecline in the relative well-being of low-income families that is indicated by the changes in the\npercentile dispersion measures in Figure 1. In contrast to the changes between 1969 and 1989,\nthe increase in dispersion between 1989 and 1998 was relatively modest, with discernible\nmovement of the density mass from the lower and middle portions to the upper portion.9\n7 To enhance visual clarity, we do not display the distribution of income in 1979. Figure 1\nshows that most of the increase in the dispersion of income between 1969 and 1989 occurred\nduring the 1980s.\n8 Kernel density estimates serve essentially as smoothed histogram representations of the\nunderlying distribution from which an empirical distribution is sampled. The key choices in regard\nto kernel density estimation are the kernel function and the bandwidth. We used the\nEpanechnikov kernel function and performed subjective tests to arrive at a bandwidth that\nprovides the clearest visual representation of our data (with the number of evaluation points set to\n500). Silverman (1986) discusses nonparametric density estimation in detail, and Delgado and\nRobinson (1992) provide a useful summary of econometric applications. To provide an adequate\nvisual representation of the key portions of the distribution, we truncated the kernel density plots\nat 0 and 60,000 dollars in all figures that display family equivalent income. However, the density\nestimates themselves are based on the full range of data.\n9Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of differences between the underlying empirical distributions for\nthese three years strongly reject the null hypothesis of no difference in each case, with p-values\nwell below .01 (see Burkhauser et al. 1999 for discussion of this test).\n\n-7-\nTo explain these changes in family income inequality, we will focus on changes in the\ndistribution of men’s earnings, women’s labor force participation, family structure, and underlying\nfamily characteristics (such as age, location, etc.). We restrict ourselves to these factors because\nthey reflect related trends at the family level in recent decades, with the possibility of causal\nlinkages between them.10\nFor the distribution of men’s earnings, we use data on yearly wage and salary earnings, for\nwhich dispersion increased substantially over our sample frame (see for example Card and\nDiNardo 2002). Our measure includes individuals whose yearly earnings are zero. In Figure 3,\nwe display the median, the coefficient of variation, and the Gini and Theil coefficients (we do not\ndisplay percentile dispersion measures in Figure 3, because they are not uniformly defined for our\nmeasure of yearly male earnings—for example, the 10th percentile generally is zero).11 As of\n1998, the median had not yet returned to the peak achieved in 1973, although growth in the 1990s\nwas been rapid. The three measures of dispersion all exhibit nearly monotonic increases between\n1967 and 1993, with the net increase ranging from 29 percent for the Gini coefficient to 55\npercent for Theil’s coefficient. However, each declined a bit between 1993 and 1998, indicating\ngrowth in yearly male earnings that was more evenly distributed than it had been in past decades\n(see Appendix A for a listing of the exact yearly figures).\n10 Exploring the causal links is beyond the scope of this paper. In recent related work,\nDickens and Ellwood (2004 forthcoming) found that demography, wage changes, and social\npolicy were key determinants of changing poverty rates in the U.S. and Great Britain between\n1979 and 1999. Work on British inequality and poverty has largely focused on the impact of\ngovernment tax and transfer policies and changes in work status; see for example Jenkins (1995,\n1996) in regard to inequality and Piachaud and Sutherland (2001, 2003) in regard to poverty.\n11 See Appendix A for a discussion of how we handled changing topcodes for the male\nearnings variable over our sample frame.\n\n-8-\nConcurrent with the increased dispersion in male earnings were substantial changes in\nfemale labor force participation and family structure. Application of our conditional density\nestimation technique to these factors requires that they be defined in categorical terms. To\nmeasure trends in female participation, we defined a variable that is coded as 1 if the family\nincludes a woman who worked positive hours in the previous year and 0 otherwise. Although this\nmeasure ignores hours variation other than the participation decision (such as changes in part-time\nwork), our tabulations indicated that nearly all of the trend increase in women’s labor force\nparticipation and hours worked during our sample frame was associated with a shift from non-\nparticipation to full-time work. As measured by this variable, women’s participation rose steadily\nduring most of our sample frame, with the most rapid increases evident in the late 1970s and only\na small increase evident in the 1990s (see Figure 4, top panel, and the exact figures listed in\nAppendix A).\nIn regard to family structure, the trend in the U.S. during the past several decades has\nbeen away from traditional husband-wife families with children, with corresponding increases in\nfamilies consisting of single (mostly female) heads with children and single individuals without\nchildren. To capture these trends, we characterize families as falling into five categories: married\nwith children, married without children, never married individuals with children, other single\nindividuals with children, and single individuals without children.12 As displayed in Figure 4\n12 In most cases households contain one family. For households that contain multiple families\nrelated by blood or marriage, we treat sub-families as separate families for the identification of\nfamily structure. This accounts for important changes in living arrangements such as the rise in\nmulti-generational families living in the same household — for example, single mothers living with\ntheir own parents. As noted by London (1998), prior to 1984 the CPS surveys did not properly\naccount for the household relationships of children living in multi-generational households,\nproducing an undercount of the number of single mothers due to misidentification of those who\n\n-9-\n(bottom panel), the share of married couples with children declined substantially, along with\npronounced percentage increases in the share of never married individuals with children and\nsingles without children.13 For example, the share of families consisting of a never-married single\nhead with children increased by a factor of nearly six between 1969 and 1998, rising from 0.010\nto 0.059 (see the exact time series tabulations in Appendix A). Although this still represents a\nsmall share of all families, the increase of about five percentage points is large relative to the share\nof families likely to have low income or be in poverty; for example, the poverty rate during our\nsample frame is mostly in the range of 0.10 to 0.15.\nII. Decomposition Methodology and Counterfactuals\nFamily Behavior and Characteristics\nOur formal analysis of the changing distribution of family equivalent income involves the\nimposition of specific counterfactuals on the observed distribution of family equivalent income.\nWe treat the changing dispersion of men’s earning as exogenous and model this factor in an\nunconditional framework, through a rank-based distributional exchange. The other factors —\nwomen’s labor force participation, family structure, and underlying family characteristics — are\ntreated as interrelated, through application of the conditional density approach of DiNardo,\nFortin, and Lemieux (1996; henceforth DFL). Most previous work that investigates the\nlive with their parents. To reduce the impact of undercounting this key family type in the early\nportion of our sample, we applied London’s correction to the pre-1984 data.\n13The incidence of cohabitation without legal marriage increased during our sample frame\n(Casper et al. 1999), which may to some degree offset the impact of declining marriage rates on\nequivalent income. Direct measures of cohabitation only became available in the CPS beginning\nin 1996; see Section III for an assessment of the sensitivity of our results to this issue.\n\n-10-\ndeterminants of rising dispersion of family income is based on decompositions of family income\ninto its components.14 These approaches in general are unconditional, in that they do not account\nfor changes in related variables that each affect the distribution of family income. By contrast, our\napproach to female labor supply, family structure, and related characteristics accounts for the\ninter-relationships between these factors, thereby providing a more clear understanding of their\nindependent effects. We describe these procedures heuristically in the text; for the formal\nderivations, see Appendix B.\nWe begin by defining an individual observation as a vector (Y, Z, t) , consisting of family\nequivalent income Y, a vector of characteristics Z, and a year t (this discussion closely parallels\nSection 3 of DFL). This distribution may also depend on other factors, such as the structure of\nmen’s earnings, denoted m. Using notation similar to DFL, we can express the density of family\nt\nequivalent income in a particular year, f(Y), as:\nt\n(2)\n14 Numerous papers examine the effects of female earnings and labor supply on family income\ninequality in the U.S. Among them, Shorrocks (1983), Lerman and Yitzhaki (1985), and Karoly\nand Burtless (1995) decomposed inequality indices by income source and concluded that wives’\nearnings magnify family income inequality. In contrast, Cancian, Danziger and Gottschalk (1993)\nfound that wives’ earnings decrease income inequality in married couple families, and Blackburn\nand Bloom (1989) found little overall impact of women’s labor supply on inequality in family\nincome. As noted by Cancian and Reed (1998), the impact of wives’ earnings and labor supply on\ninequality depends on the specific counterfactual assumption that is made. Several papers have\nfound a substantial effect of changing family structure on inequality in family income poverty;\nthese include Gottschalk and Danziger (1993) and Lerman (1996). In a different approach,\nBradbury (1996) applied regression analyses to data aggregated at the regional level and found\nthat changing family structure increased inequality while increases in women’s labor force\nparticipation reduced it.\n\n-11-\nOur estimation of counterfactual densities involves the combination of different years, or\n“datings,” and equation (2) introduces notation that accounts for these datings. For example,\nwhile the expression f(Y; t =89, t =89, m ) represents the observed density of family equivalent\nY Z 89\nincome in 1989, the expression f(Y; t =89, t =69, m ) represents the density of family equivalent\nY Z 89\nincome that would have prevailed in 1989 had the distribution of characteristics, and their\nrelationship to family equivalent income, remained as they were in 1969.\nIn our application, the vector of characteristics Z has three components: women’s labor\nforce participation L, family structure S, and a vector of other family characteristics X. Then\nfollowing DFL, and applying the multiplicative properties of conditional distributions to equation\n(2), the density of family equivalent income in 1989 can be expressed as:\n(3)\nFor the labor force participation, family structure, and family characteristics components,\nestimation of counterfactual densities based on alternative datings proceeds through the\nestimation and application of conditioning weights. Consider first the application to women’s\nlabor force participation. Assuming that women’s participation rose between 1969 and 1989, the\nsimplest way to impose the 1969 distribution of women’s participation on the 1989 distribution of\nfamily equivalent income is to downweight families that include a working woman by a factor that\nis equal to the percentage increase in the share of families in which women work (and, similarly,\nupweight families in which no working woman is present).\nThis simple adjustment, however, ignores any changes in the relationship between\nwomen’s labor force participation, family structure, and family characteristics. For example,\n\n-12-\nsuppose the increase in women’s labor force participation between 1969 and 1989 was\nconcentrated among divorced women who were attempting to replace income lost upon marital\nseparation. Then the rise in women’s labor force participation largely is associated with changes\nin family structure rather than changing labor supply behavior per se. More generally, the\nlikelihood of changes in the joint distribution of L, S, and X necessitates estimation of the 1989\ndistribution of family income with women’s labor force participation, and its relationship to S and\nX, held to its earlier period level.\nIn terms of the notation in (3), we are interested in:\n(4)\nThis expression represents the density that would be observed if the probability of women’s labor\nforce participation retained its 1969 level and structure (conditional on family structure S and\nfamily characteristics X), but family equivalent income otherwise was determined by the same\ndistributional characteristics prevailing in 1989. As derived in Appendix B, this distribution can\nbe expressed as the original unconditional distribution of family income in 1989, with individual\n(cid:0)\nψ\nobservations reweighted by the function (L,S,X). This function represents the change\nL|S,X\nbetween 1969 and 1989 in the conditional probability that the female head works in a family\ndefined by characteristics {S,X}. The conditional probabilities can be estimated as the fitted\nvalues obtained from standard binary dependent variable models, in which female participation is\nregressed on family structure and family characteristics. In the empirical analysis, we used the\nlogit model to estimate these conditional probabilities.\n\n-13-\nThe process by which we account for the impact of changes in family structure is similar\nto that for women’s labor force participation, although we must account for the added complexity\nof family structure as an outcome variable. Our measure of family structure is a variable with five\nmutually exclusive categories: married with children, married without children, never married\nwith children, other single individuals with children, and single individuals with no children. To\n(cid:0)\nψ\nform the appropriate conditioning weights, (S, X), we estimated multinomial logit models\nS|X\nfor each year of data being compared; the outcome variable S is defined by the five family\nstructure categories, and the covariates are defined by our X vector of family characteristics. We\nthen use the fitted coefficients from these models to form conditioning weights similar to those\ndescribed for the labor force participation step. Estimating the separate effects of changes in\nother family characteristics (X) proceeds in a similar fashion, through estimation of conditioning\nweights ψˆ (X) based on bivariate logit models.15\nX\nThis procedure for assessing the impact of changes in family behavior and characteristics\nrelies on simple assumptions that are embodied in the counterfactuals. For women’s labor force\nparticipation, we are assuming that if the distribution of family structure and characteristics were\nas observed in 1969, then the distribution of women’s labor force participation also would be as\nobserved in 1969. A similar assumption is made for the distribution of family structure. This\napproach ignores the possibility that unmeasured influences may have changed the conditional\nrelationships between these factors. Rather than attempting to incorporate such influences, we set\n15See Appendix B for the exact derivation of these weights. We extend the original DFL\ntechnique by examining a three-way (rather than two-way) breakdown of the conditioning\ncharacteristics Z and by including a conditioning variable that takes on more than two outcome\ncategories (see also Biewen 2001, Hyslop and Maré 2001).\n\n-14-\na more modest goal that is consistent with the usual ceteris paribus assumptions employed in\nstandard decomposition analyses.\nMen’s earnings\nWhereas the estimated effects of changes in the various family characteristics are obtained\nthrough conditioning weights, the impact of changes in the distribution of men’s earnings is\nobtained through a direct adjustment to family equivalent income. This is based on a rank-\npreserving exchange of the men’s earnings distributions between two periods (similar to Burtless\n1999). Focusing again on the years 1969 and 1989 as examples, assume that men’s earnings are\nranked from lowest to highest in each year, and consider a man ranked at a particular point. Our\nunderlying conceptual goal is to replace the earnings of each man in the 1989 data with the\nearnings of the man ranked at the same position in the 1969 data. This is trivial in the case of\nidentically sized samples without weights; we simply rank men’s earnings for each year, do a one-\nto-one merge, and exchange the earnings values. In the case of samples of different sizes, and\nwhere it is important to incorporate sampling weights, the procedure is based on the calculation\nand matching of median earnings by percentile group (quantile) for each distribution. This\nprocedure preserves the rank of each man in the 1989 distribution but imposes the location and\ndispersion characteristics of the 1969 distribution of men’s earnings on the 1989 distribution.16\n16 This is very similar to the procedure used by Burtless (1999). However, if we applied\nBurtless’ exact procedure, we would hold constant the sum of men’s earnings in 1989, thereby\naccounting for the change in dispersion only. In contrast, our approach also accounts for the\nchange in the midpoint (median and mean) of the distribution of men’s earnings.\n\n-15-\nTo apply this adjustment to family income, we subtracted from 1989 total family income\nthe wage and salary earnings from the median of the 1989 quantile to which the male head in that\nfamily belongs, then we added back the wage and salary earnings from the median of the 1969\nquantile that is at the same rank as the 1989 quantile to which that male head belonged.17 After\nagain applying our equivalence adjustment, the resulting income variable Y replaces our original\nm\nequivalent income variable Y in the analysis. It is important note that we included men with\nearnings equal to zero in these distributional calculations, to account for the possibility that\ndeclining labor force participation by low-wage men (Juhn 1992) has contributed to rising\ninequality in family income. By contrast, Burtless (1999) restricted the calculation to positive\nearners only. See Appendix C for a formal description of our procedure.18\nOur approach to the changing distribution of male earnings takes its underlying\ndeterminants as given, and as such represents an unconditional approach to assessing its effect,\nrather than a conditional approach (as for our other factors).19 We take this approach because\naccounting for the causes of rising dispersion of men’s earnings has been the focus of other work\n17 We used wage and salary earnings for this calculation and excluded self-employment\nearnings, because the literature on rising dispersion in earnings has focused on the former.\nAlthough much of that literature has focused on hourly earnings, we used yearly earnings for\nconsistency with our yearly measure of family income.\n18 In contrast to our unconditional ranking procedure, Fortin and Lemieux (1998) developed a\nranking procedure that accounts for covariates and applied it to the analysis of the gender wage\ngap.\n19 Our approach to changes in the distribution of men’s earnings could be extended to\nwomen’s earnings as well. However, this would supplant our analysis of the change in women’s\nlabor force participation, which is one of the primary behavioral changes that we wish to\ninvestigate. Moreover, Burtless (1999) found that rising dispersion of female earnings had a\nmuch smaller impact on the distribution of family income than did rising dispersion of men’s\nearnings.\n\n-16-\n(see Katz and Autor 1999 for an overview), and it would detract from our focus on changes\noccurring at the family level. Beyond that, our approach to the contribution of men’s earnings\nrelies on simple assumptions that are directly related to the counterfactual used. In particular, we\nassume that the decision to take a job in the analysis period (for example, 1989) is based on the\nlabor supply and demand conditions of the counterfactual period (for example, 1969). In other\nwords, we assume that if a man at the 10th percentile of the earnings distribution worked in 1969,\na man at that percentile of the earnings distribution also would work in 1989 (even if the observed\n10th percentile in 1989 had zero earnings). No attempt is made to account for general equilibrium\neffects of the changing distribution of men’s earnings on labor supply and demand decisions over\nour analysis period; we leave estimation of a more general model of this type to future work.\nSequential Decomposition\nFor the complete decomposition, we consider all four factors discussed above and assess\ntheir contributions to rising inequality and poverty. The factors first are considered in the\nfollowing primary sequence: the distribution of men’s earnings, women’s labor force\nparticipation, family structure, and underlying family characteristics. We assess the contribution\nof men’s earnings first because leading explanations of changes in the distribution of men’s\nearnings—which include skill-biased technological change and institutional factors such as\nunionization and the minimum wage—imply that shifts in the distribution of men’s earnings are\nlikely to be exogenous in our setting. In regard to the additional steps of the decomposition,\nconditioning female participation on family structure and characteristics seems most sensible from\na causal perspective.\n\n-17-\nOne concern regarding our approach, however, is that their estimated effects may depend\non the ordering of the decomposition, due to inter-relationships between the explanatory factors.\nWe assess the extent of this dependence by reversing the order of the decomposition, considering\nin sequence the effects of changing family characteristics, changing family structure, changes in\nwomen’s labor force participation, and changes in the distribution of men’s earnings. The\nderivation of the reverse-order conditioning weights, and the necessary calculations, are\nsubstantively different than for the primary-order weights; the exact procedure is described in\nAppendix B.\nTable 1 lists the various distributions of family equivalent income that we analyse in the\nprimary-order and reverse-order decompositions, for the comparison between 1969 and 1989.\nEach distribution is defined by the income measure used and a weight. The first row in both\npanels lists the observed distribution for 1989, which is defined by the unadjusted family weight (cid:1)\nand the 1989 time dimension for all relationships. The next four rows in both panels identify the\nadjusted (counterfactual) distributions of equivalent family income in the 1989 data. The first step\nof the primary-order decomposition adjusts family equivalent income (Y) for the change in the\ndistribution of men’s earnings, which produces the adjusted equivalent income measure Y . We\nm\nthen hold the relationships between L, S, and X to their earlier period structure, using the\n(cid:0) (cid:0) (cid:0)\nψ ψ ψ\nestimated weighting functions ( , , and ). The conditionally weighted density\nL|S,X S|X X\nestimates are obtained by using weights that are the product of the family weights ((cid:1)) and the\nestimated conditioning weights. The effects of the explanatory factors are obtained by\ncomparison of the distributions in sequence, while the impact of non-modelled “residual” factors\nare obtained through comparison of the final adjusted 1989 distribution and the unadjusted 1969\n\n-18-\ndistribution. Comparison of the distributions can be made in visual terms, using kernel density\nestimates, or in quantitative terms, using standard dispersion measures.\nIII. Results\nChanges Between 1969 and 1989 (Primary Order Decomposition)\nWe now apply our complete conditional reweighting and decomposition procedure. We\nfirst apply our analysis to the years 1969 and 1989, which correspond roughly to the period of\nrising inequality that has been the focus of previous work. Our vector of family characteristic\nvariables X includes some characteristics, such as location, that are shared among family members,\nand others, such as educational attainment, that differ across members. The variables are age,\nyears of education, the interaction of age and education, whether black, an SMSA residence\nindicator, and nine census geographic division indicators. In the women’s labor force\nparticipation equations used to form the conditioning weights, we include the age, education, and\nrace variables separately for male and female heads if both were present. As discussed above, we\nalso estimated the labor force participation equations as a function of the family structure\ncategories, which we use separate dummy variables to identify. Finally, in estimation of the family\nstructure weights, the multinomial logit equations include controls for the average values of age\nand education for male and female heads if both are present, and for the sole head values in other\nfamilies.\nFigure 5 displays the impact of the estimated factors on the distribution of real equivalent\nfamily income. We display the effects in sequence; each panel holds an additional modelled factor\nto its 1969 structure and examines the impact of this adjustment compared with the prior\n\n-19-\ndistribution. Panel A shows the effect of the changing distribution of men’s earnings. Had the\ndistribution of men’s earnings remained constant between 1969 and 1989, the distribution of\nfamily equivalent income would have been substantially narrower in 1989. The adjusted\ndistribution contains more mass in the middle and less in the lower tail, with only a limited\ndifference in the upper tail. Panel B displays the sequential effect of women’s labor force\nparticipation. The effect of the changing conditional distribution of women’s labor force\nparticipation appears to be a relatively uniform shift to the right in the distribution of family\nincome. In Panel C, the changing conditional distribution of family structure caused a shift in\ndensity mass from the middle of the distribution to the left tail; the impact appears similar to that\nof the changing distribution of men’s earnings, but smaller in magnitude. Finally, in panel D, the\nchanging distribution of family characteristics appears to have caused a relatively uniform shift to\nthe right in the distribution of family income.\nA complementary visual representation of the distribution can be obtained by calculating\nthe differences between the densities displayed in Figure 5. Because this information is closely\nrelated to that in Figure 5, for brevity we examine only the figure corresponding to the net impact\nof all four explanatory factors. Figure 6 displays the difference between the unadjusted (“actual”)\ndistributions for 1969 and 1989, along with the difference between the unadjusted 1969\ndistribution and the 1989 distribution adjusted for all four of our explanatory factors (“fully\nadjusted”). A “flat line” difference between the unadjusted 1969 distribution and the fully\nadjusted 1989 distribution would indicate that our factors fully account for the exact observed\nchange in the distribution of family equivalent income. Although we do not obtain a flat line, the\nfigure shows that accounting for our four explanatory factors substantially decreases the\n\n-20-\ndifference in densities. In particular, the relatively greater mass at very low incomes in the 1989\ndistribution largely disappears, and the relatively greater mass in the lower middle in the 1969\ndistribution and the upper portion in the 1989 distribution is substantially reduced.\nThe quantitative analogue to the visual representation in Figures 5 and 6 is listed in Table\n2. Due to their precision, we focus on these quantitative assessments in the remainder of the\npaper. The first column of the table shows the total change in the measured statistic between the\ntwo years—that is, the 1989 value minus the 1969 value. All of the dispersion measures increased\nsubstantially between these two years, although the increase in dispersion was larger in the lower\nhalf of the distribution (the 50-10 ratio) than it was in the upper half (the 90-50 ratio). The\nadditional columns show the portion of the total change that can be attributed to changes in the\nexplanatory factors, bootstrapped standard errors for these estimates in parentheses, and each\nfactor’s contributory share of the total change in the inequality measure listed in brackets.20 In\naddition to the four explanatory factors, we also list the contribution of residual (unmeasured)\nfactors, which is defined as the difference between the total change and the net portion accounted\nfor by our explanatory factors.21\nThe first row of Table 2 shows that changes in the distribution of men’s earnings and in\nfamily structure had a largely neutral effect on the midpoint of the distribution of family equivalent\n20 Because the estimated standard errors imply high levels of statistical significance for the\nestimated factor contributions discussed in the text, we do not discuss them further. The\nbootstrap standard errors reported in the tables are obtained using the paired approach, based on\n200 random resamplings (with replacement) of the original data (see Efron and Tibshirani 1993\nfor discussion of the paired or XY bootstrap).\n21 In each row, the share effects across the five factor columns sum to one (except for\nrounding errors in some cases).\n\n-21-\nincome. However, the rise in women’s labor force participation and, to a lesser degree, the\nchange in typical family characteristics both increased median family equivalent income. The large\neffect of rising labor force participation by women on median income indicates the importance of\nusing inequality measures in normalized terms—that is, percentile ratios and parametric measures\nsuch as the coefficient of variation rather than the standard deviation. Given the large effect of\nfemale participation on the location (median) of the income distribution, non-normalized\ndispersion measures such as the standard deviation would mistakenly suggest that rising female\nparticipation either had a neutral effect on or increased inequality in family income.\nThe remaining rows of Table 2 list the total changes and the effects of the explanatory\nfactors for our key dispersion measures. The estimates listed in the second column indicate that\nrelative to the other factors considered, the changing distribution of men’s earnings had the largest\nand most uniform effect on family income inequality. Excluding changes in the standard\ndeviation, changes in the distribution of men’s earnings explain from just over one-half to about\nfour-fifths of rising dispersion in family equivalent income. Although the changing distribution of\nmen’s earnings explains a greater share of increased inequality in the upper half of the income\ndistribution, in absolute terms it had a greater impact on the lower half, where the distribution\nwidened by a larger amount.22\n22We find a larger effect of changes in the distribution of men’s earnings than did Burtless\n(1999), for two reasons: we account for the rising incidence of zero earnings among men,\nwhereas’ Burtless did not; and the increase in the dispersion of men’s earnings slowed in the\n1990s, which reduced the contribution of this factor to rising inequality in family income during\nBurtless’ sample period (1979 to 1996). See our Table 4 and discussion below for results from\nthe 1990s.\n\n-22-\nThe third column of Table 2 shows that rising labor force participation by women\n(conditional on family structure and family characteristics) tended to reduce dispersion in family\nequivalent income between 1969 and 1989. Although increased female participation increased the\nstandard deviation of family equivalent income, it increased the mean by a larger amount and\ntherefore reduced the coefficient of variation by an amount equal to nearly one-quarter of the\nactual increase in that statistic. Rising female participation also reduced the other dispersion\nmeasures listed, with the size of its impact ranging from 5 to 32 percent of the increase in\ndispersion. In share terms, the largest impact of female participation was on dispersion in the\nupper half of the distribution (the 90-50 ratio); relative to the total change in the statistic, rising\nfemale participation explains much less of the increase in the bottom half (the 50-10 ratio, and the\nmean logarithmic deviation, which is relatively sensitive to dispersion towards the bottom).\nResults listed in the fourth column of Table 2 indicate that changes in family structure\n(conditional on the distribution of family characteristics) substantially increased inequality\nbetween 1969 and 1989. The impact of changing family structure was concentrated in the lower\nhalf of the distribution of family equivalent income; it explains 52 percent of the increase in the\n50-10 ratio, 49 percent of the increase in the 95-5 ratio, and only about 9 percent of the increase\nin the 90-50 ratio. This suggests that increasing prevalence of family types associated with low\nincomes—especially never married individuals with children—was more important for rising\ndispersion of family equivalent income than was the increasing prevalence of family types\nassociated with higher incomes—mainly married and single individuals without children.\nChanging family structure also explains about one-third of the increase in the key summary\nmeasures of overall dispersion (the Gini and Theil indices and mean logarithmic deviation).\n\n-23-\nThe fifth column of Table 2 lists the effects of the changing distribution of family\ncharacteristics on the distribution of family equivalent income. Once the effects of these variables\nare conditioned out in the previous steps of the decomposition, they have very little independent\nimpact on dispersion, with a mixture of small positive and negative effects across the various\ndispersion measures. As discussed below, however, the impact of family characteristics is\nsomewhat larger when they are considered first in our decomposition.\nThe contribution of residual (unmeasured) factors, listed in the final column of Table 2, is\nsmall compared to the net impact of our modeled factors, indicating that our four explanatory\nfactors account for the bulk of the change in our dispersion measures. Our explanatory factors\naccount for about 60 percent of the increase in the standard deviation, about 80 percent of the\nincrease in the Gini and Theil measures, and nearly 100 percent of the increase in several of the\npercentile ratio measures. Although omitted factors may have had large effects that offset each\nother and therefore account on net for only a small residual share, it seems clear that our\nexplanatory factors played a key role in changing inequality between 1969 and 1989.\nThe final row of Table 2 lists the effects of the explanatory factors on the change in the\npoverty rate between 1969 and 1989. The effects of the explanatory factors on poverty are\nqualitatively similar to their impact on inequality, although the effects on poverty were especially\nlarge relative to the total change in the poverty rate between 1969 and 1989. Taken separately,\nthe changing distribution of men’s earnings and changes in family structure increased the poverty\nrate by an amount approximately equal to the actual increase. These effects were offset\nsomewhat by poverty-reducing impacts of rising female participation and changes in family\ncharacteristics, both of which were associated with a (counterfactual) reduction in the poverty\n\n-24-\nrate of nearly a percentage point. On net, however, the explanatory factors account for 136\npercent of the change in the poverty rate, indicating that unmeasured factors are associated with a\n(counterfactual) reduction in the poverty rate of 1 percentage point. One key omitted factor is\ngovernment transfer payments; they are included in our measure of family equivalent income, but\nwe do not directly account for receipt of government transfers in our decomposition. The\npopulation eligible for government transfer programs increased between 1969 and 1989, which\nmay account for a substantial portion of the residual decline in poverty during that period.23\nWe investigated the sensitivity of these results to two main data issues mentioned in\nSection I. First, we checked the sensitivity to the specific family equivalence scale used, by\nsetting the scaling factor equal to 0.25 and 0.75 (in addition to the value of 0.5 used for the\nresults reported in our tables). We found very little sensitivity of our results to equivalence scale,\neither in regard to the rise in inequality or the contribution of our modelled factors. The increase\nin inequality between 1969 and 1989 is somewhat larger for higher values of the equivalence\nscaling factor, but the factor contributions are quite similar in share terms for each case.\nWe also investigated the sensitivity of our results to the treatment of cohabiting couples\n(unmarried partners, with or without children, who share living quarters). Indirect estimates from\nthe U.S. Bureau of the Census (Casper et al. 1999) suggest that the number of cohabiting couples\nincreased substantially over the past few decades, although they constitute a relatively small\npercentage of all families. By not identifying such couples and not accounting for their resource\n23 Between 1969 and 1989, caseloads for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC) program increased significantly, roughly accompanying the rise in the number of single\nmothers (Moffitt 2000).\n\n-25-\nsharing, we may overstate the contribution of changing living arrangements to rising income\ninequality.\nBecause the CPS only began explicit identification of cohabitants in 1996, we are unable\nto incorporate them directly into our analyses.24 However, under the extreme assumption of no\ncohabitation in 1969, we can obtain an upper-bound estimate of the impact of cohabitation for the\nestimated change in inequality between 1969 and 1998. When we do so, the results change\nsomewhat from those obtained using our primary sample definitions (ignoring cohabitants) for the\nsame period. In particular, changing family structure makes a somewhat smaller contribution to\nrising income inequality in the lower half of the distribution when cohabitants are incorporated in\nthis fashion: rather than explaining nearly one-half of the increase in the 50-10 ratio between\n1969 and 1998, changing family structure (including cohabitants) explains just under 40 percent\nof the increased 50-10 ratio. More generally, the impact of changing family structure on overall\ndispersion is little affected by the incorporation of cohabitation, even in this upper-bound case.25\nWe also investigated whether the patterns identified for the entire 1969-1989 period were\nmore pronounced in the 1970s or the 1980s, by applying our analyses to the sub-periods of 1969-\n1979 and 1979-1989. The basic tabulations show that increases in family income inequality were\nmore pronounced during the 1980s than during the 1970s, especially for measures focused on the\n24 Although indirect estimates of cohabitation may be informative with respect to trends over\ntime, they are likely to introduce substantial error into the identification of living arrangements for\nindividual households.\n25 Our approximation also assumes that income is shared by cohabiting couples in the same\nway as married couples, which may not be true. Consistent with our finding of a relatively small\nimpact, Carlson and Danziger (1999) report that accounting for rising cohabitation only slightly\nreduces the measured increase in child poverty in the U.S. between 1969 and 1989.\n\n-26-\nupper portion of the distribution, such as the 90-50 ratio. On the other hand, our primary\nexplanatory factors—male earnings, female participation, and family structure—each explain a\nsmaller share of rising dispersion in the 1980s than in the 1970s, indicating a more prominent role\nfor residual factors in that decade. The exceptions are a larger offsetting impact of rising female\nparticipation on dispersion in the lower portion of the distribution in the 1980s, and a larger\nimpact of changing family structure on dispersion in the upper half of the distribution in the 1980s.\nTable 3 displays the exact results for the sub-period 1979-1989.\nReverse-Order Decomposition\nAs discussed in Section II, the contribution of the explanatory factors may depend on their\norder in the decomposition analysis, due to the possibility of joint causation in the distribution of\nmen’s earnings, female labor supply, and family structure. To address this possibility, Table 4\npresents results from the reverse-order decomposition analysis for the 1969-1989 period, for\nwhich we consider, in turn, the effects of the changing distributions of family characteristics,\nfamily structure, women’s labor force participation, and men’s earnings.26 The impact of the\nchanging distribution of family characteristics is increased in magnitude when we consider it first\nrather than last in the decomposition. Compared with the primary-order decomposition (Table 2),\nin which its effects on the dispersion of family equivalent income were small and of mixed sign,\nthe reverse-order decomposition in Table 4 indicates that the changing distribution of family\ncharacteristics increased each of the dispersion measures. The share increase in dispersion\n26 We do not present charts for this decomposition and the additional sub-period\ndecompositions because the visual representation of their effects is similar to that displayed for the\nprimary-order decomposition in Figure 5.\n\n-27-\nassociated with this factor ranges from 6 percent for the coefficient of variation to 27 percent for\nthe 95-5 ratio.\nThe larger impact of family characteristics in the reverse-order decomposition, however,\ndoes not substantially alter the impact of the other explanatory factors on dispersion. The effects\nof the changing distribution of men’s earnings when it is considered last in the decomposition\n(Table 4) are very similar to its effects when it is considered first (Table 2), with the exception of\na noticeably smaller impact on the mean logarithmic deviation in the former case. Compared with\nTable 2, in Table 4 the effects of family structure are somewhat smaller in the bottom portion of\nthe distribution but a bit larger in the upper portion, and the effects on the key summary measures\nare only slightly smaller in the reverse-order case. Rising female participation has a larger\nequalizing effect on the distribution of family equivalent income in the reverse-order case than it\ndid in the primary-order decomposition in Table 2. This larger equalizing effect is most evident in\nthe lower portion of the distribution, with the reduction in the 50-10 ratio due to female\nparticipation increasing from 3 percent of the total change (Table 2) to about 22 percent of the\ntotal change (Table 4). In addition, the reverse-order effects of rising female participation on the\ncoefficient of variation, the Gini and Theil coefficients, and the mean logarithmic deviation are\nequal to about 20-25 percent of the total change, a noticeably larger effect than in the primary-\norder decomposition. Overall, however, the residual portion left unexplained after accounting for\nour four factors is largely the same in the primary-order and reverse-order cases.\nThe effects of the explanatory factors on poverty are somewhat different in the reverse-\norder decomposition than in the primary-order decomposition. The changing distribution of\nfamily characteristics increases poverty a bit when considered first in the decomposition (Table 4),\n\n-28-\nwhereas it reduces poverty when considered last (Table 2). Among the other explanatory factors,\nthe poverty-increasing effect of changing family structure is smaller in the reverse-order case, the\npoverty-reducing effect of female labor supply is larger, and the poverty-increasing effect of\nmen’s earnings is larger. Although the impact of the changing distribution of men’s earnings is\nespecially large in the reverse-order case, the qualitative interpretation of the effects is basically\nunchanged.27\nChanges Between 1989 and 1998\nWe now turn our attention to a comparison of the years 1989 and 1998, which provides\nan updated view of changing family income inequality in the U.S., for a period which showed\nsome diminution in the trend towards rising inequality. Table 5 lists primary-order decomposition\nresults for changes in the distribution of family equivalent income between 1989 and 1998. The\npace of rising inequality slowed in the 1990s: the total changes in our dispersion statistics during\nthis period are positive but small compared to their increases during the preceding two decades\n(Table 2, first column). In assessing the factor contributions, we focus here on the actual\nexplained change rather than the share of the total change, for purposes of direct comparison with\nearlier periods. Leaving aside the effects of men’s earnings for the moment, the results in the\nthird and fourth columns indicate that rising female participation reduced inequality in the 1990s\nand changing family structure increased it (by amounts similar to those in the 1980s; see Table 3).\n27 The residual factors account for slightly different shares of the total change in the primary-\norder and reverse-order cases. Although the net impact of the conditionally weighted factors\ndoes not differ in the two cases, due to equivalence of the product of the primary-order weights\nwith the product of the reverse-order weights (see Appendix B), the full impact of the four\nexplanatory factors is affected by the ordering of the men’s earnings step.\n\n-29-\nIn contrast, the impact of the changing distribution of men’s earnings on rising inequality\nin family income was much smaller in the 1990s than it was in earlier decades. This includes a\nsubstantially reduced impact of men’s earnings on the relative well-being of low-income families,\nas measured by the small positive effect of this factor on the change in the 50-10 ratio and an\nactual negative effect (albeit quite small) on the poverty rate. Two potential explanations for the\neffect of changes in the distribution of men’s earnings on low-income families in the 1990s are\nchanges in the share of males with zero earnings and changes in the minimum wage. Auxiliary\ntabulations (available on request) indicate that the share of male household heads with zero\nearnings remained approximately constant between 1989 and 1998, so the first explanation is not\ncompelling. A more likely explanation is the increase in the U.S. federal minimum wage, which\nrose 16 percent between 1989 and 1998. Low hourly earnings for a male household head does\nnot necessarily imply that his family’s total income is low. However, the correspondence is likely\nto be close enough for the increase in the minimum wage to account for the reduced impact of\nmale wage inequality on low-income families during the 1990s.\nThe effects of our explanatory factors on poverty during the 1990s are displayed at the\nbottom of Table 5. The poverty rate was essentially unchanged between 1989 and 1998.\nHowever, changes in our explanatory factors account for changes in the poverty rate ranging from\nthree-tenths of a percentage point to just over a percentage point. Changes in family structure\nimply a full percentage point increase in poverty in the 1990s, which is almost as large as the\nfamily structure effect on poverty during each of the previous two decades (see Table 2, fourth\ncolumn, bottom row; the total contribution of 0.026 implies a contribution of half that, or 0.013,\nfor each of the two decades included in that table).\n\n-30-\nAmong the most interesting results in Table 5 is the change in poverty attributable to\nresidual factors (final column, bottom row). The residual effect was especially large in the 1990s,\nimplying an increase in the poverty rate of 1.2 percentage points. This contrasts directly with a\nnegative residual contribution between 1969 and 1989 (Tables 2 and 3), which is consistent with\nexpansion of government transfer programs between those two years (Moffitt 2000). In contrast,\nthe large positive residual contribution between 1989 and 1998 (Table 5) is consistent with a\nreduction in benefit receipt following the 1996 welfare reform law.\nIV. Conclusions\nOur assessment of the causes of rising inequality in U.S. family incomes reinforce some of\nthe results from past work but also includes several important points of departure. We focussed\nfirst on the 1969 to 1989 period, which corresponds roughly to the period of rising inequality\nexamined in much previous work. Our explanatory factors account for most of the increase in\ninequality and poverty during this period, with unobserved residual factors explaining an amount\nranging from none to about one-third of the total change in our key dispersion measures. The\nchanging distribution of men’s earnings had the largest impact on inequality and poverty,\nexplaining anywhere from about one-half to four-fifths of the increase. Changes in family\nstructure—most notably the increase in families characterized by single heads with children—also\nexplained a substantial share of the increase; these effects were concentrated among lower-income\nfamilies, especially those at risk of poverty.\nIn contrast, we found that the increase in women’s labor force participation between 1969\nand 1989 tended to offset increasing inequality and poverty over this period. Its counterfactual\n\n-31-\nimpact ranged as high as one-third of the actual change in dispersion. Importantly, its impact\nspread down the income distribution over time, with a larger impact in the lower half of the\ndistribution in the 1980s and 1990s than in the 1970s.\nThe equalizing effect of rising female participation might appear to conflict with previous\nfindings of a rising correlation between husbands’ and wives’ earnings (see Juhn and Murphy\n1997), which would tend to increase inequality. However, the impact of a rising correlation\nbetween husband and wife earnings depends on the precise income rank and related characteristics\nof families that generate this rising correlation. Our conditional weighting approach enables us to\nfocus on specific portions of the distribution and to control explicitly for the changing distribution\nof family characteristics. The results indicate that ceteris paribus, the increase in women’s labor\nforce participation, and its positive impact on family income, was concentrated among lower-\nincome families. Of note, using an approach that is similar to ours, Biewen (2001) also finds\nequalizing effects of women’s labor force participation on the East German income distribution in\nthe 1990s (in particular, declining female participation was associated with rising inequality in that\nsetting).\nWe also examined changes in family income inequality and poverty between 1989 and\n1998. The net change in inequality during this period was relatively small, largely due to changes\nin the distribution of men’s earnings which actually served to reduce inequality somewhat in the\nlower portion of the distribution of family income. However, changing family structure and rising\nlabor force participation by women continued to have substantial effects on income dispersion in\nthe 1990s, with rising female participation largely offsetting the inequality-increasing effects of\nchanging family structure.\n\n-32-\nExcept for the poverty rate, we focused on standard measures of inequality, such as the\ncoefficient of variation, the Gini and Theil coefficients, and percentile ratios, in order to enhance\nthe comparability of our analyses with existing analyses. However, because our approach relies\non complete density re-estimation, it could easily be adapted to provide more specific welfare\nanalysis. For example, between 1969 and 1989, real living standards (as measured by our pre-tax,\npost-transfer income variable) declined for families below the 18th percentile of the distribution of\nU.S. equivalent family income. Our technique could be used to assess the contribution of\nexplanatory factors to such changes in real living standards, thereby providing welfare-based\ninformation for policymakers interested in maintaining or improving living standards for specific\ntarget populations. Beyond that, extension of our approach to data from European countries\nmight be especially interesting; the patterns of changing inequality differ substantially across these\ncountries, as do the extent of changes in individual earnings and family behavior.\n\nReferences\nBiewen, Martin. 2001. “Measuring the Effects of Socio-Economic Variables on the Income\nDistribution: An Application to the East German Transition Process.” Review of\nEconomics and Statistics 83(1), pp. 185-202.\nBlackburn, McKinley, and David Bloom. 1989. “Income Inequality, Business Cycles, and Female\nLabor Supply.” In Research on Economic Inequality, Volume 1.

This survey is conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for the U.S. Bureau of\nLabor Statistics (BLS). In this Appendix, we describe changing treatment of high income values\nover time in the CPS, and we display the exact time-series tabulations underlying Figures 1, 3, and\n4 in the text.\nTo preserve respondent confidentiality, the Census Bureau truncates recorded income\nvalues at an upper limit (“topcode”). For the results reported in this paper, we did not adjust total\nfamily income for changes in the topcode prior to the 1996 survey, because past work and our\nexamination of the data suggested that year-to-year changes and the trend in inequality during this\nperiod are largely unaffected by changes in the nominal topcodes. However, beginning with the\n1996 survey (income year 1995), the Census Bureau recorded values for several topcoded\nvariables at the group means of the actual topcoded incomes rather than at the topcode itself. For\nconsistency with previous years of data, we recoded these variables to equal the topcode value\nand adjusted total family income accordingly in income years 1995-1998. If this adjustment is not\napplied, inequality measures that are sensitive to outliers, such as the coefficient of variation and\nthe Gini and Theil indices, indicate a substantial increase in inequality between income years 1994\nand 1995 that is maintained in later years as well. Appendix Table A1 lists the exact tabulations\nfor the yearly median and inequality series (which are displayed in Figure 1 in the text).\nThe change in topcoding procedure in the 1996 survey (income year 1995) also was\napplied to yearly earnings; we use these data for men in our sample. This change only affects the\nAppendix A (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-2-\ntop few percentiles of the distribution of men’s earnings, but it raises the coefficient of variation\nand the Gini and Theil measures substantially. As previous authors have done, we topcoded\nmen’s earnings in each year at a fixed percentile (the 97.5 percentile) in order to smooth out the\nimpact of changing topcodes on the dispersion measures (see for example Burtless 1999). The\nyearly median and inequality series for men’s earnings are displayed in Figure 3 in the text, and the\nexact underlying values are listed in Appendix Table A2. Our data on men’s earnings includes\nindividuals whose yearly earnings are zero. As a result, we did not calculate percentile dispersion\nmeasures for these data, because these measures are not uniformly defined (the 10th percentile\ngenerally is zero).\nThe change in the topcode procedure for income year 1995, along with our approach of\nimposing a uniform percentile topcode, may have held down our estimated growth in male\nearnings inequality in the last few years of our sample frame (1967-1998). However, the decline\nin male earnings inequality discussed in the text began in income year 1994, prior to use of the\nnew topcode procedure. In addition, measures of dispersion that are relatively insensitive to the\ntopcode, such as the 75-25 ratio, also exhibit a decline between 1993 and 1998.\nOur analysis also focuses on measures of female labor force participation and family\nstructure.

This discussion\nlargely follows that in DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996; DFL), with modification to our\nspecific setting.\nOur formal derivation picks up from equation (3) (Section II) in the text, generalizing to\nan arbitrary year “t”and excluding the term representing the distribution of men’s earnings (m ).\n89\nThe following equation expresses the distribution of family income Y in year t, conditional on\nfemale labor force participation L, family structure S, and other family and individual\ncharacteristics X:\n(B1)\nA distribution such as (B1) can be expressed as:\n(B2)\nIn this equation, f(Y) is the density of Y and can be seen as the integral of the density of income\nt\nY conditional on a set of individual and family attributes and on a date t, f(Y | L, S, X, t =t),\ny\nintegrated over the distribution of individual attributes at date t, F(L, S, X; t).\nWe are interested (for example) in the distribution of Y in 1989 if the distribution of L\nconditional on S and X is held to its 1969 structure:\n(B3)\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-2-\nUsing (B2), this distribution can be expressed as:\n(B4)\nwhere (cid:1) is a reweighting function to be defined momentarily. Note that except for (cid:1) , the\nL|S,X L|S,X\nbottom line of (B4) is identical to (B2) with t=89—i.e., the distribution we want to estimate is\nequal to the unconditional distribution of income in 1989 with observations reweighted by the\nfunction (cid:1) . If we can estimate (cid:1) , it is straightforward to incorporate it and obtain the\nL|S,X L|S,X\ncounterfactual distribution expressed in (B4) by using the observed univariate, unconditional\ndistribution of income in 1989.\nThe reweighting function for female labor force participation is defined (identically) as:\n(B5)\nThe first line identity in (B5) is obtained by substituting the expression on the right side into (B4)\nand canceling-out the denominator. Regarding the second equality in (B5), note first that L only\ntakes the values 0 or 1, so that:\n(B6)\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-3-\nThe second equality in (B5) follows from the recognition that one term on the right-hand side of\n(B6) will always equal zero.\nThe weight (cid:1) represents the change in the probability between 1969 and 1989 that a\nL|S,X\nfamily defined by characteristics (S,X) is observed to have a female head who works. The\nprobabilities in (B5) are easily recognized as expressions from standard binary dependent variable\nmodels. These conditional probabilities can be obtained by estimating a model such as a probit or\nlogit and then using the fitted values. We used the logit equation:28\n(B7)\nUsing data from year t, this estimated equation provides the structure of (L|S,X) in year t, where\nthe cumulative distribution of (cid:2) is a logistic function denoted by G. In (B7), H(X) is a vector\nfunction of X designed to capture the conditional relationship being modeled, and (cid:3) is a vector of\nestimated coefficients (in the simplest case, H is purely linear). The regressions are weighted\nusing the March supplement (individual) weights attached to female heads in the sample. This\nequation is estimated for both the 1969 and 1989 samples, and the coefficients are retained. We\nused the results to fit the probabilities in (B5) using the values of (S,X) from the 1989 sample,\ncombined with the 1969 coefficients for the numerator and the 1989 coefficients for the\n1 DFL used probit equations. We use logits, for consistency with our multinomial logit\nestimation of the family structure conditioning model, and because the underlying distribution\nfunction for the logit model has a closed-form representation that may be useful in other settings.\nUse of probits rather than logits for our labor supply and characteristics (X) conditioning steps\ndoes not alter the results noticeably.\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-4-\ndenominator. For families in which no female head is present, the reweighting function (cid:1) is\nL|S,X\nset to 1.\nFormation of the family structure weight is similar but requires extension to the case of\nmultiple outcome categories. In this case, we are interested in the distribution of family income if\nfemale labor force participation and family structure are both held to the levels and relationship\nwith X prevailing in 1969 :\n(B8)\nThe second line of this equation is identical to (B4) except for inclusion of the conditioning\nweight (cid:1) Thus, to estimate the distributional impact of holding family structure to its 1969\nS|X.\nlevels and relationship with X, we can use the 1989 distribution adjusted for female labor supply,\nwith a further reweighting specified by the family structure weight, (cid:1) .\nS|X\nTo derive the appropriate weight, assume that family structure S is characterized by C\nmutually exclusive, exhaustive categories, so that we can represent S as a single variable with C\npossible values (in our specific application, C=5). Then the family structure conditioning weight,\n(cid:1) , is defined as:\nS|X\n(B9)\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-5-\nIn this expression, I is an indicator variable that takes on the value 1 if S=c and 0 otherwise.\nc\nNote that the second line of (B9) is a generalization of the second line of (B5), with S|X replacing\nL|S,X; in (B5), C is set equal to two. For each observation in the data, I =1 for only a single\nc\nvalue of c, so the second line of (B9) is generated by the same property as illustrated in (B6). The\nexpression to the right of the summation sign in the bottom line of (B8) is the relative conditional\nprobability that a family with characteristics X falls into family type c in 1969 and 1989; each\nfamily in the 1989 data is upweighted or downweighted depending on whether it was more or less\nlikely to be observed as such in 1969 than in 1989. These conditional probabilities can be\nestimated using a model designed to handle unordered polychotomous dependent variables. We\nuse the multinomial logit model for these estimates, weighted by the family weight.\nThe final conditioning weight adjusts for the change in the underlying distribution of the\nfamily characteristics X. Using a derivation similar to that for the labor supply and family\nstructure weights, this weight is defined as:\n(B10)\nThe second equality is derived through a simple rearrangement of the conditional probabilities\nbased on Bayes’ Law. This weighting function represents the relative probability of observing a\nfamily with characteristics X in the 1969 versus the 1989 sample, normalized by the unconditional\nprobabilities of being in either sample.\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-6-\nThe function (cid:1) is estimated by pooling the 1969 and 1989 data sets, and then estimating\nX\na binary dependent variable model for a dummy variable indicating the sample from which the\nobservation is obtained. The conditional probabilities Pr(t =t|X) are obtained by forming fitted\nX\nprobabilities for families in the 1989 sample, based on their X values. As with the labor force\nparticipation weights, we estimate logit equations to form the conditional probabilities. The\nunconditional probabilities, Pr(t =t), are the weighted shares of the 1969 and 1989 samples in the\nX\npooled sample.\nAs described in Section II in the paper, we combined the estimated weights in sequence to\nproduce the decomposition results, after adjusting the data for changes in the distribution of male\nearnings (see Appendix C). Due to the possibility of general equilibrium or endogenous\nrelationships between male earnings, family structure, and female labor force participation, we\nalso reversed the order of the decomposition. The representation of the underlying general\ndistribution in reverse conditioning sequence is:\n(B11)\nWe consider the associated conditioning weights from right to left in this equation. First,\nusing steps similar to those used to derive (cid:1) in (B8) above, we have:\nX\n(B12)\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-7-\nThen the estimated weight (cid:1) (L) is a simple function of the female labor force participation rate\nL\n(estimated using the individual sampling weights) in both years. In particular, observations in the\n1989 data in which the female head participates are downweighted by the proportional increase\nbetween 1969 and 1989 in the percentage of female heads who participate; observations in the\n1989 data in which the female head does not participate are upweighted by the proportional\ndecrease in the percentage of female heads who do not participate. For families in which no\nfemale head is present, the reweighting function (cid:1) is set to 1.\nL\nIn the reverse-order decomposition, the family structure weight is conditioned on female\nparticipation. Using a derivation similar to (B9), we have:\n(B13)\nThe probabilities in (B13) can be estimated through simple cross-tabulation of the family structure\nand female labor force participation outcomes. For both years, we calculated the percentage of\nobservations that fall into each of the 10 categories defined by the five family structure categories\nand two possible values (0 and 1) for the labor force participation variable. Observations falling\ninto a particular cell in the 1989 data are upweighted or downweighted by the proportional\nchange in the percentage share of that cell between 1969 and 1989. For consistency between the\nprimary-order and reverse-order decompositions in the treatment of observations, we included\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-8-\nfamilies in which no female head is present with families in which the female head did not\nparticipate.\nFinally, we estimated the X weight, (cid:1) (X,S,L), using our prior estimates of the\nX|S,L\nprimary-order weights and the two reverse-order weights described above. In particular, because\n(cid:0) (cid:0) (cid:0) (cid:0)\nF(X,S,L)=F(X|S,L) F(S|L) F(L)=F(L|S,X) F(S|X) F(X), the product of the complete set of\nreverse-order weights is equal to the product of the complete set of primary-order weights, and\nwe can rearrange to obtain (cid:1) :\nX|S,L\n(B14)\nWe used this equality to estimate (cid:1)^ for our sample. One further implication of this equality is\nX|S,L\nequivalence of the net effect of the three conditioning factors in the primary-order and reverse-\norder cases. However, inclusion of the male earnings step in our exact setting produces slight\ndifferences across the two cases in the net impact of the explanatory factors.\nAppendix B (Daly and Valletta)\n\nAppendix C— Adjusting for the Distribution of Men’s Earnings\nIn this appendix, we provide a detailed description of our adjustment for the changing\ndistribution of men’s earnings. This procedure is described heuristically in the text. We specify\nthe adjustment more precisely here, using 1969 and 1989 as our example years. The basic idea is\nto adjust 1989 family income by subtracting out each male head’s 1989 yearly earnings and adding\nback the yearly earnings from the median of the 1969 percentile group (quantile) that is at the\nsame rank as the 1989 quantile to which that male belonged.\nLet Mt denote (wage and salary) earnings of male family head j in year t. Assume that the\nj\nobservations in each year of data are rank ordered from lowest to highest earnings for men. We\ndivide the men’s earnings data into Q equally sized quantiles, with the size of each quantile\ndefined by the sum of the individual sampling weights for males in the quantile.1 Let Mt denote\nj(q)\nthe median earnings in the quantile (q) to which male j belonged in year t. To implement the\nadjustment, we calculated median earnings by quantile for the observation year and for an earlier\nyear that serves as the men’s earnings counterfactual.\nConsider adjustment of the 1989 distribution of total family income (T89) for families with\nmale heads present based on substitution of the quantile median from the 1989 distribution of\nmen’s earnings with the appropriate quantile median from the 1969 distribution of men’s\n1 We sorted the earnings observations by descending values of the individual weight. This is\nequivalent to basing the procedure on writing a new data set with the sampling weights treated as\nfrequency weights, so that each observation on men’s earnings is expanded to the number of\nobservations represented by its sampling weight. The quantile cut points exhibit minor variation\ndepending on how the weights are treated in the sorting process.\nAppendix C (Daly and Valletta)\n\n-2-\nearnings.2 In this case, our adjusted measure of total family income (with individual identifier j\nsuppressed) is:\n(C1)\nFor families in which no male head is present, no adjustment is applied. For the application in this\npaper, we set the number of quantiles Q to 100, which results in a distribution of earnings with\nmidpoint and dispersion measures that are virtually identical to the original distribution. We\nverified that we obtain nearly identical results when we set Q equal to 500.\nApplying the same equivalence adjustment as applied to unadjusted total family income\n(equation 1 in the text) produces our measure of equivalent family income adjusted for the\nchanging dispersion of men’s earnings:\n(C2)\nwhere F=family size and (cid:4)=0.5.\n2We use the quantile median from the 1989 male earnings distribution, rather than the actual\n1989 value of male earnings, to avoid an artificial reduction in family income inequality that might\noccur because inequality calculated at quantile midpoints is smaller than in the full distribution.\nWe thank an anonymous referee for suggesting this approach.\nAppendix C (Daly and Valletta)",

Some dismiss these results as fundamentally flawed because they come from a self-\nreported work limitation-based disability population that captures neither the actual population\nwith disabilities nor its employment trends. In this paper, we examine the merits of these\ncriticisms. We first consider some of the difficulties of defining and consistently measuring the\npopulation with disabilities. We then discuss how these measurement difficulties potentially bias\nempirical estimates of the prevalence of disability and of the employment behavior of those with\ndisabilities. Having provided a context for our analysis, we use data from the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS) to compare the prevalence and employment rates across two empirical\npopulations of those with disabilities: one defined by self-reported impairments and one defined by\nself-reported work limitations. We find that although traditional work limitation-based definitions\nunderestimate the size of the broader population with health impairments, the employment trends\nin the populations defined by work limitations and impairments are not significantly different from\none another over the 1980s and 1990s. We then show that the trends in employment observed for\nthe NHIS population defined by self-reported work limitations are statistically similar to those\nfound in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Based on this analysis, we argue that nationally\nrepresentative employment-based data sets like the CPS can be used to monitor the employment\ntrends of those with disabilities over the past two decades.\n\nThe Employment of Working-Age People with Disabilities in the 1980s and 1990s\nWhat Current Data Can and Cannot Tell Us\nUsing data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a new and highly controversial\nliterature argues that the employment of working-age people with disabilities fell dramatically\nrelative to the rest of the working-age population in the 1990s. (See especially: Acemoglu and\nAngrist, forthcoming; Autor and Duggan, 2001; Bound and Waidmann, 2000; Burkhauser, Daly\nand Houtenville, 2001; DeLeire, 2000.) While many researchers debate the causes for this\ndecline, some dismiss these results altogether, arguing that the work limitation-based disability\nquestions available in the CPS are fundamentally flawed and capture neither the actual population\nwith disabilities (Hale, 2001) nor its employment trends (Kaye, 2001; Kirchner, 1996; Kruse and\nSchur, 2000; McNeil, 2000).1\nThe basis for these criticisms are long-standing concerns regarding the accuracy and\nconsistency of self-reported measures of health and work limitation (see Bound and Burkhauser,\n1999 and Moore, 2001 for reviews of this literature). For one, self-evaluated health is a\nsubjective measure that may not be comparable across respondents or over time (Kirchner,\n1996).2 Second, these responses may not be independent of the observed variables one wants to\n1As we will discuss later, hypotheses for the decline include unintended consequences of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (Acemoglu and Angrist, forthcoming; DeLiere, 2000), increases in\ndisability benefit rolls (Autor and Duggan, 2001, Bound and Waidmann; 2000), and increased severity of\nhealth impairments (Kaye, 2001).\n2Kirchner argues that self-perception within the broader population with disabilities changed with\nthe passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, making people with impairments less likely to describe\nthemselves as having a work-limiting condition if they were working. Below, we test whether such changes\nin reporting behavior are reflected in changes in the relationship between the populations with disabilities\ndefined by self-reported impairments and self-reported work limitations. We also test for whether changes\nin the composition of the population reporting work limitations over time is driving the employment trends\nfound in the CPS.\n-1-\n\nexplain, such as employment status (Chirikos and Nestel 1984; Chirikos 1995). Third, since\nsociety may stigmatize those who are able to work but who want to retire before the “normal”\nretirement age, reasonably healthy individuals who wish to exit the labor force “prematurely” may\nuse poor health as their excuse (Parsons 1980a,b, 1982; Bazzoli, 1985). Finally, since federal\ndisability transfer benefits are available only to those judged unable to perform any substantial\ngainful activity, individuals with a health problem may have a financial incentive to identify\nthemselves as incapable of work because of their health (Waidmann, et al. 1995). These problems\nof misclassification can bias estimates of the true number of persons with disabilities and their\nbehavior. More importantly, changes in this mismeasurement over time can bias our estimates of\nthe trends in outcomes (e.g., employment) among those with disabilities.\nWhile the potential for bias inherent in measures of disability has led some researchers\n(Myers, 1982, 1983; Hale, 2001) to conclude that no useful information can be gained from such\ndata, we argue that this statement is too broad. In this paper, we offer basic empirical tests of\nthese assertions. Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) we examine the\nextent to which self-reported work limitation-based measures misestimate the population of\nindividuals with disabilities. We then investigate whether mismeasurement of the “true”\npopulation with disabilities biases estimates of employment, a key outcome variable for those with\ndisabilities. Finally, since the debate over what, if anything, should be done to reverse the\ndownward trend in employment among men and women with disabilities during the 1990s\n-2-\n\ncurrently is focused on the validity of the CPS data, we compare employment outcomes from the\nNHIS with those from the CPS.3\nWe find that self-reported work limitation-based data underestimate the size of the broad\nworking-age population with serious impairments and disproportionately capture those who are\nless likely to be employed in the impaired population. We then show that while there are\nsignificant differences in the size of the population with disabilities captured by the impairment\nand work-limitation questions, the employment trends in the broader impaired population from\nthe NHIS and in the work-limited populations in the NHIS and CPS are not significantly different\nfrom one another over the 1980s and 1990s. Based on these data, we argue that unlike the 1980s\nwhen the employment trends of both those with and without disabilities were procyclical, in the\n1990s, working-age people with disabilities experienced substantial declines in their employment\nrates even during an extended period of economic growth.\nDefining and Measuring the Population with Disabilities\nDefinitions of Disability\nEvaluation of the working-age population with disabilities must start with a definition of\nthat population. Unfortunately, unlike age, race, or gender, which are relatively straightforward\nand easily determined demographic characteristics, disability has proven to be a far more\n3The importance of this issue is apparent in a recent research summary by Hale (2001). Hale\nargues that because the CPS is not designed to measure a specific definition of disability, the burden of\nproof of its reasonableness is on those who use it. He then writes, “To proceed as though the data are valid\nmeasures of disabilities turns a data issue into a policy issue.”\n-3-\n\ncontroversial concept to define and measure.4 Mashaw and Reno (1996) document over twenty\ndefinitions of disability used for the purposes of entitlement to public or private income transfers,\ngovernment services, or statistical analysis, and argue that the appropriateness of any definition of\ndisability depends on the purpose for which it is used.\nThe variation in disability definitions is apparent across the two main federal policy\ninitiatives to protect those with disabilities. In the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n(ADA), disability is defined very broadly as a physical or mental impairment that substantially\nlimits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as\nhaving such an impairment.5 In contrast, the disability definition used by the Social Security\nAdministration to determine eligibility for both Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits is quite narrow. In both SSDI and SSI, benefits are\nlimited to those who are unable to perform \"any substantial gainful activity\" as the result of a\nspecific set of medical listings (a combination of pathology and functional measures) or a\ncombination of specific medical listings and vocational characteristics that predict future work\ncapacity. Clearly, the ADA definition is meant to ensure that a much larger group of people is\n4While there is little controversy over the objective standards for measuring age, the justification\nfor using age as a standard for ability to work and for \"age-based\" welfare benefits is more controversial.\nFor instance, a literature exists which argues that categorical age is not a useful measure of ability to work.\n(See Library of Congress, 1998.) In addition, the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which\nprovides protection against age discrimination, parallels the Americans with Disabilities Act, which\nprovides protection against discrimination based on disability. But if age is not a useful measure for\ndetermining ability to work, then should the Supplemental Security Income program (SSI) guarantee a\nminimum safety net on income to all those aged 65 and over, but not those younger persons in similar\neconomic circumstances? The controversy surrounding these issues suggests that social concepts of the\nrights and responsibilities of both older persons and persons with disabilities with respect to work have\nbeen undergoing major revisions over the last few decades. (See Daly and Burkhauser, forthcoming, for a\nfuller discussion of the underlying policy issues related to age or disability status as categorical standards\nfor SSI eligibility.)\n5LaPlante (1991) provides a useful discussion of alternative definitions that can be used to estimate\nthis population.\n-4-\n\nguaranteed access to work than is entitled to transfer income benefits by the Social Security\nAdministration definition if they do not work.\nAlthough there is no universal agreement on the most appropriate definition of the\npopulation with disabilities, it is possible to place the various definitions used in a common\nconceptual framework. The most frequently applied model of disability comes from Nagi (1965,\n1969, 1991). In the Nagi model, disability is a dynamic process in which an individual’s pathology\ninteracts with the socioeconomic environment.6 The dynamic nature of the disability process is\nrepresented by the movement through three stages: pathology, impairment, and disability. The\nfirst stage, pathology, is the presence of a physical or mental condition that interrupts the\nphysical or mental process of the human body. An example is deafness. This leads to the second\nstage, impairment, which Nagi defines as a physiological, anatomical, or mental loss or\nabnormality that limits a person’s capacity to function. For example, deafness limits the ability to\ninterpret sound. The final stage, disability, is an inability to perform or a limitation in\nperforming roles and tasks that are socially expected. For example, a person with deafness is\nunable to use the telephone. Under the Nagi model, those with a pathology that causes a physical\nor mental impairment that subsequently limits one or more life activities—such as work—but who\nnevertheless work would not be considered to have a work disability. (This is the case whether\n6The World Health Organization (WHO) has a model of disability very similar to that of Nagi.\nThe key to both of these definitions is the recognition that individuals move from the presence of a health\ncondition to a point where it begins to impinge on activities that are socially expected of them and that this\nmovement is related to the environment in which individuals live. See Jette and Badley (2000) for an\nexcellent comparison of the Nagi and WHO models.\n-5-\n\nwork was possible though changes in the work environment, access to rehabilitation, or individual\nadaptability.)7\nProblems with Measurement\nMost of the new work on the employment of people with disabilities comes from the\neconomics literature where researchers’ definitions of disability frequently are functions of already\navailable data rather than original data collection or clinical experience. In most surveys of\nemployment and household income, the data available on health come from a small set of\nquestions that ask respondents to assess whether their health limits the kind or amount of work\nthey can perform. As noted earlier, researchers have been cautious in using such global self-\nreported health measures for a number of reasons. Most recently, Hale (2001) has argued that\nself-reported work limitation questions from the CPS and other general employment-focused data\nsets are so poor that new variables must be added to the CPS if we are to make any statements\nabout the outcomes of those with disabilities.8\nStill, numerous researchers have shown that self-reported measures of work limitations are\nhighly correlated with other more objective assessments of health and with clinical measures of\ndisability (see Bound and Burkhauser (1999) for a review of this literature). Based on these\nfindings and evidence presented here and elsewhere (Burkhauser and Daly, 1996), we argue that\nsuch data are capable of identifying people with serious functional limitations and accurately\ntracking trends in their employment outcomes.\n7For example, a person with deafness who is accommodated at the workplace with an TTY\nmachine that permits him or her to use the telephone.\n8Hale provides no empirical evidence for this claim and suggests no alternative measures for the\nsurvey.\n-6-\n\nTracking the Population with Disabilities Using National Survey Data\nThe CPS and NHIS Data\nThe CPS annually surveys approximately 50,000 United States households (about 150,000\nnon-institutionalized civilians) and is the main source of official employment and income statistics\nin the United States. In 1981 the March Demographic Supplement of the CPS began to ask a\nquestion about work limitations: \"Does anyone in this household have a health problem or\ndisability which prevents them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can\ndo? [If so,] who is that? (Anyone else?)\" This type of question is consistent with the Nagi\nframework of disability developing from a pathology that limits a social activity—work—but may\nsystematically miss people with pathologies and impairments who are nevertheless working and\ndo not consider themselves to be work-limited. (See the Appendix Table 1A for a detailed\ndescription of the CPS data and the variables used in our analysis.)\nAlthough the CPS is a cross-sectional survey, it does interview respondents over the\ncourse of a year. Specifically, the CPS follows housing units over a four month period and then\nreturns eight months later to follow them for another four months. This allows for matching of\nhousing units and multi-period analysis. A sub-sample of the households administered the March\nSupplement are asked the work limitation question in two consecutive years (March to March).\nWe use these individuals to construct a “matched” CPS sample and define those with work\nlimitation-based disabilities as those who respond positively to the question in March of two\nconsecutive years. The two-period measure of work limitations-based disability should minimize\nthe risks of temporary illnesses and injuries being reported as long-lasting work limitations, a\n-7-\n\nconcern raised by critics such as Hale (2001). We use the CPS matched sample to check the\nrobustness of the regular CPS cross-sectional results based on single-period disability.\nThe major advantage of the CPS is that its design and size allow for state-level estimates\nand that its work limitation question has been consistently asked since 1981.9 The CPS was used\nby Acemoglu and Angrist, forthcoming, Autor and Duggan, 2001; Bound and Waidmann, 2000,\nand Burkhauser, Daly and Houtenville, 2001 for this latter reason.\nThe NHIS is an annual cross-sectional survey of approximately 100,000 non-\ninstitutionalized civilians conducted by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nUseful and comparable data are available from 1983 through 1996; the NHIS was changed\nsubstantially in 1997, making time-series comparisons after 1996 questionable. Like the CPS\ndata, the NHIS contains a standard work limitations question: \"Does any impairment or health\nproblem now keep [person] from working at a job or business? Is [person] limited in the kind or\n9The U.S. Bureau of Census collects two other data sets that can be used to measure the population\nwith disabilities: Decennial Census Long-Form and The Survey of Income and Program Participation\n(SIPP). In the 1990 Decennial Census Long-Form, the information on disability also is limited to a single\nwork limitations question: “Does this person have a physical, mental or other health condition that has\nlasted for 6 or more months and which—Limits the kind or amount of work this person can do at a job?\n(yes/no) Prevents this person from working at a job? (yes/no)” The 2000 Census Long Form has a much\nimproved series of questions focusing on disability. They are as follows: \"16. Does this person have any of\nthe following long-lasting conditions: a. Blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment?\n(yes/no) b. A condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking,\nclimbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying? (yes/no) 17. Because of a physical, mental, or emotional\ncondition lasting 6 months or more, does this person have any difficulty in doing any of the following\nactivities: a. Learning, remembering, or concentrating? (yes/no) b. Dressing, bathing, or getting around\ninside the home? (yes/no) c. (Answer if this person is 16 years old or over.) Going outside the home alone\nto shop or visit a doctor’s office? (yes/no) d. (Answer if this person is 16 years old or over.) Working at a\njob or business? (yes/no).\" These data were not released at the time we performed our analysis.\nThe Census Bureau also conducts the Survey of Income and Program Participation, a longitudinal\nsurvey of about approximately 14,000 to 36,700 households. The first easily usable panel began in 1988.\nThe same people are followed every month over a period of about two and one-half years. New samples\nbegin every year or so thereafter. The SIPP allows for dynamic analysis of employment and program\nparticipation. The SIPP also contains information on limitations of daily activities, work limitation (similar\nto the CPS question), and a limited set of specific pathology and impairment categories. DeLeire (2000)\nand Kruse and Schur (2000) use these data in their work on this topic. See Burkhauser, Houtenville, and\nWittenburg (2001) for a comparison of disability trends in the CPS, NHIS, and SIPP.\n-8-\n\namount of work [person] can do because of any impairment?\" A person with an affirmative\nresponse to either question is considered to have a work limitation. NHIS respondents are asked\nthis question early in the survey.\nIn addition, the NHIS contains detailed impairment-specific information (e.g., \"deaf in\nboth ears,\" \"blind in both eyes,\" etc.) on a subset of survey respondents.10 Individuals in this\nNHIS sub-sample are asked directly about specific impairments. This allows us to capture a\nrandom sample of the population with a given set of impairments including those who, despite\ntheir impairment, report that they do not have a work limitation.11 (See the Appendix Table 1A\nfor a detailed description of the NHIS data and the variables used in our analysis.)\nConceptual Relationships among Tractable Disability Populations\nFigure 1 illustrates how we conceptualize the interrelationships of the disability\npopulations captured by the questions in the CPS and NHIS data. The square represents the\nentire working-age population. The largest circle within the square represents the largest subset\nof working-age people with disabilities captured in our data—those who report having a\n10To gather more detailed responses on specific health pathologies and impairments, the NHIS\ndivides respondents into six randomly selected groups. Each group is assigned one of six supplemental\nsurveys known as Condition Lists. Five of the six Condition Lists focus on pathologies; Condition List #2\nfocuses on impairments. We use the one-sixth sub-sample of individuals administered Condition List #2\nfor all estimates regarding impairments.\n11The National Health Interview Survey on Disability 1994-1995 (NHIS-D) represents a major\neffort by the federal government to capture the population with disabilities. The NHIS-D provides data on\na set of pathologies, impairments, and activity limitations. A major advantage of the NHIS-D is that it\ncontains extensive information on perceived barriers to work (e.g., lack of transportation) and work\nsupports (e.g., accommodations). Loprest and Maag (2001) provide useful analysis of the existence of\nbarrier to work and work support in broadly defined populations with disabilities. However, small sample\nsizes within impairment sub-groups limit the specificity of the pathology/impairment categories, and unlike\nthe NHIS, a large number of years cannot be pooled together to boost sample sizes. See Kirchner,\nSchmeidler and Todorov (1999) for an excellent example of a pathology/impairment specific employment\nstudy using the NHIS-D. They perform a detailed analysis of the health and employment experience of\nthose reporting serious visual impairments. See the web site of the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention for more information on the NHIS-D.\n-9-\n\npathology/impairment. Each wedge represents people with a specific impairment. The NHIS\npathology/impairment data best captures this population.12 This population is most closely\nrepresentative of the ADA-eligible population, in that it includes both those who are working\ndespite their impairments and may not report a work limitation as well as those whose\nimpairments and social environment lead them to report a work limitation.13\nThe second largest circle represents people with impairments who report a work\nlimitation, also divided into impairment-specific wedges. This is the group captured by the\ngeneral work limitation questions in the CPS and NHIS data and the one most closely related to\nthe Nagi conceptualization of work disability.14 The smallest circle represents those whose work\nlimitation is so severe that they apply for SSI or SSDI. This is only a small proportion of the\nlarger population with disabilities. (See Burkhauser, Daly, and Houtenville, 2001 for estimates of\nthe size and characteristics of the smaller two circles using CPS data.)\nEmpirical Relationships among Tractable Disability Populations\nDifferences in Levels Across Measures. To begin to assess whether the population with\ndisabilities defined by the self-reported work limitation question is a reasonable proxy for the\npopulation with significant impairments, we focus on the relationship between the outermost and\nmiddle circles in Figure 1. We first examine the extent to which individuals with a specific\n12Although not represented in Figure 1, these wedges may overlap because individuals can have\nmore than one impairment. The NHIS does not ask a global question on impairment, so we are not able to\ncapture the entire population with impairments. We are able to capture a subset of the impairment wedges\npictured in Figure 1.\n13There is no global question in the NHIS, SIPP, or CPS that attempts to capture all those who\nhave impairments or more broadly who would be considered to have a “disability” under the ADA.\n14It also is the group captured by other nationally representative data sets focused on employment\nand economic well-being (e.g., SIPP, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the National Longitudinal\nSurvey.)\n-10-\n\npathology/impairment report a work limitation. We then investigate the employment behavior of\nthose with a pathology/impairment who do and do not report a work limitation. Since the CPS\ndoes not contain data on impairments, our comparisons are based solely on data from the NHIS.\nAs mentioned earlier, in the NHIS survey a subset of respondents are asked about specific health\nimpairments and then about whether they have a work limitation. We use a pooled sample of\nthese individuals (1983-1996) to conduct the analysis reported in Tables 1 and 2.15 (See\nHoutenville 2001 for a detailed description of the NHIS data used in our analysis.)\nTable 1 shows the prevalence of self-reported work limitations among working-age men\nand women with various impairments. The first cell in column one indicates the percentage of\nmen and women who report having any of the impairments in the list. The remaining cells in\ncolumn one show the percentage of men and women who say they have that specific impairment.\nColumns two and three show the percentage of those with the listed impairment(s) who report\nhaving (column 2) or not having (column 3) a work limitation.\nIn general, Table 1 supports the notion that the population within the outermost circle of\nFigure 1 is substantially understated if we use the work limitation question in the NHIS to\ndescribe it. While the severity of the impairment undoubtedly explains much of the variance in\nwork limitations in columns 2 and 3, it does not explain all of it. For example, among those who\nreport being deaf in both ears or blind in both eyes—impairments many would expect to be work\nlimiting—only 38 (69) percent, respectively, also report being “unable to work or to be limited in\nthe kind or amount of work they do.” This suggests that the self-report of a work limitation may\n15The NHIS comparisons are based on a representative one-sixth sub-sample of respondents for the\nyears 1983-1996. Because the prevalence of specific impairments is very low in any given year, we must\npool the NHIS data over a number of years to establish a sample size sufficient for analysis.\n-11-\n\nbe influenced by the work environment, rehabilitation opportunities, or the inner capacity of\nindividuals to overcome both their impairments and the barriers to work.\nAlthough Table 1 clearly shows that using a work limitation-based measure of disability\nwill underestimate the size of the population with significant impairments, it is not clear whether\nthis underestimate biases measures of employment for those with disabilities. To investigate this,\nwe examine the employment rates of those with impairments. Table 2, column one reports the\nemployment rates of men and women who say they have one of the impairments on the list.\nColumns two and three show the employment rates of those with an impairment who report\nhaving (column 2) or not having a work limitation (column 3). As illustrated in the first row,\ncontrolling for having an impairment, those who say they are not work limited are much more\nlikely to be employed (employment rate of 83.4%) than those who say they are work limited\n(employment rate of 41.5%). Returning to the specific examples of those deaf in both ears and\nblind in both eyes, those who report these impairments but report no work limitation are 2.08\n(3.98) times more likely (ratio of column 2 to column 3), respectively, to be employed than such\npersons who do report a work limitation. This suggests that responses to the standard work\nlimitation questions, available in most nationally representative data sets, are greatly affected by\nthe employment experiences of respondents. Specifically, the data from the NHIS indicate that\nusing a work limitation question to define the population with disabilities systematically excludes\nindividuals with significant impairments who are sufficiently integrated into the workforce that\nthey do not report a work limitation.\nDifferences in Trends across Measures. Having established that there are significant and\nsystematic differences in population and employment levels of those self-reporting impairments\n-12-\n\nand work limitations we now turn to an examination of the trends in these variables. Figure 2\ncompares the trends in the prevalence of impairments and the prevalence of work limitations in\nthe NHIS between 1983 and 1996 for both men and women. (See Appendix Table 2A for the\ncomplete set of prevalence rates underlying Figure 2). Note that in this analysis we focus on two\nseparately identified populations. The first is the population of working-age men and women who\nreport having any of the impairments listed in Table 1. The second is the group of working-age\nindividuals self-reporting a work limitation; these individuals may or may not report a specific\nimpairment.16\nFigure 2 shows that although the trends in impairment- and work limitation-based\ndisability prevalence in the NHIS exhibit some of the same movements, they do not always follow\neach other. For example, in the 1990s the prevalence of impairments was falling while the\nprevalence of work limitations remained relatively stable. To test whether these differences are\nsignificant we regress disability prevalence rates (pooled sample across measures) on a dummy\nvariable, indicating whether the prevalence estimate comes from the impairment or work\nlimitations question, a higher-order polynomial time-trend, and the interactions of the time trend\nand the indicator variables. We then test the joint significance of the interaction terms using an F-\ntest (see Burkhauser, Houtenville, and Nargis (2001) for a more complete description of our test\nmethodology). Based on this method, we find no significant differences between the time-trends\nin disability prevalence for men. However, we fail to accept the hypothesis that the trends for\n16The sample universe for the impairment trends is those individuals administered Condition List\n#2 in the NHIS. The sample universe for the work limitations trends is the full NHIS sample.\n-13-\n\nwomen are the same across the two measures. (See Appendix Table 3A for the results of these\ntests.)\nWhat should we make of these findings? First, based on our statistical analysis, we cannot\nsay the trends in prevalence of impairments and work limitations for men are different, suggesting\nthat while the work limitation questions cannot capture the level of impairment-based disability, it\ndoes track the trend over time. The same cannot be said for women. However, as Figure 2\nshows, the divergence in the two measures goes in a direction opposite the one critics of work-\nlimitations measures worry about (for example, Kirchner, 1996). Namely, during the 1990s, the\nprevalence of work limitation-based disability moved closer to the prevalence of impairment-\nbased disability, suggesting that the work limitation-based measures may be capturing a greater,\nrather than a smaller, share of the population with significant impairments.17\nAs a final test for trend differences in our two NHIS disability populations, Figure 3\ncompares the employment rates of those self-reporting impairments with those reporting a work\nlimitation over the period 1983-1996. (See Appendix Table 4A for a complete set of the\nemployment rates underlying Figure 3.) Again, the employment patterns across the two measures\nmirror each other, although with notable divergences from year-to-year. Most importantly for the\ncurrent debate, the decline in employment among men and women during the 1990s is observed in\nboth the impaired and the work-limited disability populations. Testing for differences in\nemployment trends between the two populations we find no significant differences in their\nestimated trends (see Appendix Table 3A for the results of these tests).\n17Ideally, we would like to directly test this hypothesis using the detailed NHIS data in Tables 1\nand 2. However, small sample sizes prohibit such detailed analysis over time.

In this section we move away from comparisons\nof prevalence and employment of those with disabilities across measures and consider trends in\nthese variables across data sets. Figure 4 compares trends in the work limitation-based disability\nprevalence among working-age men and women in the CPS, the matched CPS sample, and the\nNHIS.18 (See Appendix Table 5A for the complete set of prevalence rates underlying Figure 4.)\nAs the figure shows, the NHIS work limitation-based prevalence estimates are higher than those\nfrom the CPS and the CPS-matched sample for men and women in every year.19 The average\nannual prevalence of work limitation-based disability (1983-1996) among men was 8.1 percent in\nthe CPS-based estimates and 10.3 percent in the NHIS. The average annual prevalence of\ndisability among women over the same period was 7.4 percent in the CPS and 10.4 percent in the\nNHIS. The prevalence rates for the CPS-matched sample were smaller than for the CPS. These\ndifferences are statistically significant in most years of our study.20\nAgain, we also are interested in the extent to which the trends in prevalence observed in\nthe CPS are similar to those observed in the NHIS. Using the same test procedure applied earlier,\nwe find significant differences between the trends in the work limitations-based prevalence of\ndisability in the NHIS and the two CPS samples. Of the four comparisons, the trends are only the\n18The NHIS sample universe is all respondents.\n19One potential explanation for the level of differences in self-reported work limitations in the\nNHIS and CPS is the location of the work-limitation question in the two surveys. In the CPS, the work-\nlimitation question is asked in a section of the survey focusing on employment; in the NHIS it is asked as\npart of the basic health and demographic \"core\" questionnaire. To the extent that individuals already\nfocused on questions about their health would be more apt to disclose a work-limitation , the NHIS would\npick up a higher rate of reported disability. Likewise, to the extent that individuals who are not in the labor\nforce for other reasons do not consider themselves work-limited, the question placement in the NHIS may\nelicit a greater response.\n20The statistical tests performed were t-tests of the differences in two proportions.\n-15-\n\nsame for men in the NHIS and CPS-matched sample. (See Appendix Table 6A for the results of\nthese tests.)\nAlthough the prevalence trends clearly are different across the two data sets, we primarily\nare interested in whether the CPS can be used to follow employment trends for those with\ndisabilities. Figure 5 shows employment rates for men and women with work limitation-based\ndisabilities in the NHIS, CPS, and CPS-matched sample. (See Appendix Table 7A for the\ncomplete set of employment rates underlying Figure 5.) As the figure shows, there is a much\ncloser relationship between employment rates for those with disabilities than was true for the\nprevalence rates. Our statistical tests confirm this. We find no significant differences in the\nemployment trends (1983-1996) for the work limitations-based populations of men and women\nwith disabilities in the NHIS and two CPS samples (see Appendix Table 6A for the results of\nthese tests).\nThus, despite significant differences in the level of self-reported work limitations between\nthe two data sets, the trends in employment found in the two CPS work limitation-based disability\npopulations are not significantly different from those found in the NHIS work limitation-based\ndisability population.\nWhat Do Current Data Tell Us?\nTrends in Employment among Those with Disabilities in the 1980s and 1990s\nWe now focus on the major issue in the new literature on the employment of people with\ndisabilities. Table 3 shows the sensitivity of employment rates to economic fluctuations over the\n-16-\n\npast twenty years for working-age men and women with and without disabilities.21, 22 As the table\nshows, during the 1980s the employment of men with and without disabilities was procyclical,\nfalling with recession and rising with recovery. In 1980, the first year the economy began to slow,\nemployment rates of men with and without disabilities were relatively high—42.6 percent and\n96.7 percent, respectively. Employment for men with and without disabilities declined as the\neconomy moved through a recession, declining by about 2 percent for each group. Economic\nrecovery once again boosted employment rates among men, particularly those with disabilities.\nBetween 1982 and 1989, the employment rate among men with disabilities rose 5.1 percent,\nsurpassing the 1980 peak. Tests for differences in the levels and trends in employment between\nmen with and without disabilities during the 1980s show a significant difference in the level of\nemployment between men with and without disabilities, but no significant difference in the trends.\n(See Appendix Table 8A for the results of these tests.)\nIn the 1990s, the employment experiences of men with and without disabilities began to\ndiverge. For men without disabilities, the familiar procyclical pattern continued; employment fell\nas the economy moved into recession in the early 1990s but rebounded over the next seven years\nof economic growth (1992 to 1999). By 1999, the last year of available CPS data, the\nemployment of men without disabilities was near its 1989 peak level. In contrast, the employment\n21Employment rates (and standard errors) for each year of our sample are reported in Appendix\nTable 7A.\n22To trace economic outcomes of people with disabilities over the business cycle we focus on three\nyears representing peak or near peak points—1980, 1989, and 1999—and two years representing trough\npoints—1982 and 1991. An ideal analysis would make peak to peak comparisons (1979, 1989, and the\nnext business cycle peak). However, data constraints limit the choice of years compared to 1980 (the first\nyear of data with disability information), 1989 (the peak of the 1980s business cycle), and 1999 (the latest\nyear of data available).\n-17-\n\npattern of men with disabilities was quite different over the 1990s. Employment rates among men\nwith disabilities fell as the economy moved into recession, but then continued to fall during the\nexpansion, when job growth was substantial and the employment of men without disabilities was\nrising. By 1999 the employment rate of working-age men with disabilities had not only failed to\nreturn to its 1989 level but was substantially below its 1992 trough year level. Overall, between\n1989 and 1999, the employment rate of men with disabilities fell from 44.0 to 34.0 percent, a\ndecline of more than 25 percent. Tests for differences in the trends in employment during the\n1990s show a significant difference in the employment trends between men with and without\ndisabilities, unlike during the 1980s. (See Appendix Table 8A for the results of these tests.)\nThe story for women is similar. The employment of women with and without disabilities\nwas constant in the early recession years of the 1980s business cycle and then increased\nsubstantially through the growth years that followed. However, as was the case for men, over the\n1990s business cycle the employment experience of women with and without disabilities began to\ndiverge. For women without disabilities, employment remained near its 1989 peak through the\nrecession years of the early 1990s and grew thereafter. In contrast, the employment rate of\nwomen with disabilities fell as the economy moved into recession and continued to fall even over\nthe recovery period. Statistical tests confirm that while there is a significant difference in the level\nof employment rates over the entire period, there is no significant difference in the employment\ntrends for women with and without disabilities in the 1980s. In contrast, and as for the sample of\nmen, there is a significant difference in employment trends in the 1990s. (See Appendix Table 8A\nfor the results of these tests.)\n-18-\n\nFinally, to test for the possibility that changes in the composition of the population\nreporting a work disability are driving the results, we perform a simple shift-share analysis,\ncontrolling first for changes in age, race, education, and household size, and then controlling for\nthese demographic changes and changes in employment rates. The results of these analyses,\nreported in Appendix Table 9A show that if the composition of the population with disabilities\nwas the same in 1999 as it was in 1980 or 1989 (in terms of age, race, education, and household\nsize), the economic outcomes for those with disabilities would be worse than the ones actually\nfound in the data. This suggests that our results are not an artifact of demographic shifts, but\nrather the result of changing outcomes for those with disabilities.\nDiscussion and Issues for Future Research\nIn Figure 1 we provided a conceptualization of a population with disabilities that\noperationally placed those who report a Nagi “work limitation-based disability” within a broader\nADA-based disability population that recognizes that a reported impairment may or may not lead\nto a work limitation. Using data from the NHIS we showed that a substantial share of working-\nage people who report serious impairment do not report having a work limitation. We further\nshowed that those with impairments who also report having a work limitation are far less likely to\nbe employed than are people with the same reported impairment who do not report having a work\nlimitation. This suggests that work limitation questions like those in the CPS are likely to\nunderstate the prevalence of disability in the working-age population based on an ADA\nconceptualization and to understate the share of that population that is employed.\nHowever, we also find that the employment trends in these two distinct conceptualizations\nof the working-age population with disabilities are not significantly different from one another.\n-19-\n\nUsing NHIS data we find that the employment trends of this work limitation-based disability\npopulation are not significantly different from the employment trends of the larger impairment-\nbased population. Moreover, we find that while disability prevalence and employment rates found\nin the CPS data for this work limitation-based disability population are significantly different from\nthose found in the NHIS data, there is no significant difference between the trends in employment\nfound in these data sources.\nWith this in mind and using the work limitation-based measure of disability in the CPS, we\nfind that during the 1980s and the 1990s, employment outcomes for those without disabilities\nwere procyclical, falling during recessionary years and rising during years of expansion. While\nthis also was the case for working-age men and women with disabilities during the 1980s, it failed\nto hold for working-age men and women with disabilities in the 1990s. During the 1990s,\nemployment of men and women with disabilities fell continuously, declining in both recessionary\nand expansionary periods. These results suggest that recent studies using the work limitation-\nbased disability population in the CPS to examine the decline in the relative employment of men\nwith disabilities in the 1990s cannot be dismissed out of hand.\nSo far, three major hypotheses have been proposed to explain this decline. Kaye (2001)\nargues that declining employment rates among those with disabilities in the 1990s were caused by\ndramatic increases in the severity of impairments. Hence, for Kaye, the recent trends are health-\nbased and not a reflection of changes in public policy. Other researchers have taken a more social\nenvironment-oriented view. For example, DeLeire (2000) and Acemoglu and Angrist\n(forthcoming) attribute the downturn in employment among those with disabilities in the 1990s to\nthe passage of the ADA. Bound and Waidmann (2000) argue that changes in disability benefits\n-20-\n\neligibility and generosity made it easier and more profitable for workers to leave the labor force\nand take benefits. Autor and Duggan (2001) suggest that a combination of disability benefits that\nreplaced a greater share of labor earnings and declining job opportunities for low-skilled workers\ninduced an increasing share of workers to choose benefits over employment.\nSo far, however, no studies have been able to satisfactorily disentangle the impact of\ndemand side factors related to the passage of the ADA or changes in the mix of jobs in the\neconomy in the 1990s from supply side factors related to changes in the ease of access to SSDI\nand SSI benefits or to a reduction in the share of jobs that provide private health insurance, which\nwould discourage work among the population with disabilities. And no one has developed clear\nempirical evidence that the severity of health impairments has increased over time.\nThis paper moves the policy debate beyond the question of “Did the employment of\npeople with disabilities dramatically fall in the 1990s?” It did. Pinning down the magnitudes of\nthese various effects is the next necessary step to fully understanding the causes for this decline\nand developing policies targeted at reversing this trend.\n-21-\n\nReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron and Joshua Angrist.

This method yields\na random sample because being asked about a condition is not\ndependent on one’s response to another question. This method captures\nthose with specific conditions but who may or may not report having no\nhealth or functioning difficulties. Only one-sixth of the sample is\ndirectly asked about a specific condition. The set of impairments used\nin this paper are blindness in both eyes, other visual impairments,\ndeafness in both ears, other hearing impairments, stammering and\nstuttering, other speech impairments, mental retardation, absence of\nboth arms/hands, one arm/hand, fingers, one or both legs, feet/toes,\nkidney, breast, muscle of extremity, tips of fingers, and/or toes,\ncomplete paralysis of entire body, one side of body, both legs, other\nextremity; cerebral palsy, partial paralysis one side of body, legs, other\nextremity, other complete or partial paralysis, curvature or other\ndeformity of back or spine, orthopedic impairment of the back, spina\nbifida, deformity/orthopedic impairment of hand, fingers, shoulder(s),\nother upper extremity, flatfeet, clubfoot, or other deformity/orthopedic\nimpairment, and cleft palate.\nEmployment People are employed if they work 52 hours or more and have People are employed if they had a job in the previous two weeks, which\nMeasure positive earnings in the previous year. includes those on layoff.

In general, we find that while the employment of working-age men and women with and\nwithout disabilities exhibited a procyclical trend during the 1980s business cycle, this was not the\ncase during the 1990s expansion. During the 1990s, the employment of working-age men and\nwomen without disabilities continued to be procyclical, but the employment rates of their\ncounterparts with disabilities declined over the entire 1990s business cycle. Although increases in\ndisability transfer income replaced a significant fraction of their lost earnings, the household\nincome of men and women with disabilities fell relative to the rest of the population over the\ndecade.\n\nEconomic Outcomes of Working-Age People with Disabilities\nover the Business Cycle: An Examination of the 1980s and 1990s\nI. Introduction\nIn general, the rate of employment and household income of workers fluctuate with the\nbusiness cycle, rising during expansions and falling during contractions (Blackburn and Bloom\n1989; Burkhauser et al. 1999). Although this pattern holds for the average worker, there is\nconsiderable variation in business cycle outcomes across workers with different levels of\neducation, job skills, and work experience (Blank and Card 1993; Hoynes 2000). Research also\ndocuments substantial variation in outcomes across the distribution of household income, with\nworkers in lower income households being more vulnerable to economic downturns and less\nresponsive to economic upturns than the average worker (Karoly 1993; Karoly and Burtless\n1995).\nIn this paper, we examine the relative outcomes of workers with disabilities across the\nbusiness cycle. We find that, on average, the employment rate and household income of working-\nage people with disabilities are more adversely affected during economic downturns than are\nthose of working-age men and women without disabilities. Our findings with respect to economic\nexpansions are less consistent; a different pattern emerges in the 1990s than in the 1980s.\nWhereas employment and household income of all groups rose during the 1980s expansion, only\nthe outcomes of working-age men and women without disabilities continued to be procyclical in\nthe 1990s. The employment rates of their counterparts with disabilities declined over the entire\n1990s business cycle. While increases in disability transfer income replaced a significant fraction\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—2\nof their lost earnings, the household income of men and women with disabilities also fell relative\nto the population without disabilities over the decade.\nII. Data and Measurement Issues\nData\nWe compare the employment and economic well-being of people with and without\ndisabilities over the 20-year period from 1980 through 1999 using data from the March Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS). The CPS is a monthly survey of a nationally representative sample of\nthe civilian non-institutionalized United States population, conducted by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics. The annual March Demographic Supplement contains detailed questions about\nhousehold composition, employment, and sources of income, making it a valuable source of time-\nseries data on changes in economic outcomes over the business cycle. The sample size in each\nyear of the March CPS is in excess of 55,000 households and 150,000 individuals.\nWe test the robustness of our results using data from the National Health Interview\nSurvey (NHIS) from 1983 to1996.1 The NHIS is an annual survey of a nationally representative\nsample of civilian non-institutionalized United States households. It is conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics and used to monitor trends in illness and disability in the United States\npopulation. Each year the NHIS surveys approximately 40,000 households and 100,000\nindividuals. Because of its focus on health, the NHIS has far more information on illness and\ndisability than the CPS and less information on employment and household income. We use data\n1Although the NHIS survey covers a larger number of years, 1957 through 2000, we\nrestrict our analysis to the subset of surveys with consistently asked questions on work\nlimitations.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—3\nfrom the NHIS to validate the trends in disability prevalence observed in the CPS data and to\ncheck the robustness of our CPS-based business cycle results with an alternative data source.\nDefining the Population with Disabilities\nEvaluation of the working-age population with disabilities must start with a definition of\nthat population. Disability is a more complex concept to define or measure than age, race, or\ngender, and definitions of the population frequently vary by research discipline and policy\npurpose.2 For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), with the goal of\nestablishing broad civil rights, defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that\nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity, a record of such an impairment, or being\nregarded as having such an impairment. In contrast, the Social Security Administration, with the\ngoal of awarding disability benefits, defines disability as the inability to engage in substantial\ngainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical impairment expected to result in\ndeath or last at least 12 months.\nIn the economics literature, researchers’ definitions of disability frequently are functions of\nthe available data. In most surveys of employment and household income, the data available on\nhealth come from a small set of questions that ask respondents to assess whether their health\nlimits the kind of amount of work they can perform.3 The use of self-reported work disability is\n2Mashaw and Reno (1996) argue that the appropriateness of any definition of disability\ndepends on the purpose for which it is used. They document over 20 definitions of disability used\nfor purposes of entitlement to public or private income transfers, government services, or\nstatistical analysis.\n3Researchers have been cautious in using such global self-reported health measures\nbecause they are subjective and can vary from individual to individual. More importantly, health\nresponses may not be independent of the economic variables being examined. For a review of\nthese issues see Bound and Burkhauser (1999).\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—4\ncontroversial. Self-perception of disability as captured by this measure can be influenced by social\ncontext, such as the presence of benefit programs targeted on those with disabilities and\nworkplace barriers or accommodations. Thus, reports of a work disability may change over time,\neven holding underlying health constant (Kirchner 1996).4 While the problems inherent in these\nmeasures have led some researchers (Myers 1982, 1983) to conclude that no useful information\ncan be gained from such data, numerous researchers have shown that self-reported measures of\nwork limitations are highly correlated with other more objective assessments of health and with\nclinical measures of disability (see Bound and Burkhauser 1999 for a review of this literature.)\nMoreover, as discussed elsewhere (Burkhauser and Daly 1996), we believe such data are capable\nof identifying people with serious functional limitations.\nIn the CPS, the population with disabilities is defined by a work-limitations question that\nasks, “Does anyone in this household have a health problem or disability which prevents them\nfrom working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do? If yes, Who is that?\n(Anyone else?)”5 While this single-question measure of work-limitations is coarser than a\nmeasure of disability based on a more detailed set of self-reported questions like those in the\nNHIS or on an actual medical examination, it is a reasonable first approximation of the population\n4Kirchner argues that self-perception within the population with disabilities changed with\nthe passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, making people with disabilities less likely to\ndescribe themselves as having a work-limiting condition. Below, we test whether such changes in\nreporting behavior are reflected in changes in the composition of the population with disabilities\nover time. We also examine whether changes in reporting behavior of the type described by\nKirchner are consistent with the outcomes observed in the CPS data.\n5Small changes were made to the CPS question on disability in 1994. However, in other\nwork we argue that they do not materially affect our results. See Burkhauser, Daly, and\nHoutenville (2001, the Appendix) for a description of the changes and a discussion of there\neffects on disability prevalence.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—5\nwith disabilities. More importantly, we argue below that it allows for consistent measurement of\nthat population over the period of our analysis.\nBased on this question in the CPS, we find that, on average, between 1980 and 1999\nabout 8 percent of the working-age population reported a work-limiting disability in any given\nyear. Men were slightly more likely to report a disability than were women. During the 20-year\nperiod, an average of 8.1 percent of men reported having a disability compared to 7.5 percent of\nwomen. The complete set of values underlying these averages are listed in Appendix Table 1.\nLooking beyond the average rate of disability in the population, Figure 1 shows the prevalence of\ndisability by household size-adjusted income decile for three years in the data—1981,1990, and\n2000.6 In each of these years, the prevalence of disability falls with higher values of household\nincome. This relationship is consistent with the health-income gradient documented in other data\nsources (Daly et al. 1999; Robert and House 1996; Smith and Kington 1996).\nWhat is more important for our analysis is the fact that there is little difference in the\nprevalence of disability by income decile over time. This consistency implies that, measured by\nhousehold size-adjusted income, the composition of the population of those with disabilities has\nremained relatively constant over the 20 years of our study. Moreover, it suggests that there have\nnot been systematic changes in the way that working-age people with disabilities respond to the\nCPS work-limitation question and that this question can be used to monitor trends in the\nemployment and household income among the working-age population with disabilities over time.\n6The measure of household size-adjusted income used in Figure 1 is described in detail in\nthe variable definition section.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—6\nTo verify that the patterns we observe in the CPS data are not particular to that survey,\nwe compare CPS prevalence statistics to those obtained from the NHIS. The sample period in\nour study excludes years before 1983 and after 1996 due to major revisions in the NHIS survey\ninstrument in 1983 and 1997. The work limitation question in the NHIS is: \"Does any impairment\nor health problem NOW keep [person] from working at a job or business? Is [person] limited in\nthe kind OR amount of work [person] can do because of any impairment?\" A person with an\naffirmative response to either question is considered to have a work limitation.\nFigure 2 compares the prevalence of disability based on global work-limitations questions\nin the CPS and the NHIS over our sample period for working-age men and women. The average\nannual prevalence of disability among men over the period from 1983 through 1996 is 8.1 percent\nusing the CPS-based estimates, and 10.3 percent using the NHIS-based estimates. The average\nannual prevalence of disability among women over the same period is 7.4 percent using the CPS-\nbased estimates, and 10.4 percent using the NHIS-based estimates. As can be seen in Figure 2,\nthe NHIS-based estimates of the prevalence of disability are higher than the CPS-based estimates\nfor both men and women, in every year. 7 These differences are statistically significant in most\nyears of our study.8\nWhat is most important for our study, however, are not differences in the level of disability\nprevalence in the two data sets, but rather, the extent to which the trends in prevalence observed\n7One explanation for the difference in the level of reported disability prevalence in the CPS\nand NHIS is the location of the work-limitations question in the two surveys. In the CPS, this\nquestion is asked in a section of the survey focusing on employment; in the NHIS it is asked as\npart of the basic health and demographic \"core\" questionnaire. To the extent that individuals\nalready focused on questions about their health would be more apt to disclose any work-\nlimitations, the NHIS would pick up a higher rate of reported disability.\n8 See Appendix Table 1 for the complete set of prevalence rates (and their standard errors)\nexpressed in the figure. Statistical tests were t-tests of the differences in two proportions.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—7\nin the CPS are similar to those observed in the NHIS. To test whether the trends in disability\nprevalence between 1983 and 1996 are statistically similar in both data sets, we regress the\nprevalence of disability in the CPS and NHIS (pooled sample) on a dummy variable, indicating\nwhether the prevalence estimate comes from the CPS or NHIS data, a higher-order polynomial\ntime-trend, and the interactions of the time trend and the indicator variables. We then test the\njoint significance of the interaction terms using an F-test. Based on this method, we find no\ndifference, at conventional levels of significance, between the time-series patterns of disability\nprevalence for men and women in the two data sets. (See Appendix Table 4, columns 1-2, for the\nresults of these tests and Burkhauser, Houtenville, and Nargis 2001 for a more complete\ndescription of our test methodology.)\nKey Economic Variables\nEmployment. The analysis focuses on the role that employment plays in the household\nincome of men and women with disabilities. Individuals who report that they work more than 52\nhours per year are considered employed. 9 Individuals with fewer than 52 work hours annually are\nconsidered detached from the labor market.10 Annual labor earnings include income from all\nmarket sources, including primary and secondary jobs and self-employment income. Based on\nthis definition we calculate employment rates for those with and without disabilities for both the\nCPS and NHIS data.\n9Annual hours are calculated by multiplying the number of weeks worked by average\nhours worked per week. While our annual definition of employment is somewhat arbitrary, our\nresults are not sensitive to the hours cutoff we chose.\n10This category includes individuals who are out of the labor force and individuals who are\nlong-term unemployed (i.e., did not work during the measurement year).\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—8\nHousehold Income. Although we primarily are concerned with the economic status of\nindividuals, we recognize that most people share resources with other coresident individuals and\nhave access to income that does not flow directly to them (this is particularly important for\nspouses who do not work in the marketplace). Most researchers agree that the income-sharing\nunit should be broader than the individual, but there remains the issue of precisely who should be\nincluded in it. Some United States income distribution scholars have defined the unit as\nencompassing people related by blood or marriage who co-reside, i.e., the CPS family-sharing\nunit definition (see, for example, Karoly 1993 and Karoly and Burtless 1995). Others use the\nbroader household-based common residence definition.11\nIn this study, we use the CPS household-sharing unit definition. We define household\nincome as the sum of all pre-tax, post-transfer income received by individuals residing in a single\nresidence.12, 13 To account for the fact that $500 a week provides a higher standard of living for a\nsingle-person household than it does for individuals belonging to larger households, we adjust\nhousehold income by an equivalence factor. Since there is no universally accepted scale, we\nassume an elasticity with respect to household size of 0.5.14 In the CPS the income values are for\n11Atkinson, Rainwater, and Smeeding (1995) and Burkhauser, Crews and Daly (1997)\nargue that using the family definition, rather than the less restrictive household-based definition,\nproduces a bleaker picture of the income distribution because it treats a larger number of\nindividuals as single-person households even when they reside with and share the benefits of living\nwith others.\n12In the CPS data, income includes all cash income received from private and public\nsources.\n13The CPS data do not provide net-of-tax income information.\n14An equivalence scale with an elasticity of 1 (the per capita scale) implies no economies of\nscale in shared living. An equivalence scale with an elasticity of 0 (i.e., no adjustments for\nhousehold size) implies an infinite number of individuals can live equally well on a given\nhousehold income. An elasticity of 0.5 falls between these two options and also is close to the\nassumptions about economies of scale implicit in the U.S. Bureau of Census poverty scales\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—9\nthe year prior to the survey year. Thus, we use CPS data for 1981, 1990, and 2000 to track\nincome in 1980, 1989, and 1999. Because we are comparing income across years, we adjust\nincome using the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U); all income values are\nin 1998 dollars. Due to limitations in the NHIS income questions, we calculate household income\nonly for the CPS sample.15\nGovernment Transfer Receipt. An important component of income for many individuals\nwith disabilities is government-provided transfers. Throughout this study transfers are classified\nin two ways: individually-based and disability-related (disability benefits) and household-based and\nof any type or form (public transfers). Disability benefits include income from Workers’\nCompensation, the Social Security Disability Insurance Program, Veterans Benefits, and\nSupplemental Security Income. Public transfers include all cash benefits not specifically related to\nhealth.\nAdjusting for CPS Topcoding\nTo maintain the anonymity of the survey respondents, the CPS topcodes most sources of\nincome. Topcodes differ by income source and change over time (i.e., the portion of the\ndistribution affected varies over time and across income sources.) To ensure that such changes in\ntopcoding rules are not systematically affecting our results, we follow other CPS users (Daly and\nValletta 2000; Karoly 1993; Karoly and Burtless 1995) and adjust the data. The adjustment we\n(Burkhauser, Smeeding, and Merz 1996).\n15The NHIS income questions ask respondents to identify the income bracket for their\nhousehold. While such bracketed information provides a rough approximation of the economic\nwell-being of a household it does not allow us to make precise calculations of changes in\nhousehold income over time or to compare the NHIS income values to those from the more\ndetailed CPS. (See Burkhauser, Houtenville, and Nargis (2001) for a discussion of these issues\nand an attempt to impute household income values for NHIS sample members.)\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—10\nemploy imposes the harshest annual topcode across all years for each income source, so that each\nsource of income is topcoded at the same point in the distribution for each year in our sample.16\nSample Definition\nOur examination focuses on the experiences of working-age men and women aged 25 to\n61. This limited age range avoids confusing reductions in work or household income associated\nwith disability with reductions or declines associated with retirement at older ages or initial\ntransitions in and out of the labor force related to job shopping at younger ages. Men and women\nin the Armed Forces are excluded from our analysis. With these sample restrictions we have an\naverage of 72,000 working-age men and women in the CPS and 50,000 working-age men and\nwomen in the NHIS. The sample of respondents with disabilities averages 9,500 in the CPS and\n5,000 in the NHIS. All of our analysis are weighted by the individual sampling weights provided\nby the respective surveys.\nBusiness Cycle Dating\nTo trace economic outcomes of people with disabilities over the business cycle we focus\non three years representing peak or near peak points—1980, 1989, and 1999—and two years\nrepresenting trough points—1982 and 1991. An ideal analysis would make peak to peak\ncomparisons (1979, 1989, and the next business cycle peak). However, data constraints limit the\nchoice of years compared to 1980 (the first year of data with disability information), 1989 (the\npeak of the 1980s business cycle), and 1999 (the latest year of data available).\n16For some sources of income, the level of detail changes over time. In this case, we\naggregate the detailed data such that we have consistently defined variables over time. We\nimpose the topcode solution described above on the aggregated sources by assuming the topcode\nis the sum of the topcodes imposed on each of the component sources.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—11\nIII. Economic Outcomes of People with Disabilities over the Business Cycle\nEmployment\nBusiness cycles have a powerful effect on household income because they forcefully\nreduce employment. Table 1 shows the sensitivity of employment rates to economic fluctuations\nover the past 20 years for working-age men and women with and without disabilities.17 As the\ntable shows, during the 1980s the employment of men with and without disabilities was\nprocyclical, falling with recession and rising with recovery. In 1980, the first year the economy\nbegan to slow, employment rates of men with and without disabilities were relatively high—42.6\npercent and 96.7 percent, respectively. Employment for men with and without disabilities\ndeclined as the economy moved through a recession, declining by about 2 percent for each group.\nEconomic recovery once again boosted employment rates among men, particularly those with\ndisabilities. Between 1982 and 1989, the employment rate among men with disabilities rose 5.1\npercent, surpassing the 1980 peak. Tests for differences in the levels and trends in employment\nbetween men with and without disabilities during the 1980s show a significant difference in the\nlevel of employment between men with and without disabilities, but no significant difference in the\ntrends.18\nIn the 1990s, the employment experiences of men with and without disabilities began to\ndiverge. For men without disabilities, the familiar procyclical pattern continued; employment fell\n17Employment rates (and standard errors) for each year of our sample are reported in\nAppendix Table 2.\n18Tests performed were analogous to those conducted for differences in trends in disability\nprevalence across data sources (i.e., differences in levels were tested using t-tests of the\ndifferences in two proportions; differences in trends were tested using a simple regression model\nof employment and a higher-order polynomial time-trend.) Results of the trend tests are reported\nin Appendix Table 5.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—12\nas the economy moved into recession in the early 1990s but rebounded over the next seven years\nof economic growth (1992 to 1999). By 1999, the last year of available CPS data, the\nemployment of men without disabilities was near its 1989 peak level. In contrast, the employment\npattern of men with disabilities was quite different over the 1990s. Employment rates among men\nwith disabilities fell as the economy moved into recession, but then continued to fall during the\nexpansion, when job growth was substantial and the employment of men without disabilities was\nrising. By 1999 the employment rate of working-age men with disabilities had not only failed to\nreturn to its 1989 level but was substantially below its 1992 trough year level. Overall, between\n1989 and 1999, the employment rate of men with disabilities fell from 43.9 to 33.9 percent, a\ndecline of more than 25 percent. Consistent with Table 1, separate statistical tests show\nsignificant differences in both the level of employment between men with and without disabilities\nand in their trends. (See Appendix Table 5 for these results.)\nThe story for women is similar. The employment of women with and without disabilities\nwas constant in the early recession years of the 1980s business cycle and then increased\nsubstantially through the growth years that followed. However, as was the case for men, over the\n1990s business cycle the employment experience of women with and without disabilities began to\ndiverge. For women without disabilities, employment remained near its 1989 peak through the\nrecession years of the early 1990s and grew thereafter. In contrast, the employment rate of\nwomen with disabilities fell as the economy moved into recession and continued to fall even over\nthe recovery period. Statistical tests confirm that while there is a significant difference in the level\nof employment rates over the entire period, there is no significant difference in the employment\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—13\ntrends for women with and without disabilities in the 1980s. In contrast, and as for the sample of\nmen, there is a significant difference in employment trends in the 1990s. (See Appendix Table 5.)\nTo ensure that these employment patterns are not an artifact of the CPS data or a result of\nchanges in the composition of the population with disabilities, we perform two robustness checks.\nTo address the first concern we compare the CPS employment trends to those found in the NHIS.\nIn general, the trends in the NHIS data for the period 1983-1996 reinforce the employment trends\nreported for men and women with disabilities found in the CPS. That is, employment rates for\nmen and women with disabilities were procyclical during the 1980s and countercyclical during the\n1990s expansion. Testing for differences in employment trends across the two data sources we\nfind no significant differences in the estimated trends from the CPS and NHIS. (See Appendix\nTable 4, columns 3-4, for results from these tests.)\nTo test for the possibility that changes in the composition of the population reporting a\nwork disability are driving the results, we perform a simple shift-share analysis, controlling first\nfor changes in age, race, education, and household size, and then controlling for these\ndemographic changes and changes in employment rates. The results of these analyses, reported in\nAppendix Table 6, show that if the composition of the population with disabilities was the same in\n1999 as it was in 1980 or 1989 (in terms of age, race, education, and household size), the\neconomic outcomes for those with disabilities would be worse than the ones actually found in the\ndata. This suggests that our results are not an artifact of demographic shifts, but rather the result\nof changing outcomes for those with disabilities.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—14\nHousehold Income and Its Sources\nFor most people of working age, labor income is the principal source of household\nincome. Thus, changes in the employment patterns of working-age men and women with\ndisabilities potentially have a large impact on both their absolute and relative economic well-being.\nTable 2 shows median household size-adjusted income for men and women with and without\ndisabilities.19 The median man with and without a disability gained over the 1980s business cycle.\nHowever, for men with disabilities, the gains were much less pronounced. For example, between\n1980 and 1989, household size-adjusted income for the median man with a disability increased by\n1.0 percent, compared to an increase of 9.8 percent for the median man without a disability.\nIn general, the same trends in median household size-adjusted income observed during the\n1980s hold for the 1990s. The median man with and without disabilities gained during the period,\nbut men without disabilities gained far more. The trends for the median woman with disabilities\nwere similar in the 1980s. During the 1990s, growth in household income for the median woman\nwith a disability kept pace with that of the median woman without a disability.\nThe contrast between the trends in employment and household income among those with\ndisabilities suggest that the households of working-age people with disabilities relied far more on\nnonlabor sources of income during the 1990s than during the 1980s. Table 3 provides a more\ndetailed look at the various sources of household income of our four groups and how they\nchanged over the past two decades. Mean real household income is divided into five\ncomponents—own labor earnings, the labor earnings of other household members, own public\n19Estimates for each year of the sample are reported in Appendix Table 3.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—15\ndisability transfers, all other sources of public transfers, and all other sources of household\nincome. The sum of the means of these five income sources equals mean household income.20\nThere was a general decline in the share of household income contributed by men over the\nentire period, but the decline in the share contributed by men with disabilities during the 1990s\nbusiness cycle far exceeded the slight decline by men without disabilities. For example, the share\nof household income contributed by men without disabilities fell from 66.7 percent in 1980 to\n62.3 percent in 1989, a decline of 6.8 percent. Between 1989 and 1999 there was very little\nchange in their share. The patterns for men with disabilities are quite different. Between 1980\nand 1989 the share of household income contributed by men with disabilities fell from 23.0\npercent in 1980 to 22.2 percent in 1989, a decline of 3.5 percent, or about one-half of the\npercentage drop experienced by men without disabilities. In contrast, between 1989 and 1999 the\nearnings share of household income contributed by men with disabilities fell 26.5 percent, to 17.0\npercent.\nAs the share of household income coming from the labor earnings of men with and\nwithout disabilities declined, the share coming from labor earnings of other family members\nincreased. However, the increase in the share of labor earnings coming from other family\nmembers was larger in the households of men without disabilities than of men with disabilities. As\na result, over the past 20 years the households of men with disabilities have become increasingly\nreliant on non-labor sources of income.\n20All negative sources of income were converted to zero in the calculation of income\nshares. Means rather than medians were used and no adjustments were made in household size to\nallow the individual sources of income reported in Table 3 to sum to the total.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—16\nThe results for women are somewhat different. Over the 1980s business cycle, the share\nof household income contributed by women with and without disabilities increased substantially.\nThis trend continued over the 1990s business cycle for women without disabilities, but reversed\nfor women with disabilities. As a result, in 1999 earnings of women without disabilities\naccounted for 38.2 percent of their household income; for women with disabilities this share was\n14.1 percent.\nAs the share of household income from labor earnings declined for men and women with\ndisabilities, the share coming from public disability-related transfers increased. This substitution is\nparticularly evident in the 1990s. Among men with disabilities, the share of household income\ncoming from public disability transfers increased by 35.1 percent between 1989 and 1999; women\nwith disabilities experienced a similar increase, 31.6 percent during the period.21 The share of\nhousehold income coming from all other public transfers declined steadily during the 1990s for all\nfour groups. All other sources of household income fell during the peak-to-trough years in the\n1990s and rose thereafter for all groups. However, over the entire period these sources fell for all\ngroups.\nIV. Gains in Household Income across the Distribution\nFigure 3 looks behind the profile of the median man and woman with and without a\ndisability—examined in Table 2—and reports changes in real household size-adjusted income\nacross the entire income distribution. Figure 3 shows the dollar difference in real household size-\n21Elsewhere we show that the increase in real public disability transfers over the 1990s\ncame primarily from rapid growth in the value of SSI and SSDI benefits; in contrast, Workers’\nCompensation and Veterans’ Benefits fell in real terms over the period (Burkhauser, Daly, and\nHoutenville 2001).\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—17\nadjusted income by percentile of the income distribution for men and women with and without\ndisabilities between 1980 and 1989, and between 1989 and 1999. Each line cuts the horizontal\naxis at the percentile at which real income in one-year equals real income in the other. Values\nabove (below) the horizontal axis show that mean real income in that percentile increased\n(decreased) over the period.\nIn contrast to the population of men without disabilities, which gained across nearly the\nentire income distribution over both business cycles, within the population of men with disabilities\nthe experiences varied with the level of household income and across business cycles (Figure 3,\npanels A and B). In both periods examined, the lower part of the household size-adjusted\ndistribution experienced only modest changes in income, with small declines during the 1980s and\nsmall gains during the 1990s. Declines in own labor earnings in this part of the distribution were\nfor the most part offset by increases in disability-related transfers. The primary difference\nbetween the two periods for the population of men with disabilities occurred in the upper half of\nthe income distribution. Over the 1980s business cycle all percentiles in the upper part of the\ndistribution gained. In contrast, over the 1990s business cycle, incomes in the middle of the\ndistribution (between the 50th and 65th percentiles) remained flat, exhibiting no more growth than\nthose in the bottom half of the income distribution. It is not until the 75th percentile and above\nthat income increased by the same magnitude as in the 1980s. Declines in own labor earnings in\nthe middle of the distribution during the 1990s were only partially offset by increases in disability-\nrelated transfer income.\nWe find the same patterns for women with and without disabilities (Figure 3, panels C and\nD). Women without disabilities gained across the entire distribution in both business cycles. For\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—18\nwomen with disabilities the lower part of the distribution experienced almost no change in income\nover the 1980s business cycle, while the top 50 percent of the distribution gained. In contrast,\nduring the 1990s business cycle, incomes rose at all levels of the distribution, although by\nrelatively small amounts. Only those in the top 25th percentile gained, and for the most part their\ngains were modest.\nV. Conclusions and Issues for Future Research\nWe examined the relative responsiveness of employment and household income of\nworking-age men and women to business cycle fluctuations over the past two decades. Overall,\nthe results indicate that during the 1980s, economic outcomes for those with and without\ndisabilities were procyclical, falling during recessionary years and rising during years of expansion.\nIn contrast, the employment of working-age men and women with disabilities fell continuously\nover the 1990s. While a substantial increase in disability transfer income in the 1990s replaced a\nsignificant fraction of the lost labor earnings, it did not prevent most of the households of men and\nwomen with disabilities from losing economic ground relative to the rest of the population.\nRecognizing that CPS data are not the ideal source of information about persons with\ndisabilities, we checked the robustness of our results using data from the NHIS. While disability\nprevalence and employment rates found in the CPS data for this population are significantly\ndifferent from those found in the NHIS data, there is no significant difference between the trends\nin prevalence or employment found in these data sources. Hence we argue that the\nunprecedented decline in the importance of work as a source of household income among\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—19\nworking-age men and women with disabilities in the 1990s is not an artifact of the CPS data but a\nreal and important phenomenon.\nThese results suggest that recent studies documenting the decline in the relative\nemployment of men with disabilities in the 1990s cannot be dismissed out of hand. So far, two\nmajor hypotheses have been proposed to explain this decline. Acemoglu and Angrist (1998),\nusing CPS data from 1988 to 1997, report employment patterns similar to those reported here and\nargue that this decline was caused by unintended consequences of the passage of the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).22 Bound and Waidmann (2000), using CPS data from 1989\nto 1999, also report employment patterns similar to those reported here but argue that increases in\nSocial Security Disability Insurance benefit rolls can account for all of the decline in employment\nof working-age men with disabilities during this period. So far, however, no studies have been\nable to satisfactorily disentangle the impact of demand side factors related to the passage of the\nADA or changes in the mix of jobs in the economy in the 1990s from supply side factors related\nto changes in the ease of access to SSDI and SSI benefits or to a reduction in the share of jobs\nthat provide private health insurance, which would discourage work among the population with\ndisabilities. Pinning down the magnitudes of the various effects is the next necessary step to fully\nunderstanding the causes of the recent decline in employment among those with disabilities and\ndeveloping policies targeted at reversing this trend.\n22DeLeire (2000) using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation for the\nyears 1990-1994 reports similar findings and proposes the same explanation. Kruse and Schur\n(2000) use these same data but finds that employment trends of working-age men with disabilities\nare sensitive to one’s choice of disability measure.\n\nBusiness Cycles and People with Disabilities—20\nReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron and Joshua Angrist. 1998. “Consequences of Employment Protection?

The impetus for change has been\nmultifaceted: rapid growth in program costs; greater awareness that people with impairments are\nable and willing to work; and increased recognition that protecting the economic security of\npeople with disabilities might best be done by keeping them in the labor market. We describe the\nevolution of disability programs in four countries: Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the\nUnited States. We show how growth in the receipt of publicly provided disability benefits has\nfluctuated over time and discuss how policy choices played a role. Based on our descriptive\ncomparative analysis we summarize shared experiences that have the potential to benefit\npolicymakers in all countries.\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nAll industrialized nations provide some form of public protection to working-age\nindividuals with disabilities. In their early manifestations, these programs focused on easing the\nfinancial consequences of disability by providing cash assistance in lieu of full-time work. Over\ntime a number of nations have moved away from simple cash assistance to emphasize pro-work\nprograms designed to help individuals with disabilities maintain their labor market connections.\nOn balance these changes have reflected concerns about rapid growth in program rolls as well as\nincreased awareness that many individuals with disabilities can remain productive in the labor\nmarket.\nIn this paper, we describe the evolution of disability programs in four countries:\nGermany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. We select these countries as examples\nof nations with similar goals but very different approaches to achieving them. We begin by\ncomparing trends in disability recipiency across countries. We find that all four countries\nexperienced pronounced fluctuations in disability recipiency rates over the past 40 years. We\nshow that these fluctuations are difficult to explain based on the relatively stable paths of\nvariables such as health and population composition. We go on to describe changes in disability\npolicy in each country and show that these changes are well correlated with the ups and downs in\ncountry disability recipiency rates. We interpret these correlations as suggestive of a link\nbetween policy and disability recipiency and summarize lessons that can be gleaned from the\nexperiences in each nation. Although our paper is simply a descriptive comparative analysis, it\nhighlights the similarities of experiences across nations and underscores the potential benefit of\nlearning from other countries’ policy reform efforts when tackling the challenges associated with\nproviding social protection to those with disabilities.\n3\n\n2. Disability Program Growth across Countries\nThe number of workers receiving disability-based social insurance has increased\nsubstantially in most industrialized nations over the past 40 years. Population growth accounts\nfor part of this increase, but disability caseloads as a share of the working-age population—\nknown as the disability recipiency rate—also have risen substantially.1 This can be seen in\nFigure 1, which shows the total number of people receiving long-term categorical disability\nincome benefits as a share of the working-age population in our four countries.2 This is the most\ncritical number to policymakers since it measures the magnitude of the fiscal burden that these\ndisability programs place on country finances.3 We show values beginning in 1970 through the\nlast year of public data available in each country.4 We provide a more detailed description of the\ndata in Appendix A.\nFigure 1 plots the level of disability recipiency over time for each country. In 1970,\ndisability recipiency rates in our three European Union (EU) nations were considerably higher—\n1Pattison and Waldron (2013) argue that population growth explains the bulk of the rise in\ndisability recipiency (the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program) in the United States.\nDuggan and Imberman (2009) and Burkhauser et al. (2014) remove the influence of population\ngrowth and consider the factors that explain the remaining rise in the program. Since population\ngrowth alone would not put additional financial pressure on the system, knowing what these\nother factors are is critical to policymakers tasked with funding the system. Most recently\nLiebman (2015) argues that most of the increase in the DI incidence rate, controlling for other\nfactors including unemployment rates, occurred in the 1980s. Since then this controlled measure\nof incidence has leveled off, but at a substantially higher rate than in the early 1970s.\n2The U.S. disability recipiency rate only includes beneficiaries receiving Social Security DI.\nWhen SSI-disabled adults and DI program beneficiaries are combined, the level of the U.S.\ndisability recipiency rate is higher, but the patterns over time are roughly the same. This point is\ndemonstrated in Burkhauser et al. (2013), Figure 2.\n3The fiscal burden of disability programs comes from the fact that beneficiaries receive income\nsupport and generally do not contribute to the tax base since they are largely out of the labor\nforce.\n4Disability caseloads data are made public with a considerable lag in some countries. Hence we\ncannot fully document how the global financial crisis affected recipiency rates in all countries.\n4\n\n4.2 percent in Germany, 2.4 percent in the Netherlands, and 3.5 percent in Sweden—than they\nwere in the United States—1.2 percent). Since then disability recipiency rates have risen\nsubstantially in each country with the exception of Germany. However, as the figure highlights,\nthey have done so along significantly different trajectories.\nTo see these dynamics more clearly, Table 1 provides average annual growth rates in\ndisability recipiency by decade and over the entire sample. As the table shows, disability\nrecipiency rates rose in all countries during the 1970s, with especially rapid growth in the\nNetherlands and more modest growth in Germany. In contrast, in the 1980s, recipiency rates\ngrew more modestly and even fell in the United States and Germany. By the 1990s, growth in\nthe Netherlands and Germany ended and disability recipiency rates fell, on balance, over the\ndecade. During the 2000s, disability recipiency rates continued to fall in the Netherlands and\nGermany and grew less quickly in Sweden. Growth in the United States slowed slightly but\nremained quite high relative to the EU countries in our sample.\nThe final average (1970-final) shows that, after smoothing through the fluctuations in\ngrowth over the decades, the United States experienced the highest average annual growth rate\nover the sample period. The rapid growth in our three EU countries brought on program reforms\nand a tempering or reversal of the path of disability recipiency. In contrast, with the exception of\nthe 1980s, growth in U.S. disability recipiency was nearly continuous over the sample period.\nOf course one possible explanation for the differences in growth across countries is that\nhealth and population characteristics have evolved differently for each nation over time. To\nunderstand the extent to which these factors might account for the growth in disability recipiency\nshown in Figure 1 and Table 1, we compare trends in self-reported health across countries and\nmore formally evaluate the role that demographics and other changes in the population eligible\n5\n\nfor disability benefits might account for trends in disability recipiency rates. We begin by\nexamining trends in self-reported health over time and across countries. Although the self-\nreported measure is prone to response biases, which are well documented in the literature, one\nstrength is its availability across countries and over time.5 McGee et al. (1999) show that self-\nreported health is highly correlated with objective health measures and is a very reliable indicator\nof mortality.\nFigure 2 contains OECD data on self-reported health status for each of our countries. The\nplot shows the percentage of the population aged 45–64 in each country reporting that they are in\nvery good or good health on a survey that asks respondents to state whether they are in very\ngood, good, fair, or poor health. Since the incidence of disability increases with age this is the\nmost relevant age group for examining the role of health in disability benefit trends.\nAlthough there are persistent differences across countries in the percent of individuals\nreporting very good or good health, there is little variation over time within countries. Over the\npast ten years the overall prevalence of very good or good health among working-age\npopulations has remained relatively steady in each country. The relative stability of the health\nmeasure in each of our sample countries suggests that changes in the prevalence of impairments\nin the working-age population is unlikely to account for the bulk of the fluctuations in disability\nrecipiency rates within and across countries found in Figure 1 and Table 1. Findings reported in\nBörsch-Supan and Jürges (2012) come to the same conclusions.\nA second reason disability recipiency rates may have varied across countries over time is\nthat the eligible populations in those nations may have evolved differently. Examples of this\n5Some of the differences across countries may relate to the age structure of the population. Older\npopulations report lower rates of good health than younger populations. Remaining differences\nare likely to result from reporting differences that are idiosyncratic to each country (e.g., Jürges,\n2007; Ziebarth, 2010a; Van Soest et al., 2011).\n6\n\ninclude increased labor force participation among women in the United States, which increased\nthe share of women eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) benefits. However,\nprevious research has found that accounting for these factors cannot fully explain the differences\nin levels and trends across countries. See, for example, Burkhauser et al. (2014) and OECD\n(2010).\nIf neither health nor population characteristics can account for all of the cross-country\ndifferences in disability recipiency rates, either levels or trends, then what can? An obvious\npossibility is policy.6 In what follows we show how changes in disability policy and its\nimplementation in each country are correlated with the dynamics of disability recipiency rates\ndocumented in Figure 1. While our comparative descriptive analysis falls short of establishing a\ncausal effect of policy on the disability rolls, it is suggestive of the potential impact of policy\ndesign on the trends in disability benefit receipt across and within the countries in our sample.\n6We are not the first to make this point. The OECD (2010) summary of disability program\ngrowth across OECD nations concludes that policy rather than population characteristics are\nbehind the rapid expansion of disability benefit receipt in most nations. The point is also\nemphasized by Autor and Duggan (2010) and Burkhauser and Daly (2011, 2012) for the United\nStates and Burkhauser et al. (2014) cross-nationally, and Duggan and Imberman (2009).\nLiebman (2015) acknowledges that policy can matter but argues this is less the case for the\nUnited States since the 1990s.\n7\n\n3. Disability Policy and Program Growth\nIn industrialized nations, social protection from income loss associated with disability is\njust one part of a broader social safety net designed to protect working-age individuals from the\nloss of labor market income. Countries also provide protection to those who lose market income\nfor other reasons such as unemployment or old age.\nIn general, countries provide this protection in tiers associated with the expectations of\nemployment for different groups. The first tier provides universal, long-term, needs-based cash\ntransfers that guarantee a social minimum income to all families. The second tier provides cash\nsupport to those available for employment and expected to work, but who are temporarily\nunemployed. These benefits are usually conditional on past work, limited in duration, and may\nbe needs-based. The third tier targets benefits to those not expected to work—the aged, disabled,\netc.—and can either be needs-based or based on past earnings. Since recipients of these benefits\nare not expected to return to employment, benefits are typically higher and not time limited.\nWhen these tiers provide substantially different amounts of income and their categories\nare mutable, a considerable responsibility falls on program gatekeepers to consistently determine\nwho should come onto the program. For retirement programs this is straightforward; age is an\narbitrary but easily verifiable eligibility marker. Eligibility determinations by program\ngatekeepers will be straightforward and program caseloads will be predictable based on\nknowable trends in population composition.\nDisability is more difficult. Unlike retirement, there is no precise definition or easily\nverifiable marker for determining categorical eligibility for long-term disability benefits.\nMoreover, disability is not a static concept and social conceptualizations of disability evolve over\ntime. For example, over the past 20 years the medical model of disability underlying categorical\n8\n\ndisability programs in most OECD countries has been rejected and replaced by a\nconceptualization that recognizes that the social environment is as important as health in\ndetermining an individual’s ability to participate in society (WHO, 2001).7 Under this model,\n“work disability” is a changeable state that depends on a number of factors, including an\nindividual’s health-based impairment, the level of accommodation offered in the workplace, and\nthe relative economic rewards associated with working or exiting the labor force to receive\ndisability benefits.\nThe fluid nature of the disability category has meant that changes to disability policy\nparameters such as who is covered for program benefits, the level of benefits—both absolutely\nand relative to alternative programs or wage earnings—and the breadth and severity of the\nqualifying conditions can influence caseload growth and disability recipiency rates. This\npotential is especially acute in the context of reductions in other forms of social protection or\nchanges in the broader economy.\nFor example, in a number of industrialized nations, the relative value of disability\nbenefits has risen significantly over time, as policymakers have cut payments or imposed stricter\neligibility criteria on other benefit programs including unemployment insurance and general\nwelfare. Structural changes in the economy including the declining job and wage prospects for\nlow-skilled workers also have made disability benefits more attractive as means of long-term\nincome support. Finally, disability benefits have increasingly become an option for displaced or\nlong-term unemployed workers dislocated during economic downturns. Since very few disability\nbeneficiaries ever return to the labor market, the growth in the rolls that occurs during and after\n7There is no clear consensus on the most appropriate conceptualization of disability, although the\nmost widely used is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\nDisability, Health, and Functioning (WHO, 2001). Burkhauser and Schroeder (2007) propose a\nmethod to harmonize classifications in surveys.\n9\n\nrecessions account for some of the long-term increase in disability recipiency rates. These rates\nthen remain elevated until these recession induced cohorts of beneficiaries age out of the system\nor die. For a more detailed discussion of these issues in OECD nations see OECD (2010).\nBelow we discuss how disability program designs and changes in disability policy\nparameters in three EU countries (Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden) and in the United\nStates are related to disability recipiency rates in each country. When relevant we also discuss\nhow these policy structures may have interacted with macroeconomic conditions and the broader\nsocial safety net to account for growth in the disability rolls. For reference, Figure 3 (Panels A\nthrough D) show disability recipiency rates along with major policy changes over time for each\ncountry. Table 2 provides key information about the current state of disability programs in each\nnation.\n3.1 The German Experience\nGermany, like most European nations, has a long-standing first-tier universal needs-based\ncash transfer program that provides a guaranteed social minimum income floor to all its citizens.\nBenefits are funded out of general revenues. Major reforms in 2004 fundamentally altered\nGermany’s tier 1 program to impose job search and job training requirements on beneficiaries.8\nIn general, tier I beneficiaries are considered “able to work” and part of the active labor force in\nGermany.9 Benefits levels are set nationally and vary across individuals based on household size\nand composition.\n8The 2004 reforms created the Arbeitslosengeld II program, generally referred to as “Hartz IV”\n(Sozialgesetzbuch II, “Social Code Book II”). For more information about the reforms see, e.g.,\nEichhorst et al., 2008; Konle-Seidl, 2012.\n9People are considered “able to work” if they are judged to be able to work at least three hours\nper day. A relatively small share of people receive Sozialhilfe (Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt)\n10\n\nGermany also provides second- and third-tier benefits. Second-tier benefits consist\nprimarily of unemployment insurance (UI). To receive unemployment benefits workers must\nhave been employed for at least 24 months prior to applying. Unemployed workers under the age\nof 50 are paid benefits (Arbeitslosengeld I) for up to 12 months. After age 50 the maximum\nduration increases gradually with age such that workers who are age 58 at the start of their\nunemployment spell receive up to 24 months of benefits. For workers without children, the\nreplacement rate for unemployment benefits is 60 percent of the average monthly wage earnings\nover the previous year; unemployed workers with children receive 67 percent of prior earnings.\nUnemployment benefits are funded by payroll taxes up to the annual social insurance\ncontribution ceiling of €72,600 ($87,000).10 Employers and employees each pay 1.5 percent of\nthe gross wage.\nThird-tier benefits in Germany include the Statutory Old-Age Pension Scheme (OAP)\nand the Work Disability Pension (WDP) for both partially and totally disabled workers. Both\nprograms pay benefits to workers who have paid into the systems during their work life. Similar\nto UI, employers and employees are each subject to a payroll tax—9.35 percent of their monthly\ngross wages up to the social insurance contribution ceiling. In 2014, total WDP benefits per\nmonth were about €11 billion, or 4.2 percent of total OAP/WDP spending (DRV, 2014a, b, c;\nBMAS, 2014).11\n(“Social Assistance Benefits”) of a similar amount but have no job search requirement and are\nnot considered to be in the labor force (§§27-40 SGB XII). These beneficiaries are typically\n“long-term unemployed” and classified as temporarily not able to work three hours per day.\n10 In the eastern states of Germany, the rates are the same but the annual social insurance ceiling\nis lower—€62,400 ($75,000).\n11 The amount of €11 billion is based on an indirect calculation multiplying the 78,689 partial\nWDP beneficiaries by their average annual cash benefit of €5,844 and adding the 1,224,177 full\nWDP beneficiaries multiplied by their average annual benefit received of €8,604 (DRV, 2014a,\nb, c).\n11\n\nIn Germany, like other EU countries, workers also are eligible for both short- and long-\nterm statutory sickness insurance benefits.12 While these benefits can be the gateway to WDP,\nthey are not considered tier 3 programs since they are time limited. Employers are required to\nprovide short-term sickness benefits. Workers who are determined to be eligible for short-term\nsick benefits (up to six weeks) receive 100 percent of their net wages (Ziebarth and Karlsson,\n2010, 2014).13 Workers with longer spells are reevaluated for access to long-term sickness\nbenefits. These publicly funded benefits replace 70 percent of net wages and can be paid for up\nto 78 weeks. See Ziebarth (2009, 2013) for additional details.\nGermany had the highest recipiency rates in the early 1970s of the four countries we\ncompare in Figure 1. One reason for these higher rates was a change in WDP rules in 1969 that\nallowed partially disabled workers to receive full WDP benefits if they were unable to find a job\n(Burkhauser and Hirvonen, 1989). Further expansions in 1972 extended coverage to housewives\nand the self-employed and allowed disabled workers to transition to the retirement program at\nage 62 without an actuarial reduction in benefits. As can be seen in Panel A of Figure 3,\ndisability recipiency rose significantly in the aftermath of the reforms, peaking at 5.8 percent in\n1984.\nA substantial tightening of WDP coverage criteria followed this rapid growth in\nrecipiency rates. WDP reforms in the early 1980s limited coverage to workers who had paid\npayroll taxes into the system over the past three out of five years and had accumulated at least\n12 Similar to the workers’ compensation program in the United States, Germany also has a\nseparate Statutory Accident Insurance (SAI) program covering temporary and permanent work\nabsences in case of work accidents or diseases. But unlike the United States it is administered at\nthe federal rather than the state level.\n13 Short-term sick leave benefits were cut to 80 percent of wages in October 1996 but this cost-\nsaving reform was politically unsustainable and was reversed in 1999. For a discussion see\nZiebarth and Karlsson (2014).\n12\n\nfive years of market work experience. Since many housewives did not meet these “market work\ncriteria,” this greatly curtailed their WDP coverage. Hence a large fraction of the decline in\ndisability recipiency rates during this period was due to the reduction in access for women\nworking outside the paid labor market. (See RKI, 2006, and Börsch-Supan and Jürges, 2012, for\na more detailed discussion.) In the aftermath of these system coverage reforms, growth in\ndisability recipiency turned negative (Table 1), more than undoing the increases in disability\nrecipiency rates over the previous decades (Figure 3, Panel A).\nAdditional reforms were launched in the 1990s and 2000s. Actuarial reductions and caps\non the earnings of WDP beneficiaries were introduced in 1996. Börsch-Supan and Jürges (2012)\nreport that new male WDP beneficiaries fell from an average of about 150,000 per year prior to\nthese reforms to 75,000 per year thereafter. This 50 percent per year reduction in the inflow of\nnew male beneficiaries to the program contributed to the decline in disability recipiency rates\nover the rest of the decade evidenced in Figure 3 Panel A and Table 1.14\nAnother round of structural WDP reforms was introduced in 2001. Most important was\nthe tightening in the work-limited eligibility standard from “being unable to work in the\noccupation in which one was trained—effectively in the last job or a comparable job in terms of\nthe skills it required, the wages it paid and its prestige”—to “being unable to work in any job\navailable in the economy”. As we will describe later, this reform made eligibility for WDP\ninsurance benefits stricter than the criteria for the typical private market disability benefit.\nFollowing this policy change, inflows (men and women combined) to the WDP program\ndecreased further, falling from 200,000 in 2001 to 160,000 in 2005. This slow but steady decline\n14Note that these numbers reflect the stock of all beneficiaries. As such, even large declines in\nthe flow of new beneficiaries only gradually translate into declines in the overall disability\nrecipiency rate.\n13\n\nin new beneficiaries is linked to additional declines in the overall disability recipiency rate in\nGermany (Krause et al. 2013; DRV, 2014b).\nWDP reforms in 2004 continued to focus on reducing the flow of new recipients into the\nprogram. However, the attention of these reductions shifted away from tightening WDP\neligibility requirements and towards promoting worker accommodation on the job. Specifically,\nthe reforms mandated that employers provide workplace reintegration in the event of a work-\nlimiting impairment. Indeed, the law requires that when an impaired worker exhausts his/her\nshort-term sickness benefits (six weeks) and is being considered for longer-term sickness\nbenefits, employers must coordinate a plan that includes input from the sick-listed employee,\nWDP experts, the appropriate worker council, and the workplace physician. The plan is meant to\nensure that the worker’s temporary disability can be overcome and to prevent future reductions\nin work capacity.\nThe experience of Germany over the past four decades is a useful illustration of the role\nthat policy decisions can play in the dynamics of disability recipiency rates. When Germany was\nexpanding both the coverage and generosity of disability benefits, recipiency rates were high and\nrising relative to other countries. WDP program growth subsequently declined in the aftermath of\nreforms that limited access, made benefits less attractive, and required employers to implement a\nworkplace reintegration program. Germany is the only country in our sample whose disability\nrecipiency rate is now below its 1970 level. As can be seen in the bottom row of Table 1, annual\ngrowth rates over the entire period of our analysis (1970 to our most recent year of data)\naveraged -0.73 percent in Germany compared to +2.69 percent in the Netherlands, +2.3 percent\nin Sweden, and +3.1 percent in the United States.\n14\n\nPrivate Disability Insurance. Notably, the policy changes in Germany that reduced the\nsize of the public WDP program were correlated with an increase in the market for private\ndisability insurance (Figure 4). This private market insurance generally provides benefits to\ncovered workers who have established that a health shock led to reduced work capacity in the\ncurrent (or a comparable) occupation—a less difficult level of work incapacity to meet for\nbenefit eligibility than the one imposed by WDP since 2001. As shown in Figure 4, the number\nof new private disability insurance policies in Germany grew slowly from 1976 through the mid-\n1990s. But growth increased substantially around the introduction of actuarial reductions and\ncaps on the earnings of WDP beneficiaries in 1996. Growth in new private policies increased\nfurther in 2001. This is the year that WDP eligibility was limited to workers who were unable to\nperform any work in the economy.15 In 2012, 61 percent of employed men and 42 percent of\nemployed women were covered by private disability insurance (Statistika, 2014).16\nWhile the expansion of private disability insurance suggests that many Germans\nresponded to the reductions in WDP benefits by purchasing alternative private policies, to our\nknowledge no research on this substitution has been published. Even if individuals are\naugmenting the WDP program with private insurance, the substitution is likely not perfect.\nPrivate disability insurance plans are experience rated and individually underwritten. Private\ndisability insurance follows private insurance law and is based on a private contract between the\ninsurer and the insured, which specifies the conditions for the insured risk individually.\n15Conversations with German Association of Insurers (GDV) representatives confirm that no\nindustry-specific supply-side factors have been driving this trend.\n16Beneficiaries of private disability insurance may also receive WDP benefits if they are eligible.\nThis contrasts with the U.S. market where private insurers may reduce payments dollar-for-dollar\nfor recipients of public Social Security Disability Insurance. This means that private insurers in\nGermany have more of an incentive to return beneficiaries to work than do those in the United\nStates. (See Burkhauser and Daly, 2011, for a fuller discussion of this point.)\n15\n\nPremiums depend on age, medical diagnoses, and occupation. As a result, premiums can be high\nfor high-risk occupations and applicants may be denied coverage.\n3.2 The Netherlands17\nAs in Germany, the disability system in the Netherlands contains both a social insurance\nprogram that protects workers against lost labor earnings and a program that provides a social\nminimum for disabled adults with little or no work history. A separate social minimum scheme\nfor the disabled self-employed ended in 2004. The Dutch social insurance program (WAO/WIA)\nprovides cash transfers to working-age men and women based on lost labor earnings. The\nNetherlands does not have a separate program similar to workers’ compensation in Germany,\nSweden, or the United States. Rather it has a longer-term disability transfer program that,\ntogether with sickness benefits, all private firms must offer; the program provides a\ncomprehensive system of both partial and total disability benefits to workers regardless of how\nor where their disability occurred. The Dutch also have a categorical disability-based welfare\nprogram (Wajong) that, unlike the general welfare scheme, is not means tested. This program is\nsimilar to the SSI-disabled adults program in the United States in that it targets men and women\nwhose disabilities occurred prior to their entrance into the labor force and are severe enough that\nthey have not engaged in full-time employment as adults. (See Table 2 for details of the\ndisability program in the Netherlands.)\nThe Dutch disability program grew rapidly over the 1970s. This was a time when the\nsystem provided relatively generous benefits (Figure 3, Panel B). In the 1970s, government\npayments from the universal sickness benefit—essentially a universal short-term disability\n17A longer version of this summary of the Dutch system can be found in Burkhauser and Daly\n(2011).\n16\n\nsystem—replaced up to 80 percent of net-of-tax wage earnings for up to one year. And most\nemployees (90 percent) had the rest of their net-of-tax earnings replaced by collective-bargaining\nagreements with their employers. These disability replacement rates were far in excess of\ncomparable programs in the United States and many other European nations. Sickness benefits\nwere payable for up to 12 months. After that, employees still receiving benefits were eligible for\ndisability benefit screening. Workers with chronic conditions that caused a reduction in their\ncapacity to perform work commensurate with their job training and work history were eligible\nfor disability benefits. Those judged fully disabled were eligible for benefits equal to 80 percent\nof their previous before-tax earnings. Those judged partially disabled (those with some residual\nearnings capacity) were eligible for partial benefits; the minimum degree of impairment for\neligibility was 15 percent.\nIn a significant loosening of access to full disability benefits in the mid-1970s, Dutch\ncourts determined that unless disability evaluators could prove otherwise, they were required to\nattribute a partially disabled worker’s lack of employment to discriminatory behavior. The result\nwas that it became “administrative practice” to treat unemployed, partially disabled persons as if\nthey were fully disabled. That interpretation of the law made assessing lost earnings capacity\nunnecessary beyond the minimum 15 percent, since that became sufficient to entitle a person to\nfull benefits. This essentially made the Dutch partial disability system a very generous full\ndisability program. During this period, the adjusted disability recipiency rate in the Netherlands\ngrew 11.45 percent per year (Table 1 and Figure 3, Panel B).\nReforms initiated between 1982 and 1987 were the first of three major efforts over the\nnext two decades to regain control of the Dutch disability transfer system. By 1985, a series of\ncuts in the replacement rate effectively lowered it from 80 percent of before-tax income to 70\n17\n\npercent of after-tax income for both new entrants and current beneficiaries. In 1987 the labor\nmarket consideration rule was completely abolished. Despite the legal ban on including labor-\nmarket considerations in their assessments, disability adjudicators still tended either to grant or\ndeny full benefits. Denial rates remained quite low, suggesting that the legal change did not stop\nthe de facto use of labor-market considerations in the adjudication process. Nonetheless these\nchanges were accompanied by slower growth in disability recipiency in the 1980s that brought\nthe Netherlands more in line with disability growth in Sweden.\nIn 1994, the Dutch government introduced several additional reforms including measures\nto further tighten eligibility criteria, which caused the recipient rate to decline. And in a new\npolicy, private firms were made responsible for an employee’s first six weeks of sick pay. The\nintroduction of some privatization of the disability system was new in the Netherlands and\nrepresented a change in policy intended to encourage firms to provide accommodation,\nrehabilitation, and continued employment opportunities to workers as an alternative to moving\nthem onto long-term cash benefits. The length of time mandated for firms to bear the full\nresponsibility for sick pay was extended from six weeks to one year in 1996. Despite these\nreforms, the Dutch disability recipiency rate stopped declining in 1997 and began to slowly\nclimb.\nIn 2002, the Dutch disability system began to phase in the third and most significant set\nof reforms. These reforms culminated in the establishment of a new disability insurance scheme\nin 2004—WIA—which replaced the WAO scheme that had been in place since 1967. These\nsystemic reforms fundamentally altered disability policy in the Netherlands. The reforms\ndeliberately made work rather than cash benefits the expectation and enforced this by increasing\n18\n\nthe incentives of both employees and their employers to invest more time and effort in\naccommodation and rehabilitation following the onset of a disability.\nForemost among these reforms was the extension of the mandated length of time that\nfirms (including small employers) had to bear full responsibility for employees’ sick pay from\none year to two years. These changes effectively meant that during the first two years following\na health shock, workers were the responsibility of the firm and not eligible for long-term\ngovernment-provided disability benefits. During these two years, employers were required to\nallow workers receiving sickness benefits to remain with the firm; dismissal was allowed only\nfor employees who refused to cooperate in a reasonable work-resumption plan.\nThe reforms also gave firms a list of prescribed rehabilitation and accommodation\nactivities that they (via a private occupational health agency) had to provide to assist workers in\nremaining on the job or finding alternative employment. When the two years were complete,\nworkers were allowed to apply for long-term disability benefits, but they were required to\nprovide documentation regarding return-to-work efforts during the two-year period. In 2007,\nnearly 14 percent of disability insurance claims were returned to employers, and the employer\ncontinued to be responsible for employing the worker until the claim was processed or the\nworker had returned to the old or a new job.\nReforms at the front end of the process were accompanied by significant reforms in the\nlonger-term benefit program. All employers were made to pay for the full and permanent\ndisability program through a uniform pay-as-you-go premium rate. Employers also had to pay to\nfund the publicly run partial disability program, but they could opt out of it by enrolling their\nworkers with a private insurer instead. Either way, employers had to pay experience-rated\npremiums that covered the first ten years of partial disability benefit receipt. After ten years, the\n19\n\nfinancial burden would shift to the uniform pay-as-you-go rates that also cover the fully and\npermanently disabled and the stock of current beneficiaries under the old system.\nBorghans et al. (2014) provide evidence that the reduction in benefits for current Dutch\ndisability insurance recipients in the reforms of 1992–1993 have led to both their increased use\nof alternative social welfare programs and greater earnings from employment over the next\ndecade. They argue that, on average, increased income from these two alternative sources fully\noffset the cut in their DI benefits. While it is still too early to determine the full effect of more\nrecent policy changes on the Dutch disability beneficiary population, Van Sonsbeek and Gradus\n(2011) provide the first micro-simulation of the consequences of the post-2002 round of policy\nchanges discussed above. They estimate that the combined impact of the introduction of\nexperience rating together with the introduction of the statutory Gatekeeper Protocol and stricter\nexaminations will reduce the projected long-term number of disability beneficiaries by 600,000.\nThey project that the introduction of the new WIA scheme will further reduce that number by\n250,000 by 2040, as compared with a no-change scenario. Koning and Lindeboom (2015)\nprovide the most recent view of the consequences of the Dutch disability reforms on program\nenrollment and a review of the literature on this topic.\nOverall, research on the effectiveness of the Dutch disability reforms supports the ideas\nthat policy design matters for the outcomes of individuals with impairments and suggests that,\nwith assistance, many workers who experience a health shock can remain productively in the\nlabor market.\n3.3 Sweden\n20\n\nLike most European nations Sweden has a long-standing first-tier universal needs-based\ncash transfer program that provides a guaranteed social minimum income floor to all its citizens.\nThis first-tier protection is funded out of general revenue and is available to everyone who lives\nor works in Sweden. Although benefits provide minimum income to anyone in need, applicants\napply for benefits based on income and particular circumstances, such as disability, parental\nneeds, or old age. Benefits are set nationally and indexed to keep pace with the price level.\nSweden also provides second- and third-tier benefits. The second tier in Sweden includes\nunemployment insurance benefits, which include both a mandatory and voluntary component.\nThe mandatory component is paid for by all employers and replaces a minimum fraction of\nwages for covered workers. The number of weeks covered by unemployment insurance has\nfluctuated over time but is generally longer than in the United States. Most individuals also are\ncovered by voluntary unemployment insurance that is negotiated between firms and trade unions.\nSomewhat uniquely among the countries we review, Sweden also has many private options for\nunemployment insurance; these may be purchased individually or through an employer.\nSweden provides third-tier benefits, including old-age pensions and sickness and\ndisability benefits, through a combination of programs. For those with an earnings history the\nbulk of the protection is provided based on a social insurance program that, as in the United\nStates, is financed by statutory employer and employee contributions. Many employers in\nSweden also pay into occupational-based insurance and pension programs on behalf of their\nemployees. Participation in these schemes is driven by competitive forces or collective\nbargaining agreements with unions but a majority of employers in Sweden participate in these\nprograms. See Table 2 for more details about the Swedish disability system.\n21\n\nAs in the Netherlands, the Swedish disability program was relatively generous and\nexpanding rapidly in the 1970s (see Table 1). The first level of protection for Swedish workers\nwith health problems is a sickness benefit. In the 1970s, sickness benefits replaced about 90\npercent of expected earnings for individuals with “abnormal physical or mental conditions” that\nreduced their normal work capacity by at least 25 percent. Workers claiming sickness absence\nfor more than eight days were required to get a certificate from a doctor. This was primarily\nfacilitated by the individual’s doctor with no centralized screening or standards.\nAfter one year, employees still receiving benefits could apply for long-term disability\ninsurance. Workers with functional limitations that caused a reduction in their capacity to\nperform work commensurate with their job training and work history were eligible for disability\nbenefits. Benefits were awarded for partial (50 percent) and full disability. For those under age\n60, benefits included rehabilitation and vocational training. For those 60 and older, beneficiaries\nwere provided income support. Like sickness benefits, disability benefits were very generous,\nreplacing the vast majority of expected lost earnings.\nOver the course of the 1970s, standards for obtaining long-term disability benefits were\nalso loosened to make it easier for the long-term unemployed to move onto the program. For\nworkers of all ages, unemployment spells of more than one year were added to the list of criteria\nconsidered in the disability screening process. For workers over age 60, long-term\nunemployment became a sufficient condition for moving onto disability benefits, even without a\ncertifiable functional limitation. Similar to the Dutch case, these changes meant that the\n22\n\ndisability benefit program was increasingly being used as a very generous long-term\nunemployment insurance program.18\nGenerous benefits and easier access correlated with steady growth in disability recipiency\nrates over the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 3, Panel C). These features also left the program\nvulnerable to growth related to the serious recession in the early 1990s. As shown in Figure 3,\nPanel C, following the foreign exchange crisis in 1990 and ensuing deep recession, disability\nrecipiency rates surged. Policymakers responded by lowering the replacement rates on sickness\nbenefits, making employers pay for the first 14 days of sickness absence, and removing the pure\nlabor market criteria for disability benefits for older workers. With these changes to policy and\nan improving economy, disability recipiency rates stabilized for most of the rest of the decade.\nThat said, they remained quite high and at a level that policymakers argued was unsustainable.\nAs such, additional policy reforms were made throughout the 1990s. These reforms were\ndesigned to increase the employer cost of worker sickness absence and increase the threshold for\nworkers applying for sickness and/or disability benefits.19\nFacing increasing fiscal pressures and a renewal of disability recipiency rate growth\n(Figure 3, Panel C), in 2000 the Swedish government proposed much more sweeping reforms to\nthe sickness and disability system. Despite considerable opposition from various advocacy\ngroups, significant reforms were put into place over the remainder of the decade. The driving\n18Econometric studies of the Swedish system support this view. See for example Rebick (1994),\nLarsson (2002).\n19The Swedish government made numerous changes to sickness benefit replacement rates, the\nnumber of days the employer paid for employee sickness absence, and the number of days the\nworker had to wait before receiving sickness benefits (Andren, 2003). In addition, policymakers\nremoved most of the special allowances for disability insurance afforded to unemployed and\nolder workers Jönsson et al. (2011).\n23\n\nprinciple behind the reforms was that work support, rather than cash assistance in lieu of work,\nwas the primary goal of disability policy.\nThis general principle translated into a number of important specific reforms. In 2003, the\ngovernment merged the sickness benefits and disability systems and began a series of changes to\nstandardize and enforce the administration of these now joint systems. Most notable among them\nwas the centralization of screening processes. Up until this point, certification for sickness\nbenefits had been variable as had disability benefit allowance rates. Although rehabilitation and\nvocational training were goals, many doctors and regional disability gatekeepers focused on\nproviding income support rather than employment retraining. By centralizing the process and\ndeveloping standardized protocols for granting cash benefits, policymakers were better able to\nregulate the gatekeepers and enforce the strategy of promoting participation in work before\noffering cash benefits. Although it is too early to judge its effectiveness, the idea is that this\nstandardization will temper the link between regional economic conditions and disability\nrecipiency that had historically been present.\nIn addition to standardizing the screening process, the merger of the sickness and\ndisability programs forced disability gatekeepers to become actively involved early in the\nprocess. By getting vocational and rehabilitation experts involved early at the sickness benefit\nstage, policymakers intended to stem the flow of new applicants to the long-term disability\nprogram. To aid in this process, sickness benefits were capped at one year, and beneficiaries\nwere evaluated for work ability at 180 days of absence. Only those who could show that they had\nno capacity to perform any job were allowed to remain on the program for the full year. In\naddition, employers were required to work with disability administrators to create a rehabilitation\nplan. And gatekeepers were given the power to demand that employers provide certification\n24\n\nabout the types of accommodations they made for the worker. In the aftermath of these reforms,\nthe use of sickness benefits declined as did the flow of new beneficiaries into the long-term\ndisability system. This correlation between policy changes and declines in benefit use, to our\nknowledge, has not been causally established in published research.\nIn 2008 the Swedish government undertook an additional series of reforms to its sickness\nand long-term disability programs (these reforms are detailed in Hartman 2011 and OECD\n2009). These reforms were meant to further curb growth in the rolls and more actively return\nnewly impaired workers back to the labor market. The 2008 reforms went beyond engaging\ngatekeepers and employers and focuses on individuals with disabilities. New rules were aimed at\nstrengthening the incentives for individuals with disabilities to work and improving their\nopportunities to do so. The principal reform was the establishment of a new timeline for the\nprovision of rehabilitation services under the sickness absence program, with checkpoints closely\naligned with assessment of work capacity and a reduction of the cash value of sickness benefits\nfor those who did not return to work. In addition to adding more checkpoints, the reforms also\nfront-loaded the evaluations so that they were being done at 3-, 6-, and 12-month increments.\nThe earlier checkpoints provided rehabilitation, counseling, and assessment much closer to the\nonset of an impairment when return to work was more likely.\nAfter the reforms, new sickness program entrants returned to work more quickly and\nreduced their overall time on the program (Hartman 2011). In contrast, few of those already on\nthe sickness program when the new reforms were initiated ever returned to work. When their\nsickness benefits ended they simply moved onto other social assistance programs. These findings\nprovide support for the idea that early intervention matters. Waiting even one year following the\nonset of impairment significantly reduces the chance that rehabilitation will result in a return to\n25\n\nwork. The disability reforms put in place by the Swedish government late in the 2000s appear to\nhave helped curb growth in disability recipiency rates in the nation (Figure 3, Panel C).\n3.4 The U.S. Experience\nUnlike the three EU countries discussed above, the United States has no first-tier\nuniversal needs-based cash transfer program that provides a guaranteed social minimum income\nfloor to all its citizens. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which is limited to the\naged, disabled adults, and parents of disabled children, is the only long-term needs-based cash\ntransfer program.20, 21 The only other major categorical needs-based cash transfer program in the\nUnited States is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which is targeted at single\nmothers, provides an even lower guaranteed income level, and limits the guarantee to five years.\nThe second tier in the United States includes unemployment insurance benefits, which\nreplace a fraction of wages for covered workers for short periods of time. In normal economic\ntimes, unemployment benefits can last up to 26 weeks. During recessions, this maximum is often\nextended, and it rose to 99 weeks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Unemployment\ninsurance benefits are generally higher than SSI or TANF benefits.\nThe social security old-age retirement insurance (OAI) and disability insurance (DI)\nprograms make up the third tier of benefits in the United States; they provide social insurance to\n20SSI is similar in design to the Dutch categorical disability-based welfare program (Wajong),\nbut its income guarantee level is substantially lower.\n21The SSI aged and disabled adult programs share the same categorical eligibility criteria applied\nfor the earnings-based retirement or Old-Age Insurance (OAI) and Disability Insurance (DI)\nprograms. Individuals with sufficiently low earnings records may jointly qualify for OAI and SSI\naged benefits and for DI and SSI disabled adult benefits. This said, these programs are generally\ntreated separately by policymakers.\n26\n\nworkers who have paid social security taxes over their working life.22 To be eligible for benefits,\nworkers must have accumulated sufficient quarters of coverage, as defined in the Social Security\nAdministration’s (SSA) pension rules. These requirements are sufficiently strict to limit OAI and\nDI benefits to those with substantial attachments to the labor market. (For a summary of the\nbenefit requirements and rules, see SSA 2013b.) Benefit levels from these programs are based on\npast earnings and can be substantially higher than the social minimum level of benefits\nguaranteed by the SSI aged and disability programs.\nEligibility for DI benefits requires applicants to meet a federal disability standard applied\nby administrative evaluators and adjudicators located in each state. The criteria are in principle\nquite strict. Eligibility requires that a worker be “unable to perform any substantial gainful\nactivity on any job in the economy for at least one year.” There is no benefit for partial disability.\nDisability benefits are intended to be a last resort for those with permanent and total\nimpairments. See Table 2 for more details on the U.S. DI program.\nAlthough the written eligibility criteria have not changed over time, their implementation\nhas changed in a direction that has increased the number of working-aged adults receiving\ndisability benefits. Indeed, many of the disability recipiency rate fluctuations shown in Figure 1\nand Table 1 line up with changes in SSA policy that made it easier or harder to gain entry to the\nDI rolls. For example, rapid disability recipiency rate growth in the 1970s aligns with\nCongressional actions that increased the replacement rate for a disabled worker with median\nearnings from 35 to 49 percent (Figure 3, Panel D). In the late 1970s and early 1980s disability\nrecipiency rates fell, first because program gatekeepers were urged to interpret existing rules\nmore strictly, and then because Congress in 1980 required the SSA to reevaluate all current\n22 Autor et al. (2014) provide a detailed analysis and discussion of the private disability insurance\nmarket in the United States, which is significantly smaller than the private market in Germany.\n27\n\nrecipients to see if they still met the medical standards. This rule change, which was rigorously\nenforced by the SSA at the start of the new Reagan administration, resulted in a drop in the DI\nrolls despite a major recession—the substantial drop in normalized adjusted disability recipiency\nrates in the United States between 1978 and 1983 are in stark contrast to the sizable growth in\nthese values before 1978 and after 1990 (Figure 3, Panel D).\nBy 1983 the widespread reevaluation of those already on DI was halted as the courts and\nthen Congress restricted the SSA’s power to reevaluate beneficiaries. Furthermore, in 1984,\nresponding to a backlash against restrictive cuts imposed in the Social Security Disability\nAmendments of 1980, policymakers expanded the ways in which a person could medically\nqualify for the DI program. The 1984 legislation moved away from a strict medical listing\ndetermination of eligibility to one that also considered an applicant’s overall medical condition\nand ability to work. In addition, the legislation allowed for symptoms of mental illness and pain\nto be counted when assessing DI eligibility, regardless of whether the person had a verifiable\nmedical diagnosis (Figure 3, Panel D).23\nThe expansion of eligibility to impairments that were more difficult to measure and do\nnot precisely meet the medical listings means that SSA has increasingly been tasked with making\nmore subjective decisions about the impact that presenting impairments might have on an\napplicant’s work ability. For applicants who do not meet or exceed the medical listings, program\nadministrators consider a set of vocational criteria. While these vocational criteria have been in\nplace over the history of the DI program, their use by program gatekeepers to determine benefit\neligibility has risen dramatically since 1991. Currently, they are used to justify the majority of\nnew awards, especially among those with the more difficult to determine conditions of mental\n23See Berkowitz and Burkhauser (1996) for more discussion of these changes and their effects.\n28\n\nillness and musculoskeletal conditions—the primary condition of more than 50 percent of all\nnewly enrolled beneficiaries (Burkhauser and Daly, 2011).\nOne consequence of expanding eligibility beyond identifiable medical listings is that DI\napplicants and gatekeepers have much more of a role in determining program growth. For\nexample, over time the cyclical sensitivity of DI application rates has risen considerably.\nApplications rise during recessions and fall during periods of economic growth (see Rupp and\nStapleton, 1995; Stapleton et al. 1998; Black et al. 2002; Autor and Duggan, 2003; Liebman,\n2015). But as can be seen in Figure 3, Panel D, increased applications generally result in an\nincrease in disability recipiency rates which do not subside as economic conditions improve\nsince, once they enter, very few beneficiaries ever leave the program.\nIn addition to the cyclical sensitivity of disability applications and awards, evidence has\nshown a secular rise in the number of workers who apply over time related to the unintentional\nincrease in the replacement rates of DI for low-wage workers (Autor and Duggan, 2003). Bound\nand Burkhauser (1999) provide an early review of the literature on the labor supply effects of\ndisability insurance. Since then researchers have consistently found a negative effect of DI\nprogram work constraints on employment—see especially Chen and van der Klaauw (2008) and\nvon Wachter et al. 2011. Again, since few beneficiaries ever leave the rolls to return to work, the\nsurge in disability recipient rates associated with business cycle fluctuations or economic\nrestructuring has generally translated into a long-term increase in disability recipiency rates in\nthe working-age population.\nFinally, there is evidence that the strictness of DI gatekeepers also varies. Using SSA\nadministrative records, Maestas et al. (2013) estimate that 23 percent of applicants are initially\naccepted or denied based on whether they were assigned an easier or a stricter Disability\n29\n\nDetermination Services gatekeeper rather than on differences in the status of their health or\nimpairment status.\n3.5 Why Has the German Experience Been So Different?\nAs seen in Figure 1 and discussed above, recipiency rates in Germany’s WDP program\nfell between 1984 and reunification in 1989 and have almost continuously done so since then.\nThis pattern stands in contrast to the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States where\nrecipiency rates have increased considerably since the 1970s. While the rates in the Netherlands\nand Sweden have come down from recent peaks of 7.4 percent in 2003 (Netherlands) and 9.6\npercent in 2005 (Sweden) they reached a new record high of 4.2 percent in the United States in\n2011. As a result Germany now has the lowest recipiency rates of government-provided\ndisability insurance benefits among these four nations.\nWhat accounts for the decline in Germany both in its rates over time and relative to other\ncountries? Our read of the data is that the relatively restrictive coverage and eligibility conditions\nthat Germany has imposed over time have shifted the costs of disability insurance coverage,\nespecially since 2001, to individuals and their employers. This shift is evident in the fact that\nover 60 percent of male and 40 percent of female employees contract for private disability\ninsurance to augment their public insurance coverage. In addition, WDP benefits, when\navailable, have declined in value over time. This reduction in the social safety net for workers\nwith disabilities has been cited as contributing to the high poverty rates among public disability\nbeneficiary households (Krause et al. 2013).\nAnother more positive reason for the decline is that Germany has increasingly moved\ntowards a model of “rehabilitation before pension,” emphasizing the overall focus on\n30\n\nmaintaining work ability. As a result, Germany has one of the largest medical rehabilitation\nmarkets. In 2011, 1.9 million rehabilitation therapies were prescribed, and a total of €8.9 billion\nis spent annually (cf. Ziebarth, 2010b, 2014). This commitment to rehabilitating workers while\nthey are receiving temporary earning replacement as part of their sickness benefits may have\nplayed a role in curbing growth in the WDP program.\nFinally, the German social insurance scheme is part of a larger context of protection and\nexpectations for workers with disabilities. Germany has a coexisting Disability Classification\nSystem (DCS) which is codified in Social Code Book IX (SGB IX) and entitled “Rehabilitation\nand Participation of Handicapped Workers.”24 This DCS system identifies citizens with health\nimpairments and assigns them a handicap rating by medically based impairment categories. Only\npermanent health impairments lead to a classification. For example, a mild form of Parkinson’s\ndisease without balance issues but with “mild motion disorders” yields a disability degree of 30–\n40 percent whereas more severe forms of Parkinson’s lead to degrees of 50 percent and above\n(BMAS, 2009). A person with a rating of 50 percent and above is officially classified as\n“severely handicapped.”25 The SGB IX then provides disadvantage compensation\n(Nachteilsausgleich) for severely handicapped people such as special income tax deductions, the\nability to retire two years earlier without deductions, and parking lots for wheelchair users.\nEffectively, all WDP beneficiaries are eligible for these benefits without any loss of WDP\nbenefits before retirement since WDP is not means tested.26\n24 Before 2001, this was the Schwerbehindertengesetz.\n25 People with handicap ratings from 30 to 50 percent who have difficulty finding a job can apply\nfor the workplace quota system described below.\n26 Aarts et al. (1998) and Börsch-Supan and Jürges (2012) discuss pathways from early\nretirement to full retirement in the German system. Börsch-Supan and Jürges (2012) focus\nexclusively on Germany and provide a detailed discussion of its pathways to retirement. Unlike\nthe WDP, Nachteilsausgleich offers those defined as severely handicapped a pathway to\n31\n\nIn fact, almost 1 million people who are officially classified as severely handicapped\nwork full time in Germany (BA, 2014). This outcome may be related, at least partly, to the quota\nsystem that mandates employers with more than 19 full-time employees to ensure that at least 5\npercent of their employees are classified as severely handicapped. Employers not complying\nwith the quota must pay a monthly penalty (Ausgleichsabgabe) of €290 per unoccupied\nworkplace. This effectively means that a small business with 20 full-time employees has to hire\none severely handicapped worker or pay an annual penalty of $4,500. Lalive et al. (2013), using\ndata from Austria, which has a similar quota system, show that it significantly increases the\nemployment of handicapped people.27\n4. What Can We Learn from These Experiences?\nAn important issue for policymakers in all countries facing the challenges of providing\nprotection for workers with disabilities is that disability programs, even if not generous, are\nessential income for many individuals. In countries where other components of the social safety\nnet are weaker or less generous, disability benefit programs are even more difficult to challenge.\nThe U.S. experience highlights this point.\nHowever, the policy outcomes of Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden we have\ndiscussed show that this is a very static view. It assumes that in the absence of benefits,\nindividuals with disabilities would remain out of the labor market, dependent on other forms of\npublic or private assistance for support. Disability reforms in these countries over the past decade\nretirement two years earlier than non-handicapped people without actuarial penalty. In the\ncontext of the three-tier system we view this option as a tier 1 benefit equal to the deductions that\nare typically applied in case of early retirement, i.e., 7.2 percent of the last wage.\n27Unlike for other countries, there is a notable absence of research on the German disability\nsystem and in particular the behavioral effects of policy choices.\n32\n\nprovide suggestive empirical support that increased employment will occur when pro-work\npolicies replace policies that have had the opposite effect. Their reform experiences show that a\nsignificant number of people with disabilities, who would otherwise have moved onto long-term\ncash benefits, were able, with reasonable levels of support, to return to work (OECD, 2010).\nWhile it is always the case that tightening the criteria for disability benefits runs the risk of\ndenying disability benefits to those who will not be able to find work, on balance the EU\nexperience suggests that reasonable pro-work policies will both substantially reduce disability\nrecipiency rates and increase the employment of those who would otherwise have been on the\nlong-term disability rolls.\nAnother concern is that programs like disability insurance are especially important in\neconomic downturns when individuals with limited work capacity are not only more likely to be\nlaid off but are less likely to find a new job. Past experience of EU countries, especially\nGermany and the Netherlands, that intentionally or unintentionally used this logic to turn their\nlong-term disability programs into more general unemployment programs, suggests that it can be\na very expensive and ultimately ineffective policy decision. Indeed, many EU nations continue to\nstruggle to regain control over their disability systems which for many decades have been used\nas long-term unemployment insurance programs. A key message from the EU experience is that\nexplicitly divorcing long-term “unemployability” insurance from disability insurance is critical\nto effectively target resources towards both populations.\nTogether the experiences of other nations suggest that it is possible to balance the\ncompeting goals of providing social insurance against adverse health shocks and maximizing the\nwork effort of all working-age adults with and without disabilities. Past disability policies in both\nthe United States and EU countries have focused more on the former than the latter, resulting in\n33\n\nrapid growth in disability transfer populations that outpaced growth in the economy. Efforts to\nshift to more pro-work policies over the past decade in Europe suggest that fundamental\ndisability reforms, if done well, can lower projected long-term costs for taxpayers, ease the job of\ndisability administrators, and importantly, improve the short- and long-run opportunities of\npeople with disabilities.\n34\n\nReferences\nAarts, Leo J.M., Richard V.

We assess how they and their families fared during the long economic expansion that\nfollowed the Great Recession of 2007-09, using data from the monthly Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) and the March CPS annual income supplement. We find that the expansion\nbolstered the well-being of people with disabilities and in particular their relative labor market\nengagement. We also find that applications and awards for federal disability benefits fell during\nthe expansion. On balance, our results suggest that sustained economic growth can bolster the\nlabor market engagement of people with disabilities and potentially reduce their reliance on\ndisability benefits.\nKeywords: Disability, employment, income, program participation\nJEL codes: J14, J11, J18\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nThe Economic Status of People with Disabilities\nand their Families since the Great Recession\nI. Introduction\nPeople with disabilities face significant barriers to sustained employment and stable,\nadequate income. Severe physical or cognitive impairments often prevent work and can lead to\npersistent or permanent receipt of government assistance via disability benefit programs. Less\nsevere impairments may not completely preclude work but nonetheless sharply limit it. As such,\npeople with disabilities often struggle to maintain labor market engagement and obtain adequate\nincomes for themselves and their families. In other words, people with disabilities face\nchallenges to leading comfortable “working class” lives.\nIn this paper, we examine the economic status of people with disabilities since the Great\nRecession of 2007-09. We focus in particular on whether their relative economic status and labor\nmarket engagement improved during the unusually long expansion and historically tight labor\nmarket reached near its end, as has been found for other disadvantaged groups, though not all\n(Aaronson et al. 2019, Akee 2021, Finlay and Mueller-Smith 2021). Trends and cyclical patterns\nin the status of people with disabilities are important in part because of the costs of federal\ndisability benefit programs. Past research suggests that rising incidence of disability claims in\nprior decades reflects adverse labor market developments and the rising value of disability\npayments relative to wages (Case and Deaton 2015, Autor and Duggan 2003). Declining\ndisability benefit claims and program participation in recent years suggest that this trend may\nhave been offset or reversed by the long expansion.\nWe conduct our analyses using data on self-reported disability status from the monthly\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) and the CPS ASEC annual income supplement. We also use\nPage 3 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nadministrative data on applications and awards for receipt of federal disability benefits,\nspecifically Social Security Disability Insurance benefits (SSDI) and Supplemental Security\nIncome (SSI).\nOur results indicate that the overall well-being of people with disabilities improved\nsubstantially during the most recent economic expansion (as suggested in Shambaugh and Strain\n2021), particularly by comparison with their more limited gains during the 1990s expansion. Our\nanalyses of state panel data indicate that strong labor market conditions that lead to increases in\noverall labor force participation substantially bolster labor market engagement for people with\ndisabilities relative to those without. We also examine applications and awards for receipt of\nfederal disability benefits and find that they respond to changes in aggregate economic\nconditions but show somewhat less responsiveness to changes in economic conditions at the state\nlevel.\nThe monthly CPS data currently extend through late 2020 and hence enable a partial,\ninitial assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and recession on people with\ndisabilities. The crisis to date has not undermined the relative labor market engagement of people\nwith disabilities, and we do not observe increased applications for disability claims, though\nprocessing delays could be a key explanation.\nII. Disability Definitions and Trends\nA. CPS Disability Data\nTo conduct our analysis of self-reported disability, we use microdata from the Basic\nMonthly Current Population Survey (CPS), the source of U.S. official household labor force\nstatistics. The CPS collects a host of labor force and demographic data. To focus on disability\nPage 4 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nduring prime working years, we restrict our CPS analyses to individuals between 25 and 61 years\nof age. This represents a slight expansion of the conventional prime-age range of 25 to 54 years\nof age, thereby incorporating more individuals who report disability late in their working lives\nbut whose employment choices are not directly affected by eligibility for conventional Social\nSecurity retirement benefits.\nOur primary measure of disability is constructed using self-reported status from the CPS\nsix-question disability sequence. Collected consistently since mid-2008, the six-question\nsequence is a series of disability-related questions that is posed to all survey respondents when\nthey enter their 4-month CPS sample rotations. Following standard practice, we identify\nrespondents as people with disabilities when they answer “yes” to at least one of the six\nquestions from the sequence.\nAs a second measure of disability, since 1981 the March CPS survey has included a\nquestion about work-limiting disabilities for all household members. We rely less heavily on this\nmeasure because in 2015 the wording of the question shifted from current disability status to\ndisability experienced at any time in the prior year, creating a sharp, discontinuous increase in\nreported disability midway through our analytical timeframe. We therefore use the 6-question\nsequence to identify people with disabilities in the main analysis. However, we use the work\nlimitation question for supplemental analyses of disability patterns in the 1990s, as discussed in\nthe next section.1\nTo measure economic well-being, we use detailed earnings and income data from the\nCPS Annual and Social Economic Supplement (ASEC), a supplement administered along with\n1 Burkhauser, Houtenville, and Tennant (2013) provide a useful assessment of alternative disability\nmeasures in CPS data and related sources.\nPage 5 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nthe basic monthly survey in March and adjacent months. The ASEC asks respondents what their\nearnings and income were during the prior calendar year, so our earnings and income tabulations\nrefer to the prior year rather than the survey year.\nFigure 1 displays disability incidence based on the measures discussed above. Panel A\ncompares the incidence of disability based on the monthly CPS six-question measure and the\nprior (“traditional”) and current work-limitation measures in the ASEC (all calculated from the\nMarch survey data). Self-reported disability ranges from about seven to ten percent of the\npopulation age 25 to 61, depending on the specific measure and year. The re-designed ASEC\nwork-limitation measure, based on disability status in the preceding calendar year, yields higher\nrates of self-reported disability than did the earlier ASEC measure or the six-question sequence,\nwhich both reflect disability status at the time of the survey. Compared with other sources,\ndisability incidence measured in the CPS tends to be lower than in panel surveys such as the\nPanel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Survey of Income and Program (Meyer and\nMok 2019).2 However, self-reported disability in the CPS generally exceeds disability incidence\nas measured by beneficiary counts for the SSDI and SSI programs.3\nPanel A of Figure 1 also shows that disability incidence calculated from the six-question\nsequence and traditional work limitation measures diverged during the early part of the recovery\nfrom the Great Recession, with little change for the former and an increase for the latter.\n2 For their PSID sample of male household heads age 22-61, Meyer and Mok (2019) found self-reported\ndisability incidence that was generally in the range of 12 to 15 percent for years that overlap with our\nsample period.\n3 This is one implication of the measurement issues discussed in Burkhauser, Houtenville, and Tennant\n(2013). Beneficiary counts for the SSDI and SSI programs are available on the Social Security\nAdministration website: https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/. The figures for\nDecember 2020 imply that less than 5 percent of the population under age 65 receives SSDI or SSI\nbenefits.\nPage 6 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nHowever, both the six-question measure and the re-designed work limitation measure show a\ndecline in disability incidence after 2014, as the economic expansion gained momentum and the\nlabor market tightened. This pattern raises the possibility that self-reported disability status\nresponds to economic conditions. Note however that the decline continued in 2020, when the\nlabor market weakened substantially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing decline in\nself-reported disability is even more apparent in Panel B of Figure 1, which displays disability\nincidence calculated from annual averages of the twelve monthly surveys (rather than just the\nMarch survey as in Panel A). Other factors beyond economic conditions may be contributing to\nthe recent decline in reported disability—for example, the recent easing of the U.S. opioid\nepidemic (Currie and Schwandt 2021), which may reduce self-reported disability associated with\nopioid dependence.\nB. Trends in Relative Economic Status of people with disabilities\nWe now turn to a comparison of economic status indicators between people with\ndisabilities and people without disabilities.\nIt is important to note first that although individuals with disabilities have low\nemployment rates, their broader economic status tends to place them among the working class\naccording to common definitions. For example, large fractions of our samples of individuals with\ndisabilities lack a college education and are in the bottom half of the distribution of household\nincome. For this reason, and to maintain acceptably large sample sizes for our analyses, we do\nnot trim our sample to conduct analyses based on a specific definition of the working class.\nTable 1 lists a set of key indicators of employment status and well-being for the years\n2009 and 2019, along with the change between those two years, for people with disabilities and\npeople without disabilities age 25-61. The long expansion following the Great Recession\nPage 7 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nproduced substantial benefits for people with disabilities and people without disabilities alike.\nFor both groups, the employment to population ratio rose meaningfully, the unemployment rate\ndropped sharply, and individual earnings and family income rose substantially in real terms. The\nimprovements were generally similar for the two groups. The exception is mean earnings when\nnon-earners are included. When non-earners are excluded, mean earnings are similar for the two\ngroups, which suggests that people without disabilities entered the earnings sample at the lower\nend of the earnings distribution. This is confirmed by the greater gains for people with\ndisabilities at the 10th and 25th percentiles of earnings relative to people without disabilities.\nWhile Table 1 shows similar gains for people with disabilities and people without\ndisabilities over the past decade, it reveals nothing about the pattern of changes within those\ntimeframes. Those patterns are displayed for selected indicators in Figures 2 and 3.4 The labor\nforce, earnings, and income series displayed generally show either steady gains or stagnation\nfollowed by a pronounced pickup starting around 2014. These patterns are similar for people\nwith disabilities and people without disabilities. Also, Figure 2 shows no deterioration in the\nrelative employment and unemployment rates of people with disabilities in 2020, despite the\nseverely adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor market conditions and general\nwell-being.5\nIt is informative to compare the experience of people with disabilities during the recent\nexpansion to their experience during the 1990s expansion, which was nearly as long as the more\nrecent expansion and produced a similarly tight labor market. Accordingly, Table A1 in the\n4 Figures for the remaining indicators in Table 1 are in a supplemental appendix available from the\nauthors.\n5 This visual impression is confirmed by calculations using the exact numbers underlying the series\ndisplayed in the two panels of Figure 2.\nPage 8 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nincluded appendix reproduces Table 1 for the period 1991-2000, using the work limitation\nmeasure available in the ASEC during that period.6 The table shows that people with disabilities\ngenerally fared poorly during the 1990s, particularly by comparison with the solid improvements\nenjoyed by people without disabilities. A more detailed comparison of the two periods is beyond\nthe scope of this paper. However, earlier research documented the limited gains for people with\ndisabilities in the 1990s and attributed it in part to the restraining impact of the 1990 Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA) on employers’ willingness to hire people with disabilities, along\nwith rapid expansion of the SSDI program during that decade (Burkhauser, Daly, and\nHoutenville 2001, Acemoglu and Angrist 2001, Autor and Duggan 2003). By contrast, our\nfinding of substantial gains for people with disabilities during the past decade is consistent with\nrecent findings for other disadvantaged groups.7\nIII. Cyclical Patterns in Disability Status and Employment/Income\nThe descriptive time-series evidence discussed in the prior section is suggestive but not\ndefinitive regarding cyclical effects on the relative economic status of people with disabilities.\nTo conduct more formal analyses, we formed a state-by-year panel data set for the 50 states plus\nthe District of Columbia, which provides substantial additional variation in economic conditions\nthat we can leverage for estimation.8 This data set includes annual observations for the years\n2009-2019, using the complete set of 12 monthly CPS files for disability incidence and labor\n6 The changes measured in the 1990s are not exactly comparable to those measured for the past decade,\ndue to the change in disability measurement discussed above. However, the 1990s data enable a rough\ncomparison of the gains for people with disabilities during these two periods.\n7 Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019) found that job-finding rates for racial and ethnic minorities\nreached unusually high levels near the end of the most recent expansion.\n8 We calculated state/annual means by averaging individual observations within states using the labor\nforce weights in the basic monthly CPS and the annual supplement weights for the CPS ASEC.\nPage 9 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nforce statistics and the CPS ASEC for annual earnings and income data (income data for 2020\nwere not available at the time this paper was completed).\nTo get a sense of the variation in the data, Figure 4 shows scatter plots for the relationship\nin 2019 between state unemployment rates and: (i) disability incidence in Panel A; (ii) the\nemployment-to-population ratio of people with disabilities relative to people without disabilities\nin Panel B.9 As indicated by the fitted lines, disability incidence is higher and relative\nemployment of people with disabilities is lower in states with higher unemployment rates. The\nposition of individual states is largely mirrored in the two panels of Figure 4. For example, high\nunemployment states such as West Virginia and Mississippi also tend to have high incidence of\ndisability and low relative employment rates for people with disabilities, with the opposite\npattern evident for low unemployment rate states such as Colorado and Virginia.\nFor more formal results, we estimate regressions of the following form, using our state\npanel data:\n𝑌 (cid:3404) 𝛼 (cid:3397) 𝐿 𝛽(cid:3397) 𝑋 𝛾(cid:3397) 𝜑 (cid:3397) 𝛿 (cid:3397) 𝜖 (1)\n(cid:3046)(cid:3047) (cid:3046)(cid:3047) (cid:3046)(cid:3047) (cid:3046) (cid:3047) (cid:3046)(cid:3047)\nwhere Y represents the dependent variables described below, and s and t index state and time\n(year).10\n9 The employment-to-population ratio for people with disabilities is substantially lower for people with\ndisabilities in all states and years, hence this ratio of ratios is bounded between 0 and 1, with a mean value\nnear 0.4 in 2019.\n10 Because our primary dependent variables are measured as fractions and take values close to zero but\nbounded above it, we use the fractional regression methods developed in Papke and Wooldridge (1996,\n2008). Coefficients are reported as average marginal effects; we also measure the key explanatory\nvariables as fractions, so that the coefficients can be interpreted as the percentage point (fractional)\nchange in the outcome per percentage point (fractional) change in the explanatory variables. We report R-\nsquares calculated directly as the square of the covariance between actual and fitted values of the\ndependent variable. Observations are weighted by each state’s average labor force size over the sample\nPage 10 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nWe are primarily interested in the estimated coefficient β, which reflects the effects of\nalternative measures of state labor market conditions (L) as described below. We also account for\na set of other relevant time-varying state variables (X ), specifically a vector of age-by-gender\nst\npopulation shares.11 We include state fixed effects (φ ) in selected specifications as discussed\ns\nbelow, and all specifications include a complete set of year indicators (δ).\nt\nTable 2 reports regression results for the estimated cyclical effect β. Following Figure 4,\nPanel A uses the state unemployment rate as the measure of cyclical labor market conditions or\nslack. The 2019 cross-section regression results in columns 1 and 4 confirm the patterns evident\nin Figure 4. The average marginal effects indicate large impacts of differences in state\nunemployment rates on disability incidence and relative employment rates for people with\ndisabilities. The estimate in the first column of Panel A indicates that disability incidence varies\nacross states essentially in tandem with unemployment rates. The estimate in column 4 indicates\nthat relative employment rates of people with disabilities are higher by nearly three percentage\npoints for each percentage point reduction in the unemployment rate; this is a large effect but\nplausible by comparison with the wide variation in relative employment rates for people with\ndisabilities in our sample.12 These estimated effects are qualitatively similar but substantially\nsmaller in magnitude for the full panel specification in columns 2 and 5, and they are quite small\nand statistically insignificant in the specifications that include state fixed effects (columns 3 and\nperiod, and the standard errors are clustered by state. See Valletta, Bengali, and van der List (2020) for\nadditional details of the general estimation approach and reported statistics.\n11 The age groups are 16–24, 25–34, 35–54, 55–64, and 65 and over. These variables are included to\naccount for demographic features of each state that change over time and may affect overall disability\nincidence within the state.\n12 The standard deviations for the unemployment rate and relative employment measure are about 0.6 and\n6 percentage points in the 2019 cross-section and about 2.5 and 7 percentage points in the complete 2009-\n19 panel.\nPage 11 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\n6). The reduced size of the estimates in the full panel compared with the 2019 cross-section\nsuggests that persistent unmeasured features of state economies and populations cause states with\nhigh unemployment rates to also have high disability incidence and low relative employment\nrates for people with disabilities.\nGiven the sharp decline in labor force participation (LFP) during the Great Recession and\nsubsequent slow recovery, LFP may be a better indicator of labor market strength or slack than\nthe unemployment rate (Faberman et al. 2020). In Panel B of Table 2, we therefore replace the\nunemployment rate with the state labor force participation rate (age 16 and over). As expected,\nthe LFP variable produces opposite signed coefficients relative to the unemployment variables,\nbecause high LFP (unemployment) indicates a strong (weak) labor market. Importantly, the\nestimated coefficient on the LFP variable remains large and statistically precise in the column 6\nregression for relative employment rates, which includes state fixed effects. We place greatest\nemphasis on the fixed-effects specification. In these specifications, the coefficient of interest is\nlikely to reflect a true cyclical relationship rather than underlying state characteristics—e.g.,\nindustry and labor force composition or institutional features of state labor markets—that vary\nlittle over time but cause some states to have both weaker labor markets and less favorable\noutcomes for individuals with disabilities. The estimated effect in column 6 of Panel B (Table 2)\nis quite large: a one standard deviation difference in the LFP rate over our 2009-19 sample frame\n(about 3 percentage points) is associated with over a one-half standard deviation difference in the\nrelative employment rate for people with disabilities.\nWe also estimated the same specification for the broad set of income and earnings\nvariables discussed earlier and listed in Table 1. We found very little evidence that these\nPage 12 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nmeasures of the relative economic well-being of people with disabilities respond to variation in\nlabor market slack and hence do not list those results here.13\nOverall, our analyses using state panel data indicate that the labor market engagement of\npeople with disabilities relative to people without disabilities is affected by labor market\nconditions, particularly labor force participation rates. This likely reflects unique cyclical\nmovements in LFP rates during the most recent business cycle, including a sharp decline and\nsubsequent recovery for prime-age workers, which makes it a useful metric for assessing overall\nlabor market health (Faberman et al. 2020).\nIV. Disability Benefit Program Participation\nBolstering the employment engagement of people with disabilities may reduce their\nreliance on government disability benefits. In this section, we build on the results in the\npreceding section by assessing patterns in the use of disability insurance programs (SSDI and\nSSI) over the past decade.\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) pays benefits to individuals with extensive\nwork histories who develop a severe work-limiting disability. Because SSDI receipt tends to be\npersistent or permanent, and hence costly, the application process is extensive and often entails\nlengthy delays. SSDI protection is buttressed by Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which\nprovides payments to lower-income adults and children with disabilities regardless of work\nhistory, as well as to lower-income people aged 65 or older, typically on a temporary basis.14\n13 The results using LFP as the measure of labor market conditions are provided in a supplemental\nappendix that is available from the authors.\n14 These social insurance programs both offer recipients monthly cash benefits (that depend on prior work\nhistory and wages in the case of SSDI) after an applicant has been deemed eligible and meets the Social\nSecurity Administration’s criteria for having a disability.\nPage 13 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nThe majority of individuals who receive disability insurance benefits are not in the labor\nforce. However, trends in program use are relevant for understanding labor market outcomes for\nindividuals with disabilities because current decisions about disability program use have a large\neffect on future labor market status and thus economic outcomes: once an individual is awarded\na disability benefit, they tend to stay on the program and permanently leave the labor force.15 If\nchanges in labor market conditions influence the use of disability insurance programs, a recovery\nor recession can have lasting impacts on the economic well-being of people with disabilities (see\ne.g. Maestas, Mullen, and Strand 2015 and 2018, and Stapleton et al. 1998).\nOne reason that labor market conditions would be expected to affect disability insurance\nprogram use is that recessions increase the relative attractiveness of disability insurance relative\nto the outside option of staying in the labor force. Market wages may fall, and for the\nunemployed, so does the probability of finding a job. The prediction that an erosion of the\noutside option encourages disability insurance program use has been documented in a number of\nstudies (see e.g. Autor and Duggan 2003 and Black, Daniel, and Sanders 2002). The pattern of\napplications to the disability insurance programs over time, shown in Figure 5, fits this story.\nApplications appear to follow the cyclical pattern in the unemployment rate.16\nTo quantify the relationship between disability insurance program use and labor market\ncyclicality, we use state-by-month panel data aggregated to an annual frequency. These data are\nfrom the Social Security Administration (SSA) and represent state Disability Determination\n15 In 2018, over 85 percent of SSDI program terminations for beneficiaries with disabilities were due to\ndeath or to the beneficiary reaching retirement age (and thus transitioning to Social Security).\n16 Though not included in our analysis of the recovery from the 2007 – 2009 recession, applications to\nSSDI and SSI fell notably in 2020 (Figure 5), despite the onset of a sharp recession. This drop likely due\nto office closures and processing delays for the programs. Benefit awards for these programs also\ndeclined in 2020.\nPage 14 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nService workloads from October 2000 through December 2020. This data set gives applications,\ndeterminations, and allowances for the SSDI and SSI programs, and we sum the data across\nthese programs in our analysis.17\nWe use these data to estimate state panel regressions that are identical to those described\nin the preceding section, but with measures of disability program participation as the dependent\nvariables: specifically, the application rate (applications per 10 people age 25 – 64) and two\ndefinitions of awards rate (awards per 10 people age 25 – 64, and the number of awards per\ndetermination).\nOur main results in Table 3 yield two general conclusions: there is some cyclicality in\ndisability insurance program use, and time-invariant differences between states have substantial\nexplanatory power. Generally, our findings are consistent with existing research. The results in\nthe first two columns show that applications for disability insurance tend to rise with\nunemployment rates (consistent with prior work, such as Maestas, Mullen, and Strand 2015 and\n2018). However, adding state fixed effects (column 2) reduces the magnitude of the relationship\nsubstantially, an indication of the importance of persistent effects of state labor market or\ninstitutional features. We find that a 2.5 percentage point (roughly one standard deviation)\ndifference in state unemployment rates is associated with an increase in the application rate of\nabout 0.013 in column 1 and just under 0.01 when fixed effects are included in column 2. These\nare modest effects relative to the mean application rate of about 0.185 and the standard deviation\nof about 0.058.\n17 There are a few notable limitations with this data set. First, the data do not include applications that\nwere rejected after an initial eligibility screening. Second, claims include workers, spouses, and SSDI\nchild claimants, as opposed to (ideally) just workers. Finally, the data do not include full information\nabout appealed applications that were initially denied, which have been shown to ultimately generate a\nnon-trivial number of awards. See the supplemental appendix for additional details about the data.\nPage 15 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nTurning to initial awards, we do not find a cyclical pattern in awards as a fraction of the\npopulation (despite the aggregate time series in Figure 5 seeming to suggest one). However, we\ndo find that the award rate measured as the number of awards per determination is cyclically\nsensitive, as also documented in the existing research noted above.18 Our results show that a 2.5\npercentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with about a 0.023 (just over a\nthird of a standard deviation) decline in the award rate (which has a mean of 0.347). This\nestimate is substantially offset by the inclusion of state fixed effects in column 6, which reduces\nthe magnitude of the coefficient by more than half and eliminates its statistical significance.\nThese findings are broadly consistent with the interpretation that when labor markets weaken, the\nmarginal applicant is less likely to qualify for disability programs.19\nData limitations prevent a comparison to the 1990s expansion, but we can examine these\nsame relationships during the (shorter) expansion that followed the 2001 recession. During this\nrecovery, we find similar but slightly stronger evidence of cyclicality in disability program use\n(see Table A2 in the included appendix). This suggests that the cyclicality we find in the\nrecovery following the 2007-09 recession likely represents a general relationship between\ndisability program use and labor market conditions rather than unique features of that recovery.\nOur findings indicate that applications for disability insurance programs rose during the\n2007 – 2009 recession. The majority of individuals ultimately awarded benefits likely left the\nlabor market permanently. The permanence of these labor market exits may, in aggregate, limit\n18 Using awards per application yields similar results (available in the separate authors’ appendix).\n19 These findings are robust to a number of alternative specifications, including using OLS, adding\nmeasures of unemployment insurance availability and disability prevalence in the population, removal of\nregression weights, and using LFP in place of the unemployment rate (in the separate authors’ appendix).\nThe results using LFP have coefficients of roughly similar magnitudes, though opposite signs, compared\nto the statistically significant coefficients in Table 3. The LFP coefficients are not statistically significant\nwhen state fixed effects are included.\nPage 16 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nthe benefits of long economic expansions for people with persistent disabilities: as noted above,\nonce they enter the program, they typically do not exit later.\nRegarding the COVID-19 recession, the data through December 2020 show a sharp\ndecline in applications and awards, though this could reflect SSA office closures and backlogs\n(see the footnoted discussion of Figure 5 above). Simple cross-sectional correlations across all\nstates and months in 2020 are inconclusive, not showing evidence of significant correlations.\nWhether there will be a rise in applications as a result of the COVID-19 recession is yet to be\ndetermined.\nV. Discussion and Conclusions\nOur analyses of the employment and economic status of people with disabilities since the\nGreat Recession yields some encouraging findings. We find consistent and robust evidence that\nthe long labor market expansion, which caused a notable increase in prime-age labor force\nparticipation rates in recent years, bolstered the labor force engagement of individuals who self-\nidentify as having a disability. We also find somewhat weaker evidence that the long expansion\nled to reduced entry into government disability programs. Combined, these results suggest that\nsustained economic expansions can help improve the well-being of people with disabilities and\nreduce their reliance on public support programs. Slower population aging may already be easing\nthe growth in disability benefit rolls (Liebman 2015). Our results suggest that a sustained\neconomic expansion following the COVID-19 crisis could contribute to further improvements in\nthe economic well-being of people with disabilities.\nPage 17 of 29\n\nBengali-Daly-Lofton-Valletta, Disability\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

    "text": "Getting It Right: Meeting Uncertainty with Conditionality\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCommonwealth Club World Affairs of California\nSan Francisco, CA\nJune 24, 2024\n11 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nINTRODUCTION\nThank you, Alex for that kind introduction. And thank you to the Commonwealth Club World\nAffairs of California and the San Francisco Press Club for hosting this event. I’m really looking\nforward to a lively discussion.\nNow, the last time I was here, the world looked considerably different. It was November 2021,\nand we were still struggling to come out of the pandemic. Inflation was high, the labor market\nwas rebounding, and the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s primary interest rate tool,\nwas near zero.\nThings have clearly changed. The federal funds rate is now above 5 percent, inflation has\nreceded, although not completely, and the labor market has more than recovered and is now\nslowly moving towards a more sustainable level.\nThat’s a lot of improvement and we should acknowledge it. But we are not there yet. So, we\nmust continue the work of fully restoring price stability without a painful disruption to the\neconomy.\nToday, I will review where we stand and discuss what it will take to finish the job.1\nAs always, the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone\nelse in the Federal Reserve System.\n1 Board of Governors (2020).\n1\n\nCLOSING IN\nSo, where are we? Well, we are still in the fight to bring inflation to our 2 percent target. We’ve\nmade a lot of progress, but there is still work to do.\nAs this figure (Figure 1) shows, since March of 2022, when the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) began raising interest rates, inflation has come down substantially, from a bit over 7\npercent at its peak to just under 3 percent in the most recent readings. Importantly, as actual\ninflation has fallen, inflation expectations—what we all believe about the future—have followed\nsuit, confirming that households, businesses, and markets know that the Federal Reserve is\ncommitted to reaching its inflation goal.2\nFigure 1: Inflation and unemployment since March 2022\nPercent\nPCE inflation\n7\n6\n5\nSEP u* = 4.2%\n4\nMay\nUnemployment rate\n3\nApril\n2\n2% inflation goal\n1\n0\nMar‐22 Jun‐22 Sep‐22 Dec‐22 Mar‐23 Jun‐23 Sep‐23 Dec‐23 Mar‐24 Jun‐24\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe decline in inflation owes to many factors, including improvements in supply chains,\nproductivity, and labor force growth.3 Indeed, research by the San Francisco Fed shows that\nthese supply factors were a key reason inflation fell, especially early in the period.4\n2 Bundick and Smith (2024), Powell (2024).\n3 These improvements include spanned both goods and labor supply. Bernanke and Blanchard (2023, 2024), Guerrieri, et al. (2023), Shapiro\n(2024).\n4 In the 12 months following the first policy rate adjustment in March 2022, about two thirds of the decline in overall personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation was from supply‐driven inflation (based on the framework from Shapiro 2024). This share has fallen as demand\nfactors have risen in importance.\n2\n\nAs higher interest rates have taken hold, however, demand factors have become more\nimportant. Since the second half of last year, demand, rather than supply, has been the key\ndriver of falling inflation.5\nOf course, as demand has slowed, so has the labor market. And this has translated into slightly\nhigher unemployment as the blue line indicates. So far, however, the rise in unemployment has\nbeen modest compared with the decline in inflation. The unemployment rate currently sits just\nbelow what many judge as its longer‐run value, the level that reflects full employment.6\nIn other words, so far, so good. Both supply and demand have contributed to the decline in\ninflation. And progress has come without a significant disruption to the labor market.\nMonetary policy is working, but we need to finish the job.\nBALANCED GOALS\nAnd this will take balance.\nThe bumpiness of inflation data so far this year has not inspired confidence.7 Recent readings\nare more encouraging, but it is hard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price\nstability.\nAnd we can’t count on all the supply factors that helped us last year. Now that supply chains\nare largely mended, and domestic labor force participation has fully recovered, we are unlikely\nto get as much help from those forces. We have to remain open to positive supply\ndevelopments, but increasingly, restrained demand, rather than improved supply, will likely be\nneeded to get inflation down to target.\nAnd that brings the labor market into the conversation. As I showed earlier, so far, the labor\nmarket has adjusted slowly, and the unemployment rate has only edged up. But we are getting\nnearer to a point where that benign outcome could be less likely.\nAlthough job growth remains strong, most other measures of labor market conditions have\nreturned to their pre‐pandemic levels. In particular, the balance between the demand and\nsupply of workers has largely normalized.\n5 From March 2023 to April 2024, supply‐driven inflation only accounted for one‐fourth of the decline in overall PCE inflation.\n6 See the FOMC’s June 2024 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240612.htm).\n7 Research offers many reasons why progress on reducing inflation might be uneven. These include: the long and variable lags of the effects of\nmonetary policy on economic activity (Dupor 2023, Bengali and Arnaut 2024); changes in the relative importance of persistent versus transitory\nshocks to inflation (Stock and Watson 2007, Lansing 2022, Almuzara, Kocaoglu, and Sbordone 2023); and changes in the slope of the Phillips\ncurve that governs the responsiveness of inflation to changes in economic slack (Ball, Leigh, and Mishra 2022, Harding, Lindé, and Trabandt\n2023, Benigno and Eggertsson 2023, and Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky‐Nadeau 2023).\n3\n\nAn easy way to see this is in something called the Beveridge curve (Figure 2), a curve that’s\nreceived a lot of attention of late. It captures the relationship between job vacancies (demand\nfor workers) and unemployment (supply of workers).8\nThe black line in the figure is the historical path of the curve.9 The dots show the history in gray\nand the more recent experience in red.\nFigure 2: Beveridge curve (unemployment and job vacancies)\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics and FRBSF Staff calculations.\nLooking at the top of the red dots, you can see that in the aftermath of pandemic lockdowns,\nfirms posted historically large numbers of job vacancies. Firms were scrambling, if you\nremember, trying to manage hiring and turnover to meet ever‐surging consumer demand.\nVacancies rose rapidly, firms chased a limited pool of workers, and the labor market felt\nfrenzied. In Beveridge curve terms, we moved up the steep portion of the curve.\nThen, as interest rates rose and things became less frenzied, vacancies reversed. Firms settled\ndown, posted fewer jobs, and we moved back down the Beveridge curve. All of this occurred\n8 Updated from Bok, et al. (2022).\n9 The model is fitted on January 1999 through February 2020 data.\n4\n\nwithout a significant increase in unemployment—as shown by the lower red dots.10 At this\npoint, we have a good labor market, but not a frothy one.\nGoing forward, this tradeoff may not be as favorable. The latest job market data, the large red\ndot (April 2024), shows that we are getting very near the flatter portion of the Beveridge curve.\nThis means that future labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms\nneed to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.11\nAll this is to say that at this point, inflation is not the only risk we face. We will need to keep our\neyes on both sides of our mandate—inflation and full employment—as we work to achieve our\ngoals.\nSCENARIO PLANNING\nSo, what does this mean for policy? Simply put, we need to be vigilant and open.\nWe have two goals, one tool, and a lot of uncertainty. So, being definitive and predetermined is\nnot that helpful.\nWhat is helpful, is planning. Evaluating scenarios that could play out and understanding how\npolicy should respond.\nIn other words, to be appropriate, policy has to be conditional. And we have to think in\nscenarios.\nFor example, if inflation turns out to fall more slowly than projected, then holding the federal\nfunds rate higher for longer would be appropriate. If instead, inflation falls rapidly, or the labor\nmarket softens more than expected, then lowering the policy rate would be necessary. Finally,\nif we continue to see gradual declines in inflation and a slow rebalancing in the labor market,\nthen we can normalize policy over time, as many expect.\nThe truth is any of these scenarios are in the realm of reasonable—they are all possible.\nAnd we need to be ready to respond to however the economy evolves.\n10 The possibility of this adjustment via vacancy reductions rather than unemployment increases was discussed in Figura and Waller (2022) and\nBok, et al. (2022).\n11 Moreover, the economy may also be moving onto a flatter portion of the Phillips curve, implying it will take a larger upward movement in\nlabor market slack to achieve further downward movements in the inflation rate. See Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022), Harding, Lindé, and\nTrabandt (2023), Benigno and Eggertsson (2023), Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky‐Nadeau (2023), and Furman (2024).\n5\n\nPEOPLE WANT BOTH\nLet me end where I started. This is not 2021, or 2022, or even 2023. We are in a very different\nplace. Inflation has come down, the labor market is solid, and businesses and households\nbelieve that we can finish the job.\nBut we’re not there yet.\nWhether you call it the final mile, completing the work, or simply delivering fully on our dual\nmandate goals, there is more to do.\nBut we will need to exhibit care. To really thrive, people need both price stability and jobs.\nI know this from my own experience. I grew up in Ballwin, Missouri in the 1970s, the last period\nof high inflation. In my world, many people struggled. Inflation imposed a corrosive tax,\neroding earnings, making it hard to pay bills or invest in anything other than the day to day.\nWorst of all, there was no end in sight.12\nThe Volcker disinflation remedied that. But the medicine was harsh. And my family, and\nmillions of other American families, went from being constrained by high inflation to hampered\nby job loss.\nLooking back, that medicine seemed necessary, reflecting the specific circumstances of the\ntime.\nBut we are not in that world. The Federal Reserve has credibility that it didn’t back then.13\nPeople know the Fed will bring inflation down.\nAll of this means that our journey today can be different. Not just avoiding a painful recession,\nbut balancing policy to protect full employment while restoring price stability.\nThat is the economy we are striving for, and that is the one we are working to deliver.\n12 Inflation expectations in advance of the Volcker disinflation were unanchored, moving up nearly one to one with actual inflation. This tight\nconnection meant inflation was self‐reinforcing, hence there was no end in sight. See Daly (2022) for discussion.\n13 As noted earlier, longer‐run inflation expectations are well‐anchored.\n6\n\nREFERENCES\nAlmuzara, Martin, Babur Kocaoglu, and Argia Sbordone. 2023. “Where Is Inflation Persistence Coming\nFrom?” Liberty Street Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, July 6.\nBall, Laurence, Daniel Leigh, and Prachi Mishra. 2022. “Understanding U.S. Inflation During the COVID\nEra.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Fall), pp. 1–54.\nBengali, Leila, and Zoë Arnaut. 2024. “How Quickly Do Prices Respond to Monetary Policy?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2024‐10 (April 8).\nBenigno, Pierpaolo, and Gauti B.

The passage of the ADA represented\nan explicit effort to change the focus of United States disability policy away from income-\ntransfers for people with disabilities who remained out of the labor market toward employment\nsupport for people with disabilities who faced disability-related workplace hurdles that prevented\nemployment. The argument underlying this shift in focus was that by removing disability-\nrelated barriers to employment, individuals with disabilities would be allowed greater freedom to\nchoose work over disability benefit receipt. Despite these efforts, the greatest impact of federal\ngovernment policy on people with disabilities continues to be felt through two income-transfer\nprograms: Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).1\nMoreover, circumstantial evidence suggests that the passage of the ADA may not have improved\nthe employment opportunities of people with disabilities. During the 1990s, the employment\nrate among working-age people with disabilities fell and disability benefit rolls and expenditures\ngrew.2\nHere we provide a broader perspective from which to evaluate current disability policy.\nWe begin by reviewing the major aspects of the DI and SSI programs. We then examine trends\nin employment and disability benefit receipt among those with disabilities, paying particular\n1DI is a social insurance program targeted on regularly employed workers who experience a\ndisability that completely prevents them from working. SSI is a means-tested categorical welfare\nprogram that provides minimum cash benefit to those whose disability completely prevents them from\nworking. Other disability transfer programs such as Workers’ Compensation and Veterans Disability\nBenefits also provide income support but are targeted only to those whose disability occurred at work and\nprovide protection to partially and temporarily disabled workers.\n2The trend towards rising caseloads and expenditures began in the mid-1980s. However, the pace\nof growth increased during the 1990s.\n-1-\n\nattention to the last 15 years. Within this framework we summarize the primary difficulties in\ncrafting an efficient and equitable assistance program for a heterogeneous population that\nchanges with its environment. Finally, we place disability policy in the context of the broader\nUnited States social welfare system and consider how changes in other social welfare programs\nlikely will affect disability program usage in the future.\nOverview of United States Disability Policy\nDisability policy in the United States combines two basic components: transfers and\nemployment protection.3 Federal disability transfers—Social Security Disability Insurance (DI)\nand Supplemental Security Income (SSI)—are limited to the subset of individuals with\ndisabilities who are unable to perform any substantial gainful activity. Employment protection,\nprovided through the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), covers a much broader\ngroup of individuals with disabilities, including those who are able to work in the labor market.\nDI and SSI\nThe origins of DI and SSI can be traced to the Social Security Act of 1935.4 Both\nprograms are administered by the Social Security Administration and use the same strict\ndefinition of eligibility: “the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity, by reason of a\nmedically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in death or last\nat least 12 months” (Social Security Administration, 2000).5 Applicants must be unable to do\n3Rehabilitation, job training, and work programs are a third but much smaller component of\ndisability policy at the federal level. See Aarts, Burkhauser, and DeJong (1998) for a discussion of work-\nrelated programs in a cross-national context.\n4DI was created under Title II and SSI under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.\n5The United States does not award federal disability benefits for partial or temporary disability\nbut only for permanent and total disability.\n-2-\n\nany work that exists in the national economy for which they are qualified by virtue of age,\neducation, and work experience. In addition, there is a five-month waiting period before\npermanent benefits begin. A person applies for DI or SSI benefits at an office of the Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA). Once the federal officials and the applicant have gathered\nsufficient information to complete the application, it is submitted to a state agency for\ndetermination of disability. Disability examiners in this office, working with the aid of\nvocational and medical consultants, act as the primary gatekeepers of both the DI and SSI\nprograms. Although the criteria for determining eligibility for disability benefits is set at the\nfederal level and is uniform across states, the results of the determination process can and do\nvary greatly from state to state.6\nWhile DI and SSI are administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and\nshare a common health-based disability eligibility criteria, the goals of the programs and\nremaining eligibility criteria are quite different. DI is part of the Old-Age, Survivor, and\nDisability Insurance (OASDI) program. The goal of DI is to provide “earnings replacement\ninsurance” for those who exit the labor force because of disability. DI benefits are financed\nthrough a payroll tax (0.90% in 2000), paid by both employees and employers. Taxes are levied\non earnings up to an annual maximum—$76,200 of earnings in 2000—that is updated each year\nin relation to increases in national average annual earnings. To qualify for DI benefits, an\nindividual must have worked in employment subject to Social Security contributions for about\none-fourth of the time elapsing after age 21 and up to the year of disability. In addition, he or\n6Burkhauser, Butler, and Weathers (forthcoming) show that mean allowance rates (initial\nacceptances to initial applications) between 1974 and 1993 varied considerably across states, ranging\nfrom lows of 28 in Louisiana and New Mexico to highs of 48 in Delaware, New Jersey, and Rhode\nIsland.\n-3-\n\nshe must have recent covered work—equivalent to five of the preceding ten years (or, if between\nages 24 and 31, half the time since age 21, or if under age 24, half of the preceding three years).\nBenefits are paid based on past earnings using a formula that provides lower earners with higher\nreplacement rates.7 Since DI is an insurance program, benefits are not means-tested.8\nIn contrast, SSI is a means-tested transfer program aimed at the aged, and blind and\ndisabled adults and children. The target population for the adult disability program is working-\nage men and women whose disabilities are as severe as those required under DI, but who have\ntoo little work experience to qualify for DI benefits or whose combined DI benefits and other\nsources of household income fall below the maximum allowable to receive SSI benefits. To be\neligible for SSI, an individual’s countable income must be less than the federal benefit rate\n(FBR)—$512 per month ($6,144 per year) in 2000—and countable resources must be less than\n$2,000. For jointly eligible couples the income and resource limits were $9,288 and $3,000,\nrespectively.9 In 2000, the maximum monthly federal SSI benefit was $512 ($769 for a jointly\neligible couple).\nThe DI and SSI programs serve very different populations. Bound, Burkhauser, and\nNichols (2001) use information on applicants to both programs to find that the average DI\napplicant is more likely to be older, male, white, non-Hispanic, married, have at least a high-\nschool degree, live in a smaller household, and have more financial wealth than the average SSI\nrecipient. The pre-application household income of DI applicants is more than twice that of SSI\n7For more detailed information regarding eligibility requirements and benefit formulas for DI, see\nSocial Security Administration (2000).\n8See Bound and Burkhauser (1999) for a detailed discussion of the DI program.\n9See Daly and Burkhauser (forthcoming) for a detailed discussion of the SSI program.\n-4-\n\napplicants and is very close to that of non-applicants for DI. In terms of the income-to-need\nratio (using the U.S. Census poverty thresholds), the pre-application ratio among DI applicants is\nmore than twice that of SSI applicants and is almost exactly that of non-applicants for DI.\nFinally, the vast majority of those who applied for DI benefits were employed 36 months prior to\ninitial application, while the vast majority of SSI applicants were not employed 36 months prior\nto initial application.\nIn 2000, about 7.7 million individuals, 5.3 percent of the working-age population,\nreceived federal disability payments. Within this group, 50 percent received DI, 37 percent\nreceived SSI, and 13 percent received benefits from both programs.\nBasic Elements of the ADA\nThe definition of disability under the ADA is far broader than the one used to determine\ndisability benefit receipt. The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that\nsubstantially limits one or more major life activity, a record of such an impairment, or being\nregarded as having such an impairment. Title I of the ADA requires employers to make\nreasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities unless it would cause undue hardship on\nthe operation of business. As of July 26, 1992, all employers with 25 or more workers were\nsubject to its rules. Two years later the requirement was extended to all employers with 15 or\nmore workers.10\nTrends in Employment Rates and Disability Benefit Caseloads\nAs measured by self-reported work limitations, the prevalence of disability among all\nworking-age individuals has changed little over the past two decades, averaging about 8 percent\n10Who is actually protected by the ADA with respect to a right to sue is an unsettled issue in the\nlaw. Recent Supreme Court rulings have narrowed eligibility. See Berkeley Journal of Employment and\nLabor Law (2000) for a fuller discussion.\n-5-\n\nbetween 1981 and 2000 (Burkhauser, Daly, Houtenville, and Nargis, 2001). This consistency of\ndisability prevalence over time holds across age, gender, race, and household income decile.\nOver the same period, employment rates and DI and SSI caseloads have varied greatly,\nfluctuating with the economy, changes in benefit eligibility criteria, and the implementation of\nother public policies intended to support people with disabilities.11\nFigure 1 summarizes the primary relationships dominating research on United States\ndisability policy. The figure shows employment rates of working-age men and women with self-\nreported work limitations (based on the Current Population Survey) and the number of\nindividuals receiving disability benefits (based on data from the SSA) for the period 1980-\n1999.12 Also indicated in the figure are the 1984 disability screening liberalization, the passage\nof the ADA, and periods of recession in the 1980s and 1990s (shaded bars).\nThe trends in Figure 1 highlight the major concerns of disability policymakers regarding\nthe success of federal initiatives to protect and support people with disabilities. As the figure\nshows, the number of beneficiaries of disability transfers increased following eligibility\nexpansion and liberalization in 1984. While benefit rolls increased slowly over the rest of the\ndecade, employment rates also rose through the business cycle expansion of the late 1980s. It\nwas not until the start of the 1990s, following additional easing of DI and SSI benefit eligibility,\nthe passage of the ADA, and a marked slowdown in the national economy, that benefit rolls rose\nrapidly and employment rates fell. These trends did not reverse during the 1990s expansion.\nFor some analysts, these outcomes reflect increasing benefit support for workers with\n11See Bound and Burkhauser, 1999 and Rupp and Stapleton, 1998 for detailed reviews of changes\nin disability benefit eligibility criteria over the past several decades.\n12Employment rates are taken from Burkhauser, Daly, and Houtenville (2001). Data on DI and\nSSI beneficiaries come from the Social Security Administration (2000).\n-6-\n\ndisabilities who have limited labor market opportunities. For others, they reflect the usual moral\nhazard problems and work disincentive effects that accompany liberalizations of eligibility\ncriteria in social programs. For still others, lower employment rates and rising benefit rolls are\nevidence of the unintended consequences of the employer accommodation mandate in the\nADA.13 Although there is no consensus on what produced these trends, the outcome is clear; at\nthe end of the 1990s, despite seven straight years of substantial economic growth, a smaller\nfraction of working-age individuals with disabilities worked and a larger fraction relied on\nfederal disability income transfers than ever before.\nHurdles to Crafting Effective Disability Policy\nFinding a Consistent Policy Goal\nThe passage of the ADA challenged the conventional policy wisdom that working-age\npeople with disabilities could not and hence should not be expected to work. Proponents of the\nADA argued that unequal access to jobs—rather than a worker’s impairment—was the primary\nbarrier to employment. In the extreme, there is no such thing as a disabled worker, only a\nsociety that does not fully accommodate its citizens. If all citizens were fully accommodated,\nthe disability-transfer population would be zero. This argument raises a basic question with\nrespect to the rights and responsibilities of people with disabilities. Most fundamentally, should\npeople with disabilities categorically be expected to work?\n13A number of papers have examined the causality behind the trends displayed in Figure 1.\nDeLiere (2000) and Acemoglu and Angrist (forthcoming) blame the ADA for the downturn in\nemployment among those with disabilities. Bound and Waidman (2001) argue that changes in disability\nbenefit programs allowed workers to leave the labor force and take benefits. Autor and Duggan (2001)\nsuggest that increasing replacement rates of disability benefits and declining job opportunities for low-\nskilled workers induced workers to choose benefits over employment.\n-7-\n\nA positive answer to this question shifts the boundaries of the population expected to\nwork in our society. On the one hand, it suggests that non-productivity resulting from\ndiscrimination with regard to access to work should be stopped. On the other hand, it suggests\nthat eligibility criteria for permanent earnings replacement (DI) or for a categorical guaranteed\nincome floor (SSI) based on disability should be reevaluated. As opportunities for employment\nand the marketplace productivity of people with disabilities increases, the lines drawn between\nthose with disabilities and other groups who experience disproportionate difficulties finding\nwork—low-skilled or less-educated younger persons or single mothers facing welfare\nlimits—are blurring.\nDefining and Capturing the Target Population\nDisability is a more complex concept to define or measure than age, race, or gender. It is\na dynamic process rather than a static classification. It varies with both the health of the\nindividual and the socioeconomic environment in which the person functions, confounding\nattempts to measure it objectively and consistently. The work response to the onset of health\nconditions depends not only on the severity of the impairment, but also on the social\nenvironment—including the availability of employment, the availability of accommodation,\nrehabilitation and retraining, the presence of legal supports or protections, and the accessibility\nand generosity of DI, SSI, and other government transfer programs.\nOperationalizing a definition or definitions of disability for policy purposes is even more\ndifficult.14 Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the definitions described earlier for the\nADA and DI and SSI programs. Circle A contains the working-age population with disabilities\n14Mashaw and Reno (1996) document over 20 definitions of disability used for purposes of\nentitlement to public and private transfers, government services, or statistical analysis.\n-8-\n\nas defined by the ADA. Circle B is the working-age population that is eligible for disability\ntransfers, based solely on health impairments, although some of the members work and hence do\nnot meet the work test for DI or SSI. Circle C contains the working-age population with\ndisabilities who actually receive disability benefits. Circles B and C are subsets of circle A but\ndo not coincide for several reasons. Some people in circle B, who would be eligible for benefits\nif they stopped working, keep working, and some are denied benefits even though they are not\nworking. Hence, some people in circle B are not in circle C. Likewise, some people in circle C\nare awarded benefits even though they are not “truly” eligible.\nLimiting Behavioral Responses to Policy Rules\nLike all public policy-based programs, disability programs must contend with potential\nmoral hazard problems and with work disincentives induced by program rules.15 The magnitude\nof these problems depends in large part on whether adults with disabilities are able or expected\nto work, and on the precision of disability screening. If people with disabilities are unable or not\nexpected to work, then marginal tax rates on benefits could approach 100 percent with no change\nin work behavior. DI and SSI could provide relatively high replacement rates or income\nguarantees and still maintain relatively low break-even points (the income level at which a\nperson is no longer eligible for benefits). Moreover, if work disability is a clearly defined and\nimmutable category, differences in replacement rates, guarantees, time-limits, or funding\nmechanisms for disability and other programs would have little effect on allowances and\ncaseloads. Participation in disability benefit programs would be purely a function of the\nprevalence of health limitations in the working-age population. Our experience with DI and SSI\n15See Bound and Burkhauser (1999), Daly and Burkhauser (forthcoming), and Hoynes and\nMoffitt (1996) for a review of these issues as they pertain to DI and SSI.\n-9-\n\nsuggests that this does not describe the real world. As with other social insurance and welfare\nprograms, the disability benefit system, together with economic conditions, clearly affects work\nbehavior.\nHence, while circle A in Figure 2 is determined by health-based impairments, the size\nand location of circles B and C are determined by social policies and how people with\ndisabilities, employers, and frontline program administrators react to them. Judgments by\nadministrative gatekeepers, economic conditions, accommodation, and the X-factor that makes\npeople more or less willing to work all influence the share of the population with disabilities in\neach circle.\nBalancing Efficiency and Equity Concerns\nDisability policymakers historically have tried to maintain a balance between efficiency\nand equity. This means that the optimal level of support is not necessarily one that has no\nbehavioral impact on benefit applications, work, or savings. Even if actual disability status were\nperfectly observable, society would still want to target some level of benefits on disadvantaged\nlow-income workers and their families even if it resulted in some efficiency losses. Moreover,\nin a world where the socially appropriate eligibility standard for DI and SSI is difficult to assess,\nsome individuals will be denied benefits who are less capable of work than is socially\nacceptable. Moving to a more lenient eligibility criteria involves a trade-off between reducing\nthe risk of a denial of benefits to those who “deserve” them and the additional costs of awarding\nbenefits to those who do not “deserve” them. For policymakers the issue is: in the presence of\nuncertainty, do the social benefits of lenient eligibility criteria outweigh the efficiency costs of\n-10-\n\nproviding these funds to some who are more capable of work.16\nDisability Policy and the Broader Social Welfare System\nAs Figure 3 illustrates, disability programs are only one part of a social welfare system\nthat attempts to ameliorate the consequences of a separation from the labor market over a\nworker’s lifetime for economic as well as health reasons. These programs can influence the\nresponse of both employers and workers, when such a separation is imminent. For workers who\nremain on the job over their work life the path to retirement is straightforward. Not until they\nreach early retirement age do they have to choose between retirement and continued work. But\nfor a significant number of workers, job separation before retirement is a reality that social\nwelfare policy must anticipate.\nTo put Figure 3 in focus, it is useful to recognize that the typical working-age person\nwith a disability in the United States was able-bodied during most of his or her lifetime. For\ninstance Burkhauser and Daly (1996), using data from the Health and Retirement Study, find\nthat, in 1992, 70 percent of men and women aged 51 to 61 who reported having a health-related\nimpairment said it started during their work life. Thus, social welfare policy may influence not\nonly whether such workers remain in the labor force or end up in a transfer program, but also the\nspeed at which such transitions take place. Figure 3 illustrates the importance of social welfare\npolicies by considering four paths that workers may take following the onset of a health-related\nimpairment.\nThe work path encompasses public programs that provide or encourage rehabilitation to\novercome the work limitations caused by a disability. It also includes more direct labor market\n16See Bound, Cullen, Nichols, and Schmidt (2001) for a detailed discussion of these issues.\n-11-\n\nintervention through the creation of specific government jobs for people with disabilities,\nsubsidies to those who employ such workers, job quotas, and job protection\nlegislation—dismissal rules or general antidiscrimination legislation requiring accommodation\nfor workers with disabilities. The ADA clearly falls into this category. Work path policies\nattempt to maintain those with disabilities on the job and in the labor market, either through the\ncarrot of subsidies or the stick of mandates.\nThe disability insurance path encompasses traditional disability insurance-based transfer\nprograms. These include short-term sickness programs, which mandate employers to replace\nlost wages during the first few weeks of sickness or directly provide such replacement through\nshort-term social insurance. In the United States health care and short-term sickness benefits are\nprovided through private contracts between employers and employees with only limited\ngovernment regulation over the terms and conditions of those contracts. After some point,\nworkers are then eligible to move to a long-term disability insurance program, which often has\nboth health and employment criteria. This path eventually merges with the Social Security\nDisability Insurance program. For those with disabilities who drop out of the labor force, the\ndisability insurance path is the most common public program path.\nThe unemployment path encompasses short-term unemployment benefits to replace lost\nwage earnings due to cyclical economic downturns. At some point longer-term unemployment\ninsurance becomes available, often at a lower replacement rate. Eventually, this also merges\nwith the Social Security retirement system. Disentangling job exits because of a health condition\nfrom job exits due to economic forces is in practice a difficult and often controversial task,\nespecially as these exits are influenced by the rules established by the social welfare system.\nThe welfare path encompasses means-tested programs that serve as a safety net for\n-12-\n\nworkers without jobs who are not eligible for health- or unemployment-based social insurance.\nWelfare programs can be universal, subject only to a means test and/or linked to an inability to\nwork either because of poor health, poor job skills, or child-rearing responsibilities. This track\ncontinues past retirement age for those few individuals who are not eligible for Social Security\nretirement benefits.\nWhen a health condition begins to affect the ability to work, important job-related\ndecisions must be made by workers and their employers. Workers will consider the relative\nrewards of continued movement along the work path versus entry onto an alternative path. In\nlike manner, employers’ willingness to accommodate their workers will also be influenced by\nthe social policies within which the firm must operate.\nThis is not to suggest that all workers can or will transform themselves into candidates\nfor disability transfer programs. Rather, it recognizes that those with work limitations who are\nhaving difficulty with their current job or who are no longer working will be influenced by the\nrelative rewards provided by the disability insurance, unemployment, and welfare paths in\ndeciding whether to remain in the labor force or to apply for transfer benefits. Disability transfer\napplicants will increase as relative replacement rates rise, the period over which benefits can be\nreceived lengthens, and the probability of acceptance onto the rolls grows.\nAlthough DI and SSI are income transfer programs narrowly targeted on those with\ndisabilities, the fluidity of boundaries defining who is and who is not eligible implies that policy\nchanges in other programs such as unemployment insurance, retirement benefits, and welfare\nlikely will also affect DI and SSI caseloads. Thus, if limits are placed on other programs such as\nwelfare and unemployment insurance, the number of those receiving disability benefits will be\nrelatively large.\n-13-\n\nPutting Disability Policy on the Agenda\nTwo factors are likely to cause the debate surrounding disability policy to intensify over\nthe next decade. First, the protracted period of economic growth that the United States has\nexperienced since 1992 cannot last forever. And, as was shown in Figure 1, applications for DI\nand SSI are sensitive to the business cycle. A downturn in the economy will increase\napplications and heighten efforts to broaden the categorical definition of disability. This is even\nmore likely since the welfare reforms of 1996 have made it more difficult for low-income people\nto be eligible for other programs. Second, the percentage of the population aged 50 and over is\nincreasing. Given that the prevalence of disability rises sharply at these ages, applications for\nboth DI and SSI are likely to rise. The effect of this demographic change is magnified by the\nfact that in 2000 the age of eligibility for full Social Security retirement benefits began to rise\nfrom 65 to 67. This increase in the normal retirement age will increase the relative value of DI\nand SSI benefits for workers considering exiting the labor market prior to age 67. All these\nfactors suggest another major round of debate over disability policy and program expansion is in\nthe near future.\n-14-\n\nReferences\nAarts, L., R.V. Burkhauser, and P.R. de Jong. 1996.

Introduction\nIndividual-level data on wage changes as well as survey-based evidence on wage setting show that\nnominal cuts to pay are rare, suggesting that wages are downwardly rigid.2 Tobin (1972) argued that\nsuch downward nominal wage rigidities induce a long-run, or steady-state, trade-off between\ninflation and unemployment. Subsequent theoretical studies have formalized Tobin’s argument in\nthe context of a long-run Phillips curve that plots average inflation against the average\nunemployment rate.3,4 The key finding from this work is that the long-run Phillips curve is nearly\nvertical at high inflation and flattens out at low inflation, implying progressively larger output costs\nof reducing inflation. However, even at low inflation, the long-run trade-off is not very big, at least\nfor levels of downward wage rigidities commonly observed in the U.S. (Akerlof, Dickens, and\nPerry, 1996, Benigno and Ricci, 2011).\nIn this paper we add to this literature by considering how downward nominal wage rigidities\naffect the short-run Phillips curve.5 Phillips (1958) documented significant curvature in the\nhistorical relationship between money wage growth and unemployment in the U.K. He conjectured\nthat this curvature owed to the fact that “…workers are reluctant to offer their services at less than\nprevailing rates when the demand for labour is low and unemployment is high so that wage rates\nfall only very slowly.”6 Here we revisit Phillips’ hypothesis that downward nominal wage rigidities\nbend the Phillips curve and in so doing we make both an empirical and theoretical contribution to\nthe literature.\nWe begin on the empirical side where we use micro data on wages from the Current Population\nSurvey (1986-2011) to document the existence of downward nominal wage rigidities in the United\n2 For individual-level evidence for the U.S. see Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996), Kahn (1997), Card and Hyslop (1997), Altonji\nand Devereux (2000), Lebow, Saks, and Wilson (2003), Elsby (2009), Daly, Hobijn, and Lucking (2012). Individual-level\nevidence for a large number of countries is in Dickens et al. (2007). Kahnemann, Knetsch, and Thaler (1986) and Bewley (1995,\n1999) provide extensive anecdotal and survey evidence on downward nominal wage rigidities in the U.S. Bonin and\nRadowski (2011) present survey results from Germany. Holden and Wulfsberg (2008) provide evidence from industry-level data.\n3 Examples of such studies are Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996), Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2008), Fagan and Messina (2009),\nBenigno and Ricci (2011), Coibion et al. (2012).\n4 Ball (1994) provides cross-country evidence on how the shape of the output-inflation trade-off depends on wage flexibility.\n5 We define long-run as the steady state and short-run as deviations from the steady state. In the empirical work, this distinction\ndenotes plots of average inflation and the average unemployment rate (long-run) versus measured actual inflation and actual\nunemployment (short-run).\n6 Samuelson and Solow (1960) replicated Phillips’ results for the U.S. and found a similar curvature in the U.S. (wage) Phillips\ncurve. However, they argued the curvature might reflect an increase in the natural rate of unemployment rather than a bending due\nto downward nominal wage rigidities. For the most part this latter view has been the consensus in modern macro models.\n2\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nStates. We show that these rigidities rise substantially in recessions and remain elevated well after\nthe unemployment rate comes down. As we point out, this pattern for nominal wage rigidities\ncoincides with substantial curvature in the U.S. short-run Phillips curve. Specifically, during the\nlast three recession/recoveries plots of the Phillips curve show that unemployment first rose\nsignificantly while wage growth remained flat and subsequently fell while wage growth decelerated.\nTo understand the coincidence of these two facts, the cyclical increase in downward nominal\nwage rigidities and the bending of the short-run Phillips curve, we employ a dynamic general\nequilibrium model of downward nominal wage rigidities and monetary policy, similar to those of\nBenigno and Ricci (2011) and Fagan and Messina (2009). Our main contribution relative to these\nauthors is to solve for the full non-linear transitional dynamics of the model in response to demand\nand supply shocks, taking into account the evolution of the distribution of wages along the\nequilibrium path. Although previous studies have simulated the short-run Phillips curve (e.g.,\nBenigno and Ricci), we are the first to focus on the joint cyclical path of unemployment and wage\ngrowth following business cycle downturns.\nThe results highlight the importance of our approach. Our model generates the key patterns\nhighlighted in the data, namely the increase in downward nominal wage rigidities following\nrecessions and the subsequent bending of the short-run Phillips curve. Importantly, these results\nhold for relatively conservative parameter values that generate fewer downward nominal wage\nrigidities than measured in U.S. data.\nOverall, the model simulations show that downward nominal wage rigidities bend the Phillips\ncurve in two ways. First, during recessions the rigidities become more binding and the labor market\nadjustment disproportionately happens through the unemployment margin rather than through\nwages. The higher the level of downward nominal wage rigidities the more this mechanism matters\nand the higher the short-run sacrifice ratio between unemployment and inflation. Second, downward\nnominal wage rigidities cause recessions to result in substantial pent up wage deflation. This leads\nto a simultaneous deceleration of wage inflation and a decline in the unemployment rate during the\nensuing recovery period. This bending of the Phillips curve is especially pronounced in a low\ninflationary environment.\n3\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nWe interpret our empirical work and model simulations as evidence that downward nominal\nwage rigidities are an important force that has shaped the dynamics of unemployment, wage\ngrowth, and inflation during and after the last three U.S. recessions.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present an update of\nprevious evidence on downward nominal wage rigidities in the U.S. and construct the U.S. wage\nPhillips curve for 1986-2012. In Section 3 we describe our model of downward nominal wage\nrigidities and monetary policy. In Section 4 we present numerical results for the steady state and\nsolve the transitional dynamics of the model. We conclude in Section 5.\n2. Downward nominal wage rigidities and the U.S. wage Phillips curve\nWe begin by documenting the existence and importance of downward nominal wage rigidities in\nthe U.S. as well as the dynamics of unemployment and wage growth, as captured by the wage\nPhillips curve. We use this evidence to establish several stylized facts about downward nominal\nwage rigidities, the dynamics of wage growth, and unemployment in the U.S. during the period\n1986-2012. We subsequently compare these facts to the transitional dynamics of our model of\ndownward nominal wage rigidities and monetary policy.\nEmpirical studies documenting the existence of downward nominal wage rigidities in the U.S.\nemphasize that plots of the distribution of individual log wage changes display a prominent spike at\nzero. We update this work in Figure 1. Following Card and Hyslop (1997), we track 12-month log\nchanges in the nominal wages of individuals using micro data from the Current Population Survey\n(CPS).7 The histogram plots the distribution of wage changes in the CPS data for 2006 and 2011,\nreflecting the distributions in two different points in the business cycle. We take the distribution of\nwage changes in 2006 to represent the steady-state distribution and the distribution in 2011 to\nrepresent the additional distortions that arise in business cycle downturns.8\n7 Earlier studies (Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry, 1996, Kahn, 1997, Altonji and Devereux, 2000, and Elsby, 2009) used data from the\nPSID for this type of analysis. However, the PSID has gone from an annual to a biannual frequency and thus does not allow for the\nanalysis of 12-month wage changes anymore. Another data source that would allow for a similar analysis is the Survey of Income\nand Program Participation (SIPP). In results not shown we replicated our analysis using the SIPP. The key results were\nqualitatively similar to those for the CPS although the prevalence of nominal rigidities is higher in the SIPP than in the CPS (see\nBarattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk (2010) and Gottshalk (2005) for analyses of nominal wage rigidities using the SIPP).\n8 Most studies of downward nominal wage rigidities focus on the wage changes of those who remain in the same job. Since our\nmodel does not distinguish between job stayers and job switchers, we present the evidence for all workers who earned a wage at\n4\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nAs the histograms in Figure 1 show, actual wage changes exhibit considerable discontinuity\nwith a prominent spike at zero. This is true in both 2006 and 2011. Consistent with the view that\nindividuals do not like nominal wage cuts (Kahneman et al. 1986, Bewley 1995,1999), the spike at\nzero is produced asymmetrically, with most of the mass coming from the left of zero rather than\nfrom the right. This suggests that a sizeable fraction of desired negative wage changes are being\nswept up to zero (Altonji and Devereux 2000; Card and Hyslop 1996; Kahn 1997; Lebow, Saks,\nWilson 2003).\nWhen we compare the 2006 histogram with that for 2011, three things stand out. First, the\nfraction of workers with no wage change increased substantially in 2011 relative to 2006. In 2006\nabout 12 percent of workers reported zero wage change; in 2011 the share had risen to about 16\npercent. Second, the fraction of workers getting a wage increase declined noticeably over the period\nand the size of wage increases, conditional on getting one, was substantially lower in 2011 than in\n2006. Thus, there is notable compression of wage gains near zero, suggesting that the inability to\nadjust nominal wages downward may influence the magnitude of wage increases. This is a point\nmade by Elsby (2009). Finally and surprisingly, there is little difference in the fraction of workers\nthat get wage cuts between 2006 and 2011.\nAnother important stylized fact, hinted at in Figure 1, is that the prevalence of zero wage\nchanges varies over the business cycle. This can be seen in Figure 2 which plots the 12-month\nmoving average of the fraction of workers in the CPS data reporting zero nominal wage changes\nalong with the unemployment rate. As the figure shows, there is always a non-trivial fraction of\nworkers receiving zero wage changes in the U.S. economy. This fraction increases around business\ncycle downturns although with a lag relative to the unemployment rate. These two patterns: (i) the\nspike at zero wage changes lags the spike in the unemployment rate, and (ii) the prevalence of zero\nwage changes stays high well after the unemployment rate has begun to come down are two\nfeatures of the data that Phillips (1958) argued could produce curvature in the wage Phillips curve.\nTo see if such curvature is present in the U.S. data, Figure 3 plots the wage Phillips curve for the\nU.S. using measures of the nominal wage growth gap and unemployment gap for 1986 through\n2012. The nominal wage growth gap is the percentage point difference between a composite\nthe beginning and end of the year. However, in other work we show that although downward nominal wage rigidities are higher\nfor job stayers, they also are present for job changers (see: http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/nominal-wage-rigidity).\n5\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nmeasure of wage growth and 10yr-ahead inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional\nForecasters. We use it to capture cyclical fluctuations in nominal wage growth rather than those due\nto shifts in long run inflation expectations. The composite measure of wage growth we use is the\nfirst principal component of the four major wage series for the U.S.9 The unemployment gap is\ndefined as the percentage point difference between the civilian unemployment rate and the long-\nterm natural rate of unemployment, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. For ease of\ncomparison we separately plot the three recession and recovery periods in our sample. Observations\nfor each of these three episodes are connected by arrows. The other quarters are plotted as gray\npoints.\nFigure 3 shows the expected (Phillips, 1958, Solow and Samuelson, 1960, Galí, 2011)\nrelationship between wage growth and labor market slack; higher slack means slower wage growth,\nlower slack means faster wage growth. The figure also shows distinct non-linearities in the curve in\nthe three recession/recovery periods in our sample. These nonlinearities highlight the fact that as\nslack increases during recessions, wage growth slows but not nearly as much as a linear model\nwould predict. As the labor market recovery begins and the unemployment rate falls, the reverse\noccurs As unemployment comes down, wage growth continues to decelerate. As we will show in\nour model, these dynamics of wage growth and unemployment during the last three recessions and\nrecoveries are consistent with downward nominal wage rigidities preventing wage adjustments so as\nto bend the short-run Phillips curve.10\nIn the next section we describe our model of monetary policy with downward nominal wage\nrigidities. Solving the short-run transitional dynamics of this model we examine whether we can\nqualitatively match the empirical patterns just discussed including the spike at zero in no wage\nchanges, the lag in the spike at zero of wage changes relative to the unemployment rate, and the\nbending of the Phillips curve that occurs in recessions and recoveries.\n9 Appendix B contains a brief description of how this composite measure is constructed.\n10 Although the prevalence of downward nominal wage rigidities and the bending of the Phillips curve are most striking for the Great\nRecession, the fact that it these patterns also emerged in the two previous recessions suggest that the dynamic we focus on is not\ndue to circumstances that are specific to the 2007 recession, like monetary policy hitting the zero lower bound.\n6\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\n3. Model of monetary policy with DNWR\nWe employ a simple discrete-time model, similar to those of Benigno and Ricci (2011) and Fagan\nand Messina (2009). Our main contribution relative to these authors is to solve for the full non-\nlinear transitional dynamics of the model in response to demand and supply shocks, taking into\naccount the evolution of the distribution of wages along the equilibrium path. Although previous\nstudies have simulated the short-run Phillips curve (e.g., Benigno and Ricci, 2011), we are the first\nto focus on the joint cyclical path of unemployment and wage growth following business cycle\ndownturns. Throughout this section we point out where our model differs from those used in\nprevious studies, either (i) to keep the model tractable such that we can solve for its transitional\ndynamics, or (ii) to use more general and realistic functional forms, like for the monetary policy\nrule.\nFirms\nFirms operate in a perfectly competitive goods market and produce output using the production\nfunction\n. (1)\nHere, is average labor productivity, which evolves exogenously, and is the labor input. The\nlatter, consists of a measure one of different types of labor. Each type is indexed by and its type-\nspecific input by . Each type of labor is hired at the nominal wage rate, . The labor aggregate,\n, is a Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) aggregate over the different types of labor inputs and is of the form.\n(2)\n[∫ ] where\nCost minimization by the firms results in the labor demand function\n( ) (3)\nWhere the nominal wage aggregate, , is of the form\n(4)\n[∫ ( ) ]\n7\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nBecause firms operate in a perfectly competitive goods market, the equilibrium price level, ,\nequals the unit production cost, ⁄ . Thus, equilibrium in the goods market implies that the\ndetrended real wage aggregate in this economy is constant and equal to one. That is,\n(5)\n[∫ ( ) ] [∫ ( ) ]\nHere, ⁄ is the detrended real wage rate of labor of type at time . Moreover, perfect\ncompetition implies that costs exhaust revenue and that there are thus no profits and markups that\ncould contribute to the wedge between wage and price inflation.11 The only factor that contributes\nto this wedge is the exogenous productivity growth rate, .\nHouseholds\nWe follow Fagan and Messina (2009) and Benigno and Ricci (2011) and model downward nominal\nwage rigidities based on the staggered wage setting model of Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000).\nThat is, we consider a representative household in which the members share their consumption risk\nand individually set the wage they charge for their labor services. They then supply as much labor\nas is demanded by the firms.\nThe representative household chooses its path of consumption, ,12 and wages and labor supply\n{ } to maximize the present discounted value of the stream of utility\n∑ ∑ { ∫ } where (6)\nHere is the disutility from working for household member , which varies over time; is a\n“shock” that affects the household’s discount factor.13 The household maximizes this objective\nfunction subject to five constraints.\n11 Most New Keynesian models with price stickiness have countercyclical markups (e.g. Galí and Gertler, 1999) . Though, recent\nempirical estimates by Nekarda and Ramey (2010) suggest that markups might actually be procyclical.\n12 The absence of capital goods in the economy means that, in equilibrium, output, , equals the level of consumption of the\nrepresentative household, . Throughout this paper, we substitute in this equilibrium condition and use .\n13 We put “shock” here in quotation marks because we assume that the household knows the path { } . In addition, we assume\nthat in the long run is zero.\n8\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nThe first is the budget constraint. Defining the level of nominal assets held by the household at\nthe end of period as and the nominal interest paid during period on the assets held at the end\nof period as , we write this constraint as\n( ) ∫ (7)\nThe second constraint is that each of the members of the household sets their wage taking as\ngiven the labor demand function in equation (3). Given that in equilibrium the aggregate detrended\nreal wage equals one, this labor demand function can be written in terms of the real wage charged\nby household member as\n( ) (8)\nThe third constraint is that, because every household is infinitesimally small, it takes as given\nthe path of the aggregate wage, , and labor input, , the price level, , and the nominal interest\nrate, .\nThe fourth constraint is that the household takes the path of its discount rate shock, ,\nproductivity growth, , as well as the stochastic process that drives the member-specific disutility\nof working, , as given. In particular, we assume that in each period a member’s disutility from\nworking is drawn from a log-normal distribution, where ( ) ( ) such that [ ] .14\nThis means that there is no persistence in the disutility shocks, . We make this assumption to\nkeep the equilibrium dynamics of the model tractable and solvable.\nThe final constraint is that of downward nominal wage rigidities. Similar to Fagan and Messina\n(2009), we model these rigidities along the lines of the time-dependent price stickiness of\nCalvo (1983) commonly used in models with price rigidities. In particular, we assume that, every\nperiod, a randomly selected fraction [ ) of household members is not allowed to change their\nnominal wage downward and have to set their wage subject to the constraint .15\n14 Our setup with disutility shocks follows Benigno and Ricci (2011). Alternatively, one can introduce household member specific\nproductivity shocks, as in Fagan and Messina (2009). Both these approaches lead to similar equilibrium dynamics. The latter,\nhowever, results in a more complicated expression for the aggregates in equilibrium. To keep our illustrative model as simple as\npossible, we chose the former. Some technical details about the log-normal distribution, which we use for our derivations, are\ndescribed in Appendix A.\n15 In terms of the notation in Fagan and Messina (2009, equation 17), we assume that , and . Their probability\nis in our notation.\n9\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nOptimal savings decision\nDefining the inflation rate as , the household’s saving decision yields the Euler equation\n( ) (9)\nwhere is the real interest rate and is given by ( )⁄( ) . Since our model\neconomy does not exhibit any aggregate uncertainty, there is no uncertainty about future inflation,\n.\nWage setting under flexible wages: .\nSimilar to Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) and Benigno and Ricci (2011), each household\nmember chooses the sequence of detrended real wages, , to maximize the expected present value\nof the difference between the utility value of the generated labor income and the disutility from\nproviding the labor services demanded by firms.\nAs we show in Appendix A, this reduces to the household choosing the path of wages of\nmember to maximize\n[∑ ∑ ( )] (10)\nwhere\n( ) [ ] (11)\nNote that the objective here is an expected present discounted value because, even though the\nhousehold as a whole does not face any aggregate uncertainty, each individual member of the\nhousehold faces uncertainty about the future path of the idiosyncratic shocks to its disutility from\nworking, .\nWhen wages can be flexibly adjusted then, in every period, the real wage is chosen to\nmaximize ( ). The resulting optimal detrended real wage schedule is\n̂( ) ̂ ( ) (12)\nThis turns out to be an important benchmark to compare the wage-setting under downward nominal\nwage rigidities to.\n10\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nWage setting under downward nominal wage rigidities: .\nWhen household members’ wage setting choices are subject to downward nominal wage rigidities,\ntheir decisions depend on and , as well as the future path of these aggregates, the future path\nof inflation, , the path of productivity growth, , and the demand shock, . Two things produce\nthis dependency. First, each of these variables influences the likelihood that a household member\nwill want to reduce the current wage at some point in the future. Second, together these variables\ndetermine the present discounted value associated with the potential inability to cut wages in future\nperiods.\nIn order to formalize the optimal wage setting problem under downward nominal wage\nrigidities, we define the value of the objective (10) for a household member who gets paid a\ndetrended real wage at the beginning of period as ( ). We then hit this worker with a\ndisutility shock, i.e. a draw of a value of , after which the worker decides whether and how to\nchange the charged detrended real wage, .\nWith probability ( ) the worker is able to choose any non-negative wage desired in period\n. With probability , the worker is restricted from choosing a detrended real wage smaller than .\nIn other words, the worker can set such that . Because of inflation and productivity\ngrowth, once the worker has chosen a detrended real wage rate in period , the period real\nwage is equal to ⁄[( )( )].\nThe resulting optimization problem can be written in the form of the following Bellman\nequation\n( ) ( )∫ { ( ) ( ⁄[( )( )])} ( )\n(13)\n∫ { ( ) ( ⁄[( )( )])} ( )\nHere, ( ) denotes the distribution function of the idiosyncratic preference shocks. We show in\nAppendix A that all workers who are not constrained in their wage setting in period and have the\nsame disutility level, , choose the same detrended real wage ( ). Moreover, the wage they\nset is strictly increasing in . This means that ( ) is invertible and we denote its inverse as\n( ). This function gives the disutility from working value at which workers set their detrended\nreal wage to .\n11\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nIt is important to note that the existence of downward nominal wage rigidities affects the wage-\nsetting decisions of workers who do and do not face the constraint in the current period. For those\nwho face the constraint the statement is obvious. For those who do not face the constraint, the effect\nworks as follows. The wage that non-constrained workers set in the current period, , determines the\nlikelihood of being constrained in the next period. The higher the wage they set the higher this\nprobability. Thus, relative to the flexible wage-setting case, downward nominal wage rigidities add\nan additional marginal cost to raising current wages. Consequently, such workers will set their wage\nlower than or equal to what they would have done in the absence of DNWR, that is ( ) ̂ .\nThis is reminiscent of Elsby (2009) who emphasizes that downward nominal wage rigidities not\nonly prevent wage declines but they also dampen wage increases.\nThe workers who set a real wage and face the DNWR constraint in the current period consist\nof two groups. The first group consists of those who get a shock, ( ), such that they would\nlike to increase their wage anyway and for whom the constraint is thus not binding. The second\ngroup, for whom the constraint is binding, get a disutility shock such that the wage they currently\ncharge, , is higher than the wage they would have set under flexible wage setting, ̂ . We show in\nAppendix A, that these workers will keep their wage fixed at .\nMonetary policy rule\nBecause wages in this economy are sticky due to the downward nominal wage rigidities, there is\nroom for monetary policy to affect the allocation of resources in equilibrium. Since our emphasis in\nthis paper is not on optimal policy, but rather on the shape of the Phillips curve for a given\nmonetary policy rule, we assume that the central bank, which targets an inflation rate equal to ̅,\nsets the nominal interest rate according to a standard Taylor (1993) rule.1617 That is, the central\nbank’s policy rule is\n( ̅)( ̅)\n( ) ( ) (14)\n̅ ̅\n16 An obvious extension to our results would be to include a zero lower bound (ZLB) constraint on monetary policy accommodation.\nHowever, as we showed in Figure 3, the bending of the wage Phillips curve that is the focus of our analysis also occurred in\nrecessions where the ZLB was not binding.\n17 In Benigno and Ricci (2011) the central bank follows a nominal output target. We use the Taylor rule as a more realistic treatment\nof central bank policy.\n12\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nHere, ⁄ is the level of output in deviation from trend, and ̅ is its associated steady-state\nlevel, such that ⁄ ̅ is one plus the output gap. The steady-state level of productivity growth is ̅.18\nEquilibrium\nEquilibrium in this economy is a path of { } that satisfies (i) the production\nfunction, (1), (ii) the consumption Euler equation, (9), (iii) the Fisher equation, and (iv) the\nmonetary policy rule, (14). In addition, (v) the wage setting decisions satisfy that the real wage\nequals 1, i.e. (5).\nUnder downward nominal wage rigidities the current wage setting by workers depends not only\non current economic conditions and their expectations of future economic outcomes but also on\ntheir past wage-setting decisions. Thus, the distribution of real wages is a state variable that\ndetermines the equilibrium dynamics of the economy. As a result, the equilibrium dynamics of this\neconomy cannot be solved in closed form and need to be simulated numerically. In this subsection\nwe describe the main recursive equations that drive these equilibrium dynamics. Before we do so,\nhowever, we first consider the special case in which wages can be adjusted flexibly, .\nEquilibrium under flexible wages, .\nThis is a useful benchmark for comparison since it can be solved analytically. Because there are no\nnominal rigidities, the Classical Dichotomy holds and monetary policy does not affect the allocation\nof goods and labor in the economy. We thus limit our analysis to the real equilibrium variables\nunder flexible wages.\nAs we show in Appendix A, when wages can adjust flexibly, the equilibrium level of the labor\ninput is given by\n(15)\n( ) ( )\nwhere\n18 To cut back on notation, in the rest of our derivations, we use that ⁄ , and ̅ is the steady-state level of the labor\ninput.\n13\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\n( ) ( )\n( )\n(16)\n[∫ ( ) ]\nis the aggregate level of the disutility from working. The first factor on the right-hand side of\nequation (15) reflects the output loss due to the workers charging a wage markup and setting their\nwages inefficiently high. This reduces the equilibrium level of labor demanded and thus of output.\nIf the elasticity of substitution between the different types of labor, , goes to infinity then this\nmarkup disappears and the equilibrium level of output under flexible wages coincides with that\nobtained in the first-best where both the goods and labor markets are perfectly competitive.\nEquilibrium under downward nominal wage rigidities, .\nThe equilibrium dynamics in the general case, where , depend on the evolution of the\ndistribution of real wages across workers. We denote the distribution of real wages in period after\neach of the workers has set their wage by ( ) and the corresponding density function by ( ).\nThe evolution of this distribution function is driven by three types of workers.\nFigure 4 illustrates these three groups. Consider those that end up with a real wage or lower\nin period . There are three types of wage setters for whom this happens.\nThe first type consists of those who are not subject to the DNWR constraint in period and\ndraw a productivity shock, ( ), such that they would like to set their wage lower than or\nequal to . In Figure 4 this a fraction ( ) of all household members in the areas , , and .\nThe share of workers in these areas is equal to ( ( )).\nThe second type is those workers who are subject to the DNWR constraint in period , started\nthe period at a detrended real wage , and drew a shock, ( ) ( ) that makes\nthem want to raise their detrended real wage to a level lower than or equal to . These workers\nmake up a fraction of those in the area in Figure 4. They are the ones with real wages lower or\nequal to for which the DNWR constraint is not binding.\nThe final type of worker is those who are constrained by downward nominal wage rigidities.\nThese workers started the period with a detrended real wage and drew a shock ( ).\nThat is, they would like to lower their wage but are not able to. These individuals make up a\nfraction of workers in the area in Figure 4.\n14\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nTogether, the latter two types of workers make up a fraction of those in areas and .\nBecause, due to inflation and productivity growth, a worker who started the period with a real wage\nwas paid a real wage ( )( ) in the previous period, the share of workers in these two\nareas is equal to ( ( )( )) ( ( )).\nAdding the mass for these three types of workers, we obtain the following recursive dynamic\nequation for the distribution function of wages\n( ) ( ) ( ( )) ( ( )( )) ( ( )) (17)\nSince under flexible wages ( ) ( ( )), this equation illustrates how inflation “greases” the\nwheels of the labor market in this economy. The higher inflation, the fewer workers are stuck at a\nreal wage that they cannot adjust downwards. That is, ( ( )( )) is increasing in the\ninflation rate and, in the limit, goes to one. In that limit, the distribution of real wages in this\neconomy would be the same as under flexible wage setting. Of course, as we showed above, the\nequilibrium under flexible wages is distorted by the wage markup that workers charge. Note that\nproductivity growth has the same “greasing effect” on the labor market as inflation. When\nproductivity growth is high wages have the tendency to rise anyway, which makes downward\nnominal wage rigidities less binding.\nGiven the distribution of real wages across workers at the end of the previous period,\n( ( )( )), and the wage-setting schedule, ( ) and ( ), we can integrate out\nwage-setting decisions in (5) to solve for the equilibrium level of employment, . As we show in\nAppendix A, this yields\n(18)\n( ) ( )\nwhere the distorted aggregate disutility level is given by\n15\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\n( )\n̂ ( )\n{( )∫ ( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n( )\n̂ ( )\n∫ ( ) ( ( )( )( ))( ) ( ) (19)\n( )\n( )\n̂ ( )\n( )\n∫ ( ) [∫ ( ) ( ( )( ))( ) ] ( )}\n( )\nEach of the three lines in this equation corresponds to a different type of worker. The third line\nreflects the workers who are constrained by the downward nominal wage rigidities. These workers\nare the reason that the level of employment is lower under downward nominal wage rigidities than\nunder flexible wages. They are stuck charging a wage higher than they initially intended because\nthey drew an unexpectedly low disutility shock, . Stuck at this wage, they end up providing fewer\nlabor services than they wanted to supply. The existence of the idiosyncratic shocks is thus a central\npart of this argument. Without them, downward nominal wage rigidities are unlikely to cause a\nsubstantial distortion in equilibrium. In fact, most studies of downward nominal wage rigidities\nwithout such shocks find that very small effects on labor market allocations and welfare.19\nEven with idiosyncratic shocks, the employment loss due to workers being stuck at a high wage\nis partly offset by the change in wage setting behavior for the workers who do adjust their wage.\nThey make up the first two lines in equation (19). In order to decrease the likelihood of the\ndownward rigidities being binding in the future, they set their wage, ( ), lower than under\nflexible wages, ̂ ( ). At this lower real wage they end up supplying more labor than they would\nhave under flexible wages. This is a point that Elsby (2009) emphasizes as limiting the welfare cost\nof downward nominal wage rigidities.20\nComparing (18) with (15) one can see that the net effect of downward nominal wage rigidities is\ncaptured by the ratio ⁄ . This is the labor wedge introduced by the rigidities. This labor wedge\nresults in a shortfall in employment in equilibrium relative to the economy under flexible wages.\nFollowing Benigno and Ricci (2011) we define the unemployment rate, , in our model as the\n19 See Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2008) and Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Wieland (2012), for example. Carlsson and Westermark\n(2008) even find that DNWR can be welfare improving because they reduce wage fluctuations.\n20 Ball and Mankiw (1994) make a similar point about the welfare costs of asymmetric costs to price adjustments.\n16\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\npercentage shortfall in employment under downward nominal wage rigidities compared to under\nflexible wages.\nHow DNWR bend the Phillips curve\nTo understand how our model generates the type of bending of the wage Phillips curve evident in\nthe data in Figure 3 it is useful to interpret the time path of the wage Phillips curve as the result of\nthe changing intersection of an aggregate demand (AD) curve and a short-run aggregate supply\n(SRAS) curve. Since the positions of both of these curves shift in response to shocks, the\nintersection points change to produce a short-run time path of the wage Phillips curve.\nIn our model, the AD curve reflects the combinations of the unemployment rate, , and (wage)\ninflation rate, , consistent with the combination of the monetary policy rule, (14), and\nconsumption Euler equation, (9). Since these two equations depend on current output they also\ndepend implicitly on the unemployment rate, inflation, as well as the discount rate shock, , the\nproductivity shock, , and the future path of the equilibrium variables. This means that the AD\ncurve moves in response to different shocks. For our main experiment of a negative discount rate\nshock the curve shifts outward relative to the steady state.\nThe SRAS curve in our model is given by all combinations of the unemployment rate, , and\nthe inflation rate, , that satisfy (18), where all workers follow the optimal wage setting schedule\nimplied by the Bellman equation (13). This short-run aggregate supply curve is declining in the\ninflation rate. This is because a decline in inflation makes DNWR bind for more workers who are\nnot able to reduce their wages. This reduces total labor demand and output relative to what it would\nhave been at the higher inflation rate and increases unemployment.\nThe SRAC curve also shifts out in response to our main shock—a negative discount rate shock,\n. This is because such a shock increases the weight on the continuation value,\n( ⁄( )( )), in equation (13), which is the effective marginal cost of pay\nincreases. This results in a compression of wage increases similar to that shown in Figure 1. But\nwhen overall wage increases are compressed, the DNWR constraint binds for more workers and\nresults in a higher unemployment rate, shifting the SRAS curve outwards.\nThis means that in the presence of downward nominal wage rigidities a negative discount rate\nshock acts both as a negative demand shock, that shifts the AD curve, and as a negative supply\n17\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nshock, that shifts the SRAS curve. How this nets out to affect the short-run wage Phillips curve\ndepends on the relative movements in the AD and SRAS curves in response to the initial shock and\nthe relative movement of the two curves back to their pre-shock steady-state locations. Figure 5\nillustrates two relevant cases, one for low rigidities and one for high rigidities. For context, note that\nin the limiting case where wages are fully flexible the SRAS curve is vertical and does not shift in\nresponse to the shock. In that case, which satisfies the Classical Dichotomy, a discount shock would\nonly affect the level of inflation and not output and the unemployment rate.\nMoving slightly away from the limiting case, Panel (a) of Figure 5 shows how the AD and\nSRAS curves respond to a negative discount rate shock when downward nominal wage rigidities are\nlow. Since we are not far from the flexible wages case, the SRAS does not move very much in\nresponse to the shock; in the figure it moves from SRAS to SRAS’. In contrast, the AD curve\nmoves a lot. This results in a relatively low sacrifice ratio in response to the shock. After the shock,\nthe movements in the AD curve back to its original position are much larger than that of the SRAS\ncurve. These relative movements of the curves generate a subsequent path that displays the opposite\ntype of curvature than we observe in the data, illustrated by the curved dark line in the figure.\nConsidering a more realistic case based on the U.S. data, Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows what\nhappens when downward nominal wage rigidities are high. In that case the SRAS curve is flatter\nand shifts out more in response to the shock. This results in a higher sacrifice ratio in response to\nthe shock. During the adjustment back to the steady state, the inward movement in the SRAS is\nfaster than that in the AD curve, resulting in the type of curvature in the wage Phillips curve that we\nobserve in the data in Figure 3.\nThe type of curvature observed in the data and the illustrative examples provided in Figure 5\nsuggest that downward nominal wage rigidities are relevant for the dynamics of wage growth and\nthe unemployment rate. In the next section, show how the equilibrium path of our model looks like\npanel (b) of Figure 5. Unfortunately, neither the steady-state value nor the equilibrium path of our\nmodel can be solved in closed form. Therefore, we use numerical examples in the next section to\nillustrate how our model satisfies the main intuition captured in Figure 5.\n18\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\n4. Numerical results\nSteady state equilibrium\nIn this subsection we show that our model produces similar long-run properties to those emphasized\nin other theoretical studies of downward nominal wage rigidities (Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry,\n1996, Fagan and Messina, 2009, and Benigno and Ricci, 2011). Specifically, we show that in\nsteady-state, our model generates the familiar long-run trade-off between unemployment and\ninflation due to downward nominal wage rigidities. We also show that our model produces the same\ndistortions in the distribution of nominal wage changes documented in micro studies and shown in\nFigures 1 and 2. These include the spike at zero wage growth and the missing mass of negative and\npositive wage changes associated with downward nominal wage rigidities.\nCalibration of parameters that matter for the steady state\nWe split the parameters that matter for the steady-state outcome of our model into two groups. The\nfirst consists of the basic preference and technology parameters which we choose based on previous\nstudies and historical evidence for the U.S. In particular, we follow Benigno and Ricci (2011) and\nset the wage elasticity of labor demand to and the Frisch elasticity of the labor supply,\n. We set trend productivity growth, ̅, to match the 2.7 percent average annualized growth\nrate of labor productivity from 2001 through 2007. Furthermore, we assume that the discount factor,\n, is 2 percent annualized. In combination with the level of trend productivity growth, ̅, this pins\ndown the natural real interest rate.21 Time, , is measured in quarters.\nThe second group contains the parameters that affect the importance of DNWR in equilibrium:\n(i) , the probability of being subject to the downward nominal wage rigidities constraint in a\nperiod, (ii) the variance of the idiosyncratic shocks, , and (iii) the target inflation level, ̅, and\ndegree to which it greases the labor market in the sense of (17).22 Throughout the rest of this\nsubsection we investigate how changes in these parameters affect the steady-state unemployment\n21 Since, in steady state, the inflation rate is equal to its target, ̅, and the output gap is zero, the monetary policy parameters, and\ndo not affect the steady-state outcome.\n22 In principle, the level of trend productivity growth, ̅, also affects the degree of DNWR because trend productivity growth greases\nthe wheels of the labor market in the same way that inflation does. Because their effects are identical, we focus on variation in the\ntarget inflation rate, ̅.\n19\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nrate and wage setting.23 We use as our benchmark-case and , which results in a 5\npercent natural rate of unemployment at a 2 percent (annualized) inflation target. The benchmark\nparameter values that we use are listed in Table 1.\nLong-run Phillips curve\nFigure 6 plots the long-run Phillips curves from our model for four different degrees of downward\nnominal wage rigidities, { }. For we plot two curves, one for ,\nsolid line, and one for , dashed line. The benchmark-case and is denoted\nby the thick black line in the figure. The vertical axis is the inflation target and the horizontal axis is\nthe natural rate of unemployment that results from the inflation-target choice.\nSeveral points are worth noting in this figure. First, for all four degrees of rigidities, the long-run\nPhillips curve is downward sloping. This is consistent with the idea that inflation greases the wheels\nof the labor market, so that the lower the central bank’s inflation target the less lubricated the labor\nmarket and the higher the natural rate of unemployment. Second, the long-run sacrifice ratio is\nincreasing in the degree to which the downward nominal wage rigidities are binding. In other\nwords, as increases, unemployment increases for a given reduction in the target inflation rate. Of\ncourse, our model solely focuses on downward nominal wage rigidities. A more general analysis of\nthe optimal inflation target, like and Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Wieland (2012), would take into\naccount the many different costs and benefits of (steady-state) inflation (see, Fischer and\nModigliani, 1978).\nA third point worth noting is that changes in , illustrated for , produce two effects.\nHigher values of increase the degree to which downward nominal wage rigidities are binding,\npushing the long-run Phillips curve out. Raising also alters the slope of the long-run Phillips\ncurve, albeit slightly, with very little impact on the sacrifice ratio.\nOur results are similar to those from previous research. For example, the average long-run\nsacrifice ratio for are of a similar magnitude as that in Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996,\nFigure 3) in that an increase of the inflation target from 0 to 10 results in an approximately 3\npercentage point drop in the natural rate of unemployment. And like Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry\n23 We interpret the steady-state unemployment rate as the natural rate of unemployment in the rest of this paper.\n20\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\n(1996, Figure 3) and Benigno and Ricci (2011, Figure 2), we find that the long-run Phillips curve is\nbent such that the long-run sacrifice ratio is higher for lower target inflation rates.\nDistortion of log nominal wage changes\nThe long-run unemployment-inflation trade-off that downward nominal wage rigidities induce is the\nresult of the rigidities distorting wage-setting behavior. To illustrate this distortion, we plot the\ntheoretical equivalent of the distribution of log nominal wage changes, depicted in Figure 1, for\n̅ percent (annualized) and for as well as for the case of flexible wages, . The\ndistribution of quarterly log nominal wage changes in our model is plotted in Figure 7.\nLog-normality of the idiosyncratic shocks, , together with the optimal wage setting under\nflexible wages, (12), implies that, under flexible wages, the steady-state distribution of quarterly log\nnominal wage changes will be normal with a mean equal to the sum of the quarterly steady-state\ninflation rate, in this case 0.5 percent, and productivity growth, which we set at 0.66 percent. This is\nthe ‘flexible’ distribution plotted in Figure 7.\nThe distribution of quarterly log wage changes under downward nominal wage rigidities looks\nnotably different. As we documented in the empirical section, the presence of downward nominal\nwage rigidities distorts this distribution in three ways. First, there are many fewer negative wage\nchanges due to the rigidities. Second, the rigidities result in a spike at zero nominal wage changes.\nFor our parameter combination, 57 percent of workers have the same wage as in the previous\nquarter. Third, and most surprisingly, there are many fewer positive wage changes and those that do\noccur are smaller than under flexible wages.24 In our model, under flexible wages 56 percent of\nworkers get a quarterly wage increase of 0.25 percent or higher. While under downwardly rigid\nwages, this fraction is only 37 percent.\nThis result, that downward nominal rigidities affect positive wage changes as well as negative\nones, implies that some of the spike at zero in the data (Figure 1) reflects a pulling back of wage\nincreases. This suggests that empirical studies that estimate the importance of downward wage\nrigidities by comparing the actual distribution of wage changes with a constructed counterfactual\n(Card and Hyslop, 1997, and Lebow, Saks, and Wilson, 2003) may be underestimating the true\nmagnitude. These studies construct counterfactuals assuming that the observed frequency and size\n24 This point has been emphasized by Elsby (2009).\n21\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nof positive wage changes are not affected by the existence of the rigidities. This assumption is\nclearly violated in our theoretical model.\nSo far, we have shown that the steady-state distribution of log wage changes in our model,\ndepicted in Figure 7, shares its main qualitative characteristics with its empirical counterpart in\nFigure 1. One noticeable difference is that the spike at zero wage changes in Figure 7 is much\nhigher than in Figure 1. This might lead one to conclude that downward nominal wage rigidities are\nmuch more binding in our model than in the data. This, however, is actually not the case.\nTo see why, note that there is one main difference between Figures 7 and 1. Data constraints in\nthe CPS only allow us to construct 12-month wage changes for individuals. Thus, the spike at zero\nwage changes in Figure 1 is for 4-quarter wage changes rather than for the one quarter that we\ndepicted in Figure 7. For a better comparison of how binding the rigidities are in the data versus the\nmodel we plot the fraction of workers in our model with no wage change over four quarters for\ndifferent parameter values and levels of target inflation in Figure 8. This four quarter change more\nclosely matches the data shown in Figures 1 and 2 and allows us to verify whether our choice of\nresults in the rigidities being much more binding in our model than in the data. The\nopposite turns out to be true.\nThe figure shows that over four quarters, the spike at zero in our model is only 5.6 percent. The\nrelatively low fraction of workers with no wage changes over 4 quarters reflects our assumption that\nthere is no persistence in the idiosyncratic shocks, . Without this persistence, the following things\nneed to happen for a worker to be stuck at no wage change for four quarters. For the four quarters in\na row the worker needs to be subject to the downward wage rigidities constraint. This happens with\nprobability . In addition, the worker needs to draw four consecutive idiosyncratic shocks that call\nfor no wage increase. The joint probability of these eight events occurring is low. Thus, based on\nthe size of the spike at zero 4-quarter wage changes our model exhibits relatively low downward\nnominal rigidities compared to the data, where this spike is higher than 10 percent (Figure 2).\nHence, our parameter choice of is conservative in that it implies much less measured\ndownward nominal wage rigidities than observed in the data.\nThe figure also highlights the relationship between downward nominal wage rigidities and the\ntarget inflation rate. For all values of , the spike at zero wage changes rises as the target inflation\nrate declines. Since average inflation has been falling over time in the U.S., the potential for\n22\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\ndownward nominal wage rigidities has risen. This is the likely driver of the upward trend in the\nfraction of workers reporting the same wage as one year before, plotted in Figure 2.\nTransitional dynamics: Slope and curvature of the Phillips curve\nOf course, the empirical patterns in downward nominal wage rigidities and the wage Phillips curve\nin the aftermath of recessions, presented in Section 2, do not reflect a movement of the steady state\nbut rather a reaction to a shock that causes a deviation from steady state. Thus, to interpret these\npatterns in the context of our model we need to solve its transitional dynamics. We do so in this\nsection. In particular, we are interested in whether these dynamics are qualitatively consistent with\nthe facts we documented in Section 2.\nTo isolate the effect of downward nominal wage rigidities we consider the response of the\neconomy to a negative persistent discount rate shock\n, where , , and (20)\nNote that in the absence of downward nominal wage rigidities such a shock would be perfectly\noffset by a decline in the real interest rate, leaving the real allocation of resources in the economy\nunaffected.25\nThe degree to which such a shock is offset in the presence of downward nominal wage rigidities\ndepends on the shape of the monetary policy rule. As for this, we use Rudebusch’s (2009) estimates\nfor the policy rule parameters and fix and . These parameter estimates are based\non the period from 1988 through 2008. The target inflation rate, ̅, is set to 2 percent annualized. 26\nIn the rest of this section we show that the transition path of the model, in response to such a\ndiscount rate shock and under the estimated Taylor rule, (i) matches the shift in the histogram of log\nnominal wage changes, presented in Figure 1, (ii) exhibits a run up in the spike at zero nominal\nwage changes, as in Figure 2, and (iii) generates the non-linearity in the empirical wage Phillips\ncurve shown in Figure 3.\n25 Alternative shocks, like a shock to the marginal of substitution between consumption and leisure will also affect output and\ninflation in the absence of downward nominal wage rigidities.\n26 Of course, either of these policy rules might not be feasible for if the central bank’s policy rule is subject to the zero\nnominal lower bound (ZLB).\n23\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nTo illustrate this, we solve for the model’s non-linear transitional dynamics keeping track of the\ndistribution of real wages along the equilibrium path. We do so by using the extended path method,\nintroduced by Fair and Taylor (1983).27 Our main example is the transitional dynamics after a large\ndiscount rate shock equal to .28\nDistortion of log nominal wage changes\nFigure 9 shows the distribution of quarterly log wage changes right before the shock hits, at\nwhen the economy is in steady state, as well as the distribution three years after the shock hits, at\n. It is our model equivalent of Figure 1, interpreting 2006 as the steady state and 2011 as\nafter the shock.\nFigure 9 illustrates that the model replicates three main features from the data. First, the spike at\nzero nominal wage changes increases in response to the negative demand shock. This occurs\nbecause the decline in inflation, in response to the shock, makes downward nominal wage rigidities\nbind for more workers who are not able to reduce their wages. In addition, the likelihood of being\nconstrained by DNWR in the future increases for workers who are raising their wages, making them\ntemper their wage increases. These wage increases are further reduced by the negative demand\nshock increasing the weight on the continuation value, ( ⁄( )( )), in equation\n(13). This shock raises the effective marginal cost of pay increases even further and results in a\ncompression of wage increases similar to that shown in Figure 1. Note that this compression is fully\ndriven by the wage rigidities and is not due to a change in labor productivity, which is constant in\nthis simulation. Finally, just like in the data, there does not seem to be a large increase in the\nfraction of workers with wage declines, though conditional on getting a reduction in the nominal\nwage this decline is slightly larger after the shock than before.\n27 Examples of other applications of this solution method are Hobijn, Ravenna, and Tambalotti (2006), who solve the transitional\ndynamics of a model with nominal rigidities, and Carriga, Manuelli, and Peralta-Alva (2012) who consider the non-linear\ntransitional dynamics to a large shock that affects house prices. A more detailed description of how we implement the method can\nbe found in Appendix A.\n28 One of the shortcomings of our model is that it requires a large discount rate shock to generate fluctuations in the unemployment\nrate. This is a common problem in models of this type.\n24\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nTime-series path of spike at zero\nFigure 10 confirms that the model also generates a persistent increase in the spike at zero wage\nchanges, just like in the data in Figure 2. The negative discount rate shock, in combination with the\nmonetary policy response, leads to a decline in the inflation rate, which results in an increase in the\nfraction of workers who are stuck charging an undesirably high wage, making them sell fewer labor\nservices than they initially planned. As a consequence, the unemployment rate increases. Because of\nthe persistence of the shock these rigidities continue to bind even after the unemployment rate\nbegins to decline, just as in Figure 2.\nWage Phillips curve\nThe joint movement of inflation and unemployment along the transition path is depicted in Figure\n11. The panels plot the short-run Phillips curves for different levels of rigidities (panel a), different\ninitial discount rate shocks (panel b), different inflation targets (panel c), and for the combination of\na discount rate and productivity shock (panel d).\nPanel (a) compares our benchmark case of with the case of higher and lower\ndownward nominal wage rigidities. The plots confirm the intuition conveyed in Figure 5,\nnamely that higher DNWR lead to a higher sacrifice ratio and more bending of the Phillips curve.\nWe interpret this result as consistent with the idea that downward nominal wage rigidities are an\nimportant factor that shapes the curvature of the empirical wage Phillips curve plotted in Figure 3.\nAccording to our model, if downward nominal wage rigidities were not important, the type of\nbending we have seen in the data following the last three recession and recovery periods would not\nhave occurred.\nIn panel (b) we plot the path for three different sizes of initial discount rate shocks,\n{ }. The results show that the deeper the shock the longer the flat portion\nof the Phillips curve persists. This implies that there can be long periods of stagnant wage growth,\neven when unemployment is declining, especially after deep recessions. Again, the patterns\ngenerated from our model are consistent with the data presented in Figure 3, and might help explain\nwhy wage growth has been especially sluggish relative to decline in the unemployment rate in the\naftermath of the Great Recession.\n25\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nPanel (c) considers how the impact of downward nominal wage rigidities varies with the\ninflation target, ̅, specifically target inflation of ̅ percent and ̅ percent, annualized. For\ncomparison purposes, the figure also includes the long-run Phillips curve for from Figure 6.\nThe first thing to note is that under the high target inflation rate of ̅ percent, downward\nnominal wage rigidities are less binding and the short-run sacrifice ratio is smaller than under ̅\npercent. That is, the response to the initial shock under the high inflation target is more through\n(wage) inflation and less through the unemployment rate than under the low inflation target. Under\n̅ percent the initial increase in the unemployment rate is 2.5 percentage points while wage\ninflation decelerates by 6.5 percentage points. At ̅ percent this initial response is 2.7\npercentage points on the unemployment rate and 2.5 percentage points on inflation respectively.\nIn addition to the response to the initial shock we can also compare the speed of the transition\nback to steady state. If inflation greases the wheels then it might accelerate the pace with which the\neconomy returns to steady state in response to a shock. Surprisingly, the speeds of adjustment along\nthe two transitional paths plotted are very similar. Hence, our simulation results suggest that\nincreasing the target inflation rate, ̅, to accelerate the pace of labor market adjustments might not\nhave a particularly large impact. Of course, this result is based on our particular model of downward\nnominal wage rigidities and might change when these rigidities are included in a richer\nmacroeconomic framework.\nSince recessions often are not solely the result of discount rate shocks, but often accompanied\nby declines in labor productivity, the final panel of Figure 11, panel (d), plots the results for both a\nproductivity and a discount rate shock. Our productivity shock lowers labor productivity growth\nfrom its historical annual average, 2.7 percent, to 0 at and then lets it come back gradually\naccording to\n( ̅) ( ̅), where , ̅, and (21)\nThe figure shows that if the economy is hit by a productivity shock alone, inflation rises and\nunemployment increases. This is because the AD demand curve barely moves, while the SRAC\ncurve moves a lot, such that the economy moves along the AD curve producing both higher\ninflation and higher unemployment (see Figure 5). In this sense, the productivity shock acts like a\nclassic supply shock in our model.\n26\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nAdding the demand shock to the experiment shows that recessions that coincide with slower\nproductivity growth produce an even flatter Phillips curve than ones where productivity growth is\nunaffected. This can be seen by comparing the Phillips curve labeled discount rate shock to the one\nlabeled productivity and discount rate shock in panel (d). The additional flattening of the Phillips\ncurve owes to the fact that productivity growth, like inflation, greases the wheels of the labor\nmarket. In periods of low productivity growth this additional grease is removed and the time period\nover which wage growth remains stagnates while the unemployment rate fall is lengthened.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper we made two main contributions. Our first contribution was empirical. We updated\nand expanded existing micro data studies to document the existence of downward nominal wage\nrigidities in the U.S. We also showed that these rigidities vary with the business cycle, but\nasymmetrically. The prevalence of downward nominal wage rigidities spikes in recessions as\nunemployment rises, but remains high well after unemployment begins to come down. Finally, we\nhighlighted the fact that this cyclical pattern of downward nominal wage rigidities coincides with\nsubstantial curvature in the U.S. short-run Phillips curve.\nOur second contribution was to understand the empirical patterns we described using a model of\nmonetary policy with downward nominal wage rigidities. Adding to previous research on the long-\nrun Phillips curve, we solved for the full non-linear transitional dynamics of the model in response\nto demand and supply shocks, taking into account the evolution of the distribution of wages along\nthe equilibrium path. This focus on the joint cyclical path of unemployment and wage growth\nfollowing business cycle downturns is the key innovation of our paper.\nThe results highlight the importance of our approach. Our model was able to generate the key\npatterns observed in the data, including the increase in downward nominal wage rigidities following\nrecessions and the subsequent bending of the short-run Phillips curve. Notably, we generate these\npatterns in our model for parameter values under which downward nominal wage rigidities are\nsubstantially less binding than empirical evidence suggests that they are in the U.S.\nOverall, the model simulations showed that downward nominal wage rigidities bend the Phillips\ncurve in two ways. First, during recessions the rigidities become more binding and the labor market\n27\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nadjustment disproportionately happens through the unemployment margin rather than through\nwages. The higher the rigidities, the more this mechanism matters and the higher the short-run\nsacrifice ratio between unemployment and inflation. Second, recessions result in substantial pent up\nwage deflation. This leads to a simultaneous deceleration of wage inflation and a decline in the\nunemployment rate during the ensuing recovery period. This bending of the Phillips curve is\nespecially pronounced in a low inflationary environment. We interpret our empirical work and\nmodel simulations as evidence that downward nominal wage rigidities are an important force\nshaping the dynamics of unemployment, wage growth, and inflation during and after the last three\nU.S. recessions.\nFitting these complicated dynamics of wage growth and unemployment has turned out to be a\nchallenge for New-Keynesian models, like those analyzed in Galí, Smets, and Wouters (2011) and\nJustiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2013). Though the simplified nature of our model, which\nallowed us to solve for its non-linear transition path, only enabled us to qualitatively match the facts\non the distribution of nominal wage changes and the wage Phillips curve, our results suggest that\nthe inclusion of non-linear dynamics due to downward nominal wage rigidities with idiosyncratic\nshocks in more elaborate macroeconomic models is a challenging but promising area for future\nresearch.29\n29 Like the models used to study the likelihood of hitting the ZLB in Chung et. al (2012), or the one used by Coibion et. al (2012).\nAbbritti and Fahr (2013) is the state-of-the-art in this research area.\n28\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nReferences\nAbbritti, Mirko, and Stephan Fahr (2013), “Downward Wage Rigidities and Business Cycle\nAsymmetries,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 60, 871-886.\nAkerlof, George A., William T.

In addition, substituting the equilibrium condition that ⁄ , we\nobtain the real detrended version of the demand for labor of worker as\n( )\n(26)\nIn addition, we can rewrite the household’s objective as\n∑ ∑ { ∫ } where (27)\nSince the path of productivity, , is exogenous, it can be dropped from the objective function.\nThese are the transformed equations for which the optimality conditions are most easily solved and\nmost directly interpretable.\nThe first-order necessary conditions\nThe discrete-time Hamiltonian associated with this problem is\n32\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\n( )\n∑ ∑ [ ∫ {\n( )( )\n∫ }] (28)\nHere is the discounted co-state variable.\nOptimal consumption condition.

The condition that determines the household’s optimal savings level, ,\nis given by\n( )\n∑ [\n( )( )\n] (31)\nRearranging the terms in this condition yields\n( )\n(32)\n( )( )\nCombining (30) and (32) gives the consumption Euler equation, (9), in the main text.\nWage-setting objective, equation (10)\nWe can isolate the part of the household’s Hamiltonian that involves the wage-setting of household\nmember . That part is\ñ [∑ ∑ [ ]] (33)\nSubstituting in the result that ⁄ ⁄ , this objective can be simplified to\ñ [∑ ∑ [ ]] [∑ ∑ ( )] (34)\nThis is equation (10) from the main text.\n33\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nWage setting under flexible wages, equation (12)\nUnder flexible wages, in each period household member chooses its real wage to maximize\n( ). The associated first order condition is\n( ) [ ( ) ] (35)\nSolving this condition for the real wage, , yields\n( ) (36)\nThis is equation (12) from the main text.\nProperties of the optimal wage setting schedule, ( )\nThe Bellman equation associated with the dynamic wage-setting problem of the workers under\ndownward nominal wage rigidities is given by (13).\nWorkers that adjust their wage, are not subject to the DNWR constraint, and have the same set\nthe same wage ( ).\nThese workers choose their wage to solve\n{ ( ) ( ⁄( )( ))}\n(37)\nThe only respect with which workers differ is in terms of their productivity level. Hence, workers\nwith the same productivity level choose the same wage.\nThe wage-setting schedule, ( ), is such that ( ) ̂ ( ).\nThis is easiest seen by a transformation of variables. Instead of having the worker choose, , we\nwrite its decision variable as ( ⁄ ) . This allows us to write\n( )\n( )\n( ) ( ) (38)\nIn addition, the transformed Bellman equation, (13), can be written as\n34\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\n( ) ( )∫ { ( ) ( [( )( )] )} ( )\n(39)\n∫ { ( ) ( [( )( )] )} ( )\nFrom this Bellman equation it can be seen that ( ) . That is, the higher, (the lower the real\nwage), the less binding the constraint of downward nominal wage rigidities and the higher the value\nof starting the period with a high .\nNote that ( ) is concave, in that\n( )\n( )\n( ) ( ) (40)\n( )\nand\n( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) (41)\n( ) ( )\nUnder flexible wages, the wage set, ̂ , satisfies the first-order necessary condition\n( ̂ ) (42)\nUnder downward nominal wage rigidities, this condition is\n( ) [( )( )] ( [( )( )] ) (43)\nSince the second term in this equation is non-negative, this means that, at the optimal wage-setting\nchoice under downward nominal wage rigidities it is the case that\n( ) (44)\nConcavity of ( ) then implies that the worker will choose ̂ . Converting this\nresult back into the real wage that the worker chooses yields that ( ) ̂ ( ).\nThe wage-setting schedule, ( ), is strictly increasing in .\nSuppose that ( ) is not strictly increasing in . Then the optimal choice of is not strictly\ndecreasing in . This means that and such that and\n̂( ) ̂( ) ( ) ( ) (45)\nHere, ̂( ) is the level of chosen by a worker with shock when wages can be adjusted flexibly.\nFor all it is the case that\n35\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\n( ( ) ) ( ( )[( )( )] )\n(46)\n( ) ( [( )( )] )\nand\n( ( ) ) ( ( )[( )( )] )\n(47)\n( ) ( [( )( )] )\nThe last equation implies that\n( ) ( )\n[ ( ( )[( )( )] ) ( ( )[( )( )] )]\n(48)\n( ) ( )\n[ ( )\n(\n( )\n)\n( )\n(\n( )\n)\n]\nSince , this thus implies that\n( ) ( )\n[ ( ( )[( )( )] ) ( ( )[( )( )] )]\n(49)\n( ) ( )\n[ ( )\n(\n( )\n)\n( )\n(\n( )\n)\n]\nRearranging terms, this means that\n( ( ) ) ( ( )[( )( )] )\n(50)\n( ( ) ) ( ( )[( )( )] )\nBut this implies that ( ) cannot be the optimal choice for a worker with shock . Hence, the\noptimal choice of is strictly decreasing in . Consequently, ( ) is strictly increasing in .\nWorkers that are subject to DNWR and for whom ( ) will keep wage fixed.\nThe easiest way to show this is to show that if DNWR are binding at , which is the case when\n( ) , then they are binding at all . Suppose not, then\n( ) ( [( )( )] )\n(51)\n( ) ( [( )( )] )\nwhile there and such that\n( ) ( [( )( )] )\n(52)\n( ) ( [( )( )] )\nBut, using the similar argument as in equations (48) and (49) these two equations can be shown to\ncontradict each other. Thus, if DNWR are binding at , then they are binding for all . Hence,\nany worker subject to DNWR at a wage ( ) will keep their wage fixed.\n36\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nThe log normal distribution\nFor the disutility from working shock, , we assume that it is drawn from a log-Normal distribution,\nsuch that ( ). Throughout, we denote the standard Normal distribution function by\n( ) and the corresponding density by ( ).\nFor our derivations, we extensively use the properties of the log-Normal distribution that make\nmake expectations of various exponentials of the random variable easily tractable. First note that we\nchoose the mean such that\n(53)\n( )\nHence, the average productivity level across firms equals one.\nMoreover,\n( )\n( ) (54)\nand, consequently, we find that\n[ ( )]\n( ) (55)\nThe final property that we use is that of the truncated log normal.

Doing so, we can write\n38\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\n( )\n( )( )\n( )\n( )\n̂ ( )\n{( )∫ ( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n(64)\n( )\n̂ ( )\n∫ ( ) ( ( )( )( ))( ) ( )\n( )\n̂ ( )\n∫ [∫ ( )( ) ( ( )( ))( ) ] ( )}\n( )\nWhen we define\n{( )∫ ( )\n( )\n(\n̂ ( )\n) ( )\n( )\n∫ ( )\n( )\n( ( )( )( ))(\n̂ ( )\n) ( ) (65)\n( )\n∫ ( )\n( )\n[∫ ( )( ) ( ( )( ))(\n̂ ( )\n) ] ( )}\n( )\n( )\nThen the equilibrium condition can be written as\n( ) ( )\n( )( )\n(66)\n( ) ( )\nSolving this with respect to ⁄ yields that\n(67)\n( ) ( )\nThis is equation (18) in the main text.\nNumerical method\nApproximation of the distribution and density functions of real wages, ( ) and ( )\nThroughout, we use polynomial approximations for the value function ( ) and the wage-setting\nschedule, ( ) and ( ). We truncated the log-normal distribution of at and ̅, such that\n( ) ( ̅) . Truncating the distribution of the disutility shocks means that, at a non-\nnegative target inflation rate, ̅, the support of the steady-state real wage distribution is bounded.\nThis, in turn, means that the support of the real wage distribution is bounded at any point along the\n39\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\ntransition path. We then use Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomials to approximate\n( ) on this bounded support. Since these polynomials are differentiable, they also allow us to\ncalculate ( )\nSteady state solution\nIn the steady state the inflation rate equals the inflation target, ̅. The steady state is solved by\niterating over the following steps: (i) For a given level of output , iterate over the Bellman\nequation until convergence. This gives the wage-setting schedule, ( ) and ( ). (ii) Given the\nwage-setting schedule, iterate over the recursive equation for the distribution function of real wages\n( ) to obtain the corresponding real wage distribution. (iii) Give the wage-setting schedule and\nthe distribution of real wages, solve for the level of that equates the real wage to one using the\nequilibrium condition under downwardly rigid nominal wages, i.e. (18).\nTransition path\nThe application of calculating the transition path using the extended path method involves the\nfollowing steps. The path is calculated for under the assumption that the economy is in\nsteady state at time and at time . We start off assuming the economy is in steady state\nalong the whole path, except that the discount rate shock is not zero along that path. (i) In the first\nstep we use a backward recursion for the policy rule to obtain the nominal interest rate and inflation\nrate that the central bank would set in response to the path of { } . (ii) For the path of the\ninflation rate { } we then solve the path of the optimal wage setting schedule { ( )}\nthrough backward recursion using the assumption that the economy is in steady state for . (iii)\nGiven the path of { ( )} we then use forward recursion to solve the path of { ( )} . (iv)\nGiven the paths of { ( )} and { ( )} we then calculate the implied path of { } . We\niterate over steps (i) through (iv) until convergence.\n40\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nAppendix B: Data details\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS)\nThe CPS is a monthly survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. CPS participants stay\nwith the survey for 18 months and over the course of that period are asked to report on earnings\ntwice, once towards the beginning of their time and once towards the end-with the intervening time\nspan equaling 12 months. Since we are interested in wage changes among all workers in the\neconomy, our sample includes both workers who remain with their employer and those who change\njobs during the period over which they report their earnings. Similarly, we include both salaried\nworkers and workers paid at an hourly rate. For those paid at an hourly rate we use reported hourly\nearnings; for salaried workers we impute an hourly wage by dividing weekly earnings by hours\nworked per week. Nominal wage changes are computed for each worker as the difference in their\nreported log wages. Our final CPS dataset contains monthly information on the distribution of\nnominal wage changes for a representative sample of U.S. workers for the period from January\n1980 to February 2013. For more details regarding using the CPS for this purpose see Daly, Hobijn\nand Wiles (2011).\nMatching individuals across CPS interviews in different months\nOur CPS dataset is constructed using the outgoing CPS monthly files from the BLS. We match\nindividuals across different months using the matching algorithm detailed in Daly, Hobijn, and\nWiles (2011). Specifically, individuals must match on age (+3 or -1 years between subsequent\ninterviews), race, household ID, and line number. The Census scrambled household identifiers in\nJuly 1985 and June 1995, so we cannot match individuals one year forward from this date. This\nmeans that our dataset contains no wage change data from July 1985 to June 1986 and from June\n1995 to May 1996. We use all 8 interview months (IMs) in order to match individuals and to\ndetermine if they are job stayers, but our final dataset contains only the outgoing rotation groups\n(IM 4 and IM 8) which are the only rotation groups with earnings information.\n41\n\nDALY AND HOBIJN\nConstructing wage variables\nWhen collecting a worker’s earnings data, the BLS ascertains if the worker in question is paid at an\nhourly rate. If so, the worker’s hourly rate of pay excluding overtime, tips, and commissions is\nrecorded. We use this measure of earnings when available. Otherwise, we divide usual weekly\nearnings by usual hours worked per week to create an imputed hourly rate of pay. The BLS collects\nusual weekly earnings data by asking respondents to report their earnings in the easiest way, and\nthen converting to a weekly rate of pay. Workers that are paid at an hourly rate and do not make\nmore than the binding minimum wage in their state of residence (in either IM 4 or IM 8) are\ndropped from the sample. We also drop workers with any top-coded earnings data and restrict our\nanalysis to workers age 16 and older. Our final dataset consists of 12-month rolling panels of hourly\nwage data from January 1980 to February 2013. Wage changes are calculated as the difference in\nthe log of hourly wages from one year ago. In other words, in our dataset a wage change of 0.1 in\nJanuary 2013 means that the log of a worker’s reported or imputed hourly wage in January 2013\nwas 0.1 greater than the log of his or her hourly wage in January 2012.\nWage composite for wage Phillips curve\nThe four wage series we use to construct our composite index of wage growth are Compensation\nper hour (CPH), the Employment Cost Index (ECI), Median usual Weekly Earnings (MWE), and\nAverage Hourly Earnings (AHE). Galí (2011) plots separate wage Phillips curves for CPH and\nAHE. Combining the four most commonly used wage measures follows the idea of Justiniano,\nPrimiceri, and Tambalotti (2013) who include separate measurement equations for CPH and AHE\nin the state-space representation of their model and estimate the time-series as wages as the,\nstructurally identified, factor that drives both. We add the ECI and MWE to use the additional\ninformation that they contain. Figure B1 plots the four series and their first principle component\nwhich we use as our composite measure of nominal wage growth.\n42\n\nDOWNWARD NOMINAL WAGE RIGIDITIES\nBEND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\nTable 1.

This\nfact conflicts with standard neoclassical theory, which suggests that in a well-functioning economy\nregional inequalities should be eliminated through factor mobility, trade, or arbitrage. Although a\nsignificant research literature has been devoted to resolving the conflict between theory and fact,\nno real consensus has been formed (Magrini, 2007). In this paper, we analyze the patterns and\ncauses of persistent regional inequality in China. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate.\nChina presents a unique and important opportunity to study regional inequality. In terms of\nincome, China is a very unequal country.1 According to World Bank estimates, China’s income\nGini coefficient far exceeds that of South Asian countries such as India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.\nIncome differences in China are large, both inter- and intraregionally, with interregional differences\nincreasing over time (Fujita and Hu, 2001; Kanbur and Zhang, 1999). China is also a country in\ntransition, altering its institutions and economy at a rapid pace but with considerable variation\nacross provinces.2 Moreover, the long history of regional separateness in China means that data\ncollection efforts are as complete for China’s provinces as they are for the country as a whole.\nTogetherthesecharacteristicsmakeChinaanidealcasestudyforexaminingthevarioushypotheses\nregarding persistent regional inequalities.\nHypotheses about regional inequalities fall into two broad categories. The first relates persistent\ninequalities to market imperfections associated with institutional or informational barriers that\nlimit factor mobility, trade, or both (Magrini, 2007; Cremer and Pestieau, 2007).3 Empirical work\nprovides evidence for these types of barriers. For example, the cross-country research shows that\npersistent regional disparities can be linked to institutional barriers such as quotas on flows of\nhumanandphysicalcapital,tariffs,andinsufficientpropertyrights. Studieswithincountries,where\ninstitutional barriers are less pronounced, find informational barriers to be important, especially\nthose relating to the flow of labor across areas (Bound and Holzer, 2000). Again, China offers a\n1Persistentandevengrowingcross-regionalinequalityinChinaduringthereformperiodhasbeendocumentedin\nthe past (Jian, Sachs, and Warner, 1996).\n2For a survey of regional inequalities in transition economies, see Huber (2006).\n3Traditionally macro- and microeconomic approaches to this literature have focused on growth rates and levels,\nrespectively. We focus on levels in this paper. For a review of the literature on growth rates see Magrini (2007).\n2\n\nunique opportunity to study institutional barriers to labor migration because of a gradual removal\nof the system of permanent registration (hukou) during the time period we consider.\nThe second category of hypothesis on the causes of regional inequalities argues that persistent\ninequalities in income are not about constraints but are rather the result of unmeasured offsetting\nfactorsthatworktoequalizewell-beingacrossregionalagents(RiceandVenables,2003). Empirical\nwork on this hypothesis has investigated differences in government tax and transfer programs,\ncost-of-living differences, and differences in amenities, but has not reached consensus (Rice and\nVenables, 2003).\nIn our sample we find, not surprisingly, that cost-of-living differences are, indeed, an important\noffsetting factor. Thus, we adjust average nominal wages in each province by a province-specific\nconsumer price index (CPI) to obtain average real wages, which we use to study other offsetting\nfactors. Weconsidermeasuresofeducationlevelsineachprovince(toproxyforthequalityoflabor),\nindustrial composition in each province, its geographical location, and cross-province government\ntransfers. We take these factors one at a time and find that, with the exception of government\ntransfers, they all help explain a substantial portion of wage differentials. These factors cannot all\nbe considered together, because of the high correlation between the variables we consider in our\nsample. In the best case, about half of the variance in real wages across provinces remains after\ncontrolling for these offsetting factors.\nThere is a large body of research focused on inequality in China. For instance, Whalley and\nZhang (2004) calibrate the effect of removal of the hukou system and show that its contribution\nto regional as well as urban–rural inequality is sizable. Kanbur and Zhang (2005) construct a\nlong time series of regional inequality and show that it is explained, in different periods of time,\nby the shares of heavy industry, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness. In\na recent paper, Wan, Lu, and Chen (2007) show that increasing globalization, uneven domestic\ncapital accumulation, and privatization contribute to regional inequality in China, while the effects\nof location, urbanization, and the dependency ratio have been declining. Yao and Zhang (2001)\ndemonstrate that there is divergence among groups (or clubs) of Chinese provinces in terms of\nreal per capita GDP. Meng, Gregory, and Want (2005) argue that discontinued provision of free\n3\n\neducation, housing, and medical care as well as growing uncertainty increased the incidence of\nurban poverty when measured in terms of expenditure.\nWe find that cross-province migration to urban areas is driven, at least in part, by wage differen-\ntials; however, contrary to findings by Whalley and Zhang (2004), migration does not reduce wage\ninequality across provinces. We believe this is because between 1995 and 2000, a period for which\nwe study migration, there were still restrictions on labor mobility that precluded labor flows from\nhaving any noticeable effect in terms of equalizing wages across provinces.\nOur results indicate that regional inequality is likely to persist in China for quite some time,\nsince it is due to such structural and long-term factors as education, industry composition, and\ngeographical location. While further removing barriers to labor mobility may alleviate some of\nthe regional wage differences, it is likely to be a slow process, because it needs to be accompanied\nby urban development. In the meantime, cross-province income redistribution may be useful to\naddress social and economic tensions that regional inequality can bring. Our study finds that, in\nthe period we consider, interprovince transfers did not help offset regional wage differences.\nThe paper is organized as follows: We begin by describing the policies that restrict labor move-\nment in China in Section 2. We describe our data and recent trends in Section 3. In Section 4 we\npresent the results of our empirical analysis. We conclude in Section 5.\n2 Migration policy in modern China\nIn 1958, Mao Zedong set up a hereditary residency permit system, known as hukou, defining where\npeople could work. This system classified individuals as either “rural” or “urban” workers and\nassigned them to a specific geographic area. Under this system, one cannot acquire a legal perma-\nnent residence nor the numerous community–based rights, opportunities, benefits, and privileges in\nplaces other than where his hukou is. Only through proper authorization from the government can\none permanently change his hukou location. For longer than a one-month stay and especially when\nseeking local employment, one must apply and be approved for a temporary residential permit.\nViolators are subject to fines, detention, and forced repatriation, which was partially relaxed in\n4\n\n2003.4\nIn addition to limiting the rural-to-urban migration of the workers, which explains an extraordi-\nnarily low degree of urbanization in China, this system limited migration across regions: migrants\nneeded to obtain registration in the new area before they were allowed to work legally. Because of\nbureaucracy and red tape, obtaining registration could take months or years. Hence, the migration\nprocess in China was in many ways similar to the migration process across national borders.\nUntil 1978, the system was enforced rather strictly: police would periodically round up those\nwithout valid residence permits, place them in detention centers, and expel them from cities. After\nChinese market reforms began 1978, a private sector appeared. Unlike state-owned enterprizes,\nprivate firms frequently do not require registration from potential employees. Economic reforms\ncreated pressures to encourage migration from the interior to the coast and provided incentives for\nofficials not to enforce regulations on migration. However, even if migrants are hired without the\nregistration, they do not have access to social services such as child care, schools, or health care.\nForcedrepatriationruleswerestillinplaceafterthebeginningofmarketreforms. Infact,the1982\n“Measures of Detaining and Repatriating Floating and Begging People in the Cities” streamlined\ntherelevantlegislation. Itwasnotuntil2003,afterthetragicincidentinGuangzhou,whereaHubei\nresident was beaten to death in jail in the process of repatriation, and the outcry that followed,\nthat the repatriation law was relaxed. “Measures on Managing and Assisting Urban Homeless\nBeggars without Income” adopted on June 20, 2003, established new rules governing the handling\nandassistingofdestitutemigrants. Manycities, includingthemostcontrolledBeijingmunicipality,\ndecided soon after that migrants outside their hukou must be dealt with more carefully; they are\nno longer automatically subject to detention, fines, or forced repatriation, unless they have become\nhomeless, paupers, or criminals.\nWhile recent reforms made it easier for migrants to survive without a hukou, they did not\nmake it easier to obtain one. Thus, many people, especially those with families, are hesitant to\npermanently change their location. Moreover, fees charged for temporary residency permits, while\nfairly affordable, add to the cost of moving. Nevertheless, according to the census data, in 2000\n4This information and some of what follows is taken in part from Wang (2005).\n5\n\nalmost 30 percent of the population was residing in a province other than the one in which they\nhad their hukou.\nThere has been more progress in reforming the hukou system at the provincial level than at the\nnational level. Between 2001 and 2007 a number of provinces adopted various measures, mostly\naddressing the rural–urban migration limitations. These measures ranged from changing the ad-\nministration of the hukou system to completely abolishing the differences between rural and urban\nhukou.5\nFor the purpose of our project, we have to recognize that the barriers to cross-province migration\nin China still exist but weakened throughout our sample period. Moreover, we have to take into\naccount the fact that the progress of reform was uneven across provinces.\n3 Data\nIn this section, we describe our data sources for inequality, offsetting factors, and migration. We\nalso describe recent trends and patterns in regional inequality and migration.\n3.1 Inequality and related data\nWe use national and provincial level data that are reported in the China Statistical Yearbook. This\nannualpublicationiscompiledbytheNationalBureauofStatisticsofChinaandispublishedbythe\nChina Statistics Press. In conjunction with these data, we also use CEIC Data’s “China Premium\nDatabase” because it provides time series of the data in the China Statistical Yearbook. Using these\nsources, weconstructanannualdatasamplewithatimerangeof1993to2006, coveringaperiodof\nfast economic growth in China. Due to data limitations, not all series have coverage for the entire\nperiod.\nTo measure income we use the average wage data. It is not reported separately for rural and\nurbanhouseholds, however, thedetailed descriptionoftheseries(seeTableA.1)suggeststhatmost\n5See“RecentChineseHukouReforms”publishedbytheCongressionalExecutiveCommissiononChina,accessed\nat http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/Residency/hreform.php in October 2007.\n6\n\nof the input into average wage comes from the urban wages.\nUnlike most countries, China provides province by province consumer price index (CPI) data.\nWe take advantage of this fact to calculate real wages using individual province CPI, which allows\nus to account for differences in cost of living in different provinces. Figure 1, which depicts the\nstandarddeviationofaveragewagesacrossprovincesasameasureofinequality, showsthatbecause\ncost of living is higher in the provinces with higher average wage, part of measured inequality in\naverage wage disappears once we account for the cost of living. For example, in 2006 the standard\ndeviation of nominal wage across provinces was 31.3, while the standard deviation of real wage was\n23.7. Because real wage inequality and not nominal wage inequality is economically important, we\nconduct our analysis in terms of average real wage.\nIn the appendix, Table A.1 provides definitions and Table A.2 gives summary statistics for the\nvariables we use in this paper. Because of the high level of economic growth in China, the variables\nare trending for all the provinces; thus, for measures of inequality, we express the majority of our\nvariables in terms of percentage deviation from the country average. In doing so, we obtain unit-\nfree, common trend-free, comparable variables for all the provinces. The variables that are not\nexpressed in percentage deviation are CPI, berth capacity, inter-provincial migration, and rural-to-\nurban intraprovincial migration.\nIn 1997, the city of Chongqing in Sichuan province was raised to the status of provincial city,\nresulting in creation of a new province and also affecting all the population-based statistics for\nthe Sichuan province. Moreover, since Chongqing was the largest and wealthiest part of Sichuan,\naverage income in the Sichuan province was also affected through a composition change. We take\ntwoapproachestodealingwithChongqing: weeitherdropSichuanandChongqingfromoursample,\nor we construct weighted averages of variables for Chongqing and Sichuan after 1997. Measures of\ninequality are weighted by population except for CPI, which is weighted by GDP. In the rest of the\npaper, we present the results which treat Chongqing and Sichuan as a combined province, but our\nresults do not change if we exclude both of them.\nWe omit the provinces of Hubei and Tibet from our data sample. We omit Hubei because of the\nvast relocation of residents there for construction of the Three Gorges dam beginning in December\n7\n\n1994. We do not include Tibet because of a lack of a CPI index that extends back to 1993. Thus,\nwe cannot construct real measures of key variables that are used in our analysis. With the omission\nof Hubei and Tibet, and the combination of Chongqing and Sichuan into a single province, we have\na data set with a total of 28 provinces.\n3.2 Migration data\nWe use migration data that is collected by the National Bureau of Statistics of China and compiled\nby China Data Online. The data we use come from the 2000 population census, which measures\nmigration between November 1, 1995 and November 1, 2000. To our advantage, the data provide\ninformationnotonlyontheprovinceoforiginanddestination,butalsotheareawithineachprovince\nthat the migrant came from and went to. This is especially useful to track patterns of migration\nsuch as the movement of people from rural to urban areas—both intra- and interprovincially.6\nIn the census, individuals five years of age or older were asked if, on November 1, 2000, they\nresided in a different subcounty-level unit than that in which they lived on November 1, 1995. If an\nindividual moved his hukou to the new location or he resided in the new location for more than six\nmonths, he was counted as a migrant. While the migration data includes in-migration to Chinese\nprovinces from Hong Kong, Macau, and abroad, we exclude these numbers from our analysis.\n3.3 Patterns in interprovince migration\nWe now describe trends in the migration patterns in China. We focus on the migration that took\nplace between 1995 and 2000, using information from the 2000 population census. Overall, there\nwere 124.6 million migrants, approximately 9.9 percent of the total Chinese population in 2000. Of\nthese, 91.8 million were intraprovincial migrants.\nIn our data, we have emigration (out-migration) from each province broken down into rural\nand urban migrants. The urban migrants are those coming from the subcounty-level units of\nneighborhood committee of the town and street. The rural migrants are the migrating population\nfrom townships and village committees of the town. With respect to immigration (in-migration),\n6See Fan (2005) and Lavely (2001) for a detailed discussion of 2000 migration data.\n8\n\nwe are able to classify migrants as entering a town, city, or county. We broadly define city and\ntown as an urban region and county as a rural region.7 Given the structure of the data, we are\nable to observe various patterns in migration patterns.\nA large part of migration took place within provinces, with population moving from rural to\nurban areas. Of the intra-province migrating population, 35 percent moved from rural to urban\nareas during this time period.8 Inter–province migration was also important, with 76 percent of all\ninter–provincial migrants going into urban areas and almost none going to rural areas.\nTable A.3. reports migration for all provinces between 1995 and 2000, both cross-province and\nrural-to-urban migration within the province, in levels and as a percent of host province population\nin 1997. Not surprisingly, the provincial cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin attracted the\nmost cross-province migrants as a share of their population. We also note that coastal provinces\ntendedtoattractmorecross-provincemigrantsasashareoftheirpopulationthaninlandprovinces.\nTrends in intraprovincial migration are more difficult to identify. The variance in rural-to-urban\nintraprovince migration across provinces is much smaller than that of the cross-province migration.\n4 What explains persistent interprovince inequality in China?\nIn this section, we address two sets of explanations for persistent interprovince inequality discussed\nin the introduction. We begin by studying offsetting factors such as the quality of labor, industry\ncomposition, government transfers, and geographical factors. We then turn to the analysis of cross-\nprovince migration patterns and test whether interprovince migration is driven, at least in part, by\nwage differences and whether this migration, in turn, helps offset some of these differences.\n4.1 Offsetting factors\nIn this section, we look for reasons inequality may be persistent. We refer to them as “offsetting\nfactors,” although some of them in fact reflect imperfect measurement of remuneration for human\n7Chan and Hu (2003) include an appendix of major points in defining urban population for the 2000 census. In\nthis appendix they state that the urban population of China consists of city and town population.\n8Someofthesenumbersdonotreflectactualmovingofthepopulationbuttheannexofruralareasbycities. For\nstatistical purposes, however, this is identical to actual migration.\n9\n\ncapital. We begin with one such measure, education level. Since we do not have a direct measure\nof labor quality, we use two different measures of education levels in the province to proxy for the\nquality of labor. If observed differences in wages are fully explained by differences in labor quality,\nthere is no reason to believe that such differences should go away. We then consider industry\ncompositionintheprovinces. Becauselaborproductivitymaybehigherinsomeindustries,industry\ncomposition will affect the average wage in the province. While we would expect labor to move\nto the industries that are more productive, structural changes in the economy take a long time to\ncomplete and thus inequality that is caused by industry composition is expected to be persistent.\nFinally, we test whether some of the wage differentials across provinces are offset by transfers from\nthe central government.\nResults are reported in Table 1.9 The first two columns present our results with respect to\nmeasures of education level in each province. Column (1) uses as a proxy the number of college\ngraduates per capita, while column (2) uses government expenditures on education (in real terms)\nper capita. We can see that both measures indicate that, indeed, higher levels of education are\nassociated with higher average real wages. We can also see that the first measure explains 16.4\npercent of standard deviation in real wages across provinces in 2006, while the second measure\nexplains54.4percent,10 althoughtherecouldbesomespuriouscorrelationinthecaseofgovernment\nexpenses on education — provinces that are wealthy for whatever reason are likely to have higher\nwagesandmoreexpendituresoneducation. Forthisreason,andbecauseofsamplelimitationinthe\ncase of the second measure, we use the first measure as a control variable in the tests that follow.\nMoreover, the first measure seems to be more relevant, because it measures the contemporaneous\nlevel of college education in the province.\nColumns (3) through (6) of Table 1 use different measures of industrial composition — em-\nployment shares of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, which correspond, respectively to\nmining and agriculture, manufacturing, and services. We find that all these measures explain some\nof the difference in real wages across provinces, with higher share of primary industry associated\n9Because our right-hand side variables are highly correlated, we include them one at a time. See Table A.4. in\nthe appendix for the correlation matrix.\n10Note the sample difference between the two columns. They are due to the fact that education expenditure data\nare only available starting in 1999.\n10\n\nwith lower average wage, while shares of secondary and tertiary industries (included one by one or\ntogether), are associated with higher average wage. Share of primary industries explains 53.5% of\nstandard deviation in average real wage across provinces in 2006. We find these results intuitive,\nas manufacturing, and especially services, tend to employ more skilled labor and therefore have\nhigher wages.\nColumn (7) shows the effect of the share of agricultural population in a province on its average\nwage. We find that real wage is lower in provinces with higher share of agricultural population.\nThis effect reflects two factors — first is simply the fact that share of agricultural population is\nhighly correlated with the share of primary industry; second is that in provinces with higher share\nof agricultural population there is more unskilled labor available and therefore there is likely to be\ndownward pressure on unskilled wages and therefore on average wages.11 This variable explains\n35.4% of standard deviation in real wages across provinces.\nIn column (8) we include the berth capacity of the ports in the province, to proxy for access to\nexport markets.12 Export industries tend to be more advanced technologically and are therefore\nlikely to pay higher wages. We find that, indeed, higher berth capacity is associated with higher\naverage real wage and explains 22.8% of standard deviation in average real wage across provinces\nin 2006.\nFinally,column(9)ofTable1usestheleveloftransfersfromthecentralgovernmenttoprovinces,\nper capita, to test whether some of the wage differences are offset by government transfers across\nprovinces. We find that, contrary to our expectations, the larger transfers go to the states with\nhigher average real wages. Thus, government transfers, at least in the way we measure them, are\nnot an offsetting factor during our sample period.\n11Indeed, as we can see from tables A.5 and A.6 in the Appendix, higher share of agricultural population is\nassociated with larger rural-to-urban migration.\n12Ourpreliminarytestsdemonstratedthatitisaccesstoportratherthansimplybeingonthecoastthatmakesa\ndifference (Candelaria, Daly, and Hale, 2009).\n11\n\n4.2 Labor mobility\nBefore addressing the question of whether cross-province migration offsets some of the wage dif-\nferences, we have to establish that cross-province migration is driven at least in part by wage\ndifferences. To this end, we test whether cross-province migration into urban areas between 1995\nand 2000 is correlated with differences in real wages across provinces in 1995 (Table 2) and, al-\nternatively, with differences in real wages in 1990 and differences in the growth rate of real wages\nbetween 1990 and 1995 (Table 3). In such a setup, migration does not affect wage differences.13 We\nfind that both the level and the growth rate of real wages have positive effects on migration into\nurban areas of a given province from other provinces.14 These results hold even when we control\nfor the offsetting factors that we found to be important in the first part of our analysis.\nCoefficients on offsetting factors have expected signs — higher education and larger share of\ntertiaryindustriesattractmoremigrants, whileahighershareofagriculturalpopulationandhigher\nshare of primary industries lower the inflow of migrants. Interestingly, the share of secondary\nindustries, while associated with higher wages (see Table 1), has a negative effect on migration,\nwhile tertiary industries seem to attract migrants. Berth capacity does not enter significantly in\nthese regressions.\nHaving established that migration is indeed driven by wage differences, we now turn to the main\nquestion of interest — Does migration offset any of the wage differences? To this end, we estimate\nthe effect of cross-province migration into urban areas between 1995 and 2000 on real wages in\n2001, while controlling for our offsetting factors in 2001. The results are reported in Table 4.15\nIn column (1) we see that, far from offsetting wage differences, higher migration is associated\nwith higher real wages. This effect is spurious, however. Because real wage differences across\nprovinces are highly persistent over time, migration in 1995-2000 may be endogenous even with\nrespect to 2001 real wages. To rule out this possibility, in column (2) we add the real wage in 1995\nas an additional control variable. Once this control is included, migration no longer has a positive\n13An important caveat is that, because of the cross-section nature of the migration data, we are down to 28\nobservations and a cross-province regression.\n14For comparison, Tables A.5 and A.6 provide the same analysis for rural-to-urban migration within provinces.\n15For comparison, results of similar tests for rural-to-urban migration within provinces are reported in Table A.7.\n12\n\neffect on real wages. In fact, we find a negative effect in some specifications, which would indicate\nthat there is some equalizing effect of migration, although this negative effect is never statistically\nsignificant and the reduction in the variance of the residual is minimal to nil (comparing column\n(2) with column (11)). We conclude, therefore, that the cross-province migration that occurred\nbetween 1995 and 2000 did not produce any equalizing effects.\n5 Conclusion\nProvincial statistics show that regional inequality in China has been persistent and even growing\nin the past two decades. We find that the main sources of this growth were structural and long-\nterm factors such as labor quality, industrial composition, and geographical location. We find\nthat interprovincial transfers did not offset wage inequality during our sample period, nor did\ninterprovince migration. These findings suggest that regional income inequality in China is not\nlikely to go away in the near future.\nWhile we believe that fully removing barriers to labor mobility will help reduce cross-province\nwage inequality, we are aware that urban infrastructure is unable to accommodate large inflows of\nnew migrants. We therefore view the message of this paper as more positive than normative —\ngiven the gradual nature of structural changes and urban infrastructure development, we should\nexpect regional inequality in China to persist for quite some time.\nA policy implication of this observation is that social tensions that arise from such inequality\nmay need to be addressed in the short run through redistribution. According to our analysis of the\nmeasures we considered, such redistribution has not been present during our sample period . The\nChinese government, however, recognizes inequality as an important problem, which is reflected in\nits most recent five–year plan.\n13\n\nReferences\nBound, J., and H. J.
