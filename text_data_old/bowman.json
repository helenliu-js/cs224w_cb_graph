    "text": "Discussions of artificial intelligence (AI) inevitably center on two main points: risks and\nbenefits.1\n Both of these can be frustratingly vague and amorphous. Proponents of AI project its\nwidespread adoption will be as momentous as the industrial age—radically improving efficiency,\nincreasing labor productivity, and changing the world economy. Skeptics largely focus on the\nrisks, noting that it may introduce new and unpredictable variables into the economy and the\nfinancial system, including new forms of cyber-risk and fraud.\nIt would be impossible to predict what the future holds for AI, or how its use and impact\nwill evolve over time. But as the technology continues to mature, as new use cases evolve, and it\nis rolled out more broadly, we will almost certainly be surprised by how it is ultimately used.\nLooking at the financial industry-specific implications of AI, it is helpful to consider not\nonly how it may change the financial system, but also how regulatory frameworks should\nrespond to this emerging technology. Are the existing frameworks sufficient? If not, how can\nregulators best balance the risks AI may pose to bank safety and soundness and financial stability\nwith the need to allow for continued innovation?\nBroader availability of generative AI and large language models have created headlines\nand spiking stock prices, but the financial services sector has been using AI for some time.2\nOver time, it has become clear that AI’s impact could be far-reaching, particularly as the\ntechnology becomes more efficient, new sources of data become available, and as AI technology\nbecomes more affordable.\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2\n In 2017, the Financial Stability Board was already considering the financial stability implications of AI and\nmachine learning in financial services. See Financial Stability Board, “Artificial intelligence and machine learning\nin financial services: Market developments and financial stability implications” (Basel: Financial Stability Board,\nNovember 2017), https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P011117.pdf.\n- 2 -\nDo We Need a Definition of AI?\nBefore discussing the implications of AI and regulatory policy approaches, we should ask\nwhether we need a definition of AI. As it has advanced, the number and variety of definitions\nused to define AI have expanded.3\n Some definitions focus on the algorithms—like the use of\nmachines to learn and reason in a way that simulates human intelligence. Others focus on the\noutputs—the ability to perform complex tasks normally done by humans. In 2021, an\ninteragency request for information from federal banking regulators, including the Federal\nReserve, sought comment on banks’ use of AI, but notably avoided using any single definition.\nInstead, this request listed a few possible use cases, features, and forms. These included the use\nof structured and unstructured data; the use of alternative data sources; voice recognition and\nnatural language processing; the algorithmic identification of patterns and correlations in training\ndata to generate predictions or categorizations; and “dynamic updating,” where an algorithm has\nthe capacity to update without human intervention.4\n\nWhile each definition of AI may serve its own purpose in the context of how it is used,\nany single narrow definition can be criticized. A more generic definition runs the risk of\noversimplifying the range of activities, use cases, and underlying technology. A definition that\ncaptures the variability of AI technology in a more granular way runs the risk of being unwieldy\nin its length, and obsolete in the short-term as new forms and use cases emerge.\n3 The National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020, 15 U.S.C. § 9401(3) defines artificial intelligence as\n“… a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions,\nrecommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine\nand human-based inputs to-(A) perceive real and virtual environments; (B) abstract such perceptions into models\nthrough analysis in an automated manner; and (C) use model inference to formulate options for information or\naction.”\n4\n See Request for Information and Comment on Financial Institutions’ Use of Artificial Intelligence, Including\nMachine Learning, 86 Fed. Reg. 16837 (March 31, 2021), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-03-\n31/pdf/2021-06607.pdf.\n- 3 -\nWithin this definitional question—of whether and how you define AI—lies a more\nimportant policy question: Specifically, for what purpose is a definition required? In the context\nof the financial system, the definition of AI may help to delineate how the regulatory system\naddresses it and establishes the parameters for how it can be used by regulated institutions.\nOther specific contexts could also be included, like third-party service providers that support\nbanks or other financial services providers, or use by regulators in support of their mandates.\nA definition helps regulators and regulated institutions understand the activities that are\nsubject to rules and requirements by defining the scope. While this definitional question is\nimportant to establish clarity about the scope of what constitutes AI, it can also distract us from a\nmore important point—what is the appropriate policy framework to address the introduction and\nongoing use of AI in the financial system?\nI have no strong feelings about the ideal or optimal definition of AI, and some version of\nthe many definitions floating around are probably adequate for our purposes. At a minimum\nthough, a definition must establish clear parameters about what types of activities and tools are\ncovered. But before leaving the topic, I want to offer a cautionary note. A broad definition of AI\narguably captures a wider range of activity and has a longer “lifespan” before it becomes\noutmoded, and potentially never becomes outdated. But a broad definition also carries the risk\nof a broad—and undifferentiated—policy response. This vast variability in AI’s uses defies a\nsimple, granular definition, but also suggests that we cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach as\nwe consider the future role of AI in the financial system.\n- 4 -\nInnovation and Competitiveness\nKnowing that the technology and use of AI continues to evolve leads to the question of\nhow it should be viewed by regulators, particularly in light of the need for innovation and the\neffect on competition.\nInnovation\nAI tools have the potential to substantially enhance the financial industry. In my view,\nthe regulatory system should promote these improvements in a way that is consistent with\napplicable law and appropriate banking practices.\nOne of the most common current use cases is in reviewing and summarizing unstructured\ndata. This can include enlisting AI to summarize a single report or to aggregate information\nfrom different sources on the same or related topics. The AI “output” in these cases may not\ndirectly produce any real-world action, but it provides information in a more usable way to assist\na human. AI use cases like this may present opportunities to improve operational efficiency,\nwithout introducing substantial new risk into business processes. In some ways, the joining of\nAI outputs with a human acting as a “filter” or “reality check” can capture efficiency gains and\ncontrol for some AI risks. Similarly, AI can act as a “filter” or “reality check” on analysis\nproduced by humans, checking for potential errors or biases.\nAI tools may also be leveraged to fight fraud. One such use is in combatting check fraud,\nwhich has become more prevalent in the banking industry over the last several years. In a recent\nreport, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network noted that from February to August of 2023,\nthere were over 15,000 reports received related to check fraud, associated with more than $688\n- 5 -\nmillion in transactions (including both actual and attempted fraud).5\n The growth in check fraud\nover the past several years has caused significant harm not only to banks and the perceived safety\nof the banking system but also to consumers who are the victims of fraudulent activity. The\nregulatory response to help address this growing problem has unfortunately been slow, lacking in\ncoordination, and generally ineffective.\nCould AI tools offer a more effective way for banks to fight against this growing fraud\ntrend? We already have some evidence that AI tools are powerful in fighting fraud. The U.S.\nTreasury Department recently announced that fraud detection tools, including machine learning\nAI, had resulted in fraud prevention and recovery totaling over $4 billion in fiscal year 2024,\nincluding $1 billion in recovery related to identification of Treasury check fraud.6\n While the\nnature of the fraud may be different in these cases, we should recognize that AI can be a strong\nanti-fraud tool and provide significant benefits for affected bank customers.\nIf our regulatory environment is not receptive to the use of AI in these circumstances\ncustomers are the ones who suffer. AI will not completely “solve” the problem of fraud—\nparticularly as fraudsters develop more sophisticated ways to exploit this technology. But it\ncould be important if the regulatory framework provides reasonable parameters for its use.\nAnother often-discussed use case for AI in financial services is in expanding the\navailability of credit. AI is not the first technology with potential to expand access to credit for\nthe “un-” or “underbanked.” We have long viewed alternative data as a potential opportunity for\n5\n Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Financial Trend Analysis: Mail Theft-Related Check Fraud: Threat\nPattern & Trend Information, February to August 2023 (Vienna: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,\nSeptember 2024), https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FTA-Check-Fraud-FINAL508.pdf.\n6\n See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Treasury Announces Enhanced Fraud Detection Processes, Including\nMachine Learning AI, Prevented and Recovered Over $4 Billion in Fiscal Year 2024,” news release, October 17,\n2024, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2650.\n- 6 -\nsome consumers, like those with poor or no credit history but with sufficient cash flow to support\nloan repayment.7\nAI could be used to further expand this access, as financial entities mine more data sets\nand refine their understanding of creditworthiness. Of course, we also know that using AI in this\ncontext—in a way that has more direct impact on credit decisions affecting individual\ncustomers—also presents more substantial legal compliance challenges than other AI use cases.\nAI also has promise to improve public sector operations, including in regulatory agencies.\nAs I have often noted, the data relied on to inform the Federal Open Market Committee decisionmaking process often is subject to revisions after-the-fact, requiring caution when relying on the\ndata to inform monetary policy.8\n Perhaps the broader use of AI could act as a check on data\nreliability, particularly for uncertain or frequently revised economic data, improving the quality\nof the data that monetary policymakers rely on for decision-making. Additional data as a\nreliability check or expanded data resources informed by AI could improve the FOMC’s\nmonetary policymaking by validating and improving the data on which policymakers rely.\nWhile these use cases present only a subset of the possibilities for the financial system,\nthey illustrate the breadth of potential benefits and risks of adopting an overly cautious approach\nthat chills innovation in the banking system. Over-regulation of AI can itself present risks by\n7\n See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n“Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” news release, December 12, 2019,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/CA%2019-\n11%20Letter%20Attachement%20Interagency%20Statement%20on%20the%20Use%20of%20Alternative%20Data\n%20in%20Credit%20Underwriting.pdf\n8\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “Perspectives on U.S. Monetary Policy and Bank Capital Reform,” (speech at Policy\nExchange, London, England, June 25, 2024)\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240625a.pdf.\n- 7 -\npreventing the realization of benefits of improved efficiency, lower operational costs, and better\nfraud prevention and customer service.\nEffect on Competition\nThe regulatory approach and framework can also promote competition in the\ndevelopment and use of AI tools in the financial system.\nAn overly conservative regulatory approach can skew the competitive landscape by\npushing activities outside of the regulated banking system or preventing the use of AI altogether.\nInertia often causes regulators to reflexively prefer known practices and existing technology over\nprocess change and innovation. The banking sector often suffers from this regulatory\nskepticism, which can ultimately harm the competitiveness of the U.S. banking sector.\nIn the United States, we often think about the financial system based on the regulatory\n“perimeter.” We view institutions within the scope of federal banking regulation (banks and\ntheir affiliates) as being “in the perimeter,” while entities that operate under other regulatory\nframeworks (including money transmitters licensed under state law) are “outside the perimeter.”\nOf course, the global financial system includes institutions that operate on a cross-border basis,\nand tools and approaches often permeate throughout the financial system once they have been\ndeployed successfully in some other part of the system. But we know that the regulatory\nperimeter is permeable, and there is always the risk that activity pushed outside the perimeter can\ntransmit risk back into the system even as the activities garner less scrutiny and regulation than\nbanks. Put differently, the overly conservative approach may present only a façade of safety,\nmasking underlying risks to the financial system and those who rely on it.\nOf course, there are risks to being overly permissive in the AI regulatory approach. As\nwith any rapidly evolving technology, supervision of its use should be nimble. Its users must\n- 8 -\nmake sufficient risk-management and compliance investments to conduct activities in a safe and\nsound manner, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. While the banking\nsystem has generally been cautious and deliberate in its AI development and rollout, others have\nnot. When left improperly managed and unmonitored, it can result in unintended outcomes and\ncustomer harm. For example, certain generative AI models have been known to generate\nnonsensical or inaccurate outputs, sometimes called “hallucinations.” In some cases, AI\nhallucinations have not involved significant harm, for example when discovered in a testing\nenvironment without customer-facing implications.\nThe Sufficiency of Existing Regulatory Tools\nWhile helpful to acknowledge the risks of over-regulation and under-regulation, we must\nunderstand our currently regulatory stance—what tools do we have to promote AI’s benefits\nwhile helping to mitigate the risks? To address this topic, we should widen the lens to consider\nour approach to innovation broadly. Supporting innovation in the financial system can and\nshould apply to the introduction and use of AI.9\n\nWhen we consider AI risks, many of these are already well-covered by existing\nframeworks. For example, AI often depends on external parties—cloud computing providers,\nlicensed generative AI technologies, and core service providers—to operate. AI can also pose\nmodel risks in the banking context, with associated data management and governance concerns.\nAI can also impact a bank’s cyber-resiliency as AI-related fraud tools become more widespread\nand more anti-fraud tools become available.\n9\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “Innovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape” (speech at The Digital Chamber\nDC Blockchain Summit 2024, Washington, D.C., May 15, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240515a.pdf.\n- 9 -\nWhile AI may be on the frontier of technology, it does not operate outside the existing\nlegal and regulatory framework. AI is not exempt from current legal and regulatory\nrequirements, nor is its use exempt from scrutiny. This is particularly true with AI; its use must\ncomply with current laws and regulations, including fair lending, cyber security, data privacy,\nthird-party risk management, and copyright. And when AI is deployed in a bank, an even\nbroader set of requirements may apply depending on the use case.\nRegulators are often playing “catch-up” with banks at the forefront of innovation. As a\nresult, they often suffer from significant disadvantages in terms of understanding how the\ntechnology works, understanding the uses of AI within financial institutions, and keeping up-todate with the latest AI developments. Of course, further compounding this challenge is that\nmuch of the work in AI innovation occurs far outside the banking system, including in the\ndevelopment and testing of generative AI models and in compiling the data sources on which to\ntrain the models.\nDespite these challenges—and the understandable regulatory instinct to limit its use in\nthe financial system—we must avoid this temptation. A few general principles should govern a\ncoherent regulatory approach, which are the same principles that I apply to innovation\ngenerally.10\nFirst, we must understand AI before we consider whether and how to change our\nregulatory approach. With respect to various internal use cases, the Board has published a\ncompliance program that governs artificial intelligence.11 One of the foundational elements for a\n10 See Bowman, “Innovation and the Evolving Financial Landscape.”\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Compliance Plan for OMB Memorandum M-24-10\n(Washington: Board of Governors, September 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/complianceplan-for-omb-memorandum-m-24-10-202409.pdf.\n- 10 -\nsuccessful approach to AI, and one mentioned in this plan, is the development and acquisition of\nstaff expertise.\nMany banks have increased AI adoption to an expanding number of use cases. As this\ntechnology becomes more widely adopted throughout the financial system, it is critical that we\nhave a coherent and rational policy approach. That starts with our ability to understand the\ntechnology, including both the algorithms underlying its use and the possible implications—both\ngood and bad—for banks and their customers.\nIn suggesting that we grow our understanding and staff expertise as a baseline, I\nacknowledge that this has been, and is likely to remain, a challenge. The Federal Reserve and\nother banking regulators compete for the same limited pool of talent as private industry. But we\nmust prioritize improving our understanding and capacity as this technology continues to become\nmore widely adopted.\nSecond, we must have an openness to the adoption of AI. We need to have a receptivity\nto the use of this technology and know that successful adoption requires communication and\ntransparency between regulated firms and regulators. One approach regulators can use to\nreframe questions around AI (and innovation generally) is to adopt a posture that I think of as\ntechnology agnosticism.\nWe should avoid fixating on the technology, and instead focus on the risks presented by\ndifferent use cases. These risks may be influenced by a number of factors, including the scope\nand consequences of the use case, the underlying data relied on, and the capability of a firm to\nappropriately manage these risks. Putting activities together may be a helpful way to get a sense\nof broad trends (for example, the speed of AI adoption in the industry), but is inefficient as a way\nto address regulatory concerns (like safety and soundness, and financial stability). This may\n- 11 -\nseem like an obvious point, but at times regulators have fallen prey to overbroad categorizations,\ntreating a diverse set of activities as uniformly and equally risky.\nThis approach allows us to be risk-focused, much like we try to do with other forms of\nsupervision, moderating intensity for low-risk activities, and increasing the intensity for higherrisk ones.\nOf course, regulatory agencies do not operate in a vacuum, so we must also ask what type\nof coordination we need to ensure that we promote safe and sound adoption of AI, and address\nbroader financial stability risks, both domestically and internationally. As a threshold matter, we\nneed coordination both within each agency and among domestic regulators that play a role in the\nsupervision and regulation of the financial system, which requires an environment of open\nsharing of information.\nA posture of openness to AI requires caution when adding to the body of regulation.\nSpecifically, I think we need a gap analysis to determine if there are regulatory gaps or blind\nspots that could require additional regulation and whether the current framework is fit for\npurpose. Fundamentally though, the variability in the technology will almost certainly require a\ndegree of flexibility in regulatory approach.\nClosing Thoughts\nBefore closing, I want to thank the organizers of this event for the invitation to address\nyou this evening, and to thank the many speakers and participants who have contributed to the\nsymposium.\nArtificial intelligence has tremendous potential to reshape the financial services industry\nand the broader world economy. While I have suggested in my remarks that we need not rush to\nregulate, it is important that we continue to monitor developments in AI and their real-world\n- 12 -\neffects. In the long run, AI has the potential to impact many aspects of the Fed’s work, from our\nrole in supervising the payment system, to the important work we do promoting the safe and\nsound operation of banks and financial stability. AI may also play a growing role in monetary\npolicy discussions, as the introduction of AI tools alter labor markets, affecting productivity and\npotentially the natural rate of unemployment and the natural rate of interest.\nBut as we engage in ongoing monitoring—and expand our understanding of AI\ntechnology and how it fits within the bank regulatory framework—I think it is important to\npreserve the ability of banks to innovate and allow the banking system to realize the benefits of\nthis new technology."

    "text": "I would like to thank the Aspen Institute for inviting me to join you at this event to\ndiscuss efforts to develop a more inclusive financial system.1\n It is really a pleasure to join so\nmany stakeholders that are at the forefront of this important work. As I have often said, one of\nour important responsibilities is to foster an economy that works for everyone.2\n Consumers are\nbetter positioned to benefit from economic growth when they have access to financial products\nand services that responsibly meet their needs.\nMy perspective on financial inclusion is informed, in no small part, from my own\nexperience as a banker. Small banks, especially community banks, have a deep understanding of\nthe local economies they serve, and can respond quickly and effectively to local needs. Indeed,\nfinancial inclusion is a core mission of community banks; but no entity or group of financial\ninstitutions alone can solve the challenge of creating a more inclusive financial system. Today, I\nwill discuss my views on why financial inclusion is important to all of us—from community\nbanks to central banks. I will then highlight activities in which the Federal Reserve participates\nto promote financial inclusion and conclude with ideas for future work and collaboration.\nWhy Financial Inclusion Is Important\nAn inclusive financial system offers access and choices that enhance consumers’ and\nbusinesses’ financial well-being. From checking and savings accounts to credit and insurance,\nconsumers benefit from having financial products and services that are affordable, safe, and\nresponsive to their needs. Without them, consumers may turn to alternative financial services,\nwhich can often be more costly or may lead to consumer harm.\n1 Thank you to Jennifer Fernandez, Alejandra Lopez-Fernandini, Daniel Gorin, and Kirsten Noland of the Federal\nReserve Board for their assistance in preparing this text. These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the Federal Reserve Board.\n2 Michelle W. Bowman, panel remarks at the 2023 Symposium on Indigenous Inclusion, The Central Bank Network\nfor Indigenous Inclusion and The Reserve Bank of New Zealand—Te Pūtea Matua, Auckland, New Zealand\n(September 27, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20230927a.htm.\n- 2 -\nAn inclusive financial system recognizes that consumers come from a wide range of\neconomic circumstances; have varied perceptions of and experiences with the banking system;\nand most importantly, different needs for financial products and services. And despite the\ngeneral availability of online financial services, geography, location, and accessibility matter.\nFinancial inclusion may look very different, for instance, in rural communities, compared to the\nsuburbs of Washington, D.C., or the islands of Hawaii. The entire economy gains when more\nhouseholds achieve financial stability. That said, the benefits of financial inclusion do not\nnecessarily result in the same outcomes for everyone.\nFederal Reserve Activities and Promising Developments\nThe road to fostering a more inclusive financial system is long and winding and may, at\ntimes, seem daunting. We have been on this road for some time, and the Federal Reserve and\nmany others have already taken many promising steps. So, I’d like to share a few examples of\nthe Fed’s recent efforts to promote financial inclusion that will help to provide some context to\nour ongoing efforts.\nSupporting access to responsive products: small-dollar lending\nFor many years, a variety of surveys have indicated that consumers use small-dollar\ncredit to address temporary cash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income shortfalls\nduring periods of economic stress or natural disasters. So, we began to consider the ways in\nwhich the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators could be helpful. Shortly after I joined\nthe Federal Reserve, in 2019 and through 2020, we issued two interagency statements meant to\nprovide clarity to banks on the use of alternative data for underwriting and on principles for\noffering responsible small-dollar loans.3\n Our guidance clarified that with a consumer’s\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,\n- 3 -\npermission, banks can use alternative data, like checking account balance activity, to qualify\nthem for credit. Our guidance also underscored that small-dollar lending products that support\nsuccessful repayment outcomes and that avoid continuous cycles of debt due to rollover and\nreborrowing can help facilitate financial inclusion. We have seen some evidence that suggests\nthe release of these small-dollar Interagency Lending Principles correlated with a subsequent\nincrease in bank consumer lending.4\n Ensuring that small-dollar lending is available through\ndepository institutions rather than through other non-depository lenders could increase the credit\nopportunities available to consumers at lower cost and with fewer fees.\nBanks may also pursue expanding their lending opportunities through technology\ninnovations that provide mechanisms for more effective risk modelling or enhancing their online\naccess to financial services for consumers. These advancements can result in faster loan\ndecisionmaking, more convenient customer access, and reduced costs and risks for both banks\nand borrowers. Over time, we are seeing more banks incorporating these approaches to better\nserve clients with credit, including the use of alternative data to support underwriting. We will\ncontinue to monitor these promising developments to better understand the impact on consumers.\nSupporting mission-driven organizations\nI will turn now to the Fed’s efforts to build the institutional capacity of a set of key\nstakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Women-Owned Depository Institutions\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, “Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” CA letter 19-11\n(December 12, 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm; Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar\nLoans,” SR letter 20-14 / CA letter 20-8 (May 20, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2014.htm. 4 Daniel Gorin, Sarah Gosky, and Michael Suher, “Empirical Assessment of SR/CA Small-Dollar Lending Letter\nImpact,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 28, 2023),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3329.\n- 4 -\n(WDIs), and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), whose missions are to\nreach historically underserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an\nimportant part of the Federal Reserve’s mission to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking\nsystem that protects consumers.5\n Through the Fed’s Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, we provide technical\nassistance on regulatory matters, conduct research, host convenings, and provide examiner\ntraining to support and promote the stability of MDIs and WDIs.6\n Research suggests that MDIs\nare more likely to focus their products and services to benefit diverse communities and to work\nwith more consumers who experience credit constraints in comparison with non-MDIs.7\n The\nextent of their reach was evident during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwhen they demonstrated effective contributions to the economic resiliency of their\ncommunities.8\n During the pandemic, MDIs and CDFIs provided Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP) loans to small businesses and financially underserved firms.9\n The Fed supported these\nimportant financial service providers by providing liquidity through its emergency lending\nprogram, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.10\nThe Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) provided additional support to MDIs\nand CDFIs. Through the ECIP, MDIs and CDFIs received over $8.5 billion in low-cost capital\n5 See the Federal Reserve’s Partnership for Progress website at https://www.fedpartnership.gov. 6 Section 308 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 describes goals for the\npreservation of MDIs though the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve. 7 Maude Toussaint-Comeau and Robin Newberger, “Minority-Owned Banks and Their Primary Local Market\nAreas,” Economic Perspectives, 41, 4 (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, May 2017),\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economic-perspectives/2017/4. 8 Allen N.

The Federal Reserve conducted collective webinars and individualized outreach to\nMDIs to encourage enrollment in the program. Our early internal analysis shows, on average,\nthat eligible banks are using ECIP to strengthen balance sheets, build internal capacity, and\nenhance product offerings. As a result, we have seen ECIP recipients increase their lending\nabout a year after receiving funds, relative to MDIs and CDFIs that did not receive ECIP\nfunding.\nSupporting Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion\nThis brings me to another aspect of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to support financial\ninclusion. The Fed recently became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous\nInclusion (CBNII). This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Australia with the purpose of understanding and researching related economic\nand financial issues, knowledge sharing, and financial education targeted to these communities.11\nAs the Federal Reserve’s network representative, I recently participated in the CBNII’s biennial\nsymposium focused on the importance of Indigenous financial inclusion.12 My remarks there\nreiterated the view that a financial system must be inclusive for the economy to work for\neveryone and must include access for Indigenous communities.\nOur work with Indigenous groups includes all U.S. native populations, Native Hawaiian,\nNative Alaskan, and Native American Indians. The Fed’s CBNII work is supported by many of\nour Reserve Bank teams, including the San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for\nIndian Country Development (CICD), and the St. Louis Native Economic and Financial\n11 The Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and St. Louis support our participation in the\nCBNII based on their work with Native communities in their Districts and throughout the country. 12 Michelle W.

Together, these teams and programs work with\nIndigenous organizations and tribal nations to provide access to economic and personal finance\neducation incorporating Indigenous language and culture.\nSupporting research informing financial inclusion\nAs a final example, I’ll highlight some of the Fed’s financial inclusion data and research.\nTwo of our most important contributions to the study of financial well-being and consumer\nwealth are the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) and the\ntriennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).13 Responses to these surveys are publicly\navailable and are extensively cited by other practitioners and researchers.\nResearchers and practitioners also rely upon the St. Louis Reserve Bank’s Bank On\nNational Data (BOND) Hub, which was created in partnership with Cities for Financial\nEmpowerment’s Bank On program.14 Through voluntary and aggregated data reporting, this\nresource enables the public to track the growth and usage of Bank On accounts in communities\nacross the country. We encourage the public’s continued engagement with and analysis of these\nimportant data.\nLooking Ahead\nToday, I’ve spoken about the Fed’s work in the areas of small-dollar credit, missiondriven organizations and networks, and data. Before I close, I would like to raise several issues\non my mind that might prompt discussion in your event today.\n13 See the Federal Reserve Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm. 14 The Bank On program promotes a national standard for bank accounts that are both low cost and low risk for\ncustomers. See https://www.stlouisfed.org/community-development/bank-on-national-data-hub and\nhttps://cfefund.org/project/bank-on/.\n- 7 -\nFirst, building on some progress in small-dollar credit, how can we encourage the\ndevelopment of lower-cost products and refine our understanding of the degree to which these\nproducts may foster consumers’ financial well-being?\nSecond, given the value of mission-driven organizations in expanding access to financial\nproducts and services in underserved communities, how can we best provide support to the\nactivities of MDIs, WDIs, and CDFIs?\nThird, the CBNII relies on the participation and wisdom of Indigenous leaders and\ncommunity members to advance financial inclusion. How can we leverage this model of\nengagement and shared learning?\nFinancial inclusion is not a one-size-fits-all issue. Involving consumers and communities\nin identifying issues and crafting approaches for solutions is critical to success. Advancing\nfinancial inclusion will clearly take many hands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including\neveryone participating here today.\nClosing\nIn closing, greater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the\nFederal Reserve, and we will continue to engage on these important issues in the years to come.\nProgress requires collaboration, and I look forward to engaging with all of you as we continue on\nthe journey to make our financial system more inclusive."

    "text": "Good afternoon and welcome back to the second half of today’s conference on Financial\nInclusion Practices and Innovations.1\nIt is really a pleasure to join you to discuss this important\ntopic. This morning, our panelists provided their perspectives on issues related to supervision\nand regulation and payment frictions and innovations both domestically and internationally. The\nresearch and perspectives they discussed can certainly help to broaden our understanding of\nfinancial inclusion and all of the associated challenges. Together, our work to promote\ninitiatives that further this work will enable greater access to financial services. An economy\nthat works for everyone necessarily includes a more inclusive financial system. More expansive\ninclusion opportunities improve the financial well-being of both consumers and small businesses,\nthereby contributing to overall economic growth.\nToday, I would like to highlight the excellent work being done in this area by our\nDivision of Consumer and Community Affairs (DCCA). I will also touch on some ways that the\nbanking system and private sector can support financial inclusion.\nPromoting an Inclusive Financial System Is a Foundational Element of DCCA’s Work\nBefore discussing our work at the Federal Reserve, I would like to first take a step back\nto anchor financial inclusion within the broader objective of fostering an economy that works for\neveryone. A healthy and robust U.S. economy relies upon broad access to financial resources\nand education. Bringing consumers and small businesses into the financial mainstream helps\nthem more fully engage in the financial system and the economy and should help to facilitate the\nmore effective operation of the U.S. economy. Through its responsibility for community affairs,\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- 2 -\nDCCA works to achieve a thorough understanding of current community conditions and best\npractices by conducting research and convening relevant private sector participants.\nToday, we will focus on their important work to enhance financial access. As the chair of\nthe Consumer and Community Affairs Committee, I oversee these efforts. As many of you\nknow well, DCCA’s financial inclusion work is expansive, and I look forward to highlighting\nthese contributions with you today.\nFirst, DCCA informs internal and external stakeholders by leveraging its research and\nanalysis to provide information that can be utilized by external stakeholders to support their\nwork. For example, one of the Fed’s most important contributions to the study of financial wellbeing is the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, or the SHED. We\npublished the 11th annual report in May. The report addresses topics including financial wellbeing, savings, retirement, economic fragility, education, and student loans.2\nThe Federal Reserve System also conducts an annual Small Business Credit Survey\n(SBCS), which is a survey of over 6,000 firms with fewer than 500 employees located\nthroughout the country. This year’s survey found that many small businesses were experiencing\ntight financial conditions and often had to rely on personal financial resources, such as personal\nfunds or a loan from family or friends, to support their businesses.3 Because access to credit is\nfundamental to broader financial access and inclusion, this experience of reliance on personal\n2\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “2023 Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking,” (2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm. Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023 (Washington: Board of Governors,\nMay 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2023-report-economic-well-being-us-households202405.pdf.\n3\n Federal Reserve Banks, 2024 Report on Employer Firms: Findings from the 2023 Small Business Credit Survey\n(Federal Reserve Banks, March 2024), https://doi.org/10.55350/sbcs-20240307.\n- 3 -\nfinancial resources shows that the credit needs of small businesses may not be fully met by the\nfinancial industry.\nAnother way DCCA pursues greater financial inclusion is by convening, informing, and\nengaging with stakeholders. For example, the Community Advisory Council (CAC), which\nconsists of members of the non-profit sector and hands-on community development practitioners,\nmeets with the Board of Governors twice each year to share their experiences and observations\nand to engage on challenges facing the consumers and communities they serve. The CAC\nfocuses on the concerns of low- and moderate-income people, and at its most recent meeting in\nMay, the CAC focused on a range of economic matters continuing to affect financially\nvulnerable communities.\nDCCA also prioritizes the work of mission-driven organizations in its efforts to expand\nfinancial inclusion. The Partnership for Progress (PFP) program is the Federal Reserve’s\nMinority Depository Institution (MDI) outreach program created to support the System’s\nmandate to preserve and promote MDIs. DCCA, in collaboration with other areas of the Federal\nReserve, engages MDIs and Women-Owned Depository Institutions (WDIs) through national\noutreach efforts. The PFP provides technical assistance to help MDIs and WDIs address unique\nbusiness model challenges, enabling these institutions to compete more effectively in the\nmarketplace.4\nThird, DCCA ensures that financial institutions under the Fed’s jurisdiction comply with\nlaws and regulations that protect consumers and promote community development, including fair\nlending laws and the prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices. For example, DCCA\nexamines state member banks for compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which\n4 See the Federal Reserve’s Partnership for Progress website at https://www.fedpartnership.gov.\n- 4 -\nprohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction based on race, gender, marital\nstatus, age, or another prohibited basis. The division’s work to protect consumers from harm\nfurthers our goal to create an economy that works for everyone.\nRegulated Financial Institutions and Financial Inclusion\nI would like to turn now to share some thoughts about how the private sector can engage\nto support financial inclusion. The U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers\ninto the financial mainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their\ncommunities. For example, banks help consumers and small businesses by providing financial\nproducts and services that are safe, fair, and responsive, including through small dollar loan\nproducts. These types of loans can help consumers and small businesses access credit for\nunexpected expenses.\nData from the most recent SHED report found that 10 percent of adults with family\nincomes less than $50,000 per year used payday, pawn, auto title, or tax refund anticipation loans\nto obtain needed funds.5 These types of products often carry high or even punitive direct and\nindirect costs and risks to the consumer. For example, non-repayment of an auto title loan can\nlead to vehicle repossession further complicating the consumer’s financial situation. When\nbanks offer small dollar loans, they can often do so on terms that are safer and at lower cost than\nother types of loans.6\n5\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “2023 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking”\n(2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm. Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve, Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023 (Washinton: Board of Governors, May 2014),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2023-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202405.pdf.\n6\n Banks can look for guidance on small dollar loans through interagency statements related to alternative data and\nsmall dollar loans. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Statement on the Use of\nAlternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” CA letter 19-11 (December 12, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm, and Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar Loans,” SR letter 20-14/CA letter\n20-8 (December 12, 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2014.htm.\n- 5 -\nSome banks that offer small dollar loan products often use automated underwriting based\non alternative information that can include consumer-permissioned cash-flow data. If used\nappropriately, this approach can reduce bank underwriting costs, potentially making affordably\npriced loans available to consumers on a more timely basis. If these loans were more available\nin the banking system, they could serve as an alternative to more costly options from alternative\nfinancial services providers. Small dollar loans targeted to low- and moderate-income\nconsumers have the potential to provide an accessible and more fairly priced alternative when\nconsumers experience a financial emergency.\nRemittances and Financial Inclusion\nAs we heard from our panelists earlier today, payments inclusion can look different in\ndomestic and international contexts, but a reliable, safe, and cost-efficient payment system that\nminimizes unintended frictions is important to consumers around the world. International\nremittances can serve an important role in enhancing financial inclusion, especially in countries\nwhere these funds are a significant source of household financial support. And some research\nindicates that the ability to receive remittances increases the likelihood of bank account\nownership, which furthers economic engagement.7\nHowever, for those who send funds abroad using remittances, the costs can be\nsubstantial. For example, the average cost of sending $200 internationally from the U.S. is\nnearly 6 percent.8\nIn addition to broader work on cross-border payments, the G20 countries have\n7\n Gemechu Ayana Aga and Maria Soledad Martinez Peria, “International Remittances and Financial Inclusion in\nSub-Saharan Africa,” Policy Research Working Paper 6991 (Washington: World Bank Group, Development\nResearch Group, July 2014), https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/19e5d9c1-cabd-5c54-\na4c2-fd2f12964b61/content. David Malpass, “Remittances Are a Critical Economic Stabilizer,” World Bank Blog,\nDecember 6, 2022, https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/voices/remittances-are-critical-economic-stabilizer.\n8\n The World Bank, Remittance Prices Worldwide Quarterly, Issue 48, December 2023, p. 11,\nhttps://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q423_final.pdf.\n- 6 -\nreaffirmed a commitment to reducing average remittance fees to below 3 percent by 2030. This\ncould result in a greater proportion of funds reaching recipients.9 Continued improvements to\ndomestic and international payment systems and responsible innovation can further support our\nwork on financial inclusion.\nConclusion\nGreater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal\nReserve. While we have made great progress, there is more to be done for both the public and\nprivate sectors. We should be open to considering how new or innovative products and services\ncould promote financial inclusion. We should also be willing to engage with a wide range of\nstakeholders. Financial access and inclusion are not one-size-fits-all and can look very different\nto each consumer. Therefore, involving consumers and communities in identifying issues and\ncrafting solutions is critical to success. Advancing financial inclusion will clearly take many\nhands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including everyone participating here today.\n9 For more information on the G20 cross-border payments improvement roadmap and its progress, see Financial\nStability Board, Enhancing Cross-Border Payments: Stage 3 Roadmap (Financial Stability Board, October 2020),\nhttps://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-1.pdf, and Financial Stability Board, G20 Roadmap for\nEnhancing Cross-Border Payments: Consolidated Progress Report for 2023 (Financial Stability Board, October\n2023), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P091023-2.pdf.

    "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you to Montana State University (MSU) for\nhosting today’s event and for that very kind introduction. It is wonderful to see the\nsuccess of your Community Banking Program here at MSU and your commitment to\ninvesting in the education of future generations of community bankers.\nThroughout the response to the pandemic, community bankers have continued to\nserve as the primary source of credit to small businesses and have continued to provide\neconomic and financial support to communities across our nation. Young people, like all\nof you engaged in this program, will very likely become the future leaders of these\ninstitutions, which are critical to their communities and to our economy and financial\nsystem.\nOne of the most significant challenges facing community bankers today is\nnavigating the complex regulatory framework. One area that has become more\ncomplicated is a line of business that has traditionally been the foundation for community\nbanking, home mortgage lending. Community bank leaders consistently tell me that\nsignificant regulatory burden related to making home mortgages has been a major reason\nthey have scaled back their mortgage lending activities or exited the market altogether.\nAlong with tightened lending standards, this trend has made it harder for middle- and\nlower-income borrowers to obtain mortgage credit since the global financial crisis.\nFortunately, work is under way to relieve that burden, and I will highlight one\neffort in particular. But before I do, let me provide some context by reviewing the\ncurrent state of the economy and its effect on homeowners and would-be homeowners.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic and Homeownership in the U.S.\n- 2 -\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound effect on individuals and families\nacross the U.S. and throughout the world. While a strong recovery has begun, it is clear\nthat there is still a way to go before we are back to the robust economy we experienced at\nthe beginning of the year. These challenges are affecting homeowners and the lenders\nthat provide credit to support them. Many homeowners who have lost a job or have had\ntheir income affected by economic conditions have been able to work with their lenders,\nbut such help may not be a long-term solution for many borrowers.\nFortunately, the housing market as a whole is a bright spot for the economy.\nHigher home prices are improving the balance sheets of many households, even those\nthat may face income and employment challenges, and new construction activity is\ngenerating new job opportunities. While affordability remains an important\nconsideration, it is encouraging that housing has performed well in response to low\ninterest rates.\nMortgage Regulations and Access to Mortgage Credit\nHowever, even during this period of strong performance in the housing market,\naccess to affordable mortgage credit remains a barrier to homeownership for some\nborrowers, due in part to regulatory burden. Since the last financial crisis more than a\ndecade ago, there have been a number of new mortgage regulations that added\nrequirements for both borrowers and lenders. While many of these requirements have\ncontributed to a safer and more consumer-friendly mortgage market, they have also\nintroduced significant paperwork and delays that can present roadblocks for many\nborrowers. These new rules have also made it more difficult and costly for small banks\n- 3 -\nto originate mortgage loans, leading many community banks to scale back on home\nlending activity or abandon it altogether.\nHomeownership is as important to communities as it is to individuals, and access\nto credit for rural and low-to-moderate income communities often depends on community\nbanks. In many communities, especially rural communities, if the local bank has been\nforced out of mortgage lending due to burdensome regulation, it means little or no access\nto mortgage credit, preventing buyers from financing home purchases and homeowners\nfrom selling their homes.\nMany leaders of small community banks have told me that the compliance costs\nfor originating smaller mortgages are prohibitive, and that the staffing and training\nrequired to meet the strict requirements are extraordinary in relation to the limited\nnumber of mortgages they originate. As one state banking commissioner said to me\nrecently, “It doesn’t make a lot of sense that you can make an $80,000 truck loan on two\nsides of a sheet of paper, but that many, many pages of paperwork are required to make a\n$40,000 loan on a mobile home or trailer.”\nIn fact, I have been told by community bankers that they are sometimes\ncompelled to make loans for lower-priced home purchases that are backed by other\ncollateral, such as a car or equipment, because of the excessive burden of complying with\nthe many residential home mortgage regulations and time frames for such small\ntransactions. As a result, these consumers may not have the benefit of the important\nconsumer protections that having a home mortgage loan provides.\nReducing mortgage compliance burden would allow community banks to better\nmeet the critical need for home lending in their communities. Because of their local\n- 4 -\nknowledge and strong customer relationships, community banks are often more willing to\nwork with borrowers to get through difficult times. Taking steps to simplify and lower\nthis regulatory burden for small community banks and their customers would help to\nensure that homeowners can stay in their homes during times of stress, like the one we\nare facing currently due to COVID-19.\nOne Area to Consider in Easing Burden\nThe TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID, is one of the real estate\nregulatory requirements that smaller banks cite most frequently as creating a heavy\nburden. Commissioner Melanie Hall and the Montana Independent Bankers have been\nparticularly helpful in highlighting the importance of this issue. Therefore, I am very\npleased that the Independent Community Bankers of America is engaged in ongoing\nconversations and activities to address the more burdensome aspects of this requirement\non community banks while importantly retaining key consumer protections. Efforts like\nthese that aim to reduce the compliance burden for critically important services will\nenable many community banks to return to doing what they do best: meeting the needs of\ntheir communities.\nAgain, thank you for inviting me to join you today, and I look forward to\nengaging on this important topic"

    "text": "Thank you, Bill, and I’d also like to thank Alex Sanchez and the Florida Bankers\nAssociation for the invitation to be with you today. It is a pleasure to be here in person to\ndiscuss issues that are top of mind for all of us as we begin the new year. I will start with\nsome thoughts about the Federal Reserve’s ongoing effort to lower inflation, which\ncontinues to be much too high. I will then touch on other issues in the Fed’s purview,\nincluding bank supervision and regulation.1\n\nWhile the Fed has access to a staff of expert economists and a seemingly infinite\nflow of economic data to inform our decision-making, I often find that the most valuable\ndata comes directly from the experiences and perspectives of those who are engaged in\nand supporting the economy through the financial system. In my more than four years as\na member of the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),\nI have learned that there are few who understand the economy more directly than\nbankers, business owners and the customers you serve.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me begin by discussing the Fed’s efforts to lower inflation. Inflation is much\ntoo high, and I am focused on bringing it down toward our 2 percent goal. Inflation\naffects everyone, but it is especially harmful to lower- and middle-income Americans,\nwho spend a greater share of their income on necessities like food and housing. Stable\nprices are the bedrock of a healthy economy and are necessary to support a labor market\nthat works for all Americans.\nOver the past year, I have supported the FOMC’s policy actions to address high\ninflation, and I am committed to taking further actions to bring inflation back down to our\n1 These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- 2 -\ngoal. Since last March, the FOMC has been tightening monetary policy through a\ncombination of increasing the federal funds rate by 4¼ percentage points and reducing\nour balance sheet holdings.\nIn recent months, we’ve seen a decline in some measures of inflation but we have\na lot more work to do, so I expect the FOMC will continue raising interest rates to tighten\nmonetary policy, as we stated after our December meeting.\n2\n My views on the appropriate\nsize of future rate increases and on the ultimate level of the federal funds rate will\ncontinue to be guided by the incoming data and its implications for the outlook for\ninflation and economic activity.\nI will be looking for compelling signs that inflation has peaked and for more\nconsistent indications that inflation is on a downward path, in determining both the\nappropriate size of future rate increases and the level at which the federal funds rate is\nsufficiently restrictive. I expect that once we achieve a sufficiently restrictive federal\nfunds rate, it will need to remain at that level for some time in order to restore price\nstability, which will in turn help to create conditions that support a sustainably strong\nlabor market. Maintaining a steadfast commitment to restoring price stability is essential\nto support a sustainably strong labor market.\nTo this point, unemployment has remained low as we have tightened monetary\npolicy and made progress in lowering inflation. I take this as a hopeful sign that we can\nsucceed in lowering inflation without a significant economic downturn. It is likely that as\na part of this process, labor markets will soften somewhat before we bring inflation back\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, December 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20221214a.htm.\n- 3 -\nto our 2 percent goal. While the effects of monetary policy tightening on the job market\nhave generally been limited so far, slowing the economy will likely mean that job\ncreation also slows. And if there are unforeseen shocks to the economy, growth may\nslow further. It’s important to keep in mind that there are costs and risks to tightening\npolicy to lower inflation, but I see the costs and risks of allowing inflation to persist as far\ngreater. These dynamics make the difficult decisions facing the FOMC even more\nchallenging, but it is absolutely necessary that the Committee achieves our goal of price\nstability.\nFrom the late 1960s through the mid-1980s, the U.S. economy experienced high\ninflation, high unemployment, and declining living standards. During that time,\npolicymakers prematurely eased monetary policy when the economy weakened, and\ninflation remained high. The FOMC was forced to return to tightening monetary policy,\ncausing a deep recession in 1981 and 1982. This is an important lesson that guides my\nthinking about monetary policy and my continued support for policy actions that will\ncontinue to lower inflation.\nIt is also important to remember that today’s inflation is a global concern. This is\nbecause some of the factors driving inflation in the United States are global, including the\ndisruption to goods production and trade during the pandemic, the shutdown and\nreopening of large economies, and the more recent disruption of food and energy supplies\ndue to conflicts abroad. Monetary policy can do very little to improve supply disruptions,\nbut it can help bring supply and demand into better alignment.\nWhile the path ahead looks uncertain, I am encouraged by three specific\ndevelopments. The first is the ongoing strength of the labor market, which was further\n- 4 -\nsupported with last Friday’s jobs report. So far, the job market has remained resilient\ndespite higher interest rates and slower growth. The second development is that the\nbalance sheets of households have remained strong, with low debt levels. Low debt and\nstrong balance sheets together with the strong labor market mean that consumers and\nbusinesses can continue to spend even as economic growth slows. The third point is the\nstrength of the U.S. banking system, with high levels of capital and liquidity, due in large\npart to the reforms adopted after the last financial crisis.\nI will turn now to the banking and payments issues on the Fed’s agenda, which\ninclude crypto and digital assets, innovation in payments, climate change and banking\nsupervision, and likely changes to the rules implementing the Community Reinvestment\nAct (CRA).\nCryptocurrency\nThe dysfunction in cryptocurrency markets has been well-documented, with some\ncrypto firms misrepresenting that they have deposit insurance, the collapse of certain\nstablecoins, and, most recently, the bankruptcy of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.\nThese events have made it clear that cryptocurrency activities can pose significant risks\nto consumers, businesses, and potentially the larger financial system.\nWhile the traditional financial system has limited exposure to cryptocurrencies, I\nexpect that some banks will continue to explore how to engage in crypto-related\nactivities. The Fed and other banking agencies will continue to focus in this area, in light\nof the significant risks these activities may pose. But the bottom line is that we do not\nwant to hinder innovation. As regulators, we should support innovation and recognize\nthat the banking industry must evolve to meet consumer demand. By inhibiting\n- 5 -\ninnovation, we could be pushing growth in this space into the non-bank sector, leading to\nmuch less transparency and potential financial stability risk. We are thinking through\nsome of these issues and what a regulatory approach could look like.\nPayments\nThe Fed plays an important role in fostering the safety and efficiency of the U.S.\npayments, clearing, and settlement systems. There have been a number of interesting\ndevelopments on payments that continue to be top of mind for policymakers. One of\nthese is the push for real-time payments. Since 2019, the Fed has been working to launch\nFedNow, a new faster payments system that will be available in the first half of 2023.\nFedNow will help transform the way payments are made through new direct services that\nenable consumers and businesses to make payments conveniently, in real time, on any\nday, and with immediate availability of funds for receivers. FedNow will enable\ndepository institutions of every size, and in every community across America, to provide\nsafe and efficient instant payment services.\nWe have also been studying the concept of a central bank digital currency\n(CBDC). Several foreign governments and central banks are exploring digital currency,\nand there are many competing proposals suggesting a need to create a digital currency.\nThe common theme underlying the need in these proposals is the desire to increase the\nspeed and reduce the cost of financial transactions. Last January, the Fed published a\npaper soliciting comment on possible forms and uses of a CBDC in the United States.\nThe Fed continues to study the idea, although much of what supporters hope to achieve\nwith a central bank digital currency may be provided through FedNow and existing\n- 6 -\nprivate payment services. In any case, initiatives to make payments faster and more\nefficient will continue to be an area of focus.\nClimate Supervision\nClimate has also been a recent focus for Fed supervision, but our narrow interest\nin this area it is limited to the largest banks. Last fall, the Fed announced an exploratory\npilot study with six of the GSIBs that is narrowly focused on the goal of enhancing the\nability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate-related financial risks,\nnot credit allocation. The Fed has also published a climate guidance proposal for banks\nover $100 billion in assets. These climate efforts do not apply to smaller and community\nbanks. Smaller and community banks already integrate and comply with robust risk\nmanagement expectations. The Fed views its role on climate as a narrow focus on\nsupervisory responsibilities and limited to our role in promoting a safe, sound and stable\nfinancial system. While this climate supervision effort is a new area of focus, it has been\na longstanding supervisory requirement that banks manage their risks related to extreme\nweather events and other natural disasters that could disrupt operations or impact\nbusiness lines.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe last item on our regulatory agenda that I will note in my remarks today is the\nproposal to update the Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA requires the Fed and\nother banking agencies to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their\ncommunities, including low- and moderate-income communities. This rule was last\nupdated 25 years ago, and the banking industry has changed dramatically since the 1990s.\nThe proposal reflects these industry changes, including recognizing internet and mobile\n- 7 -\nbanking services, it also attempts to provide clarity and consistency, and it could enhance\naccess to credit for these low- and moderate-income communities. I am fully supportive\nof these efforts, but I also share the concern noted in public comments that have\nsuggested that some of the elements included in this overhaul of the CRA framework\nresult in significant new regulatory burden, particularly for the smallest and community\nbanks. As we continue this important rulemaking process, it will be critical for the Fed to\ncarefully weigh the costs and benefits of any changes before finalizing a proposal.\nI will stop there so we can move on to our conversation. Thank you again, for the\nopportunity to be with you today. I look forward to the discussion."

It is really a pleasure to join you here in Alaska.\n1 Getting outside of\nWashington, D.C. and hearing about the unique issues that affect Alaskans provides valuable\ninsights that inform my work at the Federal Reserve. A part of the mission of the Federal\nReserve is to support an economy that works for everyone. Consumers and communities are\nmore successful when they have access to financial products and services that meet their needs.\nWhile many of these products and services are available online, as Alaskans know better than\nmost Americans, geography and location are also important. This access often looks very\ndifferent in places with many remote and rural communities. Today, I will discuss the Federal\nReserve’s work to promote a more inclusive financial system, including our work on financial\ninclusion for Indigenous communities. Before diving into those topics, I will share my current\nviews on the economy and monetary policy.\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the\nFOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to\ncontinue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAfter seeing considerable progress last year, in recent months we have seen some further\nprogress on lowering inflation. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer to the more volatile higher-frequency readings, have\nmoved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated at 2.5 percent and 2.6\npercent in June, respectively. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n- 2 -\nindicate that 12-month core PCE inflation likely remained a bit above 2.5 percent in July. The\nprogress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but inflation is still\nuncomfortably above the Committee’s 2 percent goal.\nPrices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh\non consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest, since food, energy,\nand housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.\nEconomic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace\nlast year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth was solid and slowed much less than\ngross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile\ncategories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than\nGDP indicated. Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter\nof this year, largely accounting for the step-down in PDFP growth. Goods spending rebounded\nin the second quarter and retail sales continued to rise at a solid pace in July.\nConsumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced\nin part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income\nconsumers no longer have savings to support this type of spending, and we’ve seen a\nnormalization of loan delinquency rates as they have risen from historically low levels during the\npandemic.\nThe labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased\nand the number of available jobs has declined—signs that illustrate the labor market is coming\ninto better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a\nmore modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor\nsupply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in\n- 3 -\nJuly. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate.\nIn addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic\nlevel. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as\nmeasured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains remain\nabove the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nMy baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of\nmonetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably\ntoward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to\nprevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and\nemployment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering\ninflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality\nas the risks to the Committee’s employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into\nbetter balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation as supply conditions have now\nlargely normalized and any further improvements to supply seem less likely to offset price\npressures arising from increasing geopolitical tensions, additional fiscal stimulus, and increased\ndemand for housing due to immigration.\nThere are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have\nbeen indicating, and it appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the\ndegree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages\n(QCEW) report suggests that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment\nsurvey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become\n- 4 -\nless accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.2\n The rise in the\nunemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor\nforce are taking longer to find work, and layoffs remain low. It is also likely that some\ntemporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the unemployment\nrate in July was largely accounted for by workers who are experiencing a temporary layoff and\nare more likely to be rehired in coming months. Hurricane Beryl also likely contributed to\nweaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased\nsignificantly last month.\nIn light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and\nthe economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of\nmonetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data\nrevisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and\npredicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to\nconsidering adjustments to the current stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we\nshould consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC’s\nmonetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each\nFOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and\nguided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time\nof our September meeting, we will have seen additional economic data and information,\n2 The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) administrative data show employment gains that\nare about 110,000 per month lower than what the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey reported from March\n2023 to December 2023. Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics benchmarks CES payroll employment based on\nthe Q1 QCEW, to be released on August 21, the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to CES\nemployment gains last year.\n- 5 -\nincluding one employment and one inflation report. We will also monitor how developments in\nbroader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.\nI will continue to closely watch the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I\nassess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted\nearlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to\ninflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while\nwatching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that\nrestoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.\nFocus on Financial Inclusion\nI will turn now to discuss our work to promote financial inclusion. An inclusive financial\nsystem enables access to financial services that enhance the financial well-being of consumers\nand businesses. Consumers come from a wide range of economic circumstances, with varied\nperceptions of and experiences with the banking system and different financial needs. All\nconsumers should have access to the financial services and products they need.\nThe U.S. economy benefits when more households achieve financial stability. Yet, while\nwe have made significant progress in expanding access to financial services and deposit accounts\nin the United States, the remaining challenges often include geographic location, products that\nmeet specific customer needs, the absence of financial literacy education, lack of access to\ntechnology and reliable internet, and in some cases, language. These challenges are even more\nacute in providing access to financial services to Indigenous populations like those here in\nAlaska. It is impressive to see that many financial services providers, including banks and\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), are working to address these\nchallenges and making significant inroads.\n- 6 -\nImportance of banks in furthering financial inclusion\nThe U.S. financial system is uniquely positioned to bring consumers into the financial\nmainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their communities.\nBanks and other depository institutions assist consumers and small businesses by providing\nfinancial products and services that are safe, fair, and responsive. In doing so, they serve a\ncritical role in connecting consumers to the financial system and to the economy.\nSmaller banks, including community banks, are indispensable in providing access to\nfinancial products and services, especially in more remote or rural areas. Here, in Alaska, your\nbanks are the front-line providers for your communities. As you know well, community banks\nsupport small businesses through credit and technical assistance and targeted support specific to\ncustomers in their communities. As a former community banker, I know firsthand that smaller\nbanks deeply understand their communities because they live in the local economy and know\ntheir customers well.\nThis was especially apparent during the COVID pandemic. Community banks rose to the\nchallenge and continued to support the needs of their customers and communities. One of the\nprograms first made available in response to the pandemic was the Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP), which was geared to small businesses and was necessarily dependent on community\nbanks. The PPP was timely and effective in helping millions of businesses weather the initial\n- 7 -\nphase of the pandemic, and community banks were absolutely essential to the success of the\nprogram.3\nThis successful outcome is probably not surprising to this audience, because when it\ncomes to lending to small businesses, community banks have always been an outsized source of\ncredit, relative to their size in the banking system. Before the pandemic, community banks\naccounted for over 40 percent of all small business lending, while they only accounted for\nroughly 15 percent of total assets in the banking system.4\n This trend has continued. An analysis\nof June 2023 call report data showed that community banks had larger shares of small-business\nloans relative to their total assets than larger institutions.5\nCommunity banks know their customers, and they know their communities. During that\nchallenging time, community bank CEOs told me that early in the pandemic they directly\ncontacted every single one of their business and consumer loan customers. They took the time to\ncheck in with each one to see how they were doing, and what they needed. They encouraged\ncustomers to keep in touch with the bank, and they noted the available opportunities for payment\ndeferrals and other options that customers might not have been aware of. Because of this\n3\n Allen N. Berger, Maryann P. Feldman, W. Scott Langford, and Raluca A.

The Federal\nReserve relies on insights from community banks and created a mechanism to formalize the\nviews and feedback from community banks on a regular basis through our Reserve Bank and\nBoard Community Depository Institutions Advisory Councils (CDIAC). The Board CDIAC\nincludes a representative from each of the local advisory councils at the 12 Reserve Banks.\nCDIAC members are bankers from community banks, thrifts, and credit unions who provide\ninsight and information about the economy, lending conditions, and other issues that they see\nfirsthand in their communities.\nThis perspective helps us gain insights into economic activity and the impact of our\npolicies on rural and underserved communities.\nCentral Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion\nI will turn now to highlight our efforts in providing broader access to financial services.\nIn 2021, the Federal Reserve became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous\nInclusion (CBNII).7\n This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada,\nNew Zealand, and Australia. The network enabled us to initiate an ongoing international\ndialogue to raise awareness of economic and financial issues in Indigenous populations. This\n6\n Governor Michelle W. Bowman, “The Role of Research, Data, and Analysis in Banking Reforms” (speech at the\n2023 Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, MO, October 4, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20231004a.htm\n7\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces It Has Joined the Central\nBank Network for Indigenous Inclusion, Which Will Foster Ongoing Dialogue, Research, and Education to Raise\nAwareness of Economic and Financial Issues and Opportunities around Indigenous Economies,” news release,\nOctober 13, 2021, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20211013a.htm\n- 9 -\nallows us to share knowledge and best practices, promote engagement and education, and work\ntogether with Indigenous communities.\nAs the Federal Reserve’s representative to the network, I have prioritized expanding our\noutreach and engagement efforts to include all U.S. Native populations, Native Alaskan, Native\nHawaiian, and Native American. Coming here to Alaska is a key part of this role to ensure that\nthe Federal Reserve continues to expand our firsthand knowledge and understanding of the\nissues and barriers that may prevent full engagement in the economy. I take these\nresponsibilities seriously and have made meeting with and learning from Indigenous groups and\nleaders a priority in my work.\nIn October 2021, I met with Native American leaders in South Dakota and on the Pine\nRidge Reservation. These tribal leaders highlighted the importance of building understanding by\nmeeting with people in their communities to enhance our knowledge of their social and\neconomic circumstances. Earlier this year and last year, I met with members of the Native\nHawaiian community and a range of community organizations to learn about the issues and\nchallenges they face, in addition to the recovery efforts following the devastating wildfire in\nLahaina. And yesterday, I met with Native Alaskan leaders to learn about Alaska Native\ncorporations and other initiatives here in Alaska. These convenings and conversations help to\ninform our work at the Federal Reserve to ensure that the financial system is accessible to\neveryone, including Indigenous communities.\nThe Fed’s work in this area is supported by many of our Reserve Bank teams, including\nthe San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for Indian Country Development, and\nthe St. Louis Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment program. Together, these\nteams and programs support Indigenous organizations and tribal nations by providing actionable\n- 10 -\ndata and research, economic and personal finance education, and other resources to advance\nopportunities for prosperity in Indigenous communities.\nWe know that the economic well-being of all Americans is an important aspect of the\nFederal Reserve’s goal to increase economic inclusion, and it is one of the reasons we began\nparticipating in the CBNII. Even with all of its tools, the Federal Reserve cannot fully succeed\nuntil all Americans, including our Native populations and those existing on the margins of the\neconomy, have the opportunity to fully participate. Engagement in these learning opportunities,\nincluding these meetings, will help to advance this goal.\nMission-driven organizations\nFinally, I would like to briefly address the Federal Reserve’s efforts to build the\ninstitutional capacity of another set of key stakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions,\nWomen-Owned Depository Institutions, and CDFIs, whose missions are to reach historically\nunderserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an important part of the\nFederal Reserve’s responsibility to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking system that\nprotects consumers.8\n\nThese mission-driven banks and CDFIs are often vital sources of capital to many\nunderrepresented small businesses. CDFIs generally target specific underserved markets. For\nexample, there are many Native CDFIs, including several here in Alaska, that support Native\ncommunities by providing access to credit, capital, and financial services.9\n While there has been\nsome significant growth in Native CDFIs,10 they cannot singlehandedly resolve the credit needs\nof this population. This effort will require partnerships with banks, state and local governments,\n8\n See the Federal Reserve’s Partnership for Progress website at https://www.fedpartnership.gov.\n9\n See https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/programs/native-initiatives.\n10 See https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/native-cdfis-connect-indian-country-to-credit-and-capital.\n- 11 -\nand community stakeholders. As an example, the Federal Reserve convened a small business\nlending working group that brought together local, state, and federal partners to address\nchallenges with access to capital for Alaskan small businesses, especially those owned by Native\nAlaskans.11 This group has helped connect local Native CDFIs to banks and state and federal\npartners for funding and technical assistance.\nFinally, I will close with a brief note on the revisions to the CDFI Certification\nApplication recently released by the Treasury’s CDFI Fund.12 There are significant benefits to\nbeing a certified CDFI, including access to federal, state, and local governmental funds,\nphilanthropic support, and private sector investment. While the certification process is overseen\nby the CDFI Fund, I encourage CDFI banks to review the new certification application and share\nfeedback on whether the requirements are attainable and remain compatible with the bank’s\nexisting business model.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. I am very pleased to have the\nopportunity to learn from your experiences and incorporate these lessons into our work. The\nunique challenges that you face here in Alaska will help to inform and expand the Federal\nReserve’s understanding of how we can make the financial system more inclusive. Our meetings\nover the past few days with state government officials, Native Alaskan leaders, small business\nowners, and financial institutions provide many different perspectives to help inform our work to\nachieve an economy that works for everyone.\n11 Governor Michelle W.

    "text": "Good morning. Before I provide some context for today’s discussions, I would\nlike to thank all of our participants who are here with us today in Kansas City at the\nReserve Bank, and those participating remotely. Most importantly, I’d like to thank our\nhost, President Schmid, and his excellent research staff, all of whom helped to organize\ntoday’s event. I especially appreciate the opportunity to highlight a few specific areas\nthat concern me about the currently regulatory trajectory and their effects on the future of\nbanking.1\n\nToday’s workshop addresses timely and important questions, including the forces\nthat will shape the future of the banking system, entry into the banking system, bank\nmergers and acquisitions, and the state of competition including both the direct and\nindirect competition banks experience and how regulators measure and assess\ncompetition—or at least how we broadly measure it today.\nThe failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank just over a year ago, and\nthe stress to the banking system that ensued, caused many institutions to retrench and\nprompted regulators to renew their focus on bank regulatory and supervisory policy and\napproach. Banks responded by enhancing their focus on fundamental risks like interest\nrate and liquidity risk, adopting a more conservative posture in both risk management and\nlending. This self-reflection by both industry and regulators continues today. In fact, the\nlong shadow of the bank failures continues to be a driving force for regulatory and\nsupervisory reforms, even for reform proposals that have little relationship to the events\nsurrounding the bank failures and ensuing banking system stress.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Board of Governors.\n- 2 -\nAs I have noted in the past, the regulatory reform agenda, and the less visible but\nno less important changes to the supervisory process, touch on a wide range of topics that\ndirectly and indirectly affect banks of all sizes.2\n The sheer volume of changes presents\nchallenges to regulated institutions. Outside of the largest banks, how does bank\nmanagement review and provide meaningful comment on voluminous regulatory\nchanges? When those changes are finalized, how does a bank’s management reallocate\nresources to ensure a capability to comply with revised regulations? Are banks,\nespecially small banks, able to locate and retain qualified staff to understand and\nimplement these increasingly complex and burdensome rules? How does a bank’s\nmanagement and compliance officer adjust to supervisory standards and expectations that\nmay be significantly different from exam to exam or regulator to regulator?\nThe 2023 bank failures and circumstances leading up to those failures continue to\nwarrant review, self-reflection, and appropriately targeted changes to identified issues or\nfailures in regulation and supervision. But we should ask whether the volume of reforms\nthat have been proposed, recently finalized, or that are in the pipeline, reflect appropriate\nprioritization. Or instead, do they suggest that we have lost our focus on furthering the\nprimary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision—promoting a safe and sound\nbanking system and fostering a thriving banking industry that effectively supports local\nand regional economies. I am concerned that the broad-based and insufficiently focused\nreform agenda has become a growing source of risk to the banking system, particularly\ndue to the rushed nature of these reform efforts and the lack of research and\n2\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the New\nJersey Bankers Association Annual Economic Leadership Forum, Somerset, New Jersey, March 7, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240307a.pdf.\n- 3 -\nunderstanding of the intended and unintended consequences of these proposals.\n3\n This\nreform agenda, for both regulation and supervision, is the backdrop for today’s panel\ndiscussions.\nRegulatory Approvals in the Banking System\nI have previously spoken about the regulatory dynamics shaping the future of the\nbanking system, from bank capital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions\nto the Community Reinvestment Act, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for\nservices (including debit card interchange fees), the trend of dialing supervision up to\n“11” for banks of all sizes, increased competition from non-banks, the continued\nmigration of certain activities from regulated banks to non-banks outside of the banking\nsystem, and the ongoing erosion of tailoring.\n4\n These issues continue to shape the\ncontours of the banking system—including bank size, the activities in which they engage,\nand where activities occur within the broader financial system. The policy decisions\n3\n The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency recently passed an interim final rule to extend the applicability date of certain provisions in the\nrecent amendments to the Community Reinvestment Act regulations. The need for these delays to\nimportant and controversial elements of the final rule illustrates the rushed, overly complex, and unwieldy\nnature of the Community Reinvestment Act rulemaking. See dissenting statement of Governor Michelle\nW. Bowman, “Statement on the Interim Final Rule and Final Rule Amending the Community\nReinvestment Act Regulations” March 21, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240321a1.htm.\n4\n Michelle W.

These policy decisions create incentives and\nimpacts that we must acknowledge and understand. When policymakers flatten and\nstandardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create strong incentives for\nbanks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it harder for new\nbanks to successfully compete with existing banks.\nWhen we “raise the bar” for banks to engage in certain activities in a way that is\ndisproportionate to the risk of those activities, we create incentives for those activities to\nmigrate to non-banks outside of the regulatory perimeter. We must understand whether\nthe policy decisions embedded in the regulatory and supervisory framework are effective\nand complementary. If they are not, we must acknowledge the consequences of\nknowingly implementing conflicting policy choices.\nDe Novo Bank Formation\nI continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S.\nAs I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand\nfor new bank creation indicated by the ongoing preference for “charter strip”\nacquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising\ndemand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.5\n\n5\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Consequences of Fewer Banks in the U.S. Banking System,” (speech at\nthe Wharton Financial Regulation Conference, Philadelphia, PA, April 14, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230414a.pdf.\n- 5 -\nFor the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as\nthe banking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time period. Many factors\ninfluence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment,\nbusiness opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff,\nand potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services providers to operate\noutside of the regulated banking system.\nThe decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business\nconsiderations including identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and\nensuring the ability to navigate the “start-up” phase of a new bank and manage upfront\noperational costs, all while being subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first\nseveral years of de novo bank operation. Yet, perhaps the most important factor that\ninfluences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and supervisory framework, which\nincludes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.\nThe application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation.\nApplications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application\nfiling with the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) application for deposit insurance. The timeframe for receiving all of the required\nregulatory approvals to open for business often takes well in excess of a year. Of course,\nthis uncertainty must be endured after initial capital has been raised, shareholders\nidentified, and a management team ready to begin work. As one can imagine, these\ndelays can present unique challenges for de novo founders including incurring more startup expenses than anticipated, having difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified\n- 6 -\nmanagement to obtain approval, and experiencing challenges raising additional start-up\ncapital investment.\nSome of the uncertainty surrounding the de novo process flows from supervisory\nperceptions of this proposed business model. For example, a de novo business plan that\nfocuses on providing banking-as-a-service outside of a defined geographic footprint\npresents different risks than a business model that focuses on retail banking in an\nunderserved market. It stands to reason that the regulatory expectations for each business\nmodel, including capital levels, risk management, and compliance, will vary. Even\ncontrolling for the variability in business model, the standards and expectations for a de\nnovo application that will be viewed and treated favorably are opaque and may shift\nsignificantly over time, even between and among the regulators.\nThe absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in the\nbanking system, a void that may contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and\nfairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the\ncontinued shift of banking activities beyond the regulatory perimeter.\nBank Mergers and Acquisitions\nA more immediate concerning influence is the dramatically evolving approach to\nbank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) by some prudential regulators. It is helpful to\nconsider bank M&A broadly, to include not only bank-to-bank mergers subject to\napproval under the Bank Merger Act, but also the broader set of business combinations\ncontemplated under sections 3 and 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, and under\nsection 10 of the Home Owners’ Loan Act.6\n\n6\n 12 U.S.C. §§ 1467a, 1842, 1843.\n- 7 -\nThese M&A transactions allow banks to thrive in our dynamic banking system,\nand help to promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&A also ensures that\nsome institutions have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the absence\nof a viable M&A framework, we increase the potential for additional risks including\nlimited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities\nand zombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.\nM&A reform is currently a popular topic on the banking agency regulatory\nagenda with the process and standards regulators employ to review and approve\ntransactions under intense scrutiny. Recently some of the federal banking regulators have\nproposed or described new M&A policy approaches, with the Department of Justice\ncurrently reviewing how it enforces section 7 of the Clayton Act.\n7\n\nAs regulators revisit the evaluation standards for bank M&A transactions under\nthe statutory framework, we should consider whether the regulatory review process is\nfair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. This should begin with an\nimportant threshold question—what are the identified shortcomings with the current\nprocess or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these\nshortcomings?\nOne concern that has been raised about the M&A regulatory approval process\nseems largely based on the misconception that a lack of application denials implies that\n7\n Jonathan Kanter, “Merger Enforcement Sixty Years After Philadelphia National Bank” (keynote Address\nat the Brookings Institution’s Center on Regulation and Markets Event, Promoting Competition in Banking,\nWashington, DC, June 20 2023), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathankanter-delivers-keynote-address-brookings-institution; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n“Business Combinations Under the Bank Merger Act: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin\n2024-4, January 29, 2024, https://occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html; Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed Revisions to its Statement of\nPolicy on Bank Merger Transactions,” news release, March 21, 2024, https://www.fdic.gov/news/pressreleases/2024/pr24017.html.\n- 8 -\nstandards are simply not rigorous enough, that the regulatory approval process has\nbecome a rubber stamp. This view ignores the reality of the filing process. These\ntransactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of\nresources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target,\nconducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is\nidentified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators\nduring the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes\nincluding scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition.\nThis is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers take extremely\nseriously. They do not make the decision to file an application lightly. Even for those\ninstitutions that decide to proceed with an application, success is not guaranteed, even in\nthe absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve’s most recent report on banking\napplications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&A transactions in which\napplications have been withdrawn.8\n\nIn its recent proposal, one agency suggested that if an applicant withdraws a\nfiling, that agency’s board may release a statement regarding the concerns with the\napplication in the interest of creating transparency for future applicants.9\n I have observed\nthat applicants may withdraw a filing for a number of reasons, including prolonged\nuncertainty due to regulatory delays, expiration of contractual deadlines, and issues that\n8\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Banking Applications Activity Semiannual Report,\nJune 1 – June 30, 2023, Vol. 10, No. 2 (Washington: Board of Governors, September 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/semiannual-report-on-banking-applications20230929.pdf. This report notes that in the first half of 2023, 46 M&A applications were approved by the\nFederal Reserve, while 12 such applications were withdrawn.\n9\n Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Press Release, “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed\nRevisions to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions,” March 21, 2024, at 74,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/pr24017.html.\n- 9 -\nare uncovered only during the processing of the application (for example, the issuance of\nupdated supervisory ratings from recently completed examinations). As a general matter,\nthis approach could evolve to become the expectation for all withdrawn applications, and,\nif so, could put regulators in the untenable position of needing to disclose confidential\nsupervisory information or nonpublic business information about applicants even in the\ncase of a withdrawn application.\nJust as in the de novo bank formation process, one of the key risks to an effective\nM&A process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can\nsignificantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater\noperational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational\nrisk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.\nReducing the efficiency of bank M&A can be a deterrent to healthy bank\ntransactions—it can reduce the effectiveness of M&A activity that preserves the presence\nof community banks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent\ngrowth strategies, and actually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing\nto a larger scale, effectively creating a “protected class” of larger institutions.\nGiven all of these considerations, it seems reasonable to assume that the\nuncertainty of the M&A process itself may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation,\nas potential bank founders stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies—like\nthe strategic acquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer—may face long odds of\nsuccess. We must not foreclose bank merger activities that are permitted by law and that\nare necessary to maintain a healthy banking system.\n- 10 -\nInstead, we should focus on ensuring that we can improve the speed and\ntimeliness of regulatory decisionmaking, applying review standards that are reasonable\nand consistent with the statutory framework. Too often it seems that regulators discount\nthe fact that these organizations do not simply hit the pause button during the merger\nreview process. We must remember that these organizations are businesses that continue\nto operate and must do so in a way that supports their ongoing business operations and\nfuture growth.\nUnfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly\nfocused on other issues, with the timeliness of regulatory action appearing to be lower on\nthe list of priorities. These efforts have not improved the outlook for the bank merger\nprocess. Pending reform efforts may actually exacerbate the existing problems, resulting\nin an increase in the already significant delays in processing times for some applications.\nUncertainty in the standards for an application review can drive delays. A federal\nagency recently indicated that it may deviate from the longstanding approach to\nevaluating competitive effects of a merger using a deposit-based analysis. While this\nanalysis could be retained as an initial screen, that agency would “evaluate the\ncompetitive effects of a proposed merger in a manner that is most relevant to each\ntransaction,” and “may consider concentrations in any specific products or customer\nsegments….”10 I imagine bankers contemplating merger transactions will have little\ncapacity to evaluate whether a merger would raise regulatory issues in advance under this\nopen-ended standard.\n10 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Press Release, “FDIC Seeks Public Comment on Proposed\nRevisions to its Statement of Policy on Bank Merger Transactions,” March 21, 2024, at 75-76,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/pr24017.html.\n- 11 -\nThat proposal also includes revisions to the convenience and needs analysis that\nmay frustrate banks’ ability not only to receive regulatory approval, but to manage their\nbusinesses going forward. Specifically, the proposal notes that applicants should be\n“prepared to make commitments regarding future retail banking services in the\ncommunity to be served for at least three years following consummation of the\nmerger.”11 The proposal also suggests that the resulting bank would be expected to\n“better” meet the convenience and needs of the community to be served than it would\nabsent the merger.12 As is the current expectation, a bank should expect to provide\ninformation on their plans for activities and branches as part of the application process.\nBut we should acknowledge that those plans may change over time as conditions evolve.\nA bank’s future activities, whether banking or branching, are subject to regulatory\nrequirements, and oversight through ongoing supervision activities. We need not operate\nlike the applications process is the only tool available to address policy concerns. I\nexpect this proposal would greatly benefit from public input.\nEven reported data on current merger processing times may understate the\nbroader application processing timeline. This process often includes preliminary\ndiscussions and pre-filings with regulators, and delays between the time an application is\nfiled and when it is “accepted” by the regulator triggering the regulatory processing\nclock.13\n11 Id., at 42-43.\n12 Id., at 82.\n13 See Michelle W.

During the application deliberation\nprocess, regulators can impose limitations or restrictions to address specific supervisory\nor policy concerns in the form of “conditions” or “commitments” on the approval. While\nthis can be an important tool, it should not be used to replace rulemaking or existing\nregulations and statutes that guide regulatory action; we should not engage in “regulation\nby application.” Conditions or commitments that impose obligations that are inconsistent\nwith our existing regulatory framework raise issues of significant concern.14 In these\ncircumstances, our existing rules and regulations are the most appropriate and effective\ntools to address concerns.\nClosing Thoughts\nPolicymakers continue to play an important role in shaping the future of the\nbanking system, not only through policy choices on substantive regulations and\nsupervisory approaches, but also through their role in bank formations, mergers, and\nacquisitions. We currently have a dynamic banking system, but these individual pieces\nof the bank regulatory framework do not function independently. The policy choices\nembodied in current regulation and supervision, and in proposed reforms, aggregate to\ninfluence the future of the banking system, often in ways that are unpredictable, and at\ntimes in ways that are in conflict and internally inconsistent.\n14 See Michelle W. Bowman, Statement on Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Resolution\nRequirements for Large Banks and Application by U.S. Bancorp, October 14, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221014.htm\n- 13 -\nI hope that today’s discussions provide an opportunity to have frank conversations\nabout the dynamics shaping the future of the banking system. And throughout, that we\nidentify opportunities to rationalize regulatory approaches, and ensure that the values\nregulators say they support—like the importance of a broad and diverse banking system\nthat includes institutions of all sizes serving all of the different market segments across\nthe country—are consistent with regulatory actions.\nI am concerned that many of these actions may actually undermine the long-term\nviability of banks. I look forward to hearing the insights of all of our participants today,\nand thinking more deeply about how regulation, supervision, and ongoing reform efforts\ncan help to positively influence a banking system that will effectively and efficiently\nserve communities of all sizes, consumers, businesses, and the broader U.S. economy\nlong into the future"

    "text": "Thank you for the invitation to participate at this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nconference. It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the conference report and present my views on\nthe transmission of monetary policy to real activity in recent years.\n1\n I would like to start by\nthanking the authors of the paper for their thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the effects\nof monetary policy on economic activity. As you all may know, my background is in banking\nand bank regulation, so my experience with and interest in understanding the transmission and\neffects of monetary policy stems from my responsibilities as a Member of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\nTurning to the discussion, I will begin with a few comments and suggestions on the paper\nand then focus on how monetary policy and other factors influenced U.S. economic performance\nduring the tightening cycle that started in March 2022. I will then conclude with some thoughts\non the relevance of the results in the paper for monetary policy going forward.\nComments and Suggestions on “Monetary Policy Transmission to Real Activity”\nThe paper’s stated purpose is to estimate how monetary policy shocks affect gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and employment through the use of a range of models. The evidence is\ngenerally similar to previous studies, supporting the broader principle that monetary policy\nexerts its effects with long lags and has a limited contribution to changes in real activity when\nthe shock is small and not very persistent. We should keep in mind, however, that many other\nshocks hit the economy and that at times it may be hard to see the effects of monetary policy\nactions estimated in the paper as they work through the actual economy.\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee. I would like to thank Eugenio Pinto and Michele Cavallo for their\nassistance in preparing these remarks.\n- 2 -\nThe paper notes that a 1 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate that retraces\ngradually, taking five to six quarters to reach half of its initial size, has persistent negative effects\non GDP and employment. At maximum, this shock lowers GDP by 0.4 percent in about\n18 months and employment by 0.3 percent in about two years, on average across the models\nconsidered in the paper. However, there is a wide range of estimated responses, as they depend\non each model specification and the data used. The most sensitive components of GDP are\nresidential investment, business fixed investment, and durable goods consumption, which is\nconsistent with employment in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries\nbeing highly interest-rate sensitive.\nThe paper analyzes the transmission of monetary policy to real activity, but it would have\nbeen very interesting to go one step further and also see the effects of monetary policy on\ninflation. This is especially relevant because the FOMC has been focused on bringing inflation\ndown to its 2 percent target over the past few years. Of course, higher interest rates lower\ninflation by dampening aggregate demand and real activity, thereby removing pressure on\nresource utilization, wages, and prices.\nThe authors use several models to analyze the transmission of monetary policy. They use\ntwo well-known structural models created by Federal Reserve Board staff that have been used in\nTealbook, the FRB/US and EDO models, in addition to two reduced-form VAR models, the New\nYork Fed Bayesian VAR model and a simple four-variable proxy VAR model. It is reassuring\nthat the estimated responses to a federal funds rate shock in the two models that I am most\nfamiliar with, the Board FRB/US and EDO models, seem consistent with previous findings.2\n2 See Brayton et al. (2014) and Chung et al. (2010).\n- 3 -\nOne small issue is that neither of the VAR models directly includes the federal funds rate.\nThe authors acknowledge this limitation in the analysis and address it by roughly estimating that\na 100-basis points shock to the policy rate boosts the 1-year and 2-year Treasury yields by 45\nand 40 basis points, respectively. This approach may have resulted in the implied monetary\npolicy shock in the two VAR models looking more persistent than in the two structural models. I\nwould suggest the authors take another look at this aspect of their exercise, so that the contours\nof the monetary policy shocks look more similar across the different models.\nAn alternative approach would have been to take the 1- and 2-year averages of the federal\nfunds rate from the FRB/US and EDO impulse responses and possibly add a small term\npremium. This approach would have suggested larger effects of the federal funds rate shock on\nthe 1- and 2-year Treasury yields than estimated by the authors. Another approach, especially in\nthe proxy VAR setting, would have been to use a measure of the shadow federal funds rate,\nwhich provides a gauge of the overall monetary policy stance and is not constrained by the zero\nlower bound.3\nThe paper focused on the effect of changes in the policy rate, but an important channel\nfor the transmission of monetary policy is how it affects private interest rates that are relevant for\nhouseholds and businesses consumption and investment decisions. Private rates include interest\nrates charged on outstanding credit card balances, rates on auto and other durable goods loans,\nmortgage rates, and corporate bond yields. Although credit card rates move closely in line with\nthe policy rate and include a time-varying spread that depends on the default risk profile of the\nborrower, longer-term private fixed rates on mortgages and corporate bonds depend on the\nexpected path of the federal funds rate, the term premium embedded in longer-term Treasury\n3 The estimated measure of the shadow federal funds rate is based on the work by Wu and Xia (2016).\n- 4 -\nyields, and risk spreads relative to Treasury securities of comparable maturity. Accordingly,\nmonetary policy tools other than the policy rate, including forward guidance and the amount of\nsecurities holdings in the central bank’s balance sheet, are also important for the transmission of\nmonetary policy since they can more forcefully affect the expected path of the federal funds rate,\nterm premiums, and risk spreads.\nThe authors analyze the contribution of major aggregate demand components to the\noverall effect of a monetary policy shock on GDP. One minor issue is that not all the models\ntreat business investment equally. In particular, the EDO model includes inventory investment\nunder business investment, while all other models do not appear to do so. This difference may\ncontribute to the much larger initial reaction of business investment in the EDO model compared\nto the other models, as inventory investment reacts quickly to a shock in the federal funds rate.\nI would like to offer one last comment on the relatively small effect of monetary policy\non real activity. Although I do not disagree with the authors’ assessment, I think that the\nestimated effects can cumulate to be quite sizable even for the transient unexpected shock\nconsidered. The FOMC quickly raised interest rates to fight surging inflation between March\n2022 and July 2023 by a cumulative 5-1/4 percentage points. According to the average impulse\nresponses, a shock of this magnitude would lead to declines of about 2 percent on the level of\nreal GDP and 1.5 percent on the level of employment, which would translate into a similarly\nlarge increase in the unemployment rate if those who lost their jobs mostly remained in the labor\nforce. This seems to suggest the potential for fairly large effects on real activity, especially when\nthe monetary policy shock has more persistent effects on the policy rate and results in larger\nincreases in term premiums and risk spreads.\n- 5 -\nThe Recent Tightening Cycle\nThe FOMC started raising the federal funds rate in March 2022 to combat rising\ninflation. Although the initial rate hike was a mere 1/4 percentage point, the pace of tightening\nwas faster over the remainder of the year, with an overall increase of more than 4 percentage\npoints in the policy rate by the end of 2022. Rate hikes continued in smaller 1/4 percentage point\nsteps the following year, adding to 1 additional percentage point increase by July 2023. As the\nauthors note in the paper, the rapid pace of monetary policy tightening was somewhat surprising,\nespecially as the FOMC was initially slow to react to signs that the rise in inflation during 2021\nwas not merely transitory and required more aggressive action.\nAs financial conditions tightened rapidly and the yield curve inverted in 2022, fears of an\nimpending recession started to rise, with Federal Reserve Board staff mentioning downside risks\nto real activity and that a mild recession seemed equally likely to the baseline Tealbook\nprojection for sluggish economic growth over the next year.4\n The staff eventually predicted a\nmild recession in the Tealbook forecast after the bank failures and banking system stress in the\nspring of 2023.5\n Such recession was widely predicted and, in hindsight, it never materialized.\nAs you well know, the yield curve inversion has not been the only predictor of recessions that\nhas failed in recent years.\nOn a Q4-over-Q4 basis, GDP growth slowed considerably in 2022 to a modest pace of\nonly 1.3 percent. The components of GDP that exerted the most drag on growth that year were\nresidential investment, goods consumption, and inventory investment, subtracting a total of\n1-1/2 percentage points from real GDP growth in 2022.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System FOMC Minutes (November 2022).\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System FOMC Minutes (March 2023).\n- 6 -\nResidential investment weakened rather quickly and fell more than 16 percent in 2022.\nThe sharp decline in this category seems largely explained by higher mortgage rates, which\nsurged more than 3 percentage points over the course of the year as the FOMC aggressively\ntightened monetary policy. In addition to higher interest rates, the 1-1/2 percent drop in goods\nconsumption in 2022 likely reflected the imprint of higher inflation on real disposable income\nand the unwinding of previous fiscal stimulus.\nSomewhat at odds with the empirical results in the paper, business fixed investment\ncontinued to rise appreciably as special factors led to a delayed response to the rise in interest\nrates. A broader measure of business investment that includes inventories did show a slowdown\nin growth, but even this broad measure continued to rise appreciably in 2022. Business fixed\ninvestment was likely supported by construction of new microchip and battery plants, the\ncontinued boost to software investment following the switch to remote work, and a rebound in\nnonresidential structures and transportation equipment investment after their protracted decline\nover the pandemic.\nPayroll employment increased strongly in 2022 as labor force participation rose, the\nunemployment rate declined, and the labor market tightened considerably. Payroll employment\nmoved back up to its pre-pandemic level and approached its trend as social distancing receded.\nThe recovery dynamics in employment largely masked any effects from rising interest rates in\n2022. The effect from higher interest rates on employment also tends to lag and be more\npersistent than the effect on GDP, so any effects likely showed up in 2023, an outcome that is\nconsistent with the findings in the paper.\n- 7 -\nSome Reasons Why the Economy Outperformed\nThe economy outperformed in 2023 as widespread predictions of an impending recession\nnever materialized and instead growth picked up. From the point of view of the models in the\npaper, the stronger economy in 2023 also seems surprising, but this likely reflected other factors\nthat influenced the economy and that are not accounted for in the model simulations.\nDespite significant tightening in broad financial conditions in 2023, GDP growth\nstrengthened notably as fiscal policy turned from a drag into a meaningful boost to growth and\npotential output accelerated further due to increased immigration and strong productivity growth.\nThese favorable supply developments allowed for stronger economic activity along with easing\nof inflationary pressures. Although growth surprised to the upside in 2023, labor market\ntightness eased with the unemployment rate edging up over the year and payroll employment\ngrowth slowing markedly.\nFaster GDP growth in 2023 was driven by a rebound in goods consumption, some\nrecovery in residential investment, and stronger government spending. Goods consumption was\nboosted by strong gains in real compensation and personal income, including from declining\ninflation. Despite continued drag from higher mortgage rates, residential investment started\nrecovering in 2023 as other factors supported demand. In particular, the labor market remained\nstrong and household balance sheets were still healthy. The sharp rise in mortgage rates also\ncreated a lock-in effect that increased demand for new housing and construction activity.\nThe marked deceleration in employment in 2023 seems consistent with the longer lags in\nthe response of employment to the rise in interest rates relative to that of GDP, especially as a\nsignificant portion of employment gains reflected increased labor supply from immigration,\nwhich allowed the labor market to come into better balance. Also consistent with the paper\n- 8 -\nresults, employment gains in the construction and durable goods manufacturing industries were\nmore noticeably below their 2015-2019 trends than employment gains for the aggregate\neconomy.\nAs the authors argue, another reason why real activity was more resilient in the face of\nhigher interest rates may have been the healthy balance sheets of households and businesses at\nthe start of the tightening cycle. Households had accumulated excess savings during the\npandemic, reflecting both increased fiscal stimulus and reduced consumption due to social\ndistancing and supply bottlenecks.6\n In fact, data from the Financial Accounts of the U.S. indicate\nthat in the two years between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021, household bank deposits rose\nby nearly $4 trillion.7\nIn addition, many households and nonfinancial businesses were able to refinance their\nmortgages and corporate bonds at very low rates during the pandemic. Although higher interest\nrates likely held back additional consumption expenditures and investment spending, they had\nless of an effect on households’ and nonfinancial businesses’ net cash flows as the average\ninterest rates on household mortgages and business debt remained low.8\nWith historically low borrowing costs during the pandemic era, mortgage originations\nand refinancing activity reached very high levels. As a result, the share of outstanding\nmortgages with an interest rate below 4 percent increased to nearly 70 percent by 2022 and it\nremains well above pre-pandemic levels today. Similarly, nonfinancial businesses issued record\namounts of corporate bonds and extended the maturity of their debt to avoid new debt issuance\n6 See Aladangady et al. (2022).\n7 See Castro et al. (2022).\n8 The effectiveness of monetary policy can be substantially reduced both during a long period of low interest rates\nand for a long period after interest rates renormalize. See Eichenbaum et al. (2022) for the mortgage refinancing\nchannel and Fabiani et al. (2024) and Jungherr et al. (2024) for the corporate debt maturity channel.\n- 9 -\nearlier in the subsequent rate hiking cycle. Between 2020 and 2021, the fraction of triple-B\ncorporate bonds maturing within three years fell to its lowest levels in nearly 20 years.\nFiscal policy also reentered expansionary territory in 2023, with above-trend stimulus\npartly driven by strong state and local government spending. Although the unwinding of\nCOVID-19 fiscal support continued in 2023, the federal budget deficit turned back up and rose to\nnear 6 percent of GDP, while the primary deficit inched up towards 4 percent of GDP. These\ndeficit levels are unusual for an expansion, especially as fiscal policy seems to have contributed\nto the degree of tightness in the economy.\nOne way to describe the resiliency of real activity to higher interest rates during the\nrecent tightening cycle is to say that some of the previously noted factors led to a rise in r-star.\nHigher population growth, from the influx of new immigrants, and higher productivity growth,\narguably from the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence and the surge in new\nbusiness formations, especially in high-tech industries, have likely boosted investment demand.\nIn addition, the lack of significant fiscal consolidation has also increased demand for savings.\nAn economy with stronger investment demand and very little household savings likely requires a\nhigher equilibrium interest rate relative to pre-pandemic norms.\nRelevance of Results for Monetary Policy Going Forward\nThe U.S. economy has been experiencing major shocks and structural changes since the\npandemic, which may have influenced or masked the transmission of monetary policy to real\nactivity. It is, therefore, not straightforward to see how the impulse responses shown in this\npaper have translated in practice. And, as the paper acknowledges, a large portion of the\nfluctuations in real activity are driven by shocks other than those to monetary policy. Although\nthe FOMC has been focused on lowering inflation in the past few years, as we continue to make\n- 10 -\nprogress on approaching our 2 percent target, I expect that the labor market and economic\nactivity will become a larger factor in the FOMC’s policy discussions. Accordingly, the stylized\nresults on real activity effects in the paper will prove especially useful going forward.\nConclusion\nI will conclude by saying that I enjoyed the paper, and that I appreciate the opportunity to\nbe here to share my views on this topic. I look forward to the discussion and to hearing feedback\nfrom other participants and the perspective of my FOMC colleague and fellow discussant. "

    "text": "Good morning. I want to thank the American Bankers Association for inviting me to speak to you today. Two years ago, I gave my first speech as a Federal Reserve governor at this conference in San Diego, and it is always great to be with you—even if remotely from our recording studio at the Board.\n\nIt's fair to say that a lot has happened over the past two years. It is an understatement to say that the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges inside and outside the banking sector. Bankers significantly adapted operations to continue serving their communities and customers. You overcame staffing challenges and other hurdles, kept the virtual doors open, worked with your customers, and provided assistance to workers and businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. Those efforts have made, and continue to make, a huge difference in the lives of many people affected by the pandemic, and I thank you.\n\nSince becoming a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I have made it a priority to enhance the Federal Reserve's dialogue with community bankers. I have embarked on an effort to meet with the leaders of every community bank and regional bank supervised by the Federal Reserve. This valuable interaction helps build an understanding of issues affecting small and regional banks, support supervisory decision-making, and shape some of my perspective. It has also helped the Federal Reserve identify initiatives to support the vital role of community banks in serving the financial needs of communities.\n\nToday, I would like to share my approach to supervision and regulation, which has helped guide the Fed's efforts to improve oversight of community banks over the past few years and shaped our priorities for 2021 and beyond. In most cases, my points about banking regulation also apply to supervision. I will then focus on several Federal Reserve initiatives that are underway to support community banks during the pandemic and into the future.\n\nThe first principle is fundamental to regulation but sometimes bears repeating—regulation should always strike the right balance. For banking regulation, that means a balance between actions that promote safety and soundness and actions that promote an acceptable and manageable level of risk-taking. The challenge is doing neither too little to be effective to achieve the public benefit of government oversight, nor too much to prevent the regulated businesses from meeting their customers' needs. Some regulation is appropriate and necessary but striking the right balance means that at some point regulation can go too far and end up reducing the public's welfare. In recent years, the Federal Reserve and other agencies have made oversight more effective by better differentiating prudential regulation and supervision based on the asset size of banks, the complexity of their activities, and the related risks they pose to the financial system. This is especially important for community banks, most of which managed risks well before and during the 2008 financial crisis and have managed their risks well since. Achieving these principles also requires following consumer protection laws and regulations, including fair lending laws, to ensure fairness and broad access to credit and financial services that enable economic opportunity for individuals and communities.\n\nThe second principle is that the regulatory framework should be effective, but also efficient, and that means assessing the impact of the requirements. For the Federal Reserve, it means that we consider both a rule's benefit to safety and soundness and any potential negative effect, including limiting the availability of credit and services to the public, and the implications of compliance costs on banks. The wisdom in this approach is evident when considering the effect of a regulation on community banks and their role in providing financial services to their communities. Community banks have often been one of the few or only sources of credit and financial services to their customers. Their smaller operational scale relies on fewer staff to reach a more disbursed customer base with limited resources for compliance activities. Regulations should consider the potential impact on the availability of services in a community, as well as the costs to the bank of implementing a rule, particularly in more rural locations. It is necessary that a full and careful practical analysis of costs and benefits be a part of every rulemaking.\n\nThe third principle is that regulation and supervision should be consistent, transparent, and fair. Regulators are obligated by law to act in this manner, and it also makes good practical sense. These principles enhance safety and soundness and consumer compliance by making sure supervisory expectations are clear and that banks understand and respect the regulatory requirements. Supervisors should not and cannot be everywhere at every moment. But they should be available to provide clarification or answer questions when needed. A clear understanding of the rules and our expectations and a respect for the reasonable application of them is an effective approach to ensure effective compliance. By promoting respect and trust between regulators and the supervised institution, banks are more likely to communicate throughout the examination cycle to inform supervisors of changes they may be considering or challenges they may be facing and how best to resolve or approach them from a regulatory perspective.\n\nA final principle that flows from consistency, transparency, and fairness is that rules and supervisory judgments must have a legitimate prudential purpose, and in the majority of cases must not be solely punitive. The goal should be to encourage sound business practices and activities by supervised institutions. By clearly communicating our objectives, we build respect for the rules and make it more likely that any remedial actions against an institution will not be necessary because we encourage compliance through our supervisory approach. When a supervisory action or formal enforcement action is required to address violations at an institution, those actions should be framed in a way that seeks to promote safe, sound, and fair practices and not simply as punishment.\n\nThese principles that guide my approach to regulation and supervision are consistent with many of the major steps that the Federal Reserve has taken to improve community bank oversight since the implementation of the rules following the 2008 financial crisis. Some predate my arrival at the Fed, and some I have played a significant role in achieving. Most of these actions involve tailoring rules that treated community banks in the same way as larger, more complex institutions. For example, the Volcker rule was aimed at curbing proprietary trading by large banks, but it ended up creating significant compliance costs for community banks, which are not involved in this type of trading.\n\nMany of the most important improvements to the Federal Reserve's regulatory framework involve tailoring rules to fit to the size, business model, and risk profiles of community banks. For example, we raised the asset threshold for small banks to qualify for an 18-month exam cycle and similarly raised the threshold for small bank holding companies to be exempted from consolidated risk-based capital rules. The concept of tailoring is also expressed in our community bank supervisory framework, which has been updated to implement the Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program. The BETR program allows examiners to identify higher and lower risk activities and, in turn, streamline the examination process for lower risk community banks, thereby reducing burden. In fact, Federal Reserve examiners have tailored examinations by spending approximately 65 percent less time on low/moderate risk state member bank exams than they do on high-risk exams. We also implemented the community bank leverage ratio that allows institutions to opt out of risk-based capital requirements. The Federal Reserve and the other agencies also raised the threshold for when an appraisal is required for residential real estate loans and tailored safety-and-soundness examinations of community and regional state member banks to reflect the levels of risk present and minimize regulatory burden for banks.\n\nThese improvements in regulation and supervision have helped right the balance I spoke of earlier between safety and soundness and consumer protection, on the one hand, and the ability to provide financial services and best meet the needs of their customers. We have also considered the impact of our actions, seeking to revise rules that impose significant costs to community banks but provide limited benefit to safety and soundness, consumer protection, or financial stability.\n\nAs a part of this approach, I have also prioritized efforts to improve the consistency, transparency, and reasonableness of regulation and supervision. One of those efforts is promoting greater consistency in supervisory practices across the Federal Reserve System. For example, we are actively working to improve the timeliness of providing banks with consumer compliance exam findings. Further, we are exploring ways to strengthen our ability to understand, monitor, and analyze the risks that are affecting community banks. A key aspect of consistency is ensuring the same supervisory approach and outcomes for similarly situated institutions, with the goal of ensuring, for example, that a \"one\" composite or component rating in a particular region would be the same for an institution with similar activities and practices in another region. This applies to all areas of our supervisory responsibility, whether safety and soundness, consumer compliance, or analyses of financial stability risk.\n\nI'd like to expand on one important area of focus, which is essential to the future success of the community banking sector: accessible innovation and technology integration. This subject is one that I speak about frequently with stakeholders and our staff at the Board. We are committed to developing a range of tools that will create pathways for banks to develop and pursue potential partnerships with fintech companies. This includes clearer guidance on third-party risk management, a guide on sound due diligence practices, and a paper on fintech-community bank partnerships and related considerations. These tools will serve as a resource for banks looking to innovate through fintech partnerships.\n\nTechnological developments and financial market evolution are quickly escalating competition in the banking industry, and our approach to analyzing the competitive effects of mergers and acquisitions needs to keep pace. The Board's framework for banking antitrust analysis hasn't changed substantially over the past couple of decades. I believe we should consider revisions to that framework that would better reflect the competition that smaller banks face in an industry quickly being transformed by technology and non-bank financial companies. As part of this effort, we have engaged in conversations and received feedback from community banks about the Board's competitive analysis framework and its impact on their business strategies and long-term growth plans. We are in the process of reviewing our approach, and we are specifically considering the unique market dynamics faced by small community banks in rural and underserved areas.\n\nSoon after the pandemic began early last year, the Federal Reserve took several actions to support community banks and their ability to help affected customers. We paused examinations and issued supervisory guidance that made it clear that we would not criticize or take public enforcement actions against a bank that was taking prudent steps to help customers and making good faith efforts to comply with regulations. This certainty of regulatory treatment created an environment that built trust between regulators and bankers. It enabled banks to continue to meet the needs of their customers who were struggling with circumstances through no fault of their own.\n\nLet me conclude by again commending the important role that community banks have played in providing financial services during these challenging times. You responded quickly to the needs of your customers and communities to provide financial services with limited, if any, interruption. You persevered to implement the largest proportion of Paycheck Protection Program funds to small businesses, whether they were your existing customers or new customers. These relationships are the hallmark of community banking, and as we look toward the future, community banks will continue to play an essential role in supporting customers, delivering financial services, and providing resources to their communities and customers.\n\nLet me stop here and thank the organizers for another opportunity to speak to you at this important conference. I look forward to your questions, Rob."

    "text": "Let me begin by saying my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the passengers\nand crew who perished in the tragic flight accident in Washington, D.C. Wednesday evening.\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today.1\n It is a pleasure to be with you\nvirtually for your CEO Summit. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet bankers from across the\ncountry, especially New England, to learn about the issues that are important to you. The\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, so\nI will begin by offering some brief remarks on the economy, and then share my views on a\nnumber of mutual and community bank issues, before addressing some questions that were\nsubmitted by your members in advance of today’s meeting.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nAt our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate\ntarget range at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities\nholdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the level of the policy rate towards\nthe end of last year to reflect the progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the\nlabor market, I think that policy is now in a good place to position the Committee to pay closer\nattention to the inflation data as it evolves.\nLooking ahead to 2025, in my view, the current policy stance also provides the\nopportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get clarity on the\nadministration’s policies and their effects on the economy. It will be very important to have a\nbetter sense of the actual policies and how they will be implemented, in addition to greater\nconfidence about how the economy will respond.\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- 2 -\nBrief Remarks on the Economy\nThe U.S. economy remained strong through the end of last year, with solid growth in\neconomic activity and a labor market near full employment. Core inflation remains elevated, but\nmy expectation is that it will moderate further this year. Even with this outlook, I continue to see\nupside risks to inflation.\nThe rate of inflation declined significantly in 2023, but it slowed by noticeably less last\nyear. Without having seen the December data released this morning, I estimate that the 12-\nmonth measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation—which excludes food and\nenergy prices—likely remained unchanged at 2.8 percent in December, only slightly below its\n3.0 percent reading at the end of 2023. Progress has been slow and uneven since the spring of\nlast year mostly due to a slowing in core goods price declines.\nAfter increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the initial three quarters of last year,\ngross domestic product appears to have risen a bit more slowly in the fourth quarter, reflecting a\nlarge drop in inventory investment, which is a volatile category. In contrast, private domestic\nfinal purchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity,\nmaintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly\nagain in the fourth quarter.\nSome measures of consumer sentiment appear to have improved recently but are still well\nbelow pre-pandemic levels, likely because of higher prices. And since housing, food, and energy\nprice increases have far outpaced overall inflation since the pandemic, lower-income households\nhave experienced the negative impacts of inflation hardest, especially as these households have\nlimited options to trade down for lower-cost goods and services.\n- 3 -\nPayroll employment gains rebounded strongly in December and averaged about 170,000\nper month in the fourth quarter, a pace that is somewhat above average gains in the prior two\nquarters. The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.1 percent in December and has moved\nsideways since last June, remaining slightly below my estimate of full employment.\nThe labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after having\nloosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023\nlargely reflected weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking\nlonger to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed\nworkers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more\navailable jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight,\nbut wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nI hope the revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data, which will be released\nnext week, will more accurately capture the changing dynamics of immigration and net business\ncreation and bring more clarity on the underlying pace of job growth. It is crucial that U.S.\nofficial data accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, such as those in\nrecent years, so we can more confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic\npolicymaking. In the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges,\nand significant data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of\nreal-time data releases.\nAssuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this\nyear. Its progress may be bumpy and uneven, and the upcoming inflation data for the first\nquarter will be an important indication of how quickly this will happen. That said, I continue to\n- 4 -\nsee greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains near full\nemployment.\nDespite the prospect for some reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,\nEastern Europe, and Asia, global supply chains continue to be susceptible to disruptions, which\ncould result in inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. In addition,\nthe release of pent-up demand following the election, especially with improving consumer and\nbusiness sentiment, could lead to stronger economic activity, which could increase inflationary\npressures.\nThe Path Forward\nAs we enter a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more\nneutral policy stance, I would prefer that future adjustments to the policy rate be gradual.\nWe should take time to carefully assess the progress in achieving our inflation and employment\ngoals and consider changes to the policy rate based on how the data evolves.\nGiven the current stance of policy, I continue to be concerned that easier financial\nconditions over the past year may have contributed to the lack of further progress on slowing\ninflation. In light of the ongoing strength in the economy and with equity prices substantially\nhigher than a year ago, it seems unlikely that the overall level of interest rates and borrowing\ncosts are exerting meaningful restraint.\nI am also closely watching the increase in longer-term Treasury yields since we started\nthe recalibration of our policy stance at the September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a\nreflection of investors’ concerns about the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be\nrequired to address inflationary pressures. In light of these considerations, I continue to prefer a\ncautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy.\n- 5 -\nThere is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal.\nI would like to see progress in lowering inflation resume before we make further adjustments to\nthe target range. We need to keep inflation in focus while the labor market appears to be in\nbalance and the unemployment rate continues to be at historically low levels. By the time of our\nMarch meeting, we will have received two inflation and two employment reports. I look forward\nto reviewing the first quarter inflation data, which, as I noted earlier, will be key to\nunderstanding the path of inflation going forward. I do expect that inflation will begin to decline\nagain and that by year-end it will be lower than where it now stands.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.\nAt each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming\ndata and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals\nof maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of\ncontacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy\nlabor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\nPerspective on Mutual and Community Banks\nTurning to banking, I will start with a brief discussion of the important role of mutual\nbanks in the banking system before addressing other bank regulatory issues. One of the unique\ncharacteristics of the U.S. banking system is the broad scope of institutions it includes and the\nwide range of customers and communities it serves. Given this institutional diversity, regulators\nmust strive to foster a financial system that enables each and every bank, no matter its size, to\nthrive, supporting a vibrant economy and financial system.\n- 6 -\nMutual Bank Issues\nIn the Northeast, everyone is familiar with mutual banks given their significant presence\nin this region. Since the early 1800s, these banks have been dedicated to serving their local\ncommunities.2\n Their ownership structure differs from traditional banks in that mutuals are\nowned by their depositors, rather than by shareholders. Like other community banks, they focus\non local issues that are important to their communities and to their depositors.\nMany of the challenges mutual banks face are similar to those faced by other financial\ninstitutions, including competition from other banks, credit unions, and non-banks. But mutual\nbanks also face unique issues that can add cost and expense to their operations. Two issues I\nwould like to discuss are the challenges mutual institutions face raising capital, and unique\nprocedural hurdles mutuals face in managing the dividend process. While these issues are\nunique to mutuals, both highlight the challenges of a lack of transparency, and insufficient focus\non efficiency.3\n\nJust as with other community banks, a challenge for many mutuals is the difficulty of\nraising additional capital. This difficulty is exacerbated by their ownership structure, which\ntypically requires mutuals to rely heavily on retained earnings. Although mutual institutions\nhave historically been more highly capitalized relative to their stock-owned peers, if a mutual\ncapital raise is needed, it would be helpful to provide some regulatory flexibility in the process.\nRecently, some mutuals have issued subordinated debt as a form of capital, but another form of\nregulatory capital may be preferable: mutual capital certificates.\n2\n The first mutual banks in the United States were chartered in 1816. The Provident Institution for Savings and the\nPhiladelphia Savings Fund Society were both chartered that year. See https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123609;\nhttps://www.mass.gov/info-details/history-of-the-division-of-banks.\n3\n Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on 2024: Monetary Policy, Economic Performance, and Lessons for Banking\nRegulation” (speech at the California Bankers Association 2025 Bank Presidents Seminar, Laguna Beach,\nCalifornia, January 9, 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250109a.htm\n- 7 -\nTo date, it has been unclear whether mutual capital certificates qualify as regulatory\ncapital. These instruments could provide mutual banks an additional way to raise capital without\ndisrupting their mutual structure. In my view, the banking agencies should be receptive to these\nkinds of instruments to ensure that mutual banks can both raise capital and maintain their\ndepositor-owned structure. Mutuals need clarity and transparency about the regulatory treatment\nof these instruments and whether they qualify as regulatory capital.\nAnother concern for mutuals is the annual requirement to receive regulatory approval for\na mutual holding company’s waiver of a dividend issued by its subsidiary bank.4\n The Board\npractice is to require a mutual holding company to submit an application each year to implement\na waiver. This prior approval requirement is complex and imposes significant costs on these\nsmall institutions, reducing the investment they can make in their communities. Because of the\ntime and expense of these waiver requirements, it is possible that the inefficiencies of the\nrequired application process erode the value of a mutual holding company structure, which\nwould further constrain a mutual bank’s ability to raise capital.\nSince the Board has nearly 20 years of experience considering these waiver requests, it\nseems appropriate to consider whether the applications process for these waivers is efficient.\nWhat lessons have we learned? Is the prior approval requirement effective in its review of\nholding companies waiving receipt of their dividends, or can this be resolved in a more efficient\nand cost effective manner? In my view, the Board should consider whether this process is\neffective and efficient in addressing concerns related to dividend waivers.\nMutual banks, like all community banks, are vital to the economic success of their\ncommunities. It is critical that our applications process not act as a limit on a particular type of\n4\n 12 CFR § 239.8(d).\n- 8 -\ninstitution simply due to regulatory inaction or lack of clarity and transparency. Regulators must\nfind efficient and effective ways to support a vibrant and diverse banking system that enables\nthese and other small institutions to thrive while supporting and investing in their local economy.\nTailoring\nTransparency and efficiency are just two of the necessary components of a regulatory\napproach that promotes a healthy and vibrant banking system. Another component that I speak\nabout frequently is the use of “tailoring” in the regulatory framework. For those familiar with\nmy philosophy on bank regulation and supervision, my interest and focus on tailoring will come\nas no surprise.5\n In its most basic form, it is difficult to disagree with the virtue of regulatory and\nsupervisory tailoring—calibrating the requirements and expectations imposed on a firm based on\nits size, business model, risk profile, and complexity—as a reasonable, appropriate and\nresponsible approach for bank regulation and supervision. In fact, tailoring is embedded in the\nstatutory fabric of the Federal Reserve’s bank regulatory responsibilities.6\nThe bank regulatory framework inherently includes significant costs—both the cost of\noperating the banking agencies, and the cost to the banking industry of complying with\nregulations, the examination process, and supplying information to regulators both through\nformal information collections and through one-off requests. In the aggregate, these costs can\nultimately affect the price and availability of credit, geographic access to banking services, and\nthe broader economy. The cost of this framework—both to regulators and to the industry—\nreflects layers of policy decisions over many years. But this framework could be more effective\n5\n See, e.g., Michelle W. Bowman, “Tailoring, Fidelity to the Rule of Law, and Unintended Consequences” (speech\nat the Harvard Law School Faculty Club, Cambridge, Massachusetts, March 5, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240305a.pdf.\n6\n See, Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, § 401(a)(1)\n(amending 12 U.S.C. § 5365), 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n- 9 -\nin balancing the mandate to promote safety and soundness with the need to have a banking\nsystem that promotes economic growth.\nFor example, let’s consider costs. As regulatory and supervisory demands grow, there is\noften parallel growth in the staff and budgets of the banking agencies. We should not only be\ncognizant of these costs, but we should act in a way that requires efficiency while ensuring safety\nand soundness. Some degree of elasticity in regulator capacity is necessary to respond to\nevolving economic and banking conditions, as well as emerging risks, but there must be\nreasonable constraints on growth. Expansion of the regulatory framework is not a cost-free\nendeavor, and the costs are shouldered by taxpayers, banks, and, ultimately, bank customers.\nThe bank regulatory framework has great potential to provide significant benefits,\nincluding supporting an innovative banking system that enhances trust and confidence in our\ninstitutions, and promotes safety and soundness. When we consider the benefits and the costs,\nwe can institute greater efficiencies in both banking regulation and in the banking industry itself.\nThe bank regulatory framework is complex, and the various elements of this framework are\nintended to work in a complementary way. As banks evolve—by growing larger, or by engaging\nin new activities—tailoring can help us to quickly recalibrate requirements in light of the new\nrisks posed by the firm.\nBut the regulatory framework, especially how supervisors prioritize its application to the\nbanking industry, can pose a serious threat to a bank’s viability. For example, imposing the\nsame regulatory requirements on banks with assets of $2 billion to $2 trillion under the new rules\nimplementing the Community Reinvestment Act demonstrated a missed opportunity to promote\n- 10 -\ngreater effectiveness and efficiency.7\n I question the wisdom of applying the same evaluation\nstandards to banks within such a broad range.\nLikewise, supervisory guidance can provide fertile ground to differentiate supervisory\nexpectations under a more tailored approach. While supervisory guidance is not binding on\nbanks as a legal matter, it can signal how regulators think about particular risks and activities,\nand often drives community banks to reallocate resources in a way that may not be necessary or\nappropriate. The Fed’s guidance on third-party risk management is an example of this.\nOriginally, this guidance was published in a way that applied to all banks, including community\nbanks. Yet, it was acknowledged even at the time of publication that it had known shortcomings,\nparticularly in terms of its administration and lack of clarity for community banks.8\n\nTailoring is important for all banks, but it is particularly important for community banks.\nThere are real costs not only to banks, but to communities, when the framework is insufficiently\ntailored, as community banks faced with excessive regulatory burdens may be forced to raise\nprices or shut their doors completely. These banks often reach unbanked or underbanked corners\nof the U.S. economy, not only in terms of the customers they serve but also in terms of their\ngeographic footprint. We are all familiar with banking deserts and the challenges many\nlegitimate and law-abiding businesses and consumers have in accessing basic banking services\nand credit. It is difficult to imagine that a system with far fewer banks would as effectively serve\nU.S. banking and credit needs and sufficiently to support economic growth.\n7\n See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, October 24, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowmanstatement-20231024.htm.\n8\n See “Statement on Third Party Risk Management Guidance by Governor Michelle W. Bowman,” news release,\nJune 6, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230606.htm.\n- 11 -\nIt is imperative that we keep the benefits of tailoring in focus as the bank regulatory\nframework evolves. A tailored regulatory and supervisory approach can help inform our policies\non a wide range of industry issues that are likely to emerge in the coming years.\nProblem-Based Solutions\nOne of the most difficult challenges on the regulatory front is prioritization, both for\nbanks managing their businesses and for regulators deciding how to fulfill their responsibilities.\nAt a basic level, the role of regulators is dictated by statute. Congress granted the Federal\nReserve and other banking agencies broad statutory powers but has constrained how those\npowers may be directed through the use of statutory mandates, including to promote a safe and\nsound banking system, and broader U.S. financial stability. In the execution of these\nresponsibilities, the Federal Reserve must also balance the need to act in a way that enables the\nbanking system to serve the U.S. economy and promote economic growth. While these\nobjectives are not incompatible, they do require us to consider tradeoffs when establishing\npolicy.\nHow can regulators best meet these responsibilities? As many of you may already know,\nI strongly believe in a pragmatic approach to policymaking.9\n This requires us to identify the\nproblem we are trying to solve, determine whether we are the appropriate regulator to address the\nproblem based on our statutory mandates and authorities, and explore options for addressing the\nidentified issue.\nAs a first step, we must be attuned to the banking system and how regulatory actions\naffect that system. We oversee a wide range of banks of varying sizes, activities, affiliates, and\n9\n Michelle W. Bowman, “Approaching Policymaking Pragmatically” (remarks to the Forum Club of the Palm\nBeaches, West Palm Beach, Florida, November 20, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241120a.pdf.\n- 12 -\ncomplexity. These banks interact with a range of service providers, financial market utilities,\npayments providers, and non-bank partners, regularly competing with non-bank financial\nintermediaries. The banking system can be a key driver of business formation, economic\nexpansion, and opportunity.\nAs we look at the banking system, including the regulatory framework, we must focus on\nthose issues that are most important to advancing statutory priorities. There is always the risk of\nmisidentification and mis-prioritization, and that we fail to take appropriately robust action on\nkey issues or focus on issues that are less material to a bank’s safety and soundness. Our goal\nshould be to develop a better filter to promote appropriate and effective prioritization.\nFraud\nWe have seen several instances where this filter did not produce appropriate results, as\nwe have recently seen with fraud. The incidence of fraud, particularly check fraud, has been\nrising substantially over the past few years, causing harm to banks, damaging the perceived\nsafety of the banking system, and importantly hurting consumers who are the victims of\nfraudulent activity. Sometimes these efforts target vulnerable populations, like the elderly, who\nare particularly susceptible to certain forms of fraud.\nDespite this known problem, efforts by regulators have been frustratingly slow to\nadvance, and seem to have done little to address the underlying root causes of this increase in\nfraud. Why has this important issue failed to garner greater attention from all of the appropriate\nregulatory and law enforcement bodies? Different governmental agencies may share an\nimportant role in addressing this problem, but the need for a joint and coordinated solution does\nnot excuse collective inaction.\n- 13 -\nClimate-Related Financial Risk\nOf course, not every issue falls within the scope of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities.\nEven when policymakers identify an issue or priority that they would like to pursue, it is\nimperative to ask whether that priority falls within the scope of our mandate and authorities.\nStatutes and regulations, paired with the “soft” power of examination, can be deployed in ways\nthat may not be primarily directed towards the priorities mandated for banking regulators. I’ve\nnoted previously that the banking agencies’ climate-related financial risk guidance arguably\npushes the boundaries of appropriate regulatory responsibilities. Banks have long been required\nto manage all material risks, including weather- and climate-related risks. And while this\nadditional guidance seemed to do little to advance the goals of promoting the safe and sound\noperation of banks it, in effect, posed significant risks of influencing credit allocation decisions.\nUltimately, banking regulators should not dictate credit allocation decisions, either by rule or\nthrough supervision. Bank regulatory policy should be used to address the needs of the\nunbanked and expand the availability of banking services. It should not be used to limit or\nexclude access to banking services for legitimate customers and businesses in a way that is\nmeant to further unrelated policy goals, sometimes referred to as “de-banking.”\nOnce we have identified problems and determined that they are within the Fed’s\nresponsibility, we must consider alternative approaches to address them, focusing on identifying\nefficient solutions. New technologies and services often require novel regulatory and\nsupervisory approaches, and we recognize that past approaches may not be effective. Often\nregulators take a “more is better” approach to regulation and guidance. Over the past several\nyears, the banking industry has faced an onslaught of proposed and final regulations and\nguidance, materials that require a significant time commitment to review, to comment on, and to\n- 14 -\nimplement. Many times, these require changes to policies and procedures or risk management\npractices.\nIt is critical that in our urgency to address issues in the banking system—particularly for\ncommunity banks—that we consider not just the direct and indirect effects of regulatory action\nbut also this cumulative burden. Community banks are resilient and dedicated to serving their\ncommunities, but at some point, the cumulative burden of the bank regulatory framework can\nadversely affect the availability and pricing of banking services and threaten the ongoing\nviability of the community bank model. The community banks in this country are important\neconomically and to their communities, and we should strive to support these institutions and\ntheir ongoing viability.\nOther Notable Issues and Concerns\nIn preparation for today’s event, conference attendees were asked to submit questions in\nadvance. So before concluding my remarks I’d like to address a few of these, since we won’t be\nable to do a live Q&A session in this virtual format. Thank you for submitting your questions in\nadvance.\nAs community bankers, we are deeply invested in supporting the growth and resilience of our\nlocal economies. With ongoing regulatory pressures, what specific actions can the Federal\nReserve take to ensure smaller institutions like ours remain competitive and capable of\ndelivering the personalized service that our communities depend on?\nOne of the things I think is critical in identifying how to support community banks is\nlistening to the industry—which issues are top-of-mind for you? Being an effective regulator\nrequires a degree of humility, and receptiveness to hearing about issues that affect the business of\nbanking, particularly when there are alternative ways that regulators can better promote safety\n- 15 -\nand soundness, or where regulatory actions have resulted in unintended consequences. At the\nsame time, during my conversations with banks, a few themes have emerged that deserve\nattention. This will be a non-exclusive list, but hopefully will give you a sense of the types of\nissues and concerns that I hear about most frequently when talking to community banks.\nFirst, I think there is room to improve the transparency of regulatory communication.\nBanks should not be left to guess what regulators think about the permissibility of particular\nactivities, or what parameters and rules should apply to those activities. Uncertainty discourages\ninvestments in innovation and the expansion of banking activities, products, and services, and\ncan call into question whether internal processes and procedures are consistent with supervisory\nexpectations. Banks already must confront the challenges of dealing with evolving economic\nand credit conditions, regulators should not compound these challenges through opaque\nexpectations and standards.\nSecond, I think we need to address shortcomings in the processing of banking\napplications, employing a more nimble and predictable approach specifically in the de novo\nformation and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) contexts. Today, the process to obtain\nregulatory approval can be influenced by many factors under a bank’s control—for example, the\ncompleteness of the application filed and responsiveness to addressing questions and providing\nnecessary additional information. However, the timeline for application decisions is often\nuncertain and beyond the bank’s control. This can be due to questions about the minimum\namount of capital needed and early-stage supervisory expectations (for a de novo bank), or\nuncertainty about the competitive effects of a transaction, or the filing of a public comment\nraising concerns about an application in the M&A context.\n- 16 -\nFinally, I think regulatory and supervisory “trickle-down” is real and it has significantly\nharmed community banks. I am referring to regulators conveying expectations to community\nbanks (for example, during the examination process) that lack a foundation in applicable rules or\nguidance, or that were designed for larger institutions, or based on a horizontal review of unique\nbanks.\nIt is very difficult to insulate community banks from the harmful consequences of\n“trickle-down,” and broader structural changes may be needed to shield them from inapplicable\nand unreasonable expectations. At the same time, we must preserve strong supervisory standards\nas banks cross asset thresholds, so banks that grow larger and riskier are subject to appropriately\ntailored and calibrated requirements and expectations. I would also note that some degree of\n“trickle down” has occurred over time because the regulatory asset “line” defining community\nbanks has remained constant at $10 billion in assets for over a decade. During that time, the\neconomy has grown significantly, and inflation has rendered this asset definition obsolete. Many\n“community banks”—as defined by business model and activities rather than asset size—now\nexceed the threshold and must comply with broader regulatory requirements that may be\nexcessive.\nWhat support or guidance can community banks expect from the Federal Reserve as we\nnavigate technological innovation and increased cybersecurity threats?\nBoth innovation and cybersecurity are issues that are top of mind for me. Innovation has\nalways been a priority for banks of all sizes and business models. Banks in the U.S. have a long\nhistory of developing and implementing new technologies, and innovation has the potential to\nmake the banking and payments systems faster and more efficient, to bring new products and\nservices to customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness.\n- 17 -\nRegulators must be open to innovation in the banking system. Our goal should be to\nbuild and support a clear and sensible regulatory framework that anticipates ongoing and\nevolving innovation—one that allows the private sector to innovate while also maintaining\nappropriate safeguards. We must promote innovation through transparency and open\ncommunication, including demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development\nprocess. By providing clarity and consistency, we can encourage long-term business investment,\nwhile also continuing to support today’s products and services. A clear regulatory framework\nwould also empower supervisors to focus on safety and soundness, while ensuring a safe and\nefficient banking and payment system.\nOn cybersecurity, banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as\nareas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and\nbusiness email compromises, are costly in terms of expense and reputation, and are timeconsuming events that pose unique challenges for community banks.\nThe maintenance of cyber assets and technology resources required to support a\nsuccessful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote\ncybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident “resilience” and response capabilities by identifying\nresources and opportunities, such as exercises, for banks to develop “muscle memory” in cyber\nincident response.\nThe Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk\nmanagement practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop,\nwith the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.10 Over the past couple\n10 See Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity, “Midwest Cyber Workshop 2024,” June 25-26, 2024, https://www.chicagofed.org/events/2024/midwest-cyberworkshop.\n- 18 -\nof years, this workshop has provided a forum to discuss cyber risk among community bankers,\nregulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Community banks can also turn to\nthe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the\nFFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources.\nWe know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system, and we recognize\nthat community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to\ncyber threats. Regulators should, therefore, ensure that a range of resources are available to\nsupport banks and seek further opportunities to help build bank resilience against these threats.\nCommunity banks are integral to rural and underserved communities. How can the Federal\nReserve support us in maintaining our presence in these areas, particularly amid ongoing\nconsolidation trends?\nAs I noted earlier, it is essential that the U.S. banking system is broad and diverse,\nincluding institutions of all sizes serving all the different markets across the country.\nCommunity banks play a particularly valuable role in rural and underserved communities, and\nwe need to ensure that the community banking model remains viable into the future.\nTo do that, we need to have a regulatory system in which both de novo bank formations\nand M&A transactions are possible. Viable formation and merger options for banks of all sizes\nare necessary to avoid creating a “barbell” of the very largest and very smallest banks in the\nbanking system, with the number of community banks continuing to erode over time.\nM&A ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the\nabsence of a viable M&A framework, there is potential for additional risks, including limited\nopportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities. Uncertainty\nrelated to the M&A process also may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation, as potential\n- 19 -\nbank founders may stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies—like the strategic\nacquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer—may face long odds of success.\nAnother challenge particularly in rural markets are the competitive “screens” that are\nused to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger. Using these screens often results\nin a finding that M&A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition\nand should therefore be disallowed.11 Even when these transactions are eventually approved, the\nmechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects often requires additional review or\nanalysis and can lead to extensive delays in the regulatory approval process. Reducing the\nefficiency of the bank M&A process can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions—it can\nreduce the effectiveness of M&A and de novo activity that preserves the presence of community\nbanks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and\nactually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale."

    "text": "It is a pleasure to join you today for my first public remarks as the Federal Reserve\nBoard’s Vice Chair for Supervision.\n1 Today, I will describe my approach to leading the Fed’s\nDivision of Supervision and Regulation in its vital work to promote the safe and sound operation\nof the U.S. banking system. I have spoken extensively in the past about my principles for\nsupervision and regulation, which will continue to guide my approach to supervision and the\nbank regulatory framework.2\nAt the core of these principles is pragmatism, which focuses on first identifying the\nproblem to be solved and then developing efficient solutions.3\n Once we have identified a need\nfor reform, or a problem to be solved, our next task is to conduct a careful analysis of the\nintended and unintended consequences of any proposed policy solution, and to consider\nalternative approaches that lead to lower cost or better outcomes.\nThe views I share with you today reflect my initial thoughts about how these principles\nshould be incorporated into the important work that will be required to improve supervision and\nregulation in the future, addressing: (i) enhancing supervision to more effectively and efficiently\nmeet the Fed’s safety and soundness goals; (ii) reviewing and reforming the capital framework to\nensure that it is appropriately designed and calibrated; (iii) reviewing regulations and\ninformation collections to ensure that this framework remains viable; and (iv) considering\napproaches to ensure the applications process is transparent, predictable, and fair.\nEnhancing Supervision\nSupervision focused on material financial risks that threaten a bank’s safety and\nsoundness is inherently more effective and efficient. We should be cautious about the temptation\nto overemphasize or become distracted by relatively less important procedural and\ndocumentation shortcomings. Fundamentally, as I’ve noted in the past, our goal should be to\n- 2 -\nprioritize the identification of material financial risks and encourage prompt action to mitigate\nrisks that threaten safety and soundness. There are a number of changes we can adopt in the near\nterm to better enable us to accomplish this goal:\nTailoring. Risks are not uniform, and each bank is unique based on its business model,\ncomplexity, and business profile. I am a long-time proponent of tailoring banking regulations.\nGoing forward we will extend the application of tailoring to our supervisory approach to\nfinancial institutions, not only among bank categories, but also within a particular category.\nIn the past, the Board has “pushed down” requirements developed for the largest firms to\nsmaller banks, often including regional and community banks. One approach that would\npreserve tailoring is to create an independent community bank supervisory and regulatory\nframework to clearly separate these banks from larger bank supervision and regulation. This\nwould serve to insulate these smaller banks from standards designed for larger and more\ncomplex firms. While I have no objection to a deliberate, intentional policy to apply similar\nstandards to firms with similar characteristics as conditions warrant, the gradual erosion of\ndistinct regulatory and supervisory standards among firms with very different characteristics—\nessentially the subtle reversal of tailoring over time—is not a reasonable approach for\nimplementing supervision and regulation.\nBoth regulators and legislators should consider whether the bank regulatory framework\nincludes appropriate thresholds for defining distinct categories of institutions, and whether\nsimple fixes—for example the indexing of thresholds to inflation or growth—could better ensure\na sound, tailored approach that remains durable over time. It is clear that the current $10 billion\nthreshold defining the upper bounds of a “community bank” leaves many institutions that pursue\n- 3 -\nthis business model—of community and relationship-based banking—subject to heightened\nrequirements more suitable for larger and more complex firms.\nTo further these objectives, later this year I will host a conference on small and\ncommunity bank issues, to discuss improving the bank regulatory framework to adopt a more\nefficient, tailored approach for these firms. We must demonstrate wisdom and courage by\ncarefully listening to those who are subject to regulatory oversight and considering ways to\nenhance our approaches to both supervision and regulation.\nOne issue that continues to present challenges to smaller banks is check fraud. The\nongoing increase in bank losses to this type of fraud can negatively impact the perceived safety\nof the banking system and result in significant consumer harm. Past efforts by regulators have\nbeen frustratingly slow to advance and seem to have done little to address the underlying root\ncauses of this increase in fraud. I will continue to work to identify specific actions that can be\ntaken to reduce the incidence of fraud, including through expediting the remediation process\nfrom check fraud after it occurs. I expect that the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the OCC\nand FDIC, will soon take action on this front.\nRatings. Ratings must reflect risk, and yet we have seen gradual changes in supervisory\napproaches that have eroded the link between ratings and financial condition.4 Federal Reserve\nsupervisory statistics show that that two-thirds of the largest financial institutions in the U.S.\nwere rated unsatisfactory in the first half of 2024.5 At the same time, the majority of these same\ninstitutions met all supervisory expectations for capital and liquidity.\nThis odd mismatch between financial condition and supervisory ratings requires careful\nreview and appropriate revisions to our current approach. Under the current large bank ratings\n- 4 -\nframework, a single component rating can result in a firm being considered not “well-managed,”\nwhich has driven the disparity between well-managed status and financial condition.\nThe Federal Reserve will soon begin to address this mismatch, by proposing changes to\nthe Large Financial Institution ratings framework. The proposed changes will be designed to\nresult in a more sensible approach to determining whether a firm is well-managed, no longer\ndisproportionately weighting a single framework component for a firm that has demonstrated\nresilience under a range of conditions and stresses.\nThis initial change should help address the gap between assessed ratings and material\nfinancial risk for those firms subject to this framework. We have an obligation to ensure that our\nsupervisory ratings are current, credible, and reflect material financial risk. This promotes\neffective supervision and ensures that firms are accurately rated based on their underlying\nfinancial strength, which should increase the public’s confidence in our assessment of the\nbanking system.\nWe must also consider the appropriateness of the broader ratings framework which\napplies to smaller institutions, including the CAMELS framework. Are these frameworks\nappropriately tailored to capture material financial risks, particularly for elements that rely on\nsubjective examiner judgment? While judgment is a legitimate and necessary tool in\nsupervision, it must always be grounded in the materiality of the identified issues as they relate\nto the financial health of each institution and the banking system as a whole. This has been a\nnotable shift in supervision not only for large banks, but also for regional and community banks.\nImproving prioritization. Examiners review a broad range of activities in the\nsupervisory process. A random sample of examination reports demonstrates that supervisory\nfocus has shifted away from core financial risks (credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk,\n- 5 -\nfor example), to process-related concerns. While process is important for effective management,\nthere is a risk that overemphasis on process and supervisory box-checking can be a distraction\nfrom the core purpose of supervision, which is to probe financial condition and financial risk.\nChecklists should not distract examiners from the central purpose of examinations.\nAnother tool that we will be reviewing with a critical lens is the use of horizontal\nreviews. In theory, horizontal reviews—where examiners conduct a narrow but deep review on a\nparticular topic across multiple banks—can help improve an examiner’s perspective. Horizontal\nreviews, when used effectively, can help supervisors better understand the range of industry\npractices.\nBut these reviews have quickly evolved into oversimplification of complex issues and\noften include “grading on a curve,” where firms are rank-ordered, with an expectation that\nimplementing a simpler approach fails to meet expectations, under the assumption that the more\ncomplex approach is appropriate for all firms. However, this side-by-side comparison fails to\naddress the only question that matters: whether a firm’s approach meets appropriate legal and\nsupervisory standards for the individual firm’s characteristics. Differences in approaches are not\nindicative of shortcomings, particularly since these can often be explained by distinguishing the\nunderlying activities, scope and scale of operations, and risk tolerance of the firm’s board and\nmanagement.\nThere is also a lack of transparency in the results of these exams, and a risk that\nhorizontal reviews will create generally applicable rules without complying with the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). I will be looking closely at whether the continued use of\nhorizontal exams going forward is appropriate, and if so, to ensure that these exams are\n- 6 -\nsufficiently transparent, they reflect proper respect for the APA, and do not circumvent our\nresponsibility to provide each regulated institution with a fair, firm-specific evaluation.\nThe role of guidance in supervision. Finally, I will discuss the important role of\nguidance in the supervisory process. Guidance can be an effective tool to promote transparency\nin supervisory expectations, to provide clarity to regulated institutions on the permissibility of\nnew activities and their associated risks, and to provide firms some perspective on how they may\ncomply with statutory and regulatory requirements. Structured with these goals in mind,\nguidance can further the objective of supervisory prioritization.\nWhere guidance does not further these objectives, it is worth revisiting. I think it is\nimportant that we review a wide range of existing guidance, including outstanding Supervision\nand Regulation Letters (SR Letters), topical guidance that addresses issues that may adversely\naffect innovation (like the extensive guidance that has some bearing on third-party risk\nmanagement), and the many other guidance documents that have been issued in recent years.\nFundamentally, guidance should clarify expectations, and provide answers to industry\nquestions, such as our earlier “office hours” guidance that provided a venue for banks and\ninnovators to share information on new products and services like digital asset activities and\nartificial intelligence.\nChanging expectations around the use of guidance, as a tool to promote clarity in\nsupervisory expectations, can encourage innovation in the banking system. Uncertainty in\nsupervisory expectations has long been an obstacle to banks seeking to innovate, including banks\nengaging in digital asset activities or incorporating new technologies like artificial intelligence to\nimprove efficiency and delivery of products and services. Just as it is imperative that banks\n- 7 -\ninnovate to remain competitive in the future, it is critical that bank supervisors enable the\nadoption of new technologies in a manner consistent with safety and soundness.\nExaminer training and workforce development. Examiners must engage in a\nchallenging course of study and pass rigorous tests before qualifying to become a commissioned\nbank examiner. Those who have obtained this license have a strong foundation that they can rely\non to conduct appropriate examinations. The commission demonstrates an elevated level of\nexpertise, judgment, and fairness that these examiners bring to their work. As such, they should\nnot shy away from transparency or public accountability.\nCurrently, the Federal Reserve does not require all staff involved in supervision and bank\nexamination to have met or to be on a path to meet this credential. Regulated entities should be\nable to expect that all of our examination and supervisory teams have achieved or are working to\nachieve this level of professional expertise. Going forward, the Fed will prioritize this training,\nparticularly as we face an aging workforce across the Federal banking agencies that will require\nour new examination staff to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system into the\nfuture. Failure to invest in and plan for examiner training today will result in much less effective\nsupervision in years to come.\nCapital\nCapital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory framework\nand are essential for the stability of interconnected banking and financial systems around the\nworld. Yet too often, our efforts to address capital reform take a piecemeal approach to capital\nrequirements. We tend to review individual elements of the capital framework in isolation,\nwithout considering whether proposed changes are sensible in the aggregate and contribute to a\ncapital framework in which all components work together effectively.\n- 8 -\nWhile each component is important, the aggregate calibration of requirements is\nultimately the most meaningful, and we must examine whether this approach in totality\nappropriately captures risk. Over-calibrated capital requirements effectively create market\ndistortions, disfavoring some activities over others in a way that is divorced from prudential\nsafety and soundness goals and economic conditions.\nLeverage ratios are one example that illustrates this concern. The Federal Reserve has\nlong acknowledged that leverage ratios are intended to act as a “backstop” to risk-based capital\nrequirements. When leverage ratios become the binding capital constraint at an excessive level,\nthey can create market distortions. This is especially true in the case of the enhanced\nsupplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) which is applicable to the largest banks.\nAs a result of this leverage requirement, banks are less inclined to engage in low-risk\nactivities like Treasury market intermediation and revise their business activities in a way that is\nneither justified nor responsive to their customer needs. These distortions can also create\nbroader financial system impacts like increased stress on Treasury market functioning. To be\nclear, the increasing bindingness of the eSLR on the largest firms did not result from careful\npolicy debate and discussion. Instead, it is an unintended consequence of market and other bank\nregulatory requirements implemented after it was originally put in place.\nThe original calibration of the eSLR was based on forecasts of the level of reserves and\nother so-called “safe assets” in the system that are now far out of line with current levels. I\nexpect that in the near future, the agencies will publish a proposal to help address this concern\nand ensure that the eSLR resumes functioning as a backstop capital requirement.\nWhile this fix to the eSLR is necessary, it may not be sufficient to address issues in the\ncapital framework. In July, the Federal Reserve will host a conference that will broaden our\n- 9 -\nperspective in the consideration of capital requirements for large banks. We will bring together\nbankers, academics, and other capital experts to examine whether capital requirements as\ncurrently structured and calibrated are operating as intended—in a complementary fashion.\nI welcome the opportunity to consider a broader range of perspectives as we look to the\nfuture of capital framework reforms. In addition to considering potential changes to leverage\nratio requirements and stress testing, the capital conference will also include a discussion of\npotential reforms to the GSIB surcharge and the Basel III capital requirements.\nThe Board has already proposed a significant change to reduce the volatility in capital\nrequirements resulting from our current stress testing process. The proposal includes providing a\nlonger implementation timeline to phase in the annual stress capital buffer requirement. And\nlater this year, the Board will consider more extensive changes aimed at promoting transparency,\nfairness, and predictability in the stress testing program.\nWhile stress testing is an important supervisory tool, its implementation, outcomes, and\nprocesses have raised significant questions and concerns about its effectiveness in identifying\nsystemic weakness. The lack of transparency around the models used in stress testing prevents\nmeaningful discussions about how the stress tests can be improved.\nCapital has an impact on the business activities of all banks. Although the capital\nframework for the smallest institutions tends to be simpler and more straightforward, calibration\nand design elements play an important role in the functioning of smaller banks just as they do for\nlarger banks. Therefore, it is important that we also take the opportunity to address issues for\nsmaller banks, that provide critical support to their local communities and the economy. On this\nfront, we will review and consider the community bank framework, including capital\n- 10 -\nrequirements like the calibration of the community bank leverage ratio, and whether reforms to\nthe capital framework for mutual banks can be improved to promote capital formation.\nI look forward to the results of public engagement on these issues, including through the\nupcoming conferences. As we consider bank capital requirements, the focus should be on\nachieving a capital framework that provides a strong foundation for the banking system,\nappropriately requires banks to hold capital corresponding to risk, and works together with bank\nsupervision to support a safe and sound banking system.\nReview of Regulations and Information Collections\nSince the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act nearly 15 years ago, the body of regulations that\nall banks are subject to has increased dramatically. Many of the reforms made after the 2008\nfinancial crisis were important and essential to ensuring a stronger and more resilient banking\nsystem. Yet, a number of the changes were backward looking—responding only to that\nmortgage crisis—not fully considering the potential future unintended consequences or future\nstates of the world.\nWith well over a decade of change in the banking system now behind us postimplementation, it is time to evaluate whether all of these changes continue to be relevant. Some\nof the regulations put in place immediately after that financial crisis resulted in pushing\nfoundational banking activities out of the regulated banking system into the less regulated\ncorners of the financial system. We need to ask whether this was and continues to be\nappropriate. These tradeoffs are complicated, and we must consider not only the changes that\nwere made but also the evolution of and differences in the banking system today.\nDriving all risk out of the banking system is at odds with the fundamental nature of the\nbusiness of banking. Banks must be able to earn a profit and grow while also managing their\n- 11 -\nrisks. Adding requirements that impose more costs must be balanced with whether the new\nrequirements make the correct tradeoffs between safety and soundness and enabling banks to\nserve their customers and run their businesses. The task of policymakers and regulators is not to\neliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and\neffectively managed.\nIn a well-functioning, regulated banking system, banks serve an indispensable role in\ncredit provision and economic stability. The goal is to create and maintain a system that\nsupports safe and sound banking practices, and results in the implementation of proper risk\nmanagement. Our goal should not be to prevent banks from failing or even eliminate the risk\nthat they will. Our goal should be to make banks safe to fail, meaning that they can be allowed\nto fail without threatening to destabilize the rest of the banking system.\nMaintenance of the regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that our regulations\ncontinue to strike the right balance between encouraging growth and innovation, and safety and\nsoundness. One easily identifiable way to achieve this is using the Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process, which the agencies initiated in\nFebruary of last year.\nThe EGRPRA review process requires the federal banking agencies to identify any\noutdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome regulations, eliminate unnecessary regulations, and\ntake other steps to address the regulatory burdens associated with outdated or overly burdensome\nregulations. Prior iterations of the EGRPRA process have been underwhelming in their ability to\nresult in meaningful change, but it is my expectation that this review, and eventually the\naccompanying report to Congress, will provide a meaningful process for stakeholders and the\npublic to engage with the banking agencies in identifying regulations that are no longer\n- 12 -\nnecessary or are overly burdensome. It is also my expectation that regulators will be responsive\nto concerns raised by the public.\nAnother area that is ripe for review are several of the Board’s rules that address core\nbanking issues—from loans to insiders, to transactions with affiliates, to state member bank\nactivities, and domestic and foreign activities of bank holding companies. Many of the Board’s\nregulations have not been comprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given\nthe dynamic nature of the banking system and how the economy and banking and financial\nservices industries have evolved over that period, we should update and simplify many of the\nBoard’s regulations, including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks.\nBanking Applications\nThe process to file an application and receive regulatory approval, whether it involves\nbanks seeking a de novo charter, institutions seeking to merge, or any other application for bank\nregulatory approval should reflect both (1) transparency as to the information required in the\napplication itself, and the standards of approval being applied, and (2) clear timelines for action.\nRecent experience with banking applications suggests that revisions would be helpful in\nthis space. Streamlining the applications for de novo formation, and establishing clearer\nstandards for approval, may encourage more de novo activity.\nSimilar problems have affected bank mergers and acquisitions, where there have been\nlengthy processing delays. We need to rethink whether many of the additional requests for\ninformation can be addressed through better application forms or relying on information that is\navailable from bank examinations. We should also consider factors that force applications to be\nmoved from Reserve Bank-delegated processing to requiring consideration by the Board. One\nexample is the perverse effect of “competitive” screens that disproportionately affect transactions\n- 13 -\nin rural and underserved banking markets. Another is the treatment of adverse public comments\nthat may lack factual support or rely on matters already considered in the review process,\nincluding existing supervisory records.\nClosing Thoughts\nI am honored to have the opportunity to serve as the Vice Chair for Supervision. The\nwork of supervision and regulation is critical to maintaining a safe and sound banking system\nand protecting U.S. financial stability. Conditions constantly evolve in the banking system, and\nso too must the regulatory and supervisory framework. We must be proactive and responsive in\nthe face of emerging risks and ensure that the framework operates in an efficient and effective\nmanner.\nThe steps I have identified today are intended to further these goals by creating an initial\nroadmap to refocus supervisory and regulatory efforts on the core financial risks most critical to\nmaintaining a healthy and resilient banking system. I look forward to working with my Board\ncolleagues and my counterparts at the other banking agencies as we pursue sensible and\npragmatic reforms.\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2\n See, e.g., Michelle W.

    "text": "Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the important role\nagriculture plays in our economy, a role that is supported by many community banks. I\nwould like to thank the Independent Community Bankers Association and their New\nMexico state association for inviting me to participate in the conversation we will have\ntoday. In addition to the bankers and state leaders here, agricultural bankers and other\nleaders in the industry are listening in from around the country, and I look forward to\nhearing their views in a few moments.\nDuring our time together, I would like to offer some observations on the current\nstate of the farm economy. And because I see community bankers as playing a vital role\nin this sector, I’ll explain why I believe the community banking model is well-suited to\nsupporting agricultural businesses. Finally, I will highlight the Federal Reserve’s\napproach to supervising agricultural banks.\nAs many of you know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I worked at a\ncommunity bank that primarily served ranchers and farmers and the businesses that\nsupport them. More recently, as Kansas state bank commissioner, I supervised many\nbanks whose business and customers were closely connected to the land and the people\nwho work it. I now have the honor of being the first governor to fill the role designated\nfor someone with community banking experience on the Federal Reserve Board, a\nposition that was created by statute in 2015.1\n I plan to fulfill this unique responsibility by\ntraveling widely and listening closely to community bankers, consumers, farmers,\nranchers, and dairy farmers--all of the stakeholders with an interest in our work. My goal\nis to bring back the knowledge I gain from discussions and visits like the one we are\n 1 Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-1, 129 Stat. 3),\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/26.\n- 2 -\nhaving today and use it to improve our work. In doing so, I am confident our work will\nbe more effective and efficient. And in the process, I hope to help you better understand\nthe role of the Federal Reserve and what we are trying to accomplish.\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy mandate is twofold: to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices. To do that, we continuously monitor the health of the\nU.S. economy in general, and because of its sizable share of overall activity, the\nagricultural sector in particular. U.S. agriculture and its related industries support about\n22 million jobs in the United States and produce close to 10 percent of our exports.2\n A\nhealthy farm economy also supports many rural and regional economies. We track\ncommodity prices, ag credit, and exports as factors that influence our outlook on inflation\nand economic growth. As bank supervisors, we work to ensure safe and sound banking\npractices. We also monitor trends in asset quality and risk-management practices at\nagricultural banks as part of our ongoing assessment of the level and direction of risk at\nthese financial institutions and within the agricultural economy.\nEarlier this week, I had the privilege of welcoming farm sector leaders to the\nFederal Reserve Board in Washington, where we hosted the 2019 National Agricultural\nCredit Conference. For nearly 80 years, this conference has brought together leaders in\nthis sector to discuss important issues related to farm credit. Attendees at this year’s\nconference recognized that, while the outlook for the farm economy in 2019 may be\nsimilar to a year ago, there are ongoing concerns that increasing stress on producers could\nlead to repayment difficulties.\n 2 See U.S Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service at https://www.ers.usda.gov/dataproducts/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy/.\n- 3 -\nFarm incomes are expected to remain relatively low this year after declining\nsharply from the 2013 peak. The price of major agricultural commodities has also\nremained low in early 2019. For example, today, the price of corn is about 40 percent\nlower than it was from 2010 to 2013. Dairy producing states like New Mexico are well\naware that average milk prices were about 15 percent lower in 2018 than from 2010 to\n2013, and well below the highs of 2014. As noted in recent Federal Reserve System\nBeige Books, higher tariffs on soybeans and other U.S. exports and continued uncertainty\nover trade policy represent headwinds for American producers.\nHere in New Mexico, agricultural production rose 5 percent to $3.4 billion in\n2017, with strong gains in milk production and livestock. Coming from a ranching\nfamily, I’m well aware of the challenges facing livestock producers. New Mexico is also\nthe nation’s second largest producer of pecans, producing a record 92 million pounds\nworth $220 million in 2017. I’m also looking forward to touring a farm later today to\nlearn more about a crop we don’t grow a lot of in Kansas--chili peppers. The demand for\nchili peppers and pecans grown in New Mexico is a good example of the kinds of\nregional variations we see in agriculture and many other industries.\nWhile it is important to understand regional trends, I would like to focus this\nmorning on some overarching themes that have emerged in recent years. Recently, a\ngreat deal of attention understandably has been paid to an increase in the number of U.S.\nfarm bankruptcies. While this is, of course, an important indicator to watch, it’s equally\nimportant to note that the rise over the past few years has been fairly modest.\nSpecifically, Chapter 12 filings increased from 360 in 2014 to about 500 in 2018. The\n- 4 -\nFederal Reserve tracks these developments closely because of their potential implications\nfor both the economy and banking supervision.\nThe challenging outlook has prompted some to wonder if the industry is about to\nrelive the hard times of the 1980s farm crisis. But here, I think, the historical contrast is\nsomewhat reassuring. In the 1970s, farm income in the United States had advanced\nrapidly as exports surged. The broad increase in farm income led to a significant rise in\ncapital investments in the years that followed. But exports began to soften and fell\nsharply after the suspension of trade with the then-Soviet Union. Farm incomes dropped,\nprofits declined rapidly, and liquidity in the U.S. farm sector dried up.\nOther factors turned the sharp downturn into a crisis. High interest rates in the\nearly 1980s, in response to the Great Inflation, contributed to the stress.3 Despite the\nreductions in profits and liquidity, capital spending remained elevated in the early 1980s,\nand was financed with higher levels of debt made possible by rising land values. With\ndebt burdens rising and incomes falling, many farm operations were forced to sell their\nland, causing the value of farmland to decline rapidly. The result was a sharp increase in\nfarm bankruptcies and a number of bank failures.\nWhat about now? There are some similarities. Farm incomes rose rapidly from\n2000 before reaching their peak in 2013 at $123 billion.\n4\n During that time, spurred by\nrising demand in China and a boom in biofuels, farmers invested heavily in new\n 3 Jerome H. Powell, “Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy” (speech at Changing Market Structure and\nImplications for Monetary Policy, a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, August 24, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm. 4 U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, “Highlights from the March 2019 Farm\nIncome Forecast,” https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances/highlightsfrom-the-farm-income-forecast/.\n- 5 -\nequipment and technology to meet this rising demand. And, in a troubling echo of the\n1980s, farm incomes have now been cut roughly in half.\nThat said, there are some important differences between the 1980s and today.\nWith current inflation low and stable, interest rates are substantially lower than in the\n1980s, and overall leverage has been less pronounced. And in contrast to the 1980s,\nfarmland values have declined only modestly in recent years. The combination of\nrelatively low interest rates and modest debt levels has resulted in more-manageable debt\nservice requirements for many agricultural borrowers.5\nSome farm operations have faced significant financial stress, and it is important to\nrecognize that there are still risks. Farmland prices are quite high, and working capital\ncontinues to decline. However, returns at banks with a concentration in agriculture have\ngenerally remained healthy, as most producers have continued to make loan payments\ndespite weakening revenue streams.\nLet me shift focus now to the role of banks, particularly community banks, in the\nU.S. farm economy. Community banks foster strong long-term relationships with\nfarmers, ranchers, and others involved in the local business of agriculture. Often, these\nrelationships are cultivated through community bankers’ service on local civic and\nbusiness organizations or by participation with local farmers and their families in\nactivities to support the local community and economy. Agricultural community banks\nand agricultural borrowers share a common goal of serving and strengthening their local\ncommunities. They are also responsible for providing jobs that maintain the viability of\n 5 Cortney Cowley and Ty Kreitman, “Farmland Values Stable, but Risks to Outlook Remain,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, February 14, 2019,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/indicatorsdata/agcreditsurvey/articles/2019/2-14-2019/farmlandvalues-stable-but-risks-to-outlook-remain.\n- 6 -\nthese rural communities. Frequently, community bankers’ ties to local agricultural\nbusinesses include running family farms, ranches, orchards, and dairies. In other\ninstances, members of the boards of directors that help to oversee community banks are\nheavily involved in the business of agriculture. These close connections to local\nagricultural businesses provide community banks with a unique and important\nperspective in helping to meet local agricultural credit needs.\nAdditionally, community banks can be more agile than their larger competitors,\nas they employ lenders with a deep understanding of local products and conditions and\nare able to offer customized funding options in response to changing lending conditions.\nThis agility ultimately allows for better informed lending decisions and provides\nagricultural borrowers with the means to fund their operations and sustain their\ncommunities.\nAs bank supervisors, we pay close attention to the performance of all banks,\nincluding agricultural banks. Before we start our conversation today, I would like to\ndiscuss how the Federal Reserve approaches bank supervision with a focus on agriculture\nlending and the challenges our farmers and the community banks that support these\noperations are facing.\nOverview of Agricultural Banks\nThere are approximately 1,400 “agricultural banks” in the United States, all of\nwhich play a vital role in providing rural producers with access to credit.6\n Agricultural\nbanks hold approximately 50 percent of all agricultural loans outstanding at U.S.\n 6 Agricultural banks are defined as banks with farm production and farm real estate loans equal to 25\npercent or more of total loans.\n- 7 -\ncommercial banks. As I noted earlier, farm income has declined by approximately\n50 percent since 2013, yet agricultural loans have steadily increased. Additionally,\nagricultural banks have more challenging funding structures given the seasonal funding\nneeds of their agricultural customers and the difficulty of attracting deposits at rural\ninstitutions. This combination of a cyclical deposit base, lower inflows of deposits into\nrural community banks, and growing loan demand from agricultural borrowers has\nresulted in a greater dependence on borrowed funds to support the recent growth in\nagricultural lending.\nApproximately one-third of all agricultural banks are highly concentrated\nagricultural banks, and the number of these banks has declined slightly over the past\nseveral years--from 479 in December 2016 to 449 in September 2018. Although there\nare some unique risks and challenges for highly concentrated agricultural banks and their\nsupervisors, these banks also generally remain in sound financial condition. And capital\nlevels and liquidity metrics at most ag banks are generally in line with other banks that do\nnot share these concentrations.\nWhile concentrated agricultural banks are currently operating with adequate\ncapital ratios, regulators continue to closely monitor capital levels and to encourage\nprudent capital planning and concentration risk management, given the potential for\nunforeseen challenges and emerging risks associated with agricultural lending.\nWith respect to liquidity, as previously noted, rapid asset growth can strain a\nbank’s liquidity position if its funding sources turn out to be unstable. As supervisors, we\nwork with bankers to understand their liquidity planning process, their challenges around\nattracting deposits, and the risks associated with potentially relying too heavily on\n- 8 -\nnoncore sources of funding. We have observed the increasing pressure on community\nbanks to compete for deposits; however, we still see many community banks overcoming\nthis challenge and effectively competing for deposits in their communities.\nAnother key component of all community bank examinations is a focus on asset\nquality. Financial indicators for agriculture banks remain at manageable levels as\nhighlighted by the nonperforming agricultural loans to total loans ratio of 1.36 percent as\nof September 2018.\nIn addition to the traditional focus on the financial factors related to agricultural\nlending, the Federal Reserve has provided examiners with helpful insights into the\nappropriate treatment of agricultural carryover debt. We understand that bankers need to\nwork constructively with borrowers when problems arise. And this is particularly true for\nhighly concentrated agricultural banks, where maintaining enhanced agricultural credit\nrisk-management practices to facilitate prudent underwriting, early detection of problems,\nand well-thought-out restructuring plans for agricultural borrowers are imperative to\nlimiting losses and maintaining a sound banking institution.\nIn 2011, the Federal Reserve also issued guidance to the industry on key risk\nfactors in agricultural lending and supervisory expectations for a financial institution’s\nrisk-management practices.7 This guidance applies in all economic environments, but it\nis especially important in periods of economic stress, because it reminds bankers that the\nidentification of a troubled borrower does not prohibit a banker from working with the\nborrower.\n 7 See Supervision and Regulation SR Letter 11-14, “Supervisory Expectations for Risk Management of\nAgriculture Credit Risk,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1114.htm.\n- 9 -\nMany banks engaged in agricultural lending are located in communities where\nfarming is the primary economic driver, and simply pushing every borrower with\nchallenges out of the bank does not benefit the long-term interests of the bank or the\ncommunity it serves. The Federal Reserve recognizes the benefits when lenders work\nprudently with troubled borrowers in a way that serves the long-term interests of all\nstakeholders.\nI would like to conclude by recognizing how fortunate we are to have so many\nhighly skilled and experienced farmers and operators, and agricultural lenders who\nsupport them. Modern agriculture is a sophisticated and complex business that requires\nskilled forecasting of supply and demand, rigorous financial and operational\nmanagement, and sharp technical expertise. Our farmers and operators are pushing\nforward the frontiers of agriculture. The integration of robotics, data analytics,\ngeolocation, and advanced sensors holds the promise of a new, more efficient and\nproductive era of “precision agriculture.”\nA close working relationship between farmers and agricultural lenders is essential\nto the economic growth of agricultural borrowers and the continued success of many\nrural communities. The outlook for U.S. agriculture is challenging, though agricultural\nbanks remain relatively stable. As such, it is important for the Federal Reserve to\ncontinue to tailor effective supervision and regulation to ensure the safety and soundness\nof agricultural banks, while also making sure that undue burden does not constrain the\ncapacity of these institutions to continue supporting the agricultural communities that\nthey serve"

    "text": "Thank you, Commissioner Marshall, for the invitation to speak to you today. It’s really a\npleasure to be here, finally in person at the Venture Center.\n1 Much has happened over the past\nfew years, and I have been following your work closely.\nTechnology Is Changing Financial Services\nTechnology and innovation are a priority interest for my work at the Board of Governors.\nTechnology can offer increased speed, lower costs, and greater efficiency in providing services\nand products in the financial industry. This week’s conference agenda includes many of the\ntopics I follow closely through our work on innovation.\nMuch of the innovation in financial services is occurring in the nonbank sector, but\ntechnology is also changing the business of banking in profound ways. More and more\ncustomers interact with their banks exclusively through digital channels. They check their\nbalances, apply for credit cards, and make deposits and payments via their phones, rather than\nvisiting bank branches.\nBut the changes run deeper than that. Technology is also changing fundamental aspects\nof bank operations. For example, banks are beginning to use artificial intelligence (AI) in credit\nunderwriting, back-office operations, various aspects of risk management, and customer service.\nTechnology is also leading to new bank business models. Many banks are using\napplication programming interfaces and other technology to allow nonbank technology firms to\nprovide financial services. Under many of these arrangements, the technology firm maintains\nthe customer relationship, while the bank provides the underlying financial infrastructure,\nincluding deposit services and access to the payment rails.\n1 These remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee. I am grateful for the assistance of Federal Reserve Board staff Jeff Ernst, Kavita\nJain, Molly Mahar, Jason Hinkle, and Kirstin Wells in preparing these remarks.\nFederal Reserve Support for Innovation\nThe Federal Reserve is monitoring these transformations closely, and we are encouraged\nby the potential for improvements that can be brought by responsible innovation.\nI think it is critically important for banking regulators to support innovation in banking.\nTraditionally, banking regulators may have viewed banking innovation solely as a risk on a long\nlist of risks that need to be appropriately managed. While that perspective won’t change, I\nrecognize that evolving consumer preferences are requiring banks to meet these technologyenabled expectations. It is true that new services and products present new risks, but these are\nnot unmanageable risks. And, frankly, there is greater risk in standing still—in not recognizing\nthe need to move forward. Failure to innovate can undermine a bank’s competitiveness, posing a\nthreat to safety and soundness just as innovating recklessly can. The Fed supports responsible\ninnovation in a variety of ways, and I will mention a few of them in this discussion.\nFor the past few years, I have been working to assist banks to address the challenges\nbrought by the process of partnering with a third-party service provider. Last year, the Fed,\nalong with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, proposed interagency guidance to assist in the management of risks involved in\nthird-party engagement. The agencies received over 80 comment letters and are reviewing those\ncomments as we move toward finalizing the guidance. In my view, it is especially helpful to\nprovide clarity for banks in these kinds of relationships and to help them establish a solid\nfoundation as banks and fintechs continue to engage in partnerships.\nLast year at this time, the federal banking agencies released a guide designed to assist\ncommunity banks to assess risks in constructing and considering relationships with fintech\ncompanies.\nAnd lastly, this past September, the Federal Reserve published a paper detailing industry\nperspectives and experiences on the different types of partnerships between community banks\nand fintech companies.2\n We conducted extensive outreach with community banks, fintechs, and\nother stakeholders and incorporated real world experiences of the strategic and tactical decisions\nthat led to effective partnerships.\nFor the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on several issues that are likely top of mind\nfor those who are engaged in financial services innovation.\nCrypto-Assets\nLet’s start with digital and crypto-assets. I am hearing more discussions involving banks’\ninterest in offering services involving crypto-assets. The chatter seems to originate more from\nthose outside the banking industry, but I’ll put that aside for now.\nThere seem to be a number of reasons for this interest and why customers might seek to\nengage in this type of activity. First, although the interest seemed to have cooled lately, given\nrecent developments in the crypto industry, we have seen significant consumer demand for\nengagement in these types of services. It seems reasonable that because bank customers are\naware of crypto and have discussed these assets with their banks, banks want to better understand\nthis type of engagement and potentially provide those services to their customers.\nSecond, we have also been told that banks have observed their deposits flowing to\nnonbank crypto-asset firms and, understandably, would like to stem that outflow by offering the\nservices themselves. I certainly recognize and appreciate these challenges. But before a bank\nbegins to engage in or offer crypto-asset-related services, it must seriously and carefully consider\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Publishes Paper Describing Landscape of\nPartnerships Between Community Banks and Fintech Companies, news release, September 9, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210909a.htm.\nthe risks involved—both to the bank and its customers. The recent turmoil in the digital-asset\nindustry only underscores that point.\nFederal Reserve staff is working to articulate supervisory expectations for banks on a\nvariety of digital asset-related activities, including\n• custody of crypto-assets\n• facilitation of customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets\n• loans collateralized by crypto-assets, and\n• issuance and distribution of stablecoins by banking organizations.\nWe understand that everyone involved in this space is seeking clarity. One of the most\nimportant tools that we have as a regulator is the ability to clearly articulate our supervisory\nexpectations. It is also our most direct path to encouraging and supporting responsible\ninnovation.\nEarlier this week, we released supervisory guidance addressing banks that are engaging\nin or seeking to engage in crypto-asset related activities.3\n This guidance will provide banks with\nadditional information about the risks of crypto activities and remind them to ensure that the\nactivities are legal, and they should have adequate systems, risk management, and controls in\nplace to conduct the activities in a safe and sound manner consistent with applicable law.\nCritically, one important element of this release is that firms should contact their supervisors\nabout these types of activities and expect that supervisory staff will provide timely feedback, as\nappropriate.\n3\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board Provides Additional Information for\nBanking Organizations Engaging or Seeking to Engage in Crypto-Asset-Related Activities, news release, August 16,\n2022, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20220816a.htm.\nBased on my conversations with bankers across the country, I believe that providing the\nrules of the road—highlighting the risks we are most concerned about and laying out our\nexpectations for how those risks should be managed—is invaluable for banks considering\nwhether and how to innovate.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe Federal Reserve is taking a similar approach with respect to banks’ use of AI. Last\nyear, the Fed joined with four other financial agencies to issue a Request for Information and\nComment on Financial Institutions’ Use of Artificial Intelligence, Including Machine Learning.\n4\n\nAs noted in that document, banks are using AI in a variety of ways, including fraud monitoring,\npersonalization of customer services, credit decisions, risk management, and textual analysis.\nThese applications of AI can, to varying degrees, involve risk-management challenges around\nissues such as explainability, data governance, cybersecurity, third-party risk management, and\nconsumer compliance.\nThe banking agencies received over 100 responses to the Request for Information. Those\nresponses give us a window into what questions banks need regulators to answer about using AI.\nFederal Reserve staff is working with the other regulators to provide further clarity in this area.\nPayments: FedNow and Central Bank Digital Currencies\nPayments is another area where innovation continues to flourish, and the Federal Reserve\nis actively engaged in shaping the future payments landscape.\nThe FedNowSM Service will enable financial institutions of every size, and in every\ncommunity across America, to provide safe and efficient instant payment services. It is intended\nto be a flexible, neutral platform that will support a broad variety of instant payments. It will\n4 86 Fed. Reg. 16,837.\nallow depository institutions and their service providers to offer value-added services to their\ncustomers, ultimately enhancing competition in the market for payment services. Completing\nand implementing FedNow is a high priority, and we expect it to be available by mid-2023.\nFedNow will help transform the way payments are made through new services that allow\nconsumers and businesses to make payments conveniently, in real time, on any day, and with\nimmediate availability of funds for receivers. Our assessment of these benefits has not changed\neven as we consider whether a central bank digital currency (CBDC) might fit into the future\nU.S. money and payments landscape.\nMy expectation is that FedNow addresses the issues that some have raised about the need\nfor a CBDC. As I’m sure you are already aware, earlier this year we published a discussion\npaper that outlined some design principles, costs, and benefits of a CBDC and solicited public\ncomments.\n5\n We received over 2,000 comments, and we are currently reviewing these comments\nand plan to publish a summary of them.\nNovel Charters and Access to Federal Reserve Account Services\nBefore I wrap up, let me touch on one more topic that relates to innovation in bank\ncharter types.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in novel charter types being authorized or\nconsidered across the country at the state and national levels. As a result, Federal Reserve Banks\nare receiving an increased number of inquiries and requests for access to Reserve Bank master\naccounts and financial services, which could provide those institutions with access to the nation’s\npayment system.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital\nTransformation, January 2022, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments20220120.pdf.\nOn August 15, the Board of Governors published final guidelines that govern how\nReserve Banks will evaluate requests for account access. The guidelines take into account the\nBoard’s goals to (1) ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) effectively\nimplement monetary policy; (3) promote financial stability; (4) protect consumers; and (5)\npromote a safe, efficient, inclusive, and innovative payment system.6\n\nThe approach articulated in the guidelines is based on a foundation of risk management\nand mitigation, recognizing that access to Fed accounts and services can create significant risks.\nThe systematic evaluation of these different risks is intended to establish a framework ensuring\nsimilar treatment for legally eligible institutions with similar risk profiles across the Reserve\nBanks. For example, requests for accounts and services from non-federally insured institutions\nwould generally be subject to a higher standard of review. The Board expects Reserve Banks to\ncollaborate on reviews of account and service requests, and conduct ongoing monitoring of\napproved accountholders, to ensure that the guidelines are implemented in a consistent manner.\nPublishing the guidelines is an important step to providing transparency and consistency\nacross the Federal Reserve System. However, more work remains to be completed before a\nprocess is established to fully implement the guidelines. In the meantime, there is a risk that the\nguidelines could establish false expectations regarding the timeline for evaluating and acting on\nthese requests.\nIn closing, I’d like to once again thank the Venture Center for hosting this event and for\nproviding the opportunity to get together to discuss innovation in financial services. It’s great to\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Board Announces Final Guidelines That\nEstablish a Transparent, Risk-Based, and Consistent Set of Factors for Reserve Banks to Use in Reviewing Requests\nto Access Federal Reserve Accounts and Payment Services, news release, August 15, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220815a.htm.\nfinally be back in Little Rock and to have the chance to meet so many of you in person after such\na long time.

    "text": "Thank you to the American Bankers Association for inviting me to address this\nyear’s Conference for Community Bankers. I am delighted to be here with you again.\nLet me begin by stating that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve.\nAs community bankers, you have worked hard to develop a deep understanding of\nyour local economies, while also keeping perspective on the broader economic picture.\nThere is little I could tell you about your local communities that you do not already\nknow, but I thought I might say a few words on the national economic outlook before\nturning to my main topic for today.\nMy colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee had our most recent\nmeeting about two weeks ago, when we decided to keep our target range for the federal\nfunds rate unchanged at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This policy setting should help support\nthe economic expansion, which is now in its 11th year. My outlook for the U.S. economy\nis for continued growth at a moderate pace, with the unemployment rate—which is the\nlowest it has been in 50 years—remaining low. I also see inflation gradually rising to the\nCommittee’s 2 percent objective. So on the whole, the national economic backdrop looks\nvery favorable, which should be broadly supportive of your local economies. And of\ncourse, by ensuring that consumers and businesses in your communities have access to\nfinancial services, you are key contributors to the health of our national economy.\nLet me now turn to my main topic for today, the interaction between innovation\nand regulation for community banks. As the Federal Reserve Board’s first designated\ngovernor with experience in community banking, I am committed to maintaining a strong\nand thriving community bank sector. Small banks are the lifeblood of their\n- 2 -\ncommunities—and they ensure that consumers and businesses have access to financial\nservices. This capacity to address local needs is fundamental to a strong and stable\nfinancial system. To community bankers, customers are much more than their credit\nscore or their annual income, and small businesses are far more than their most recent\nrevenues. By extending credit and offering specialized products and services that meet\nthe needs of their borrowers, these banks empower communities to thrive.\nWe live in an exciting time, when the face of banking is changing faster and\nperhaps more fundamentally than it ever has. The first digital banks appeared on the\nscene about 25 years ago. Since then, financial technology has evolved rapidly.\nTechnology puts more information in the hands of both the customer and the bank. As\nfinancial institutions succeed in digitizing more of their offerings, customers are able to\nmonitor cash flows, make direct payments, understand changes in their credit scores,\ntrack spending, and budget more easily. Technologies like predictive analytics, when\nsupported with appropriate consumer protections, can improve bank services and\nperformance by enabling continuous tailoring of the customer experience. It also helps\nbanks identify products that are best suited for their customers and their business model\nand strategy. For those account holders who are willing, an analysis of spending habits\nmay indicate that they could benefit from services they hadn’t yet considered.\nBut successful innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies.\nSuccessful innovation has always required strategic vision and creativity. Community\nbanks thrive when they find creative ways to serve their communities, using everything\nthey know to build relationships, offer solutions, and make lending decisions. We need\n- 3 -\nonly look to the performance of community banks during the financial crisis to see how\nwell they leverage this local knowledge and their relationships to make lending decisions.\nAfter the onset of the crisis, community banks’ superior loan quality resulted in\nlower aggregate delinquency and charge-off rates compared to the largest banks. This\nsuperior performance was widespread—community banks in the vast majority of states\noutperformed the largest banks in this way.1\nEven today, community banks continue to perform with distinction. In the third\nquarter of 2019, community banks’ pre-tax return on average assets was 1.5 percent,\nmarking the highest pre-tax return on assets ratio reported by community banks since\n2006. Asset quality also remains strong for community banks and is better than for larger\nbanks. The community bank net charge-off rate for total loans and leases was less than\n0.2 percent at the end of the third quarter 2019. Let me state that again—the net chargeoff rate was less than 0.2 percent, less than half of the industry average. Community\nbank capital levels remain at continued high and increasing levels. Community banks\nreported a total risk-based capital ratio of nearly 16 percent, as compared to the industry\naverage of less than 15 percent. This type of performance positions the community\nbanking sector for continued success this year and well into the future, helping ensure the\npreservation of the community bank model for future generations of Americans.\nCommunity banks understand their borrowers and their specific needs. While\ntechnology continues to evolve and change the way we live and bank for the better, it still\ncannot by itself fulfill that unique and vital role.\n 1 See Jeffrey W. Gunther and Kelly Klemme, Financial Stability: Traditional Banks Pave the Way (Dallas:\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2012),\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/fed/~/media/documents/fed/annual/2012/1201e.pdf.\n- 4 -\nToday, there are more than 4,800 community banks in the United States.\n2\n Nearly\n80 percent of these have assets totaling less than $500 million, with roughly 40 full- and\npart-time employees, on average. The vast majority of these community banks are\nfinancially strong, and are the backbone of the towns and cities they serve, providing\nloans to individuals and businesses in the local area. But as customers’ needs and goals\nevolve, community banks will need to evolve to meet them.\nThe successful integration of financial technology into the community bank\nbusiness model is proving to be enormously valuable to enable community banks to\nenhance the services they’ve already proven they can deliver effectively. Access to\ntechnology and services to meet customer needs is critical to ensuring community banks\nremain vibrant.\nFor the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on my vision for creating pathways\nto responsible community bank innovation. In particular, I will discuss the promise and\nthe challenges that smaller banks face in identifying, integrating, and deploying\ntransformative new technologies, and I will offer some ideas for how the Federal Reserve\ncan help community banks find and manage their relationships with service providers.\nClearing a Path for Innovation\nCommunity banks have always been innovators, but rapid technology adoption is\nchallenging for banks of all sizes. In most cases, realizing the potential that technology\noffers requires community banks to obtain services from other companies or products\nfrom core service providers, which I will refer to collectively as third-party providers. As\nI noted earlier, banks with less than $500 million in assets employ roughly 40 people on\n 2 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile 13, no. 4 (Third Quarter\n2019), https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/qbp/2019sep/qbp.pdf#page=1.\n- 5 -\naverage—nowhere near the number required to exhaustively develop, test, and manage\nevery element of novel technologies. In my discussions with bankers, they note that the\nprocess of selecting, initially vetting, and continuing to evaluate third-party service\nproviders is onerous and presents obstacles to successful innovation.\nI agree that the cost of complying with some of our regulations and expectations\nfor third-party relationships can pose an outsized and undue burden on smaller banks.\nThese compliance costs are in some instances disproportionate to bank size, complexity,\nrisk, and capacity and can be the same for a bank with $10 million in assets and a bank\nwith $10 billion in assets. Further, expectations of due diligence when applied to a\npotential fintech partner may require more financial history or information than that\npartner can provide.\nDue diligence for new third-party relationships, even those that are not start-ups,\ncan require a community bank to collect and analyze a significant amount of complex\ninformation. Also, the annual monitoring that is required adds an additional significant\nand ongoing burden. The process for managing the annual collection and review of the\nfinancials, audit results, and other operational compliance materials for multiple vendors\ncan take weeks of time for several employees. Bank employees must review thousands\nof pages of documentation, and the workload per vendor can be the same for all banks,\nregardless of their asset size and number of employees. And as someone who has been\ninvolved in this compliance work, I know that it’s not as if other responsibilities can\nwait—community bank employees often wear several hats. Community banks must\nweigh the benefit of any third-party relationship against the additional work required to\nevaluate the third party. And even when new product offerings emerge from service\n- 6 -\nproviders that already serve the bank, contract terms can be complicated to adjust, adding\nto the costs of obtaining technologies, which may ultimately be prohibitive. Flexible core\nsystems are important for this reason. Collaboration between a bank and its core system\nprovider is critical to ensure that technology solutions can be integrated quickly and cost\neffectively within the core system.\nCreating the Right Regulatory Environment\nResponsible innovation, especially for smaller institutions, requires two key\naspects: a clear idea of how the technology serves a bank’s strategic objectives and a\nregulatory environment that supports innovation. I will touch today on the important\ninterplay between these factors, and in particular, the role that regulators can play in\ncreating a regulatory environment that is conducive to innovation, preserves the safety\nand soundness of the financial system, and protects consumers. As regulators, we need to\nensure that banks uphold sound risk-management practices. Yet we also have\ninformation that can help community banks meet those standards. We should closely\nexamine opportunities to share that knowledge, subject to appropriate safeguards, in\norder to support innovation.\nResponsible innovation begins with a bank’s strategy. Banks need to identify\ntheir goals and then look to identify the kinds of products and services that can help them\nmove forward to implement that strategy. In the past, I have spoken about the\nimportance of considering the impact of new technologies and finding ways to leverage\nthem, if a bank feels that it fits into its business model and strategy. For community\nbanks, a decision to embrace a new technology or innovation is almost always\nsynonymous with third-party engagement.\n- 7 -\nRegulators and supervisors can contribute to an environment where banks are\nempowered to achieve these strategic objectives, simplifying and clarifying the process of\nthird-party selection, due diligence, and monitoring.\nA bank may decide that its business model should evolve, and that offering a new\nproduct or partnering with a fintech company will help it position itself for future growth.\nThis decision is an essential one, but what comes next? This is a new world for most\ncommunity banks, and supervisors and regulators can lend their expertise to those banks\nseeking to navigate the unfamiliar landscape.\nTo that end, the Federal Reserve recently launched a web page on innovation and\nannounced several upcoming Reserve Bank events. The innovation page on our website\n(www.federalreserve.gov/innovate) is intended to be a one-stop shop for supervisory\ninformation, publications, research, and international work that is related to technology\ninnovation. Most importantly, the web page also facilitates interaction with Federal\nReserve System specialists, to enable bankers and tech industry participants to submit\nquestions about all aspects of technology in the financial services industry, or to request\nan in-person meeting. Essentially, to open a dialogue.\nWe have also launched a series of Innovation Office Hours events hosted by\nReserve Banks. These events incorporate panel discussions and face-to-face meetings for\nbankers with regulators and supervisors, which are intended to be a resource for both\nstate member banks and fintech companies seeking partnerships with or offering services\nto banks. During these meetings, banks that attend the office hours will have an\nopportunity to share specific projects or proposed partnerships and learn about how\nregulators approach and consider risk management in those contexts. Regulators can also\n- 8 -\nshare their observations about effective implementation and risk-management practices\nacross the sector. Equally important, the events provide regulators an opportunity to hear\ndirectly from banks and fintech companies about challenges to innovation. The office\nhours events will also include a panel discussion on innovation topics that will help to\nprovide additional insights into new financial technologies. Our first office hours event\nwill be held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta later this month. Additional events\nare planned later in the spring and throughout the rest of the year. These are an important\nopportunity for us to learn, and I look forward to hearing your feedback on these events.\nI’d like to turn next to another step in this process—the selection of a third-party\nprovider. This step can be challenging given a lack of information about potential\npartners when many firms, and their product offerings, are new. Notably, in the 2019\nNational Survey of Community Banks, community bankers voiced a desire for more\ntransparency into third-party service providers, to inform decisions about whether to enter\ninto contracts with these providers and the type of contract that may be appropriate.3\nIn this regard, I believe the Federal Reserve should consider several possible\nsteps. First, we should explore the possibility of publishing the list of service providers\nsubject to supervision by the agencies. This could provide a starting point for community\nbanks by sharing information about the types of companies providing services to a large\nnumber of financial institutions.\nSecond, I believe we should increase transparency around our own practices.\nThrough the banking agencies’ service provider program, we regularly conduct\nexaminations for and produce independent evaluations of certain providers of critical\n 3\nSee https://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/publication/cb21publication_2019.pdf.\n- 9 -\nservices. These exams are focused on risk management, audit, and internal controls. The\nFed and other agencies have the statutory authority to oversee third-party providers that\nserve the banks they supervise. Providers that represent a significant level of risk to their\nclients are part of an interagency supervisory program. The agencies make the outcomes\nof those exams available to banks that are clients of a supervised service provider.\nI believe we can take a step further with increasing transparency on our\nsupervisory program by making information that may be useful about our supervision of\nkey service providers available to banks. This could take a number of forms, such as\nbeing more transparent about who and what we evaluate. Of course, moving forward in\nthese areas requires careful consideration and interagency collaboration, and I have asked\nour staff to work with other agencies to develop and propose workable options for giving\nbanks the benefit of the knowledge that supervisors have about their potential providers\nin an appropriate manner.\nOnce banks seeking to innovate have navigated the selection process and\nidentified a partner, they now face a complicated due-diligence process. I believe that\nregulators and supervisors have a role in easing the burden of that process for community\nbanks in several respects.\nFirst, we could help by implementing clear third-party guidance that is consistent\nacross all regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve is in the process of working with the\nother banking agencies to update our third-party guidance. I believe that the banking\nagencies should all have consistent expectations for third-party relationships, and that the\nFederal Reserve should, as a starting point, move toward adopting the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) guidance. It is incredibly inefficient to have banks\n- 10 -\nand their potential fintech partners and other vendors try to navigate unnecessary\ndifferences and inconsistencies in guidance across agencies.\nSecond, this guidance should allow banks to conduct shared due diligence on\npotential partners. If several banks use the same third-party service provider and are\nopen to collaborating, they should be allowed to pool resources instead of duplicating one\nanother’s work.\nThird, the guidance should explain what due diligence looks like for a potential\nfintech partner, because the standards applied to other third parties may not be universally\napplicable. For example, many fintech companies lack the kind of long financial history\nassociated with more traditional bank vendors. Perhaps a fintech company has been\naround for only a few years. On its own, the fact that a bank cannot evaluate more than\nfive years of the company’s financials should not necessarily stop this company from\nbeing considered as a partner. Every bank has different objectives, and potential\npartnerships are not one-size-fits-all. Regulators should especially support partnerships\nthat combine the strengths of community banks and fintech companies, which have a\ntrack record of success. The guidance should reflect some supervisory flexibility, and not\nimpede prudent, strategic partnerships between community banks and potential partners.\nFourth, in order to give community banks a better picture of what success in due\ndiligence looks like, and where it begins and ends, I also believe that we should release\nmore information on its necessary elements. This change would provide clarity and assist\ncommunity banks in completing their work. In particular, I believe that regulators can\nprovide more clarity on the types of questions that should be asked of a prospective thirdparty provider and our view of a satisfactory answer. Such a handbook would not only\n- 11 -\nhave the benefit of increasing transparency for community banks but could also be\nbeneficial for fintech companies that hope to become third-party providers.\nFinally, I know from experience that once due diligence has concluded, the\nevaluation of third-party relationships is not over. As I noted earlier, monitoring can take\nweeks of work every year for community bank employees. To be sure, this work is an\nimportant part of risk management. But I believe regulators and supervisors have a role\nto play in ensuring that the burden is tailored to bank size, risk, complexity, and capacity.\nKnowing the burden that third-party monitoring can present to employees of the smallest\nbanks, I have encouraged Federal Reserve staff to consider options for further tailoring\nour expectations for community banks with assets under $1 billion in this area. We\nshould be mindful that when we apply the same expectations to banks with starkly\ndifferent asset sizes, we are creating the same workload for a bank with about 30\nemployees as for a bank with roughly 180 employees, even though their resources and\nrisk profiles are quite different.\nClosing Remarks\nTo conclude, I believe that we can create a regulatory environment in which\ncommunity banks are empowered to innovate, in which supervisors leverage their own\nknowledge to help banks understand what to look for in a service provider. It’s a\nregulatory environment in which guidance is clear and supervisors are appropriately\nflexible, and due diligence and third-party evaluations are appropriately scaled.\nEvery bank must decide for itself whether and how to adapt their business models\nto new technologies, but supervisors and regulators can facilitate innovation at a few key\nmilestones on that path forward. First, supervisors and regulators can serve as a resource\n- 12 -\nfor banks navigating the financial technology landscape for the first time, and make\nsubject-matter experts accessible. Second, we can make the process of selecting a partner\nappropriate for a bank’s business strategy a more informed one, by being more\ntransparent about our own supervisory program for certain service providers. Third, we\ncan facilitate vetting of potential partners by allowing shared due diligence, providing in\nour guidance specific expectations for partnerships with fintech companies, and\npublishing a handbook of sound practices in due diligence. Finally, we can reduce\nburden on banks as they continue to evaluate risk at third-party providers, by rightsizing\nour expectations and sharing more information about our supervisory program. Capacity,\nin addition to complexity and size, should be considered as we continue to tailor\nsupervisory expectations.\nAs we work toward the environment I described, communication between\nregulators, supervisors, banks, and fintech partners must be frequent, and confusion about\ncompliance requirements must not be an impediment to banks who wish to partner with\nthird parties. I believe the steps I have laid out today are a promising beginning to\nmaking this regulatory environment a reality."

    "text": "Good morning. I would like to thank the Kentucky Bankers Association for the\ninvitation to join you today for your annual convention.\n1\n I appreciate the opportunity to share\nmy views on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before we engage on community banking\nissues and other matters affecting the banking industry.\nIn light of last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin\nmy remarks by providing some perspective on my vote and will then share my current views on\nthe economy and monetary policy.\nUpdate on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting\nIn order to address high inflation, for more than two years, the FOMC increased and held\nthe federal funds rate at a restrictive level. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower\nthe target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent and to\ncontinue reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nAs the post-meeting statement noted, I dissented from the FOMC’s decision, preferring\ninstead to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 5 to\n5-1/4 percent. Last Friday, once our FOMC participant communications blackout period\nconcluded, the Board of Governors released my statement explaining the decision to depart from\nthe majority of the voting members. I agreed with the Committee’s assessment that, given the\nprogress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor\nmarket, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by recalibrating the level of the federal funds\nrate and begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance of policy. As my statement\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n- 2 -\nnotes, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate while the U.S. economy remains strong\nand inflation remains a concern, despite recent progress.\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook\nIn recent months, we have seen some further progress on slowing the pace of inflation,\nwith monthly readings lower than the elevated pace seen in the first three months of the year.\nThe 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which\nprovides a broader perspective than the more volatile higher-frequency readings, has moved\ndown since April, although it came in at 2.6 percent in July, again remaining well above our\n2 percent goal. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that\n12-month core PCE inflation in August was likely a touch above the July reading. The\npersistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing prices, perhaps due in part to\nlow inventories of affordable housing. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a\nwelcome development, but core inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee’s 2 percent\ngoal.\nPrices remain much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on\nconsumer sentiment. Higher prices have an outsized effect on lower- and moderate-income\nhouseholds, as these households devote a significantly larger share of income to food, energy,\nand housing. Prices for these spending categories have far outpaced overall inflation over the\npast few years.\nEconomic growth moderated earlier this year after coming in stronger last year. Private\ndomestic final purchases (PDFP) growth has been solid and slowed much less than gross\ndomestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile\ncategories including net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than\n- 3 -\nGDP indicated. PDFP has continued to increase at a solid pace so far in the third quarter, despite\nsome further weakening in housing activity, as retail sales have shown further robust gains in\nJuly and August.\nAlthough personal consumption has remained resilient, consumers appear to be pulling\nback on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant\nspending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have extra\nsavings to support this type of spending, and we have seen loan delinquency rates normalize\nfrom historically low levels during the pandemic.\nThe most recent labor market report shows that payroll employment gains have slowed\nappreciably to a pace moderately above 100,000 per month over the three months ending in\nAugust. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent in August from 4.3 percent in July.\nWhile unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and\nbelow my and the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined further to a touch below the\nhistorically elevated pre-pandemic level—a sign that the number of available workers and the\nnumber of available jobs have come into better balance. But there are still more available jobs\nthan available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged\nperiod since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market strength despite the reported\ndata.\nAlthough wage growth has slowed further in recent months, it remains indicative of a\ntight labor market. At just under 4 percent, as measured by both the employment cost index and\n- 4 -\naverage hourly earnings, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal\ngiven trend productivity growth.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers\nentering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low.\nIn addition to some cooling in labor demand, there are other factors likely contributing the\nincreased unemployment. A mismatch between the skills of the new workers and available jobs\ncould further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven\nby the stronger supply of workers. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the\nrecent rise in the unemployment rate, as unemployment among working age teenagers sharply\nincreased in August.\nPreference for a More Measured Recalibration of Policy\nThe U.S. economy remains strong and core inflation remains uncomfortably above our\n2 percent target. In light of these economic conditions, a few further considerations supported\nthe case for a more measured approach in beginning the process to recalibrate our policy stance\nto remove restriction and move toward a more neutral setting.\nFirst, I was concerned that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate by\n1/2 percentage point could be interpreted as a signal that the Committee sees some fragility or\ngreater downside risks to the economy. In the current economic environment, with no clear\nsigns of material weakening or fragility, in my view, beginning the rate-cutting cycle with a\n1/4 percentage point move would have better reinforced the strength in economic conditions,\nwhile also confidently recognizing progress toward our goals. In my mind, a more measured\napproach would have avoided the risk of unintentionally signaling concerns about underlying\neconomic conditions.\n- 5 -\nSecond, I was also concerned that reducing the policy rate by 1/2 percentage point could\nhave led market participants to expect that the Committee would lower the target range by that\nsame pace at future meetings until the policy rate approaches a neutral level. If this expectation\nhad materialized, we could have seen an unwarranted decline in longer-term interest rates and\nbroader financial conditions could become overly accommodative. This outcome could work\nagainst the Committee’s goal of returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI am pleased that Chair Powell directly addressed both of these concerns during the press\nconference following last week’s FOMC meeting.\nThird, there continues to be a considerable amount of pent-up demand and cash on the\nsidelines ready to be deployed as the path of interest rates moves down. Bringing the policy rate\ndown too quickly carries the risk of unleashing that pent-up demand. A more measured approach\nwould also avoid unnecessarily stoking demand and potentially reigniting inflationary pressures.\nFinally, in dialing back our restrictive stance of policy, we also need to be mindful of\nwhat the end point is likely to be. My estimate of the neutral rate is much higher than it was\nbefore the pandemic. Therefore, I think we are much closer to neutral than would have been the\ncase under pre-pandemic conditions, and I did not see the peak stance of policy as restrictive to\nthe same extent that my colleagues may have. With a higher estimate of neutral, for any given\npace of rate reductions, we would arrive at our destination sooner.\nOngoing Risks to the Outlook\nTurning to the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I continue to see greater risks to price\nstability, especially while the labor market continues to be near estimates of full employment.\nAlthough the labor market data have been showing signs of cooling in recent months, stillelevated wage growth, solid consumer spending, and resilient GDP growth are not consistent\n- 6 -\nwith a material economic weakening or fragility. My contacts also continue to mention that they\nare not planning layoffs and continue to have difficulty hiring. Therefore, I am taking less signal\nfrom the recent labor market data until there are clear trends indicating that both spending\ngrowth and the labor market have materially weakened. I suspect the recent immigration flows\nhave and will continue to affect labor markets in ways that we do not yet fully understand and\ncannot yet accurately measure. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic\nsignals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking signal from\nonly a limited set of real-time data releases.\nIn my view, the upside risks to inflation remain prominent. Global supply chains\ncontinue to be susceptible to labor strikes and increased geopolitical tensions, which could result\nin inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. Expansionary fiscal\nspending could also lead to inflationary risks, as could an increased demand for housing given\nthe long-standing limited supply, especially of affordable housing. While it has not been my\nbaseline outlook, I cannot rule out the risk that progress on inflation could continue to stall.\nAlthough it is important to recognize that there has been meaningful progress on\nlowering inflation, while core inflation remains around or above 2.5 percent, I see the risk that\nthe Committee’s larger policy action could be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory\non our price-stability mandate. Accomplishing our mission of returning to low and stable\ninflation at our 2 percent goal is necessary to foster a strong labor market and an economy that\nworks for everyone in the longer term.\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that, by moving at a measured pace toward a\nmore neutral policy stance, we will be better positioned to achieve further progress in bringing\n- 7 -\ninflation down to our 2 percent target, while closely watching the evolution of labor market\nconditions.\nThe Path Forward\nDespite my dissent at the recent FOMC meeting, I respect and appreciate that my FOMC\ncolleagues preferred to begin the reduction in the federal funds rate with a larger initial cut in the\ntarget range for the policy rate. I remain committed to working together with my colleagues to\nensure that monetary policy is appropriately positioned to achieve our goals of attaining\nmaximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent target.\nI will continue to monitor the incoming data and information as I assess the appropriate\npath of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to adjusting the stance of\npolicy going forward. It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My\ncolleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and\nthe implications for and risks to the outlook guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. We need to ensure that the public understands clearly\nhow current and expected deviations of inflation and employment from our mandated goals\ninform our policy decisions.\nBy the time of our next meeting in November, we will have received updated reports on\ninflation, employment, and economic activity. We may also have a better understanding of how\ndevelopments in longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions might influence the\neconomic outlook.\nDuring the intermeeting period, I will continue to visit with a broad range of contacts to\ndiscuss economic conditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As\nI noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as a concern. In light of the upside risks that I just\n- 8 -\ndescribed, it remains necessary to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate\nwhile being attentive to the risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view\ncontinues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment\nover the longer run. However, should the data evolve in a way that points to a material\nweakening in the labor market, I would support taking action and adjust monetary policy as\nneeded while taking into account our inflation mandate.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. It is a pleasure to join you and\nto have the opportunity to discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy. And given\nthe recent FOMC meeting decision and my dissent, I appreciate being able to provide a more\ndetailed explanation of the reasoning that led me to dissent in favor of a smaller reduction in the\npolicy rate at last week’s FOMC meeting.\nI look forward to answering your questions and to engaging with your members on bank\nregulatory and supervisory matters."

    "text": "Good morning. I’m very pleased to welcome you to the second annual Financial\nInclusion Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Board.1\n Last year, at our inaugural event, I\nunderscored that financial inclusion is essential for creating an economy that works for everyone,\nwith innovation in the financial sector playing an important role.2\nThis year’s conference builds upon increased engagement across both the public and\nprivate sectors, with a collective effort to leverage technology to broaden financial service access\nand improve the financial well-being of consumers and small businesses. The Federal Reserve\nwill continue to play an important role in these efforts through its research, community\nengagement, and regulatory approach. This work supports our ability to understand and\ncommunicate the state of financial inclusion, how banks support access to affordable financial\nservices, and the role that our policies and practices play in promoting inclusion.\nProgress to Date\nBanks of all sizes are working to improve access to financial services for all Americans.\nAs I’ve noted in the past, the U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers and\nsmall businesses into the financial mainstream by providing access to safe, fair, and responsive\nfinancial products and services.3\n These efforts greatly benefit from our continued focus on\nbroader access and innovation, including understanding how our supervisory and regulatory\nframework either supports or impairs a bank’s ability to provide affordable financial services that\nare consistent with safety and soundness.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Michelle W. Bowman, “Promoting an Inclusive Financial System,” speech delivered at Financial Inclusion\nPractices and Innovations Conference at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Washington, D.C., July 9, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240709a.pdf.\n3 Bowman, “Promoting an Inclusive Financial System.”\n- 2 -\nInnovation comes in many forms. One example is through banks’ use of alternative data,\nwhich can enable banks to provide services like affordable small-dollar loans or to provide\naccess to credit invisibles who may not have access to loans and other financial services from\ntraditional lenders.4\n This growing area of focus also helps align financial service offerings with a\ncustomer’s financial goals.\nA well-functioning financial system provides a foundation for strong consumer financial\nhealth. To further this, the federal banking agencies recently published a request for information\non check and payments fraud to help address the impact of this growing problem on banks and\ntheir customers. I am committed to working together with a wide range of state and federal\npartners, including law enforcement, to address this issue.5\nA More Financially Inclusive Future\nAlthough there has been significant progress in providing access to financial services,\nthere is more work left to be done. We know that financial institutions, both small and large, are\nworking to build innovative approaches to meet their customers’ needs while maintaining the\nsafety and soundness of the banking system.\nToday’s Conference\nThe theme of this year’s conference is “Unleashing a Financially Inclusive Future.”\nToday, we will hear from a number of experts that will help to explore what the future might hold\n4 For more details on regulations related to alternative data use in credit underwriting and small-dollar lending, see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit\nUnderwriting,” CA letter 19-11 (December 12, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm, and Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar Loans,” SR letter 20-14/CA\n20-8 (May 20, 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2014.htm.\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment to Address Payments and Check\nFraud,” press release, June 16, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250616a.htm.\n- 3 -\nfor financial inclusion. Our next presenter, Jo Ann Barefoot from the Alliance for Innovative\nRegulation, will discuss the role of banking industry innovation and policies in support of\nfinancial inclusion. Later in the day we will hear from three panels focused on topics including\nevolving products and practices, the role of mission-driven organizations, and how cross-border\npayment innovations can facilitate the movement of money around the world.\nI would like to thank you all for joining us today and I will turn it over to Art Lindo,\nDeputy Director and Head of Policy in the Board’s Division of Supervision & Regulation, to\nintroduce Jo Ann Barefoot.\nThank you for the opportunity to join you virtually today, and for your ongoing\ncommitment to support a financially inclusive future."

    "text": "Thank you to the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) for inviting me to address this year's policy summit. I am delighted to be speaking with you and especially pleased to see the summit's focus on innovation. The ThinkTech accelerator represents the type of resourcefulness necessary to help community banks tackle their greatest challenges, among them ensuring that banking services and credit support are available to customers in all communities, regardless of where they are located. Today, I will share my perspective that technological innovation is essential to the future of community banking in America, and reiterate my intent to elevate those issues related to innovation to the top of the regulatory agenda.\n\nThere are certain points in history when an event can fundamentally change how society and entire industries function. In addition to the other ways that COVID-19 has affected us, this could be one of those moments. The pandemic has demonstrated the importance and unique role of technology in responding effectively to new challenges. In this case, the challenge has been an unprecedented disruption in our lives. One year ago, it would have been difficult to imagine the extent to which we are now working and conducting routine aspects of our lives from home and online.\n\nTake health care as an example. One recent report on telemedicine trends notes that the number of patients treated through video-enabled physician visits has increased between 50 percent and 175 percent compared to before the pandemic.1 While virtual consultations with a health care professional haven't replaced physical examinations and medical procedures, they are serving a vital role in the industry's response to the pandemic and they will likely play a significant role in how the health-care industry serves its customers in the future. When this health emergency has come to an end, I expect that telehealth, home grocery delivery, and a variety of online services and communications will continue at a higher frequency than before our recent experience.\n\nIn the financial sector, I believe we may be seeing a quantum leap in the use of digital deposit, digital payments and online lending. One large financial service provider reported a 200 percent increase in new mobile banking registrations during the early phases of the pandemic.2 Customers who reacted to the physical limitation on visiting a bank branch or ATM are learning to bank using online banking or through an app on their smartphone may not be as willing to stand in line or wait for in-person service at their bank branch in the future. Recent surveys show that consumers with access to digital and mobile banking are more likely to continue using those convenience products and services in a post-pandemic world.3\n\nThe adoption of digital banking services can also be essential for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities, assuming they have bank accounts and access to internet-based tools like smartphones. In some cases, fintech can lower costs and improve services, particularly for small businesses or lower-income consumers who are less likely to have access to credit. While electronic banking certainly didn't start with the pandemic, acceleration of its adoption has undoubtedly led banks of all sizes to rethink how they will meet their customers' needs in the long term.\n\nI have noted on many occasions how vital community banks are to those they serve and to a strong and stable financial system. Successful innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies. It involves aligning a bank's strategy with its innovation plans to clearly map a purpose and desired outcome for the adoption of new technology. The continued success of many community banks depends on their willingness to engage in strategy-based innovation-led growth. We have seen and are encouraged by many examples of entrepreneurial community banks embracing technological innovation. Developments such as digital deposit and lending products, regulatory technology solutions, and application program interfaces (APIs) have increasingly become more popular in the banking industry. When implemented effectively, they can result in greater efficiencies and effectiveness.\n\nA number of community banks have already taken advantage of these opportunities. Still, perspectives on the need for change vary across the industry. I recognize that while it seems clear that the industry is changing, there remains a wide distance between fintech's promise of a future driven by technology and what many community bankers experience today. From my perspective, it is unlikely that fintech will ever completely eliminate what is the hallmark of community banking—personal interaction and building relationships with customers and communities.\n\nOne trend is clear, however: more and more community banks are expressing interest in fintech partners to help them open new lines of business, help with customer acquisition, enhance customer service, and improve operational functions. Through the Fed's engagement with fintech companies and small banks during our Innovation Office Hours, we learned that a wide range of partnership models are emerging, with varying benefits and challenges. Some banks are engaged in customer-oriented partnerships, where a bank selects a fintech partner to improve the customer experience, develop new products or services, or acquire new customers. In one case, a bank partnered with a fintech company to centralize each customer's financial data and provide personal financial management tools. Other banks are engaging fintech partners to automate or improve the efficiency and effectiveness of compliance and regulatory processes, which is often referred to as \"regtech.\" For example, a fintech partner automating the Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money-laundering process may be able to provide notable cost savings and enhance compliance, while freeing up resources for other areas. We have also seen instances where a bank offers its financial services to a fintech partner that, in turn, offers financial products or services to its customers. In this type of relationship, a bank plays an important part in the delivery of products and services. The list goes on. My point is there is great possibility and a wide variety of options for engagement. And everyone, from the banks to customers to the regulators, needs to be thinking about these changes and their implications.\n\nWith the emergence of additional core-service providers, we are also seeing more opportunities for community banks to access the technology infrastructure they need to improve basic banking activities. These basic banking activities include tasks like reconciling transactions to the general ledger or simply offering expanded digital services. Furthermore, there are new opportunities for integration of cloud-based platforms and APIs. Community banks should take advantage of the new technologies that make sense for their business and the communities they serve.\n\nStill, even as community banks prepare for the future, there is the very real challenge of finding partners and knowing how to navigate the regulatory environment once an institution has identified a potential partnership arrangement. We certainly understand this concern. From the fintech perspective, one provider noted the challenges they face during the onboarding process with financial institutions, including struggles to navigate siloed compliance and risk-management functions. Participants in the Fed's Innovation Office Hours told us that they would benefit from the Fed broadly sharing information on the current landscape of such partnerships, on a range of practices, and on relevant guidance for banks to consider.\n\nIn response, early next year we plan to publish a white paper that documents examples of community bank partnerships with fintech companies and outlines effective practices for managing those arrangements. This white paper would describe a range of distinct options for such partnerships and seek to identify benefits and challenges of the different approaches. We are also continuing to pursue a range of community bank projects to provide pathways to innovation that I mentioned earlier this year.\n\nWhile it is essential to safety and soundness that banks understand, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with their third parties, I am sensitive to the burden that due diligence can pose. Being unsure of the questions to ask a third-party vendor, or whether a response is sufficient, should not keep community banks from accessing innovation, yet we continue to hear that these are real challenges. To address this problem, I have directed Federal Reserve staff to work with their interagency colleagues to develop a vendor due diligence guide, aligned with existing supervisory expectations, which would include sample questions for vendors and guidance on appropriate responses. This guide would also be specific about the documents and information that community banks need in order to successfully complete their due diligence.\n\nIn addition to the due diligence guide, I expect that Federal Reserve staff will work with our colleagues at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to enhance and align interagency guidance for third-party risk management. The guidance would eliminate the need for community banks to navigate multiple supervisory guidance documents on the same issue. It is my expectation that the combination of refreshed and aligned interagency guidance and the community bank due diligence guide will meaningfully enhance clarity on supervisory expectations for community bank partnerships with fintech companies.\n\nThere are also opportunities within our existing supervisory program to improve our regulatory response to innovation, without creating additional burden for community banks. The federal banking agencies' service provider supervision program plays an important role in assessing the rigor of risk management and controls at key service providers. It is important that reports of supervisory assessments be readily available to banks that rely on service providers so that banks can use the reports to support their third-party risk management. Since I last spoke about the program in February, the federal regulatory agencies have made notable progress in creating a process to automatically distribute those reports to all client banks. Proactively sending reports to community banks removes the inefficient step of each bank hunting for reports on their own. For banks supervised by the Fed, the aim is to begin automatic distribution in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nFinally, I would note that as we consider the types of financial services technology that may be useful to the banks we supervise, our rules and guidance need to keep pace. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning in banking might require an adjustment in regulation and supervision. AI is becoming more prevalent in customer service and machine learning can offer real opportunities to assess risk and find new customers.\n\nCommunity banks face limits on the resources they can dedicate to researching and evaluating third party providers of these new services. Regulators and supervisors should consider ways to encourage innovation by simplifying the process of third party selection, due diligence and monitoring.4 To that end, staff from the Federal Reserve and other agencies have been jointly conducting significant outreach to industry and other stakeholders over the past several months. We want to hear from you. In addition to this outreach, a conference planned for January, 2021 will include views from academic researchers on the potential benefits and risks posed by artificial intelligence for banks of all sizes.\n\nTechnological innovation holds great promise to help community banks compete and succeed in the evolving financial services landscape. I look forward to continuing to engage on these issues in 2021 and to work with the ICBA and other stakeholders to foster an environment where communities and the banks that serve them continue to thrive.\n\n1.

    "text": "Good afternoon.1\n It is a pleasure to join you for today’s meeting of the Forum Club of\nthe Palm Beaches. It is truly humbling for me to be invited to speak to your membership, in the\ncompany of the many influential leaders, authors, and other public figures this organization has\nhosted since its founding in 1976.\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks today, I want to briefly share with you a\nbit about my background. I am one of the longest serving members currently on the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), having served as a Board member since\nNovember 26, 2018. As a member of the Board, I am a permanent voting member of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) and serve in other capacities—I lead the Board committees on\nsmaller and community banks and on consumer and community affairs and serve as a member\non other committees that broadly address supervision and regulation and payments. I also\nprovide input into the full range of matters that come before the Board.\nI am the first Governor appointed to fill the role created by Congress for someone with\ndemonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks, banks with less\nthan $10 billion in assets.2 I have been both a banker, working in the community bank owned\nand operated by my family since 1882, and a bank supervisor—as the Kansas State Bank\nCommissioner. Early in my career, I spent almost a decade working in public service in several\nfederal government roles, including setting up the Department of Homeland Security after\n9/11 and as a Deputy Assistant Secretary and policy advisor to the first Homeland Security\nSecretary, Tom Ridge. I also served as a counsel on several U.S. House Committees, and as a\nstaff member for the former U.S. Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole.\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2\n See 12 U.S.C. § 241.\n- 2 -\nThese experiences have provided me with a uniquely broad perspective about the role of\ngovernment and the functioning of the U.S. economy—from the view of a regulated business, an\nexecutive branch agency, the legislative branch, and state and federal regulatory agencies.\nThroughout my career, but particularly in my current role as a member of the Board of\nGovernors, I have approached my responsibilities in an independent way, relying on facts,\nanalysis, my own experience and judgment, and the pursuit of the congressionally mandated\ngoals that guide the work of the Board.\nIn some cases, this approach has led me to depart from the views of my colleagues. At its\nSeptember meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, for the\nfirst time since we began tightening to combat inflation, by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to\n5 percent. I dissented from that decision, preferring instead to lower the target range by\n1/4 percentage point. In my statement published after the meeting, I agreed with the\nCommittee’s assessment that, given the progress we have seen since the middle of 2023 on both\nlowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was appropriate to reflect this progress by\nbeginning the process of recalibrating the policy stance toward a more neutral setting. As my\nstatement noted, I preferred a smaller initial cut in the policy rate. With inflation continuing to\nhover well above our 2 percent goal, I saw the risk that the Committee’s large policy action\nmight be interpreted as a premature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. In\naddition, with the U.S. economy remaining strong, moving the policy rate down too quickly, in\nmy view, would carry the risk of stoking demand unnecessarily and potentially reigniting\ninflationary pressures.\nMy dissent was notable in that the last dissenting vote from a Fed Board member on an\nFOMC vote occurred nearly 20 years ago. My dissent was guided by my view and interpretation\n- 3 -\nof the available data and my understanding of the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment\nand stable prices, which I will discuss more in a moment.\nEveryone in this room knows that experience is important. My experiences have shaped\nand reinforced my views on how policymakers can best serve the public—narrowly, including in\nmonetary policy decisionmaking and the regulation of the banking industry, but also more\nbroadly in thinking about policymaking in support of an agency’s mission balanced with its\nextensive impact on the affected industry and the U.S. economy.\nA Pragmatic Approach to Policymaking\nA Goal-Oriented Approach\nIn the past, I have discussed the role of policymaking from the perspective of a Federal\nReserve Board member. But taking a step back, there are some broader themes relevant to\nagency policymaking more generally, themes that are useful beyond the context of the Federal\nReserve. At a basic level, I think of this as a pragmatic approach. It requires tradeoffs to balance\nregulation while also not inhibiting economic growth.\nThe first question I like to ask when confronted with a policy issue is, “Why are we\nhere?” You may recognize this question from Philosophy 101, but this question also applies to\nthe exercise of executive authority by regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve has extensive\nresponsibilities, and equally extensive powers, but it must exercise these powers only in\nfurtherance of specific goals established by statute. The sheer scope of the Fed’s powers can\npresent a temptation to go beyond the statutory authority. For example, to play a more active\nrole in the allocation of credit, or to displace other sources of bank funding even when market\nsources of liquidity are functioning well. It could also include the temptation to venture into\npolicy matters unrelated to the Fed’s responsibilities that are better addressed by Congress or\nother policymakers (here, a push for banking sector climate change related regulation comes to\n- 4 -\nmind). The goals Congress has laid out for the Fed are complicated and important. Congress\nshould not expect the Federal Reserve, or any other agency for that matter, to solve problems\nbeyond that agency’s limited purpose. Doing so would contravene the intent and authority of\nCongress.\nTo begin, I will provide a few concrete examples of how the starting point for policy is\nthe agency’s mission, including in: (1) the execution of monetary policy, and (2) the conduct of\nbanking regulation and supervision.\nIn conducting monetary policy, Congress has given us the dual mandate of maximum\nemployment and price stability. Achieving these goals has often proven challenging, particularly\nover the last several years, as these policy objectives can sometimes be in tension. Policy actions\nto tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal funds rate, can have an adverse\neffect on employment. A critical input to the FOMC decisionmaking process is an analysis of\neconomic conditions and outlook. The real economy continues to be strong, with solid\nmomentum in economic activity, robust household spending and business investment, and a\nhealthy labor market that remains near full employment. Although economic conditions have\nbeen supportive of our employment mandate, they have been unsatisfying for our price stability\nmandate as inflation continues to be elevated.\nWe have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress\nseems to have stalled in recent months. The 12-month measure of core personal consumption\nexpenditures inflation—which excludes food and energy prices—has moved sideways at around\n2.7 percent since May, and the latest consumer and producer price index reports point to a\nsimilarly elevated or even higher reading for October. The persistently high core inflation\n- 5 -\nlargely reflects pressures on housing services prices, perhaps due to an increase in demand for\naffordable housing and an inelastic supply.\nGross domestic product (GDP) increased at a solid pace in the third quarter, maintaining\nthe momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be driven by private\ndomestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in particular, strongly\nincreased last quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in housing activity due to high\nmortgage rates. Retail sales continued to rise in October, even though Hurricanes Helene and\nMilton may have exerted a small drag on sales last month. The annual revision of the national\nincome and product accounts confirmed that GDP has been providing the right signal about the\nongoing strength in economic activity, as gross domestic income and personal income were\nrevised up considerably for 2023 and the first half of this year.\nThe October employment report seems to have been affected by the recent hurricanes and\nthe Boeing strike. It also featured the lowest response rate to the payroll survey in decades.\nAfter accounting for these special factors, it seems that payroll employment continued to\nincrease in October at a pace close to the average monthly gain seen in the second and third\nquarters. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1 percent in October, down from\n4.3 percent in July. The labor force participation rate remains well below pre-pandemic levels\nand edged down further in October due to lower prime-age participation. While unemployment is\nnotably higher than a year ago, it is still at a historically low level and below my and the\nCongressional Budget Office’s estimates of full employment.\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few years.\nThe ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has been close to the historically elevated prepandemic level in recent months. But there are still more available jobs than available workers, a\n- 6 -\ncondition that before 2018 has only occurred twice for a prolonged period since World War II,\nfurther signaling ongoing labor market strength. Wage growth has slowed further in recent\nmonths, but it continues to indicate a tight labor market.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers\nentering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs remain low.\nIn addition to some cooling in labor demand, a mismatch between the skills of the new workers\nand available jobs could further raise unemployment, suggesting that higher unemployment has\nbeen partly driven by the stronger supply of workers.\nMonetary Policy\nIn the monetary policy function, we rely on the best data available, but without question\nthe data are imperfect. We also consider a range of possible future economic conditions to help\ninform our monetary policy decisionmaking, which requires that we make assumptions and\npredictions about the future. Looking back over time, our crystal ball has never been perfect at\npredicting the risks that may emerge, how those risks may influence economic conditions, and\nhow that should be considered in analyzing our monetary policy goals. To illustrate this point in\nterms of recent events, we have not yet met our inflation goal and, as I noted earlier, progress in\nlowering inflation appears to have stalled.\nI see greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor\nmarket remains near full employment, but it is also possible that we could see a deterioration in\nlabor market conditions. These predictions always come with a dose of humility, however,\nparticularly because they rely on imperfect data. The labor market data have become\nincreasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other measurements struggle to incorporate\nlarge numbers of new workers and to account for other influences that we do not yet fully\n- 7 -\nunderstand and have not yet been able to accurately measure. As the dynamics of immigration\nand business creation and closures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to\nunderstand the payroll employment data. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting\neconomic signals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking\nsignal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\nWhile the mandate for monetary policy is straightforward, its execution is complex. Our\ndecisions are guided by our dual mandate, but arriving at them entails careful analysis of\nsometimes flawed data, and informed judgments about unknowable future conditions.\nBank Regulation and Supervision\nIn conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve promotes the safe\nand sound operation of individual banks, and the stability of the broader financial system. These\nbank regulatory goals have obvious synergies—individual banks operating in a safe and sound\nmanner tends to create conditions that promote financial stability in the banking sector. The\nFed’s bank regulatory objectives include implicit tradeoffs: we aim to foster a banking system\nthat is safe, sound, and efficient, while serving the U.S. economy, and facilitating economic\ngrowth. The objectives must also support the full breadth of the banking system from the very\nlargest to the very smallest.\nStriking a balance among these competing goals can certainly be a challenge, and policy\nviews on where that balance should be struck may vary. We should approach the task of bank\nregulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs, coupled with an affirmative\nacknowledgment that the banking system is an important driver of business formation, economic\nexpansion, and opportunity. A banking system that is safe and sound yet irrelevant would not\nfulfill our regulatory objectives, but would be the inevitable outcome of following a path that\n- 8 -\nstrives for elimination of risks rather than promotion of effective risk management. Banks are\nunique individual businesses, not public utilities.\nThe pursuit of these bank regulatory goals requires an approach that considers a range of\nregulatory and supervisory tools, from the quantitative—like the setting of bank capital and\nliquidity requirements—to the more subjective—like evaluating bank management during the\nexamination process. And while the goals themselves seem straightforward, the tools available\nand the complexity and evolution of the financial system over time present real challenges from\na policymaking perspective.\nWhen we consider drafting a new regulation, we should always ask “What problem\nwould this new regulation solve?” Policymakers should exercise restraint in the promulgation of\na new regulation, by articulating the problem it purports to solve and presenting an efficient way\nto address it. Identifying the problem that requires addressing often poses one of the most\nsignificant challenges. Ideally, the process would begin by identifying the problem, then move\nto an analysis of whether proposed solutions are within the agency’s statutory authorities, and\nfinally whether targeted changes to the regulatory framework could result in improvements,\nremediation of gaps, or elimination of redundant and unnecessary requirements.\nBut for a number of reasons, the problem identification process can result in\nmisidentification of issues, and a resulting failure to prioritize the most important ones. Take for\nexample the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the regulatory response. At its root, this\nbank’s failure exposed significant flaws in the bank’s management and the regulators’ oversight\nand supervision. The interest rate and funding risks, rapid growth, and the idiosyncratic business\nmodel and concentrated customer base of the bank, were apparent and obvious. These risks were\nmismanaged by SVB and not acted on early enough by bank supervisors.\n- 9 -\nThese were not the only factors contributing to the firm’s failure, but these critical\nelements should have been the key priorities for the supervisory function to address after the\nbank’s failure. And yet in the aftermath of SVB’s demise, we have focused on regulatory\nproposals ranging from substantial increases in bank capital requirements, to pushing down\nglobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements to much smaller firms,\nfinding supervisory deficiencies in the management of well-capitalized and financially sound\nfirms, and considering widespread changes to the funding and liquidity requirements and\nexpectations that apply to all banks.\nA crisis is not a regulatory blank check. In some ways, it presents heightened risks that\nshould prompt us to show our work even more carefully. A deliberate, transparent, and factbased approach to pursuing statutory objectives also serves the goal of avoiding the impression\nof pursuing unrelated policy goals, particularly those that venture into political concerns outside\nof an agency’s purposes or functions. Promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability should\nnot devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit—picking winners and losers—or\npromoting an ideological position through more open-ended processes like bank supervision and\nexamination.\nEffective and Efficient Solutions\nOnce we have a clear and thorough understanding of our statutory objectives and have a\nframework to identify issues, gaps, or redundancies, the next task is to focus on finding efficient\nsolutions to those issues. In doing so, we should consider policy alternatives and perspectives\nthat may differ from our past approach. We should also acknowledge that we may not have all\nthe facts or information necessary to immediately identify an effective solution. Successful\npolicymaking requires openness and humility, caution, and a deliberate approach.\n- 10 -\nWith respect to monetary policy, uncertainty surrounding available data and the many\nvariables that can affect future economic conditions suggest that we should pursue a cautious\napproach. At the most recent meeting in November, the Committee decided to take an additional\nstep along the path of moving toward a more neutral policy setting. I agreed to support this\naction, since it aligns with my preference to lower the policy rate gradually, especially in light of\nelevated inflation and the uncertainty about the level of the neutral rate.\nMy estimate of the neutral policy rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic,\nand therefore we may be closer to a neutral policy stance than we currently think. I would prefer\nto proceed cautiously in bringing the policy rate down to better assess how far we are from the\nend point, while recognizing that we have not yet achieved our inflation goal and closely\nwatching the evolution of the labor market. We should also not rule out the risk that the policy\nrate may attain or even fall below its neutral level before we achieve our price stability goal.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC\nmeeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the\nimplications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed’s dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. During each intermeeting period, we typically receive\na range of economic data and information. In addition to closely watching the incoming data,\nI meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic conditions as I assess the\nappropriateness of our monetary policy stance. Especially in light of the data measurement\nchallenges that I mentioned earlier, engaging with contacts helps me interpret the signals\nprovided by the data and gain a better understanding of how the economy is evolving.\nConsistent with this pragmatic approach, I am pleased that the November post meeting\nstatement included a flexible, data-dependent approach, providing the Committee with\n- 11 -\noptionality in deciding future policy adjustments. As I noted earlier, my view is that inflation\nremains a concern, and I continue to see price stability as essential for fostering a strong labor\nmarket and an economy that works for everyone in the longer term.\nIn banking regulation, this pragmatic approach requires us to consider the costs and\nbenefits of any proposed change, as well as incentive effects, impacts on markets, and potential\nunintended consequences. But it also means that we must consider the limits of regulatory\nresponsibility—grounded by our statutory objectives—when taking regulatory action. In my\nview, these considerations apply beyond Federal Reserve policymaking to regulatory actions\ntaken by any agency.\nAs I noted previously, statutory mandates guiding the Fed’s bank regulatory\nresponsibilities provide an important grounding for agency action. But they must be viewed in\nthe broader context of promoting an effective and efficient banking system that supports market\nfunctioning and encourages economic growth, business creation and expansion, and opportunity.\nOur responsibility is not to look only at whether a proposal will promote greater safety and\nsoundness, but to consider the broader context, including whether regulatory incentives will\nskew the allocation of credit, adversely affect capital markets, or push traditional banking\nactivities outside of the banking system into less regulated non-banks.\nIs the bank regulatory framework efficient? Does it allow banks sufficient freedom and\nflexibility to operate and meet customer needs? And importantly, are there areas within the\napproach to regulation and supervision that simply cannot be justified based on a cost-benefit\nanalysis? The answer to the latter is “Yes.” There are a number of areas where right-sizing\nregulation and our supervisory approach would be appropriate and can be done in a way that\ndoes not sacrifice safety and soundness or threaten financial stability.\n- 12 -\nRegulation is most effective when it strikes an appropriate balance between competing\ngoals and objectives. In the banking system, this means operating in a safe, sound, and\nfinancially stable way, while also supporting economic growth and efficiency. When we fail to\nconsider this broader context, we risk disincentivizing growth, imposing overly burdensome and\nunnecessary regulations, setting opaque and unreasonable expectations through the supervisory\nprocess, and forcing the inefficient allocation of capital.\nSometimes this debate escapes from the dusty offices of the banking regulators into plain\nview, as during the past year on the Basel III Endgame package of bank capital reforms. While\nthis proposal prompted extensive comment from a wide range of commenters, it also inspired a\nnegative television and radio advertising campaign, which is unprecedented for a relatively\ntechnical bank regulatory issue. But these ads highlighted an uncomfortable truth: the\nregulatory approach we took failed to consider or deliver a reasonable proposal, one aligned with\nthe original Basel agreement yet suited to the particulars of the U.S. banking system. Instead, the\nproposal released last year opted for significant capital increases for some banks, in excess of\n20 percent, departing significantly from the approach adopted by our international counterparts.\nThis public engagement has been useful, and it seems to have softened some of the overcalibrated positions underpinning the original capital reform proposal. But this level of public\nengagement and debate was also a byproduct of the rulemaking process. While regulatory\noverreach can threaten the credibility of agency action in the eyes of the public, a transparent\nprocess allows public commenters to pressure test and pushback on agency action.\nHowever, when agencies overwhelm the process by publishing thousands of pages of\nrulemakings in a short period of time, the public’s ability to provide meaningful feedback on our\nrules is compromised. Last year the federal financial agencies published over 5,000 pages of\n- 13 -\nrules and proposals. And yet, even when the public is able to comment on these voluminous\nproposals, regulators often ignore this constructive feedback and move forward to publish final\nrules with minimal or no changes relative to their proposals, as with the Community\nReinvestment Act rule.\nMaintenance of an existing regulatory framework is not glamorous but is perhaps one of\nthe more important agency functions to ensure that the framework is striking the right balance\nbetween promoting a strong banking system and supporting economic growth. This requires\nreviewing and updating regulations to ensure that prior agency actions continue to address\nproblems efficiently as industries and conditions change.3\n When agencies prioritize the creation\nof new regulation in the absence of a statutory mandate, harmful and unintended consequences\ncan result. One such example is the adverse effects of regulatory constraints on Treasury market\nfunctioning. Rules like the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, the G-SIB Surcharge, and the\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio pose known and identified constraints on the Treasury market that may\ncontribute to future stress and market disruption if left unaddressed.\nFinally, while transparency—like that intended by the rulemaking process—can lead to\nbetter public engagement and outcomes, it is important that agency actions are transparent even\nwhen not legally mandated. The most obvious opportunity for additional transparency in the\nbanking framework is in supervision. Supervision by its nature involves confidential and\ndetailed inquiries into bank operations, with examiners evaluating quantitative measures like\ncapital and liquidity, while making judgmental assessments of the activities and risks of the\n3\n In February, the Board announced the initiation of its review of its regulations to identify those regulations that are\noutdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome in accordance with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork\nReduction Act. See Michelle W. Bowman (2024), “Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman on the Review of\nthe Board’s Regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996\n(EGRPRA)” press release, February 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240206a1.htm.\n- 14 -\ninstitution, and its risk-management approach. Supervisory expectations should not surprise\nregulated firms, and yet transparency of these expectations is often challenging to achieve. In\nfact, since the failure of SVB supervisory surprises have become more common in bank\nexaminations.\nIn light of the recent Supreme Court cases regarding agency actions, agencies should\nrespond in a way that furthers the goals of transparency and accountability, and act as a check on\nregulatory overreach. The elimination of Chevron deference has the potential to transform\nagency rulemakings positively—in a way that promotes the pragmatic approach I outlined in this\ndiscussion. The same considerations we follow in the pursuit of our statutory objectives could\nhelp support rulemakings that are built upon a stronger factual and analytical basis, with a\nthorough and more comprehensive explanation of an agency’s policy approach.\nClosing Thoughts\nWhile my remarks today have largely focused on Federal Reserve responsibilities, a\npragmatic approach has broader applicability. Agencies can build public support for their\nactivities by following these simple principles—a rigorous focus on statutory objectives, a\nfoundation based on facts and careful analysis in forming policy, crafting efficient solutions, and\npublic transparency and accountability. Agencies and their regulated businesses will benefit\nfrom a rigorous process that considers different perspectives, the intended and unintended\nconsequences of decisions, and the costs and benefits of actions. The ability of the banking\nsystem to finance the future growth of the U.S. economy hinges upon our ability and willingness\nto shift our approach to regulation and supervisory oversight. A pragmatic approach to\npolicymaking will better enable the U.S. economy to continue to grow now and into the future. "

    "text": "Congratulations on what I have no doubt was a productive and thought-provoking day,\nthough one, I am sure, that also underscored the many remaining challenges for women and\nminorities in the professions of economics and finance. I want to thank our hosts, the European\nCentral Bank, who put so much work into making this conference a success, as well as the\nconference organizers from all three sponsoring institutions—the ECB, Federal Reserve, and the\nBank of England. I also want to express my appreciation to the many researchers from\nuniversities and from other central banks, as well as the members of women’s and minority\ncommittees of economics and finance associations from around the world, who are attending the\nconference in Frankfurt. I wish that I could have been there with you to participate in the\ndiscussions.\nI found the conference program to be particularly interesting, and I look forward to Federal\nReserve staff coming back to Washington to share what they learned from the research and\ndiscussions. At the Federal Reserve, we greatly value this conference, not only for the\ninteractions that our staff have while they are there, but also when they bring back what they\nlearn and share it with our staff. Last year, we had over 200 staff members from across the\norganization attend summary presentations in DC given by several staff members who had\nattended the conference in London. In fact, staff in Washington had a “watch party” to view the\nwebcast of today’s panels. The topics of today’s conference, including papers on the promotion\nof women, the role of culture and institutions, and the dynamics of publishing, conferences, and\nseminars, will all spur additional conversations and ideas for action among staff at the Federal\nReserve.\nIn my view, central banks have a responsibility to be leaders in addressing diversity and\ninclusion, not only for our own institutions, but also because of our influence on the profession\nas a whole. Part of the value of this conference is that we, as central banks, can promote the\nstudy of these issues and discuss concrete steps that we can take together to address them.\nCertainly, we take diversity and inclusion issues to heart at the Federal Reserve.1\n We believe\nthat the best ideas, policies and, ultimately, service to the public are the result of diverse\nperspectives, and from a staff that reflects the rich diversity of our nation. Inclusion makes us\nstronger by providing all employees the assurance that they will be working in an environment\nthat welcomes and values their differences, and that recognizes and rewards people according to\nthe contributions they make in advancing the mission of the organization. That is not to say that\nwe have all of the solutions, or that we do not have considerable progress to make. But we have\nmade efforts in a number of areas. These efforts are consistent with the Congressional directive\nto establish the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, and as articulated in the Board of\nGovernors’ Strategic Plan for Diversity and Inclusion.2\nFirst, we have made a commitment, and have made progress, to make our institution more\ndiverse. That includes efforts to bring greater diversity to the Board of Directors of our Federal\nReserve Banks and Branches as well as to senior leadership in the Federal Reserve System. We\nhave also worked to improve our internal culture. These efforts include re-establishing and\nstrengthening employee resource groups. We are working to come up with codes of conduct\nincluding efforts to make our meetings more inclusive and set rules around behavior in seminars.\nWe are also providing diversity and inclusion as well as bystander training to both new and\nexisting employees.\nSecond, we have broadened our reach in recruiting to provide a more diverse range of\napplicants the opportunity to apply for positions at the Federal Reserve—through strengthening\n 1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/diversityinclusion.htm 2 https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/minority-women-inclusion.htm\nour connections to schools that serve diverse populations, hiring an outreach specialist for these\ncommunities, establishing a stronger presence at career fairs for diverse students, and hosting\ncareer events for students to promote jobs in economics and finance at the Federal Reserve.\nThird, we are working with high schools and universities to inspire students’ interest in\neconomics and finance. We are also working to provide them with the tools they need to enter\nthese fields. This has included partnerships with local high schools to teach economics, and with\na local Historically Black University, Howard University, to teach and mentor students in\neconomics and statistical analysis.

I will first offer some observations regarding the benefits and costs of largescale asset purchases (LSAPs) by reflecting on the two episodes of the Federal Reserve’s\nactive use of the balance sheet in U.S. monetary policy following the 2008 financial crisis\nand during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the importance of\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I would like to thank Rebecca Zarutskie for\nassistance in preparing these remarks and Neeco Beltran for assistance in preparing the figure.\n- 2 -\nlonger-term interest rates for broader asset prices and for investment and consumption\ndecisions, the FOMC used both forward guidance and LSAPs to help lower longer-term\nrates, which had not yet moved to zero. The intent of forward guidance was to lower\nlonger-term interest rates by shifting expectations of “low-for-long” short-term interest\nrates in line with a low-for-long federal funds rate. LSAPs, or quantitative easing (QE),\nwere intended to reduce longer-term interest rates further by lowering the yields of\nspecific longer-dated securities being purchased and by reducing more generally the term\npremia, the compensation that investors must earn to incentivize investment in a longerterm bond relative to a short-term bond. LSAPs could also reinforce the FOMC’s\nforward guidance of low-for-long short-term interest rates. Such reinforcement of lowfor-long forward guidance could be especially powerful if the FOMC communicated that\nit would not consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate until it stopped\nactively engaging in asset purchases for the purposes of QE.\nThe Federal Reserve purchased both Treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities (MBS) as part of its QE programs from 2009 to 2014. Figure 1 shows\nthe evolution of the Federal Reserve balance sheet assets and liabilities from before the\n2008 financial crisis to the present. The Fed’s Treasury and agency securities holdings\nincreased from around half a trillion dollars to around $4.25 trillion by the end of the\nthird round of QE, which ended in 2014. A range of studies indicate that the Fed’s asset\npurchases were effective in raising the prices of and lowering the yields on the targeted\nclass of securities.2\n Research suggests that these asset purchases also helped lower term\n2 See, for example, Mark Carlson, Stefania D’Amico, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, Bernd Schlusche, and Paul\nWood (2020), “Issues in the Use of the Balance Sheet Tool,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2020-071 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.071; Stefania D’Amico and Thomas B.

In 2017, the Fed began to reduce its securities holdings, which\nis often referred to as quantitative tightening (QT). In January 2019, the FOMC voted to\noperate monetary policy in an “ample reserves” environment.\n6\n This change in the policy\nimplementation framework had the effect of keeping the size of the balance sheet much\nlarger and providing more liquidity to the banking system in normal times than had been\nthe case before the financial crisis. The FOMC ended QT in August 2019, and balance\nsheet growth resumed in October 2019 through the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills and\nsecurities following a brief period of stress in money markets in which the interest rates\non repurchase agreements and other short-term funding instruments jumped, as noted by\nthe line labeled “Repo Spike” in figure 1. This stress was interpreted as an indication that\nthe level of reserves had fallen below ample levels.7\n\nOverall, one could deem the post–financial crisis use of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet as a monetary policy tool as a success. Unemployment fell and inflation\nremained near 2 percent through the period over which LSAPs were conducted. The\nFOMC was able to end LSAPs and eventually was able to partially unwind them, though\nthe overall terminal size of the Fed’s securities holdings as a share of GDP following the\nend of QT was much greater than before the financial crisis. This much larger end state\n6 See the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which\nis available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policynormalization.htm. 7 See the October 2019 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n- 5 -\nwas a direct result of the FOMC’s decision to implement monetary policy in an amplereserves operating framework and had the effect of lowering the likelihood of future\nvolatility in short-term funding markets.8\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic balance sheet policy\nGiven the effectiveness of the balance sheet as a monetary policy tool over the\nprevious decade, the FOMC rapidly deployed LSAPs in March 2020 as part of its\nresponse to the pandemic.9\n These purchases followed the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic at that time, and the FOMC returned the federal funds rate to its effective lower\nbound. Following an initial higher level of Treasury and agency MBS purchases\nmotivated both by restoring market functioning following a period of severe stress and by\nproviding monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC began to purchase $80 billion of\nTreasury securities and $40 billion of agency MBS per month. In its December 2020\npost-meeting statement, the FOMC communicated that it intended to continue this pace\nof asset purchases “until substantial further progress has been made toward the\nCommittee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.”10 By the end of the\npandemic period asset purchases, total securities held by the Federal Reserve stood at\naround $8.5 trillion.\n8 At the end of balance sheet runoff, the Fed’s securities holdings totaled around $3.6 trillion. The FOMC\nhad considered other types of operating regimes, including those that would result in a lower level of\nsecurities holdings in the longer run. See, for example, the discussion in the November 2018 FOMC\nminutes, which can be found on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. 9 The Federal Reserve also implemented 13 emergency lending and liquidity facilities under its emergency\nlending authorities and undertook supervisory and regulatory actions to support the flow of credit to\nhouseholds, businesses, and local governments; see “Funding, Credit, Liquidity, and Loan Facilities” and\n“Supervisory and Regulatory Actions in Response to COVID-19” on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisory-regulatory-action-response-covid-19.htm, respectively. 10 See the December 2020 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm (quote text in paragraph 4).\n- 6 -\nThe pace of asset purchases during the pandemic period was much greater than in\nthe previous QE episodes. Conditions in the economy and financial system were also\ndifferent than those that prevailed following the 2008 financial crisis in significant ways.\nThe stabilizing actions taken by the Federal Reserve to restore market functioning and to\nsupport financial stability in the first half of 2020, in addition to the much higher capital\nlevels in the banking system relative to 2008, enabled the financial system to remain\nresilient. Credit continued to be available to households, businesses, and local\ngovernments following the pandemic’s onset.\nThe U.S. Congress and the Administration also provided extraordinary fiscal\nsupport in response to the pandemic—which included stimulus checks sent to\nhouseholds, expanded unemployment insurance, and the Paycheck Protection Program—\nthat bolstered household and business balance sheets.11 The housing market—recently\nrecovered from the buildup of poorly underwritten mortgage debt in the lead-up to the\n2008 financial crisis and a subsequent steep decline in house prices—remained in sound\ncondition. And as households and families sought larger living spaces and amenities as\nthey worked from home during the pandemic, house prices increased sharply.\nIn hindsight, the sharp contrast between the economic and financial system\nconditions during the pandemic period and those following the 2008 financial crisis raise\nquestions about the similarities in the response of the Federal Reserve and FOMC to\nthese events. Was such a strong balance sheet policy response during the pandemic\nappropriate, and to what extent did such a strong balance sheet policy response contribute\n11 The Paycheck Protection Program offered low-interest loans that would be forgiven to small and\nmedium-sized businesses that met certain criteria; see “Paycheck Protection Program” on the U.S. Small\nBusiness Administration’s website at https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-reliefoptions/paycheck-protection-program.\n- 7 -\nto the buildup of inflationary pressures and the post-pandemic inflation surge? Given the\nunderlying strength in the housing market, should the FOMC have conducted such large\npurchases of agency MBS into late 2021? Given the strong fiscal response to support\nspending by households and businesses and large issuance of Treasury debt, should the\nFOMC have conducted such large purchases of Treasury securities into late 2021? I look\nforward to our conversation today and to future studies on these questions, such as those\nconducted regarding the effectiveness of balance sheet policies following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nMy own view is that the FOMC would likely have benefited from an earlier\ndiscussion and decision to begin tapering and subsequently end asset purchases in 2021\ngiven the signs of emerging inflationary pressures.12 Doing so would have allowed the\nFOMC the option to have begun to tighten monetary policy earlier by raising the target\nrange for the federal funds rate. While a robust and rapid response by the FOMC was\nappropriate in 2020, I think it is worth asking whether such a robust response for so long\nwas appropriate. The economic and financial system conditions were very different\nduring the pandemic and included a strongly accommodative fiscal backdrop.\nCould the FOMC have reduced its pace of asset purchases earlier once it was\nclear that market turmoil had subsided, just as the 13(3) emergency lending facilities\nestablished in 2020 were allowed to expire and exit plans developed for those programs?\nA thorough discussion of these questions will be a useful reference for the FOMC and\nother central banks as they consider future use of QE as a monetary policy tool. This\n12 The FOMC discussed alternative approaches to slowing asset purchases at the September 2021 meeting;\nsee the September 2021 FOMC minutes, which can be found on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n- 8 -\nperspective would be helpful for historical reference when formulating appropriate\nbalance sheet policy as a monetary policy response to future episodes when the\nconventional interest rate tool is near zero.\nAnother important difference between the FOMC’s balance sheet policy\nfollowing the pandemic and its balance sheet policy following the 2008 financial crisis\nwas the speed and timing of the subsequent reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve’s\nsecurities holdings during the period of QT.13 This difference reflects the larger amount\nof securities purchases compared to the earlier periods of QE as well as the quite different\neconomic conditions facing the FOMC at the start of QT post-pandemic. These\nconditions included too-high inflation and a desire by the FOMC to tighten monetary\npolicy through both the federal funds rate and the balance sheet tools.\nSo far, the rapid and sustained pace of the Federal Reserve’s securities runoff has\nproceeded relatively smoothly. A useful question for further inquiry is to what extent\nduring the post-pandemic period has QT served to further tighten financial conditions.\nWith the understanding that QT is a tool employed beyond conventional monetary policy\nrestriction, how does one measure the incremental increase above the FOMC’s\nconcurrent increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and related forward\nguidance regarding its policy rate? Evidence to date suggests that QT exerts an\nindependent effect on tightening financial conditions, though in some cases it may be\nasymmetric to the effects of QE.14 Quantifying the effects of QT as well as QE will be\n13 The pace of balance sheet runoff beginning in 2022 has been roughly double the pace of the balance\nsheet runoff that occurred from 2017 to 2019.\n14 Du, Forbes, and Luzzetti (2024) argue that the effects of QT are asymmetric to QE. This result may be\ndue, in part, to investor expectations for QT before the authors look at announcement effects. See Wenxin\nDu, Kristin Forbes, and Matthew N. Luzzetti (2024), “Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe: What\nHave We Learned?” NBER Working Paper Series 32321 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, April), https://www.nber.org/papers/w32321; and Lorie Logan (2024), “Discussion of\n- 9 -\nhelpful to policymakers in their future deliberations regarding use of the balance sheet in\nsetting monetary policy.\nFuture Considerations regarding the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet Policy\nLooking ahead, the FOMC continues to reduce the size of its balance sheet as it\nseeks to maintain a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy to bring inflation\nback down to its 2 percent goal. Recently, the FOMC voted to slow the pace of securities\nrunoff by around half beginning in June.15 In its Plans for Reducing the Size of the\nFederal Reserve’s Balance Sheet released in May 2022, the FOMC noted that it would\neventually slow and then stop securities runoff when reserve balances are somewhat\nabove the levels it judges to be consistent with ample reserves to ensure a smooth\ntransition to ample-reserves levels.16 Aggregate reserve levels currently stand at around\nthe levels at the start of balance sheet runoff in June 2022, and there are still sizable\nbalances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility. In light of\nthese conditions, I would have supported either waiting to slow the pace of balance sheet\nrunoff to a later point in time or implementing a more tapered slowing in the pace of\nrunoff.17\n‘Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe: What Have We Learned?’ by Wenxin Du, Kristin Forbes and\nMatthew Luzzetti,” speech delivered at the 2024 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum sponsored by the University\nof Chicago Booth School of Business, March 1,\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2024/lkl240301. 15 See the May 2024 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. 16 See the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, which is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm. 17 Aggregate reserves stood at around $3.3 trillion just before start of balance sheet runoff in June 2022; see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), Statistical Release H.4.1, “Factors Affecting\nReserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks” (June 2),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20220602.\n- 10 -\nWhile it is important to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff as reserves approach\nample levels, in my view we are not yet at that point, especially with still sizable take-up\nat the ON RRP.18 In my view, it is important to continue to reduce the size of the balance\nsheet to reach ample reserves as soon as possible and while the economy is still strong.\nDoing so will allow the Federal Reserve to more effectively and credibly use its balance\nsheet to respond to future economic and financial shocks.\nAs balance sheet runoff proceeds, however, it will eventually be appropriate to\nstop runoff as reserves near an ample level. The FOMC will be monitoring money\nmarket conditions and related interest rates as it assesses the point at which reserve levels\nreach ample.19 It will be important to communicate that any future changes to balance\nsheet runoff do not reflect a change in the FOMC’s monetary policy stance. Not\neffectively communicating this point might cause the public to interpret the endpoint of\nQT as a signal that the FOMC would decrease the target range for the federal funds rate,\nthereby causing financial conditions to inappropriately ease.\nAnother important issue regarding future balance sheet policy is what the\ncomposition of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings should be in the longer run. As\nnoted in the FOMC’s January 2022 Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal\nReserve’s Balance Sheet, the FOMC intends to hold primarily Treasury securities in the\nlonger run to minimize the effects of the Federal Reserve’s holdings on the allocation of\n18 Because the ON RRP and reserves are both Federal Reserve balance sheet liabilities, a one-for-one\ndecrease in the ON RRP with securities reductions would leave the level of reserves unchanged. To date,\nsecurities runoff has largely been matched by a similarly sized reduction in the ON RRP rather than a\nreduction in reserves, reflecting the ON RRP’s role as an excess liquidity absorbing tool during periods of\nlarge asset purchases by the central bank.\n19 See Roberto Perli (2024), “Balance Sheet Reduction: Progress to Date and a Look Ahead,” speech\ndelivered at 2024 Annual Primary Dealer Meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, May 8,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/per240508.\n- 11 -\ncredit across the economy.20 I strongly support this principle. Consistent with this\nstatement, the FOMC will reinvest any principal payments from agency MBS holdings\nabove the current runoff cap into Treasury securities. And once balance sheet runoff\nconcludes, my expectation is that proceeds from agency MBS holdings would continue to\nbe reinvested in Treasury securities in order to facilitate a transition of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet holdings to consist of primarily Treasury securities.\nThe longer-run maturity structure of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities\nholdings is also an important consideration. A benefit of a balance sheet Treasury\nsecurity maturity structure that mirrors the broader Treasury market is that the Fed’s\nholdings would be “neutral” in the sense that they would not disproportionately affect the\npricing of any given maturity of Treasury security or provide incentives for the issuance\nof any given type of Treasury security. However, a balance sheet tilted slightly toward\nshorter-dated Treasury securities would allow some flexibility in approach. For example,\nthe FOMC could reduce its holdings of shorter-dated Treasury securities in favor of\nlonger-dated Treasury securities in a future scenario in which the FOMC wanted to\nprovide monetary policy accommodation via the balance sheet without expanding the\nsize of its securities holdings. This approach would be similar to the FOMC’s maturity\nextension program in 2011 and 2012, sometimes referred to as “operation twist.”21 It will\nbe important to consider such potential costs and benefits to the Federal Reserve’s\nTreasury securities maturity structure and the best ways to achieve the desired maturity\nstructure over time.\n20 See the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, which is available on\nthe Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm. 21 For more details, see “Maturity Extension Program and Reinvestment Policy” on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/maturityextensionprogram.htm.\n- 12 -\nIt is also important for the FOMC to clearly distinguish when the goal of future\nasset purchases is restoring market functioning or supporting financial stability. In my\nview, when the Federal Reserve purchases securities for such purposes, it should\ncommunicate that those purchases will be temporary and subsequently unwound when\nfinancial market conditions have normalized.\n22\nIn conclusion, the FOMC’s past experiences with using the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet as a monetary policy tool have demonstrated that the central bank balance\nsheet can be an effective way to ease financial conditions and support the economy in\nperiods in which the conventional monetary policy interest rate tool has reached the zero\nlower bound. Importantly, the U.S. experience shows that the effects of QE and QT can\nhave varying effects depending on the economic and financial system environment, an\nimportant consideration for future episodes.\nJust as when using the conventional monetary policy interest rate, monetary\npolicymakers must use the balance sheet judiciously when setting monetary policy.\nPolicymakers must also consider the risks of “doing too little” in balance with the risks of\n“doing too much” as they pursue their monetary policy mandates.\nThank you, and I look forward to our conversation."

    "text": "Good afternoon and thank you to the organizers of the 2025 Wyoming Blockchain\nSymposium for inviting me to speak to you today.1 It is an honor to be included in this year’s\nevent, which is being held at a critical moment for American leadership in the digital asset space.\nWe are at the beginning of what appears to be a seismic shift in the way we think about money,\nvalue, and the fabric of our financial system. This shift is not just about incremental changes or\ntweaks to the existing system. What we are witnessing has the potential to fundamentally\ntransform the way we live, work, and interact in society.\nIt is inspiring to be together with all of you, as thought leaders engaged in developing\ntechnologies that could help shape the financial system in the future. You don’t need a tech\nbackground to appreciate the opportunity that blockchain provides to the financial system.\nFinancial services innovation drives faster, safer, cheaper, and more customized products\nthat more efficiently meet the needs of consumers and businesses. Digital processes like wire\ntransfers and ACH disrupted the need to move large amounts of physical currency and other hard\nassets, making the system more efficient and safer. Through technology, there is opportunity to\ntransform how we think about transferring assets.\nThroughout recent history, whether previous transformations involved industrialization,\ncommunications, or the internet, each of these advances had a profound and lasting impact on\nour society. While the future is unknown and unknowable, I expect we will look back at some\npoint to consider the impact of blockchain, AI, and quantum computing and marvel at the\ntransformation of everyday business processes. Time will tell, but the opportunities and\npossibilities that lie ahead may be profound.\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- 2 -\nOf course, you know better than most that bank regulators approach technology and\nperiods of change with caution and skepticism, concerned about rapid growth, new business\nmodels, greater interconnectedness and interdependence, often focusing only on the risks. But\nrisks may be offset or at least determined to be manageable when we recognize and consider the\npotentially extensive benefits of new technology.\nToday, I’d like to address the Federal Reserve’s approach to thinking about technology\nand tools like blockchain in context of bank supervision, including recent developments, the cost\nof supervisory focus on “reputational risk,” and principles for a tailored regulatory framework\nthat accommodates technology.\nReframing the Regulatory Mindset\nBank regulators work to promote safety and soundness in the financial system through\nregulation and supervisory practices. Our goal is not just a safe and sound banking system, but\none that also serves its intended purpose of supporting consumers, businesses, and communities,\nand fostering economic growth. To accomplish this goal, regulators strive to strike a balance\nbetween managing risks that threaten safety and soundness, while also creating an environment\nthat allows new technologies to take root and grow.\nInnovation outside the banking system often complements the development and use of\ntechnology within the banking system, and often far outpaces that growth. As you’re all aware,\nmany groundbreaking tech innovations have been pioneered by developers outside of the\ntraditional banking system.\nDevelopments in the Banking System\nWe are seeing a number of promising developments in the banking and financial system,\nand I’ll start with tokenization.\n- 3 -\nWhile progress on tokenization is moving ahead, it’s helpful to identify and understand\nthe problem that it is intended to solve. One clear friction is in the transfer of asset ownership,\nwhich includes both completing the asset transfer—which may involve re-registering securities,\nor transferring physical assets—and coordinating the timing of the purchase and sale. Asset\ntransfer frameworks are designed to minimize the risk of transaction failures, and have\nhistorically relied on escrow agents and manual processes. Tokenization has the potential to\nfacilitate faster ownership transfer, mitigating some of these well-known risks and potentially\nlowering costs in the process.\nTokenized assets enable a transferor to pass title without changing a custodian or moving\nany physical security or asset. Many banks and international organizations have begun projects\nto develop this technology, but we have not yet seen broad adoption. It is possible that we could\nsee a “tipping point” where the processes themselves are well-established, and legal frameworks\nhave been updated to permit a wider range of activities relying on the new technology, and\ntokenized asset transfers become more of a market standard.\nThere are other potential advantages to tokenization, including expanding access to\ncapital markets and facilitating near real-time payments. The speed and cost of wholesale\npayments, especially internationally, is a longstanding problem that tokenization could help to\naddress. Banks of all sizes, including community banks, can benefit from efficiency gains that\nflow from asset tokenization. New technology and processes can open the door to direct, faster,\nand lower cost payments.\nWhile tokenization may be part of the solution to a number of known frictions in the\nbanking system, the blockchain technology that it relies upon has already changed how banks\nseek to engage with their customers. For example, while digital assets have been considered to\n- 4 -\nbe risky, many banks are improving their tech stacks and security infrastructure to provide digital\nasset custody services to a wider range of retail customers. Very few bankers, and even fewer\nregulators, anticipated that the market would accommodate this development even just a few\nyears ago. Yet we’ve seen much progress and a growing appetite for traditional bank\nengagement in this space. We are also seeing positive signs in the evolution of the digital asset\nuser experience, making digital assets more accessible and easier to use.\nOne recent development—Congress passing the GENIUS Act and the President signing it\ninto law—has brought stablecoins to the forefront of many discussions. And they are now\npositioned to become a fixture in the financial system, with implications and opportunities for\nthe traditional banking system, including the potential to disrupt traditional payment rails.\nCongress tasked the banking agencies with creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and\nwe are working with our colleagues in the other agencies to move forward.\nIt is essential that banks and regulators are open to engaging in new technologies and\ndeparting from an overly cautious mindset. Regulators must understand new products and\nservices and recognize the utility and necessity of embracing technology in the traditional\nfinancial sector.\nSo how do we accomplish this? Some of you may have had direct experience with\nregulators and the banking system, as you attempted to engage in this type of partnership with\nbanks through the introduction of new technology and services. I am sure that many of you were\nnot satisfied with these interactions. When you start from a world of possibility, where you\nmove fast and break things to make rapid improvements, you may struggle with the complex and\nrigid regulatory constructs familiar to bankers and regulators. In this world, inertia can easily set\n- 5 -\nin and pose resistance to anything not deemed within the realm of “traditional” banking\nactivities.\nDespite this past inertia, change is coming.\nBank regulators are taking important steps to create a framework for digital assets and the\nadoption of blockchain technology within the banking system. These steps will promote\naccessibility to banking products and services by removing supervisory impediments that have\nstood in the way of bank relationships. I am also encouraged by the promise of this technology,\nby its ability to solve problems and improve the efficiency of the traditional financial system.\nTo this point, I have noted several use cases that have already been adopted or are in\ndevelopment within the banking system, but I would also like to encourage the industry to\nengage with regulators to help us understand blockchain and its potential to solve other\nproblems. What is the value proposition of any new product or approach? What problem is it\nintended to address? And how should regulators consider both the risks and benefits, so we can\nprovide a path to allow its use within the banking system?\nWe have already seen some initial benefits of bank AI adoption, and I continue to be\nencouraged by the significant ongoing investments being made in AI and in machine learning.\nThese technologies have the potential to transform how business is conducted, including the way\nwe detect and prevent fraud, manage risk, and provide customer service. During a recent\nbanking conference at the Fed, Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, joined me for a fireside chat\non AI in the banking and financial sector.2\n One highlight from our discussion was the two-sided\nnature of how technology can impact banking transactions—just as AI can undermine customer\n2\n Michelle W. Bowman, “Fireside Chat with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,” conducted at the Integrated Review of the\nCapital Framework for Large Banks Conference, Washington, D.C., July 22, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/integrated-review-of-the-capital-framework-for-large-banks.htm.\n- 6 -\nverification methods designed to identify and mitigate fraud, AI tools can also be leveraged to\ndetect and mitigate fraud.\nI see a similar challenge with blockchain technologies. Some bankers have expressed\nconcerns about new technologies posing a threat to traditional business models and practices.\nBut the banking system is constantly evolving, and technology can change the banking system\nregardless of how banks and regulators choose to respond. We must choose whether to embrace\nthe change and help shape a framework that will be reliable and durable—ensuring safety and\nsoundness and incorporating the benefits of both efficiency and speed—or to stand still and\nallow new technology to bypass the traditional banking system altogether. From a regulator’s\nperspective, the choice is clear.\nI am open to these discussions, and I look forward to learning more. Many of you have a\ngreat deal to share and have new ideas about the best regulatory approach to blockchain and\ndigital assets. Let me start with a specific request on fraud: how can new technologies be\nleveraged to fight fraud? Fraud is a major challenge in the financial services sector, and if\nblockchain or other new tools could mitigate it, we should explore those use cases. If fraud can\nbe addressed using new technology, we should make sure that the regulatory framework does not\nstand in the way. I see this as an exciting opportunity for collaboration between industry and the\nFed.3\nThe promise of technology and advances like AI are already positioned to impact parts of\nthe banking and financial system. Ideally, changes will occur with the willing embrace of\n3\n See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, “Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment to Address payments and\nCheck Fraud,” press release, June 16, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250616a.htm. Comments on the RFI are due on\nSeptember 18, 2025.\n- 7 -\nregulators—allowing use cases to proliferate in a way that benefits the banking system. If this is\nnot our approach, then we risk the banking system becoming less relevant to consumers,\nbusinesses, and the overall economy. As a result, the banks will play a diminished role in the\nfinancial system more broadly. Those who follow developments in bank regulation have\nhopefully recognized some positive steps that demonstrate our commitment to embrace change.\nI am committed to changing our culture and attitude toward the adoption and integration of\ntechnology and new products and services.\nThe Hidden Role of Reputational Risk\nIn late June, the Board announced that reputational risk would no longer be considered in\nour supervisory process.4\n To implement this lasting change, we are updating guidance,\nexamination manuals, handbooks, and other supervisory materials to ensure the durability of this\napproach, which is a critical step in addressing the problem of de-banking. I am also considering\nwhether we need a regulatory change to provide greater transparency and certainty about this\napproach. It is not the role of examiners or policymakers to direct which customers or industries\nto serve or which products to offer. That decision lies solely within the purview of bank\nmanagement, limited by the safety and soundness of the institution,, the legal activities of its\ncustomer, and risks, if any, to financial stability.\nOver time, “reputational risk” emerged as a priority area that policymakers emphasized\nfor examinations. Exams or reviews focused on reputational risk have often lacked a sufficient\nnexus to financial risk and safety and soundness considerations that are the appropriate focus of\nour supervisory activities.\n4\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces That Reputational Risk\nWill No Longer Be a Component of Examination Programs in Its Supervision of Banks,” press release, June 23,\n2025, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250623a.htm.\n- 8 -\nLet me be clear. We must adopt an approach that does not penalize or prohibit a bank\nfrom banking a customer engaged in legal activity. This approach must allow and encourage\nbanks to provide banking products and services to any legal business, without disfavoring any\nparticular viewpoints, businesses, or industries.\nThe Importance of Outreach\nThe industry—whether traditional finance, community banking, or digital assets—should\nexpect a constructive engagement with our supervisors when discussing strategies and\napproaches for innovation. As regulators, we must engage in a way that enables our supervisory\nteams to understand the technology or innovation under consideration and have an open-minded\nview about the benefits and possibilities of a new approach, while also understanding effective\nmitigation strategies to address any risks. Banks should be encouraged to explore new\ntechnology, to engage in discussions with their regulators about how they can be deployed, and\nwhat reasonable supervisory expectations should apply. In this context, a healthy dialogue and a\ncommitment to learning ensures the bank and examiner relationship can be collaborative rather\nthan antagonistic in tone.\nInnovators, banks, and regulators must develop a constructive relationship, and this relies\non a commitment to ongoing outreach. As I have demonstrated throughout my tenure as a\nregulator at both the state and federal levels, I am committed to outreach that enhances my\nunderstanding of industry preferences, challenges and better ways to engage with both\ndevelopers and adopters. We should build an examination workforce that requires skills\ndevelopment and informed judgement to address evolving business preferences, practices and\nexpectations. In a step toward doing so, last week, I announced that the Fed’s “novel\nsupervision” activities would be reintegrated into our Reserve Bank examination staff. This will\n- 9 -\nreestablish the role of the normal supervisory process in monitoring banks’ so-called “novel\nactivities.”5\n\nOur approach should consider allowing Federal Reserve staff to hold de minimus\namounts of crypto or other types of digital assets so they can achieve a working understanding of\nthe underlying functionality. While there are many resources available to learn about these\nfinancial products, and we will soon be establishing a framework for supervising issuers of these\nassets, there’s no replacement for experimenting and understanding how that ownership and\ntransfer process flows.\nI certainly wouldn’t trust someone to teach me to ski if they’d never put on skis,\nregardless of how many books and articles they have read, or even wrote, about it. We should\nconsider whether limits on staff investment activities may be a barrier to recruiting and retaining\nexaminers with the necessary expertise and for existing staff to better understand the technology.\nBuilding a Tailored and Proportional Regulatory Framework\nGoing forward it will be necessary to continue to implement a tailored approach to these\nnew technologies in our supervisory activities, an approach that balances the supervisory and\nregulatory expectations in a way that is commensurate with risk.\nWhat would this look like in practice? It needs to include regulatory certainty, tailoring,\nsafety and soundness, consumer protection, and maintaining America’s reputation for providing\nan open environment for innovation. Regulators should abide by these principles in developing\nthis framework.\n5\n See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces That It Will Sunset\nIts Novel Supervision Program And Return to Monitoring Banks’ Novel Activities Through the Normal Supervisory\nProcess,” press release, August 15, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250815a.htm.\n- 10 -\nThe first principle is essential. That is regulatory certainty. Justifying investing in new\nblockchain development specifically for the banking industry, or even repurposing existing\nblockchain technologies for this sector, requires significant investment. Why would you make\nthat investment without a clear understanding about how regulators will evaluate new use cases\nin a highly regulated industry? Would you choose to partner with banks, knowing that this will\nbring regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty, or would you develop alternatives outside of the\nbanking system? Your industry has already experienced significant frictions with bank\nregulators applying unclear standards, conflicting guidance, and inconsistent regulatory\ninterpretations. We need a clear, strategic regulatory framework that will facilitate the adoption\nof new technology, recognizing that in some cases, it may be inadequate and inappropriate to\napply existing regulatory guidance to address emerging tech.\nHaving clear and transparent rules is not effective if these rules are unnecessarily\nburdensome and restrictive. So, my second principle is that rules must be well-calibrated and\ntailored to address risks. Well-calibrated regulation promotes responsible innovation while also\naligning incentives for long-term growth and stability. Tailoring rules and supervision requires\nregulators to approach each use case based on particular facts and circumstances, rather than\napplying expectations designed for an imaginary “worst-case” scenario that differs from the\nactual use case. We cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. Regulators must recognize the\nunique features of these new assets and distinguish them from traditional financial instruments or\nbanking products.\nA third principle is that frameworks must be consistent with generally applicable rules\nand requirements. Customer-facing products must comply with consumer protection laws,\nincluding those prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. We must think\n- 11 -\ncarefully about appropriate regulations to protect consumers and investors, maintain bank safety\nand soundness, and preserve the stability of the financial system. Any legal framework must\nalso include appropriate Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements, to fulfill the\nimportant policy objectives of these requirements.\nFinally, we need to build a framework that allows the United States to continue to be the\nbest place in the world to innovate. Failing to do so could jeopardize American competitiveness\nover the long run. Regulators have taken preliminary steps to support blockchain technology\nwithin the banking system, as well as to eliminate deterrents for banks to provide services to the\ndigital asset industry. I am confident that with the benefit of ongoing outreach and education we\nwill build a framework that is fair, efficient, and transparent.\nClosing Thoughts\nWe stand at a crossroads: we can either seize the opportunity to shape the future or risk\nbeing left behind. By embracing innovation with a principled approach, we can define the\ncourse of history and fulfill our responsibility to promote the safety and soundness of the\nbanking system and financial stability.\nWe are mindful of the potential risks and vulnerabilities that result from rapid\ntransformation. We are cautious about the unintended consequences, and our mindset, and\npolicies guide us toward minimizing risks. But we must pay equal attention to the benefits side\nof the equation. Innovation and regulation don’t need to be on opposite ends of the spectrum. In\nfact, they complement each other. A more modern, efficient, and effective financial system\nfurthers key regulatory objectives—promoting safe and sound banking operation, financial\nstability, and economic growth. "

    "text": "Thank you to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for this\nopportunity to share my perspective and some of my goals as a Federal Reserve Board\ngovernor on issues of interest to you and many in your states.1\nI emphasize that word “perspective” because the view from Washington can be\nvery different from how things look in your states and communities. No one knows that\nbetter than I do, of course, because not so long ago, I was sitting where you are, enjoying\nthe dinner provided by CSBS and hearing the perspective from Washington. I’m still\nenjoying the dinner tonight, but find I am now, so to speak, also on the menu. And in this\nposition, as part of the Federal Reserve but also still deeply rooted in my experience as a\ncommunity banker and state regulator, I’ll offer my thoughts on forging a closer\nrelationship and strengthening communication between the Board of Governors and state\nbanking commissioners.\nFirst, to establish some context, let me say a few words about the Fed’s role and\nperspective on supervising community banks. The lion’s share of community banks are\nthose with total assets of $500 million or less, with the Fed defining the sector as those\nwith up to $10 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve directly supervises 731 statechartered community banks, which is only a small share of the number of state-chartered\nbanks overseen by CSBS members. The fact that this is only a small share of the total\nmight sound to some people like the Federal Reserve has only a small role in community\nbanking. But it’s important to remember that the Fed is the primary federal supervisor\nresponsible for all bank and thrift holding companies, a total of 3,912. This includes the\nvast majority of all community banking organizations. The Fed also influences the\n 1 My views are my own and do not represent the view of the Board of Governors or its other members.\n- 2 -\nsupervision of all community and regional banks by developing both safety and\nsoundness and consumer rules to implement laws passed by Congress, applicable to\ninsured depositories and their holding companies. Typically this is done in collaboration\nwith other federal agencies and after seeking the public’s input. I mention Congress and\nthese other agencies to emphasize that the Fed shares responsibility for writing and\nimplementing federal regulations for community banks.\nNow, let me describe my role. In addition to my broader responsibilities in\nsupervision and regulation, I am Chair of the Board’s Smaller Regional and Community\nBanking subcommittee, which oversees our work in this area. I am also the Chair of the\nBoard’s committee tasked with oversight of our rulemaking and supervision on consumer\nissues.\nI also participate in carrying out the Federal Reserve’s other responsibilities, such\nas conducting monetary policy and overseeing the payment system. But it’s fair to say\nthat my background in community banking was an important reason I was chosen and\nconfirmed by Congress as the first person to fulfill a new requirement that at least one\ngovernor have primary experience working in or supervising community banks. My\nbackground and commitment to community banking is also some important context for\nwhat I have to say about the Fed’s interests in improving communication with the\nmembers of CSBS.\nI mentioned a moment ago that the perspective in Washington, and from the\nBoard, can be different from the view from your position as banking commissioners, and\nthat is certainly true. But one thing I have learned, since joining the Board in November,\nis that my fellow governors, along with the staff at the Board, share your view, as I do,\n- 3 -\nabout the vital importance of community banking and the essential role community banks\nplay in our financial system.\nCommunity banks are frequently the economic engines supporting and driving the\neconomies of many communities, especially in rural areas. In these communities, they\nare the primary providers of financial services for individuals and small businesses, and a\nsource of financial advice and civic leadership. They play an indispensable role in areas\nnot served by larger institutions and in other communities of all different sizes, from\nurban to rural, serving a range of customers, including some that are sometimes not as\nhigh a priority for larger banks.\nI think it is important to note, and too often overlooked, that the vast majority of\ncommunity banks managed their risks well in the years leading up to and during the\nfinancial crisis and were not the source of the excessive risk taking that caused the crisis.\nFor this reason among others, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in an active effort to\ntailor regulations, including those issued in the wake of the financial crisis, to\nappropriately reflect the potential risk that an institution might pose to financial stability.\nI am pleased to see some evidence we are making progress. Last year’s CSBS\nsurvey found that community banks reported a decrease in regulatory costs in 2017.\n2\n\nThis was the first reduction in burden reported since the survey began in 2014. The\ndecline was attributed to the implementation of changes stemming from the recent review\nby the banking agencies under the EGRPRA, the Economic Growth and Regulatory\nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1996. There has been progress in tailoring regulations that\n 2 Federal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,\n2018 Community Banking in the 21st Century (Research and Policy Conference, October 3–4, 2018),\nhttps://www.communitybanking.org/~/media/files/publication/cb21pub_2018_final.pdf.\n- 4 -\naffect community banks, and I believe more progress lies ahead as we implement the\nchanges that Congress included in S. 2155 and explore additional opportunities to reduce\nburden while maintaining the resiliency and strength of smaller banks.\n3\nBefore I go further, let me give a brief assessment of how community banks are\nfaring. This might seem like an issue that is primarily of interest to community bankers\nand regulators, but I don’t look at it that way at all. One of my most important\nresponsibilities now is voting on the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, and that requires me to closely and constantly monitor the health of\nthe U.S. economy. And when community banks are the source for more than half of all\nlending to small businesses, which together account for two-thirds of private sector job\ncreation, then the health of community banking has a big influence on the health of the\nU.S. economy.4\nSince the financial crisis, the health of the community-banking sector has\nimproved significantly. Over those years and today, the large majority of community\nbanks have maintained sound levels of capital. Although the number of community\nbanks in the United States continues to fall due to consolidation, overall the sector\ncontinues to post strong earnings, which, in turn, contribute to maintaining healthy capital\npositions. One measure of this strong financial position is that no community banks\nfailed in 2018. The shared responsibility we have as financial supervisors to ensure the\nongoing viability of community banks requires cooperation and coordination. We must\n 3 Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018) 4 U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions About Small\nBusiness (August 2018), https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Frequently-Asked-QuestionsSmall-Business-2018.pdf.\n- 5 -\ncontinue to ensure that the institutions we supervise are proactively managing their risks\nto remain strong. It’s our job to identify emerging risks to community banks and to\nensure bankers are identifying and managing their risks appropriately. We want to ensure\nthat loans are underwritten prudently and that bankers are actively managing the\nconcentrations of credit risk in their portfolios.\nWe welcome the strong lending growth that many community banks are\nexperiencing, which is fueling job creation and sustaining our economic expansion,\nwhich in July will become the longest in U.S. history. But strong lending growth must be\nsupported by prudent, well-managed funding plans in order to manage the risk that strains\non liquidity may arise more quickly than is sometimes anticipated.\nNow, let me turn back to my main theme today, which is fostering better\ncommunication between CSBS and state banking commissioners and the Board of\nGovernors. Improved communication is a top priority for me for several reasons.\nFirst, it is very much my approach to government service, and leadership in\nparticular, to do a lot of listening. A wise person once said that the most effective leaders\ndo more listening than talking. When I became Kansas’ State Bank Commissioner, I\nstarted a twice-yearly series of roundtables with the chief executives of banks across the\nstate. It was an excellent way for me to better understand the issues that were impacting\nbankers in a way that was less formal than when banks comment on rules and less fraught\nthan the supervisory process. Sure, it took time away from the office, from consultation\nwith the legislature, and the deadlines all of us have faced. In my case, considering the\nsize of Kansas, it was also time away from home and family. However, I don’t have to\n- 6 -\ntell those of you who have also found a lot of merit in such tours that it is an enormous\nadvantage to find out what is on the minds of those in the field.\nThe second, very straightforward reason to foster better communication with all\nof you is that the nature of financial regulation and supervision in the United States\nargues strongly for better coordination. To a much greater extent than in other nations, in\nthe United States financial oversight is divided between the federal government and\nsubnational authorities--the states. At the federal level, responsibility is further divided\nbetween different agencies, such as the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of Comptroller of the\nCurrency, and the National Credit Union Administration. This system evolved over time,\nand as things stand, there are some advantages to this specialization. But this division of\nlabor may, at times, inhibit information sharing, and as a general principle, better\ncommunication can help overcome this challenge.\nMore specifically, better communication and information sharing between state\nbanking commissioners and the Federal Reserve can further improve the early\nidentification and resolution of emerging issues at community banks. Harnessing and\nsharing these sometimes divergent views can serve to strengthen a financial regulatory\nsystem that shares responsibility among many state and federal agencies. Better\ncommunication and information sharing will benefit both you and the Federal Reserve,\nbut my motivation is that the Fed has much to gain here. Because states are responsible\nfor chartering and co-supervising the large majority of community banks, they can\nprovide a broader perspective into local community banking issues and trends.\nLet me pause here for a moment and say that improving communication doesn’t\nnecessarily mean that the Federal Reserve and the CSBS members will always agree. We\n- 7 -\nwon’t, and perhaps we shouldn’t. A diversity of views can be a strength. A robust\ndiscussion requires a thorough analysis of differing views, which leads to a more\ninformed understanding of issues. This healthy give and take is the fourth reason for\nbetter communication: It leads to better outcomes.\nI will cite one example that I know is on the minds of many of you--the\nrulemaking process the agencies are currently engaged in on the community bank\nleverage ratio (CBLR). Here is an excellent example of where it makes good sense to\nconsult closely. I know you have a lot of knowledge and expertise to bring to bear on\nthis issue, which helps explain why Congress has required the agencies to consult with\nthe states. As you know, the Fed and the other agencies are now gathering and evaluating\ncomments on the CBLR and getting feedback on this interagency proposal. So, now is a\ngood time to re-engage. I am committed to re-engaging with you on the interagency\nproposal and ways we might be able to improve it. I am eager to hear your thoughts.\nI have one more reason for better communication, but first I will give you an idea\nof what I have in mind for that consultation. The formal means by which CSBS and\nothers comment on a rulemaking is important, but I think we would also all benefit from\nmore informal, and more frequent contact. If you have an issue, if you have something to\nsay, just pick up the phone. It is also my intention to be on the road a lot, visiting Federal\nReserve Districts and talking to bankers, consumers, and community groups. When I\ncome to your state, I hope to see you, and I promise to make time to talk.\nMy final reason for better communication brings me back to a point I made at the\noutset: the United States needs a strong community-banking sector. We need strong\ncommunity banks because they help support strong communities. Strong communities\n- 8 -\nare the building blocks of a strong nation. They provide safety, education and economic\nopportunities, and help define the values we hold dear. Community banks are vital to the\nsuccess of communities. They help us save and plan for a better future. The credit they\nextend helps preserve farming as a way of life for American families, and provides the\nmeans for small businesses to start and to thrive, which is so important to the health of\ncommunities.\nThis is not an abstract notion for me. As a community banker, I have seen how\naccess to credit and support from a financial institution with deep roots in a community\ncan make a direct and immediate difference in people’s lives. I continued to feel that\nway when I did the job you do, as a state banking commissioner, helping ensure that\nfamilies and communities have access to financial services that are so important to their\nsuccess. I enjoyed being a community banker, and I hope you know I’ve enjoyed\nworking closely with all of you as a banking commissioner, and I now look forward to\nbuilding a stronger partnership between all of you and the Federal Reserve Board.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I hope to see you soon in\nyour states, and I wish you a productive and enjoyable visit to Washington. "

    "text": "I would like to thank the Digital Chamber for the invitation to share my perspectives on\ninnovation in the financial system.1\n I welcome opportunities like this to engage in discussions\nthat include both the public and private sector on this important topic. These conversations help\ninform my understanding of and expectations for how technology can enhance financial services\nin a manner that is consistent with operating in the highly regulated banking industry. Today, I\nwill share my views on evolving financial technology and the importance of ongoing,\nresponsible innovation, including the roles of both the public and private sectors in shaping the\nfuture.\nIn my role at the Federal Reserve, I view financial innovation through the lens of the\ncentral bank’s responsibilities—issuing U.S. currency; conducting monetary policy; fostering a\nsafe and efficient payment system; maintaining financial stability; promoting consumer\nprotection; and supervising and regulating financial institutions. Regulators often espouse the\nbenefits of innovation—innovation can lead to greater efficiency, and it can promote competition\nin the market, which can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and services to\nconsumers and businesses.\nWhile regulators acknowledge these benefits, innovation is inevitably accompanied by\nrisk. Innovation can exacerbate traditional financial risks or introduce new risks that must be\ncarefully understood and managed. And on a basic level, the “newness” of innovation often\nleads regulators to reflexively resist these changes, whether the change takes the form of new\ntechnology, new ways of delivering products and services, new financial infrastructure that\n1 Thank you to Priyanka Slattery and Alex Sproveri of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing\nthis text. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- 2 -\nunderlies how the banking system works, and new relationships within the financial system and\nbeyond.\nSo how do regulators get comfortable with innovation? Some attending today may\nanswer that “they don’t!” And I am sure that some here in the room have experienced this\nfriction in trying to pursue innovation in a heavily regulated environment. In fairness, sometimes\n“no” is the correct regulatory response when innovation either does not solve an actual problem,\nor simply cannot be executed in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable\nlaws. But my goal today is to propose some building blocks that could help regulators get to\n“yes” more often, and potentially smooth the rough path to successful innovation in the banking\nsystem.\nUnderstanding Innovation\nAs a first principle, I would offer “understanding” as a necessary predicate to promoting\ninnovation. Before we craft a useful public policy around innovation in banking, we need to\nunderstand the various dynamics involved with particular innovations. We must consider how\ninnovation can impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial\nmarkets, and how those impacts will ultimately effect end users. For example, will “tokenized”\nproducts and platforms duplicate existing bank deposits and payment rails, potentially creating\nparallel systems? If so, will the products and platforms that duplicate these functions provide the\nsame legal protections for customers and the overall financial system?\nThe wide variety of technology and use cases can be a significant obstacle to getting to a\nplace where regulators understand any one innovation. Innovation in the financial system can\ntake many forms including new technology, new business models, and improvements to existing\ninfrastructures. As one form of innovation, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including\n- 3 -\nblockchain, has inspired new ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition\nto the role of intermediaries and trusted third parties. DLT combines a number of different\ndesign elements—like distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms—that\nsupport the transfer process, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping.2\nDLT is an interesting example because it highlights the challenges presented to regulators\nin understanding innovation. There are many variations in the application of DLT—and ongoing\nresearch and development creating more variability over time—which ultimately may complicate\nunderstanding how the technology can be used, and how different functionality can be\nincorporated into DLT solutions for different use cases.\nIn short, innovation can take many forms. It often involves new uses for existing\ntechnology that enhance core business lines, but it can also include the introduction of\ntransformational new technology or capabilities. Customer demands for cheaper products or for\nnew and innovative products often motivate banks to explore how technology and innovation can\nmeet these demands and provide products and services for the future.\nWhile understanding technology is an important first step, it is not the only one.\nRegulators also need to understand the players who operate in the fintech space. Banks of all\nsizes have a long history of innovation, from the introduction of checks; to the advent of ATMs\nthat allow easy access to cash and basic banking information; to online banking platforms and\nelectronic payments that have simplified and streamlined the way many consumers and\nbusinesses manage and access their funds, receive credit, and conduct financial transactions.\n2 See, e.g., Mills, David, Kathy Wang, Brendan Malone, Anjana Ravi, Jeff Marquardt, Clinton Chen, Anton Badev,\nTimothy Brezinski, Linda Fahy, Kimberley Liao, Vanessa Kargenian, Max Ellithorpe, Wendy Ng, and Maria Baird\n(2016). “Distributed ledger technology in payments, clearing, and settlement,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2016-095. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.095.\n- 4 -\nInnovation helps banks upgrade their existing business lines to better meet customer needs, for\nexample, by introducing instant payments or providing credit in innovative ways.\nThere are also many nonbank providers in this space, including core service providers\nthat often hold the “keys” to innovation at small banks when they facilitate the add-on of new\ntechnology to core systems. And fintechs that may focus on even more transformational uses of\ntechnology within all aspects of banking. This presents another layer of complication when it\ncomes to innovation in banking.\nEven with an understanding of technology and of the players involved, regulators still\nneed additional feedback to understand the “why” of innovation. What is the purpose of the\ninnovation? What problem is it designed to solve? Are there tradeoffs policymakers would need\nto consider if the new technology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system?\nThere are many examples across this spectrum of innovation. For example, take the use\ncases around DLT. Some banks are exploring the possibility of DLT as a way to help facilitate\nservices like cross-border payments and financial market transactions. Other businesses may see\nDLT as a way to improve supply chain management by tying payments to specific activities\nacross the supply chain. Some financial institutions see DLT as a potential solution for existing\nprocesses that require manual interventions and coordination across disparate systems.\nBusinesses may look at a single technology—DLT—and see possible solutions to a wide range\nof problems. When the financial system promotes innovation, we better enable firms to serve\ntheir customers’ unique needs while also advancing the capability of the financial system.\nRegulators and industry both have an important role to play in achieving this goal of\nunderstanding. Regulators cannot hope to craft effective public policy without understanding.\n- 5 -\nAnd while industry’s focus is rightly on developing innovative solutions, part of successful\ninnovation in the banking space is promoting education and understanding for the regulators.\nOpenness to Innovation: Getting to “Yes”\nAs a second principle, regulatory openness is a critical ingredient to fostering innovation\nin the financial system. The first reaction of regulators to proposed innovation in the banking\nsystem is often not one of openness and acceptance, but rather suspicion and concern. The use\nof emerging technology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach.\nIt also very often requires regulatory feedback—sometimes before innovation is introduced, in\nothers after it has been rolled out and is reviewed during the supervisory process.\nAs a financial policymaker and a regulator, I recognize that there are a number of\nquestions we must answer before pursuing a change in policy, whether in the form of regulation,\nor in supervisory approach, to facilitate innovation in the financial system.\nRegulators need to ask whether we have considered the intended and unintended\noutcomes of a new innovation, and do the benefits of the new technology outweigh the risks?\nWould the introduction of a new technology or innovation in the banking system require\nupdating our regulatory framework to incorporate clear oversight? Who should have\nresponsibility for oversight, and what roles do we see for different regulators at both the state and\nfederal level?\nTransformational technology requires clear, consistent, and transparent guardrails and\nexpectations to govern the activities that are allowed into the regulated financial system. Where\ncurrent regulation does not contemplate a new activity, should it be acceptable for financial\nagencies to regulate the activity through supervision and enforcement alone? Or should\ncongressional action address the treatment of these activities in the financial system?\n- 6 -\nThese are difficult questions, to be sure, but ones we must confront if we are to allow\ninnovation to flourish in the banking system and the broader financial system. Ensuring an\norderly and observable method for regulators to understand and provide a path for potentially\ndisruptive or transformational technology could ultimately enhance the long-term stability of the\nfinancial system.\nSo, while the obligation to promote understanding may fall more heavily on industry, the\nobligation to be receptive to innovation falls more heavily on regulators. We must fight the\ntemptation to say “no” and resist new technology, and instead focus on solutions—how can we\nmitigate the risk of new technology? What benefits will technology bring to the financial\nsystem? How can we provide clear regulatory expectations?\nThe appeal of resisting innovation—resisting change—is that it preserves the familiar and\nknown. But the cost of resistance to change may be great, in that it promotes stagnation and\ninertia. Ultimately, this could lead to a banking system that may be safer and smaller, but also\nless effective at providing banking products and services and in supporting the U.S. economy.\nInnovation as a Priority in Banking\nUnderstanding and openness can go a long way to promoting innovation, but I think there\nare opportunities to do more. Can we shift from a reactive approach to innovation, to an active\none that facilitates innovation? This leads to my final principle, which is that regulators can do\nmore to promote innovation. Regulators can do more than simply tolerate innovation, they can\npromote it through transparency and open communication. Take, for example, the frictions\nassociated with cross border payments, including the speed and cost and the ability to transfer\nmoney. At first blush, this seems like a prime opportunity for innovation to come in with a new\napproach.\n- 7 -\nThe challenge in cross-border payments historically has been achieving the goal of\nserving new types of customers and increasing the speed of payments, without losing or watering\ndown important compliance safeguards that deter criminal activity. Some perceived payment\nfrictions exist for specific policy reasons and do not stem from issues with existing technology.\nTherefore, new technology alone cannot solve the issue unless it also addresses the required\nsafeguards.\nRegulators can serve a valuable role in identifying where a technology solution may have\nan important “gap,” as in the case of cross-border payments, by identifying how a solution can\nmeet the needs of both customers and regulators. Innovation and regulatory and legal\nrequirements can coexist—providing both enhanced capability and regulatory compliance.\nTransparency can promote innovation.\nPolicymakers should strive to define a clear and sensible regulatory framework designed\nto meet policy objectives that also enables the private sector to innovate within the established\nguardrails. A clear regulatory framework supports private sector innovators by providing clarity\nand consistency that encourages long term business investment in pursing innovation, while\ncontinuing to support today’s products and services. A regulatory framework empowers\nsupervisors to focus on safety and soundness and ensuring a safe and efficient payment system.\nIn the past, I have described an approach to innovation that solves specific problems and\nenables banks and other providers to meet the needs of their customers in a safe and sound\nmanner.3\n This approach recognizes the role of the private sector and focuses policymakers on\n3 Michelle W. Bowman, “Responsible Innovation in Money and Payments,” (Speech at the Roundtable on Central\nBank Digital Currency, hosted by the Harvard Law School Program on International Financial Systems, October 17,\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20231017a.pdf.\n- 8 -\npayment and financial system infrastructure while balancing the public policy objectives with the\nbenefits provided. In this construct, the same activities that present the same risks must be\nsubject to the same regulatory expectations—regardless of what the product is called or where it\nis offered.\nThe active promotion of innovation has proven to be successful in the past. One example\nfrom 2019 highlights the benefits of this approach, specifically as it relates to the use of\nalternative data to support small dollar consumer loans.4\n Timely guidance and regulatory clarity\nin the interagency statement clarified that, with a customer’s consent, a bank may use alternative\ndata, like checking account balance activity to help evaluate the potential borrower’s\ncreditworthiness who might not have otherwise qualified for a loan. This example did not\nrequire a change in technology, instead it used data in a responsible and innovative way through\nleveraging deposit account cashflow information to show credit worthiness, enabling banks to\nmeet their customers’ credit needs.\nI think there is more we could do on this front. For example, I think there are\nopportunities for regulators to provide clear, actionable, and timely feedback on innovation\nproposals. And the principles I have described are complementary—the more regulators\nunderstand innovation, the more comfortable they will be in accepting it and promoting its\nadoption in the financial system. My hope is that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing research and\nengagement with industry will help us continue to understand and assess the potential benefits\nand risks presented by new innovation.\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\n“Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting,” CA letter 19-11, December 12,\n2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm.\n- 9 -\nClosing thoughts\nAs I consider the ever-evolving financial landscape, I will continue think about how the\nregulatory framework can accommodate new technology and services, while applying the\nsafeguards in place today that protect households and businesses, and guard against illicit\nactivity, ensuring the safety and soundness and the stability of the financial system. My hope is\nthat as we enhance our understanding, and we recognize the promise of new technology, we can\nachieve a banking system that welcomes innovation, and is stronger and more efficient as a\nresult.\nThank you for the invitation to join you today to discuss these issues.

    "text": "It is a pleasure to join you this afternoon for the South Carolina Community Bankers\nConference.1\n I always welcome the opportunity to learn from and share my perspective with\nbankers on issues affecting the U.S. economy and the financial industry. Today, I will focus my\ndiscussion on monetary policy, bank regulatory reforms, the evolving standards in bank\nsupervision, and new developments in the payments system. I look forward to learning from\nyour insights and perspectives on these issues, particularly your views on bank supervision,\nregulatory reforms, and your thoughts on the direction of the economy. As we kick off the new\nyear, it’s also a good time to look back on 2023 and consider a few New Year’s resolutions for\nthe coming year.\nBefore discussing bank regulation and supervision, I’d like to offer my thoughts on the\neconomy and monetary policy.\nOur Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in December left the target range\nfor the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and continued the run-off of the Fed’s\nsecurities holdings. Inflation data over the past six months indicate that the Committee’s past\npolicy actions are having the intended effect of bringing demand and supply into better balance.\nThis continued progress on lowering inflation reflects a restrictive policy stance with the most\nrecent 12-month total and core personal consumption expenditures inflation readings through\nNovember at 2.6 and 3.2 percent respectively. Employment data, though often significantly\nrevised, continue to show signs of a tight labor market with reports of healthy job gains. The\naverage pace of job gains has slowed over the past year, which may be a sign that labor market\nsupply and demand are coming into better balance. The economy has remained strong even with\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n- 2 -\nthe pace of real gross domestic product projected to moderate from the third quarter 2023\nstrength.\nConsidering this progress, I voted to maintain the policy rate at its current level while we\ncontinue to monitor the incoming data and assess the implications for the inflation and economic\noutlook. And based on this progress, my view has evolved to consider the possibility that the\nrate of inflation could decline further with the policy rate held at the current level for some time.\nShould inflation continue to fall closer to our 2 percent goal over time, it will eventually become\nappropriate to begin the process of lowering our policy rate to prevent policy from becoming\noverly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. And important upside inflation risks\nremain.\nTo the extent that both food and energy markets remain exposed to geopolitical\ninfluences, they present upside risks to inflation. There is also the risk that the recent easing in\nfinancial conditions encourages a reacceleration of growth, stalling the progress in lowering\ninflation, or even causing inflation to reaccelerate. Finally, there is a risk that continued labor\nmarket tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. While I do not tend to\ntake too much signal from one report, last Friday’s employment report showed continued\nstrength in job gains and wage growth, and the labor force participation rate declined.\nGiven these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely—including data revisions, which have increased in magnitude\nand frequency since the pandemic—as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. I will\nremain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the\n- 3 -\noutlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be sufficiently restrictive to\nbring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate\nfurther at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled\nor reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable\nprices over the longer run.\nTwenty-twenty-three was a particularly busy year for banking regulators. Before I dig\ndeeper into bank regulation, I’d like to recap a few of 2023’s notable banking industry events.\nAnd since we are embarking on a journey into the new year, I will conclude by offering a few\nideas for New Year’s resolutions for regulators to consider prioritizing for 2024. These\nresolutions borrow heavily from principles that I have discussed publicly a number of times in\nthe past, but they continue to be critical in guiding my thinking and approach to regulation. And\nI encourage my colleagues in banking regulation and supervision to consider these ideas as we\nbegin 2024 with a full regulatory agenda.\nKey Developments in 2023\nTwenty-twenty-three brought many significant developments in bank regulation and\nsupervision, beginning with speculation about the now-issued proposal to finalize the Basel III\n“endgame” capital rules. The Basel III capital rules were designed to apply only to the largest\nbanks with significant cross-border activities, so much of the speculation early last year focused\non scope—which banks would be subject to the rules under the new proposal—and calibration,\nhow the capital requirements would change—whether they would increase, decrease, or remain\nthe same. On the question of calibration, much of the speculation centered around whether\nregulators would propose significant increases to aggregate capital requirements or adopt a\n“capital neutral” approach by refining standards but keeping aggregate capital levels largely the\n- 4 -\nsame. The objective of having a “capital neutral” proposal seemed reasonable to many, based on\nthe understanding that a holistic review of the capital framework was in process at the Federal\nReserve Board.\nIn March, however, priorities and focus changed. The failures of Silicon Valley Bank\n(SVB) and Signature Bank resulted in the exceedingly rare steps to invoke the systemic risk\nexception to guarantee all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank,2 and to create\nthe Bank Term Funding Program.\n3 These were significant emergency actions to support and\nstabilize the banking system. It is important to note that the Bank Term Funding Program is\nscheduled to expire in mid-March of this year. Understandably, the bank failures led regulators\nto take a hard look at what may have been missed in our supervision and what had driven\nregulatory and supervisory priorities leading up to these bank failures.\nSeveral post-mortem reviews were conducted in the immediate aftermath of the failures\nto identify and analyze the circumstances and factors that contributed to the bank failures. Many\nof these reviews suffered from serious shortcomings, including compressed timeframes for\ncompletion and the significantly limited matters that were within the scope of review.\nNevertheless, these reviews were, and continue to be, singularly relied upon as a basis for\nresetting regulatory and supervisory priorities. The findings of these limited reviews have also\ncontinued to influence proposals that had long been in the pipeline, especially those related to\ncapital reforms.\nI view the remainder of last year as something akin to a regulatory tidal wave, in light of\nthe sheer volume of regulatory initiatives considered, published, and finalized. Many were\n2\n See 12 U.S.C. § 1823(c)(4)(G).\n3\n See 12 U.S.C. § 343.\n- 5 -\nundertaken or expanded with the purported goal to help address root causes of the bank failures\nand banking system stress. But this also included a rulemaking agenda that at times had little to\nno nexus with the root causes of the failures. Without a doubt, it was a challenge to support the\nregulatory agenda this past year.\nThe published capital rulemaking proposal incorporated an expansive scope, a notable\nshift in approach, pushing down new Basel capital requirements to all banks with over $100\nbillion in assets, regardless of their international activities.\n4\n At the same time, the capital\nproposal would substantially increase regulatory capital buffer and minimum requirements for\nthe covered firms. In close succession, the agencies proposed new “long-term debt”\nrequirements. This long-term debt proposal would require firms with over $100 billion in assets\nto issue debt at the top-tier parent level that could better absorb losses during bankruptcy, which\nonly becomes relevant after the bank fails, not in order to prevent a failure. In part, these\nproposals were characterized as helping to address the root causes of the bank failures. As I’ve\nnoted in the past, I think there are reasons to question whether these proposed revisions are\neffective and appropriately targeted and calibrated, particularly when considering that bank\nmanagement and supervisory shortcomings more directly contributed to the bank failures than\nregulatory shortcomings. The banking agencies simply cannot regulate better or more effective\nsupervision. We must appropriately manage our supervisory programs and teams to ensure that\neffective and consistent supervision is implemented within each firm and that it is effective and\nconsistent across our regulated entities.\n4\n See dissenting statement, “Statement by Governor Michelle W. Bowman” on the proposed rule to implement the\nBasel III endgame agreement for large banks, news release, July 27, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20230727.htm.\n- 6 -\nFor community banks, two of the most important developments last year were the\nfinalization of revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act regulations, and the proposal to\namend the debit interchange fee cap in the Board’s Regulation II. Many in the banking industry\nhave expressed concern with the amendments to the CRA regulations, noting among other things\nthe increased cost and burden associated with a number of the proposed revisions and new data\nsystems required for compliance. In addition, many raised concerns about the potential adverse\nconsequences of the rules, which include the possibility that these rules will reduce the\navailability of credit in some underserved markets if banks cut back lending activities due to\nrevisions made to assessment areas defined in the new rules.5\n Similarly, the proposed revisions\nto Regulation II have generated concern from banks directly subject to the rules, but also from\nexempt banks concerned that the practical effect will be to push lower interchange fees down to\nall debit card issuers.6\nOf course, supervision also saw significant changes in 2023, with the publication of new\nguidance on third-party risk management applicable to all financial institutions, without tailoring\nor guidance to assist the smallest banks in compliance,7 and climate guidance that on its face\napplies only to institutions with more than $100 billion in assets.8\n In 2023, many banks also\nreported very material shifts in bank examinations, with a renewed focus on interest rate risk,\n5\n See dissenting statement, “Statement on the Community Reinvestment Act Final Rule by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, October 24, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowmanstatement-20231024.htm.\n6\n See dissenting statement, “Statement on Proposed Revisions to Regulation II’s Interchange Fee Cap by Governor\nMichelle W. Bowman,” news release, October 25, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20231025.htm.\n7\n See dissenting statement, “Statement on Third-Party Risk Management Guidance by Governor Michelle W.\nBowman,” news release, June 6, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowmanstatement-20230606.htm.\n8\n See dissenting statement “Statement by Governor Bowman on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk\nManagement for Large Financial Institutions,” news release, December 2, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bowman-statement-20221202.htm.\n- 7 -\nliquidity risk, and management, and banks continue to see ongoing changes in supervisory\nexpectations. Many of these examination-related shifts have received little public\nacknowledgement or attention, in large part because the rules designed to protect confidential\nsupervisory information frustrate visibility into structural shifts in the supervisory process. As\nyou all know well, changes in supervisory expectations frequently come without the benefit of\nguidance, advance notice, or published rulemaking, and in the worst-case scenario these shifts,\ncloaked by the veil of supervisory opacity, can have significant financial and reputational\nimpacts.\nResolutions for 2024\nThe new year provides a prime opportunity to reflect on the past 12 months and think\nabout how the Federal Reserve can improve our approach. I’m sure many of us took the\nopportunity to reflect on recent experiences as we rang in 2024. I see the new year as a perfect\ntime to think about how the banking regulators can implement some recent lessons learned. This\nvery brief snapshot of the past year does not cover all of the important developments in the\nbanking system, and the bank regulatory framework, that occurred in 2023. But it is a helpful\nstarting point for considering the year ahead. So now, I’d like to offer three new year’s\nresolutions for bank regulators.\nPrioritize Safety and Soundness\nFirst, safety and soundness should be renewed as the highest priority supervisory\nconcern. This is a regulator’s greatest responsibility and ensures the safe and sound continuous\noperation of the financial system. Last year’s stress, precipitated by the spring bank failures,\nvalidated the tenet that supervision, when implemented effectively and appropriately, is the\nsingle most effective tool to support a safe and sound banking system. In the case of SVB,\n- 8 -\nsupervisors failed to appreciate, appropriately identify, and mitigate the known significant,\nidiosyncratic risks of a business model that relied on a highly concentrated, uninsured base of\ndepositors, and the buildup of interest rate risk without appropriate risk management.\nBut as every banker in this room knows, concentration risk and interest rate risk are not\nnovel or unique risks, and these good old-fashioned risks can create vulnerabilities fatal to\nindividual institutions if not appropriately anticipated and managed. Banking regulators and\nsupervisors at all levels of our dual banking system have long focused on these risks. Therefore,\nI recommend that regulators collectively resolve to renew the focus on these and other\nlongstanding and fundamental risks to banks and the banking system.\nSo, what should bank regulators do differently to prioritize safety and soundness? In my\nview, the problems in 2023 resulted from a failure to identify and prioritize the appropriate areas\nof risk. Instead, the focus was on broader, more qualitative, more process- and policy-oriented\nareas of risk. This focus resulted in a disproportionate emphasis on issues that distracted from\nthe fundamental risks to the bank’s balance sheet.\nRegulators often identify evolving conditions and emerging risks before they materialize\nas pronounced stress in the banking system. But too often, regulators fail to take appropriately\ndecisive measures to address them. Regulators can also fall into the trap of getting distracted\nfrom core financial risks, and instead focus on issues that are tangential to statutory mandates\nand critical areas of responsibility. Focusing on risks that pose fewer safety and soundness\nconcerns increases the risk that regulators miss other, more foundational and pressing areas that\nrequire more immediate attention.\nIn my view, the new climate guidance introduced by the federal banking agencies last\nyear effectively illustrates this lost focus. While perhaps well-intended, this guidance mandates\n- 9 -\na diversion of limited supervisory resources away from critical, near-term safety and soundness\nrisks. Setting aside differing views about the appropriateness of the content of the guidance, the\nfundamental question is whether climate change is a core, present-tense risk to safety and\nsoundness—not whether climate change is an important public policy issue. And here, the\nevidence suggests that climate change is not currently a prominent financial risk to the banking\nsystem.\nThis lack of attention and focus on the most material safety and soundness risks may\nresult from intentional policy preferences, or simply may be the product of allowing ourselves to\nbe distracted from known, longstanding risks over calm periods of banking conditions.\nWhatever the cause, it comes at a significant cost, as both banks and regulators shift resources\nand supervisory attention away from the most pressing risks.\nRenewed Commitment to Tailoring\nSecond, is a renewed commitment to our Congressionally mandated obligation to\ntailoring. The current bank regulatory framework relies upon a risk-based, tailored approach,\nwhich strives to fulfill the congressional mandate to tailor the prudential regulatory framework\nfor institutions with more than $100 billion in assets by aligning regulation with risk.9\n As we\nengage in ongoing regulatory reform, we must not lose sight of the virtues of this approach, for\ninstitutions of all sizes. Tailoring helps regulators prioritize the allocation of supervisory\nresources to focus on the most important risks and emerging threats to the financial system.\nTailoring regulations does not mean that regulators can or should ignore safety and soundness\nissues at smaller institutions, or that the standards for smaller institutions should not be robust.\nAs this audience knows well, all banks are subject to periodic examinations, capital\n9\n Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n- 10 -\nrequirements, and regulatory reporting requirements, and have regular engagement with bank\nexaminers at the state and or federal levels. Starting with an approach that acknowledges the\nimportance of tailoring helps us avoid the impulse to simply crank regulatory dials to their\nhighest level for all firms (or “up to 11,” like the amplifiers in the classic film, This Is Spinal\nTap).\n10 This type of approach overlooks fundamental differences in business model and asset\nsize, while tailoring ensures that we appropriately calibrate regulations and expectations to the\nsize, complexity, and business model of institutions.\nThe existing capital framework provides a well-reasoned model for how this tailored\napproach results in appropriate requirements based on firm characteristics. The largest firms are\ndivided into four categories based on size and complexity, with the largest and most complex\nfirms being subject to the most stringent requirements. Regional banks, with $10 billion to $100\nbillion in assets, are subject to a somewhat more streamlined capital framework. And finally, the\nsimplest rules are reserved for community banks that rely on a less complex, relationship-based\nbusiness model.\nAs this example illustrates, incorporating graduated requirements not only helps to\neffectively allocate limited supervisory resources, but it also avoids creating regulatory\nincentives that could unintentionally alter the banking landscape. For example, without tailoring,\nit is likely that the requirements for the largest and most complex banks would be pushed down\nto smaller banks that have simple, straightforward business models, either directly through\nchanges to regulation, or indirectly through opaque supervisory expectations. This environment\nwould create overwhelming incentives for industry consolidation, since a bank with a simple\nbusiness model would be subject to and expected to comply with requirements designed for\n10 This Is Spinal Tap, directed by Rob Reiner (1984).\n- 11 -\nlarger and more complex banks, and consolidation creates economies of scale that make it more\ncost-effective to comply with these requirements.\nMy concern is that an overbroad application of requirements—requirements that are not\ntailored—could become a characteristic of future regulatory reforms. The Basel capital proposal\nhighlights this concern. While the comment period is still open until January 16, much of the\nfeedback shared with me so far has focused on two prominent concerns: (1) that the increases to\ncapital requirements would be significantly higher than stakeholders anticipated, and (2) that the\nproposal would largely “flatten” the regulatory requirements for all banks over $100 billion,\ncreating a severe cliff effect for firms approaching or crossing that threshold. Banks within this\nasset range are already carefully considering the ongoing viability of remaining at an asset size\nnear that threshold. Firms just above the threshold will face strong pressure to shrink below the\nthreshold or to merge to achieve economies of scale to comply with the breadth and complexity\nof the new requirements. Firms just below the threshold will need to be very intentional about\napproaching it and may consider revising business strategies and activities to remain below the\nthreshold.\nWhile the capital proposal does not directly apply to regional and community banks, all\nbanks are affected when policymakers shift away from or deemphasize tailoring. When we fail\nto recognize fundamental differences among firms, there is a strong temptation to continually\npush down requirements designed and calibrated for larger and more complex banks, to smaller\nand less complex banks that cannot reasonably be expected to comply with these standards. As\nwe look to the future and the anticipated regulatory agenda for 2024, the critical role of tailoring\nmust be incorporated as a foundational element of these regulatory reforms.\n- 12 -\nIncrease Transparency\nThe third and final resolution is increasing transparency in supervisory expectations.\nWhile policymakers may have different views on the decisions embedded in the regulatory\nframework, such as where thresholds should be set, and the calibration of different requirements,\none virtue of regulation is that the requirements are spelled out in public, in advance, and in\nsome specificity and granularity. If you are a bank, you know which regulations apply to your\nbusiness model.\nBut is this true in practice? As a banker, do you always know the standards to which you\nwill be held prior to the examination? One of the concerning trends in 2023 were reports,\nincluding from state banking regulators, that some supervisory actions were excessive in light of\nthe risks posed by some smaller institutions. It seems reasonable that the banking system stress\nplayed a role in tightening supervisory expectations. But we must also ensure that supervisory\nexpectations and the resulting actions are appropriately calibrated and based on existing\nconditions, rather than driven by premature judgments and uncertain or unsupported supervisory\npredictions or assumptions. Transparency allows bankers to understand supervisory expectations\nin advance and work to meet those expectations. As you know, bankers have a deep\ncommitment to operate safely and soundly but have no ability to look inside the mind of an\nexaminer to divine that expectations have shifted. Opaque shifts in expectations can create\nunwelcome surprises in the examination process. These “surprises,” in the form of ratings\ndowngrades, can create significant issues for banks: they can disrupt business plans, including\nbank mergers and acquisitions, and create pressure on a bank to divert resources away from\nserving customers to addressing non-critical supervisory matters.\n- 13 -\nThe increasing trend of supervisory “surprises” we saw in 2023 suggests to me a\nshortcoming in supervisory transparency. This by no means suggests that banks should not be\nheld to high standards. To the contrary, it means that we should hold banks to standards that are\nknown and identifiable, and when those standards inevitably evolve over time, we should give\nadvance notice to our regulated institutions so they can manage their businesses accordingly to\nensure continued compliance.\nClosing Thoughts\nI will conclude by expressing my appreciation for the opportunity to speak to you today.\nWe are entering the new year at a time when significant changes to the banking system and bank\nregulatory framework are actively being considered. Many of these changes will have a lasting\nimpact on banks of all sizes and their current and future customers, how banks run their\nbusinesses, and the broader U.S. economy.\nMy hope is that you, as bankers, and other interested stakeholders play an active role in\nthis process, by sharing your views and concerns broadly, including with regulators directly.\nThis input provides valuable insights into the specific impacts—intended and unintended—of\nchanges to the bank regulatory framework. Voicing your concerns enables us to identify, and\nwhere needed, address, the real-world consequences of regulatory and supervisory reforms. I\ncertainly don’t need to remind this audience that the stakes are extremely high. My sincere hope\nfor 2024 is that policymakers have the humility to acknowledge the intended and unintended\nconsequences of these and upcoming regulatory reform efforts, and the courage to change\ncourse, when necessary, to mitigate and minimize these consequences. The future of the banking\nsystem and the ongoing strength of the U.S. economy depend on it."

All throughout this great nation, and the state\nof Texas, community and regional banks provide financial services and essential credit to assist\nfamilies and businesses achieve their dreams.\nFederal regulators, including the Federal Reserve, in partnership with state banking\ndepartments—like Commissioner Cooper and his team here in Texas—are responsible for\nensuring that banks provide these services in accordance with consumer and safety and\nsoundness laws. State bank regulators help to provide context and an understanding of the\nunique economic conditions that exist within Texas and within the different regions of the state.\nThis context helps our supervisory teams at the Fed better understand the decisions that a bank’s\nmanagement might make in light of particular circumstances and market dynamics.\nToday, I thought I would spend some time following up on a few topics that I have been\nspeaking about recently that provide some insight into the roles of policymakers and regulators,\nbut most importantly highlighting the critical role of bankers in facilitating a strong economy. I\nwill begin with bank supervision and risk-tailored bank regulation, and how I think about\ntailoring in the context of the recent bank failures and ongoing discussions about regulatory\nreform. I will then talk about the benefits of nimble supervision and how that approach supports\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\n- 2 -\na U.S. financial system with banks of all sizes in every community in every diverse region of this\ncountry.\nAnd finally, I will address the importance of ensuring that both banks and examiners are\nwell prepared and positioned for potential stress in the banking market. Most importantly,\nthough, I want to emphasize the role of due process in the Federal Reserve’s bank supervision.\nWe should not be remotely analyzing your bank and downgrading your rating without\ncommunication and justification. Due process requires formal engagement between examiners\nand the bank. If our examiners believe there is a reason to be concerned with the condition of\nyour institution, the examiners should notify you and engage directly with you to make sure that\nthey have a clear understanding of all of the facts, and that any supervisory actions—including\nany discussion of ratings downgrades—are appropriate based on the unique facts and\ncircumstances of the institution.\nIt's been a while since I’ve felt the need to say this to our state-chartered banks, but the\ntime has come to renew this message today and to emphasize it going forward. I’m sure you are\nnot surprised that our largest bank CEOs do not hesitate to engage directly with the Board and\nReserve Bank presidents. I see one of my many functions and roles as a Member of the Board of\nGovernors as providing that open door and opportunity for direct engagement with a\npolicymaker for our regional and smaller banks, as well. Your Texas ABA executive, Chris\nFurlow, who is a long time friend and colleague, can put you directly in touch with me should\nyou desire to do so. As a former banker, and bank commissioner, I know from experience that\nbuilding a relationship is key to effective communication. And it’s always better to have made\nthat connection before you need it. I look forward to that opportunity to get to know each of\nyou.\n- 3 -\nTailored Supervision and Regulation, and the Path Forward for Reform\nAs every banker in this room knows, tailoring is a critical aspect of the federal regulatory\nand supervisory framework. It has continued to be a core principle in strengthening bank\noversight since the 2008 financial crisis. Over the years, as regulators refined and improved the\nregulatory and supervisory framework, the concept of tailoring has evolved. Overseeing banks\nbased on their size, risk, business model, and complexity provides appropriate proportionality to\nour work.\nI’ve often said that risk-based supervision is itself a form of tailoring.2\n This approach to\nsupervision and regulation, when it works effectively, allows us to focus supervisory attention on\nareas that pose the greatest risk. It also recommends differences in regulatory requirements and\nsupervisory expectations, based on the size and complexity of the bank. It is simply common\nsense that what works well for the largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) is not\nappropriate for regional and community banks. Our tailored approach applies across many areas,\nincluding in the stringency and complexity of capital requirements and for regulatory reporting\nobligations.\nAs regulators consider the appropriate response to the recent bank failures, a renewed\nfocus on the role of tailoring has emerged. From my perspective, there are several important\nsteps we must take. First, we must seriously consider the feedback from a variety of internal and\nexternal viewpoints to identify what went wrong. In my view, one of the most effective steps the\n2\n Michelle W. Bowman, “Independence, Predictability, and Tailoring in Banking Regulation and Supervision”\n(speech at the American Bankers Association Community Banking Conference, February 13, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230213a.pdf.\n- 4 -\nFederal Reserve could take would be to engage an independent third party to analyze the events\nsurrounding the failure of these banks, so that we can fully understand what led to the failures.\nBefore making conclusions about appropriate responses going forward to address causal issues,\nwe need accurate, impartial, and thorough information to inform the debate about what\nspecifically may be needed to fix any problems in our supervision and regulatory framework.\nSecond, supervisors must do a better job of focusing on and identifying key issues and\nrisks to ensure they can be promptly remediated. It is imperative that bank management, the\nboard of directors, and supervisors understand bank business models, and risks that may emerge\nto threaten that model. Where issues are identified, supervisors need to clearly explain the\nconcerns, so that bank management can create a plan to address them. Regulators already have a\ncomprehensive toolkit at their disposal to encourage issue resolution, and frankly, we need to use\nthose tools appropriately, not create more tools because we failed to use the tools at our disposal.\nTo be sure, we do need to consider whether there are necessary, appropriate adjustments\nto improve the bank regulatory and supervisory framework. But our focus in doing so must be\nconcentrated on identified problems and risks with clearly defined goals and outcomes. We\nshould avoid using these bank failures as a pretext to push for other, unrelated changes to bank\nregulation. But, as we engage in this exercise, I think we need to carefully consider both the\nstrength of the current regulatory framework and the effective implementation of tailored\nsupervision.\nOn this last issue—as we consider making changes—we need to carefully consider how\nthese proposals will incorporate tailoring of regulation and supervision—specifically when\nconsidering reforms.\n- 5 -\nAre we in the same place today as we were at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis? Of\ncourse not. While we have seen stress in some parts of the banking system, overall the system is\nstrong and resilient. U.S. banks have high levels of capital and liquidity, and banks of all sizes\ncontinue to support the economy. To a large degree, this strength comes from the work done at\nthe direction of Congress, most recently pursuant to the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory\nRelief, and Consumer Protection Act, which better aligned regulation with risk.3 The strong set\nof laws and regulations we have today suggests that the problems in the banking system require a\ntargeted solution, one focused on actual risks, on improvement of supervision and risk\nmanagement, and on prompt remediation of supervisory issues.\nNot only is the current tailoring approach robust, it also results in efficiency. Tailoring\ndistinguishes firms by size, risk, and complexity, and imposes appropriate regulatory\nrequirements in light of these differences. The Board considers a number of factors when\nevaluating the largest firms, including size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding, off-balance sheet exposures, and nonbank assets. These characteristics, and\nthe G-SIB scoring methodology more broadly, help distinguish the largest firms that pose the\ngreatest risks from smaller and less systemic firms. Even for smaller firms, we have clear\nregulatory standards and thresholds to ensure that supervision is appropriately tailored for each\ninstitution. This framework provides appropriate scale for both regulators and for banks. It\nstrikes the crucial balance between safety and soundness and ensuring that well-supervised and\nregulated banks are able to continue providing credit to their local and regional businesses and\ncommunities.\n3\n Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296 (2018).\n- 6 -\nFundamentally, we should be careful not to undermine tailoring and risk-based\nsupervision. While there were some clear lapses in the supervision of Silicon Valley Bank, our\nFed supervisors and those with the other banking agencies are dedicated public servants who I\nam confident will embrace the lessons learned from the recent bank failures. We need to provide\nexaminers with direction and support to promote safety and soundness in the banking system.\nThe banks that recently failed were unique in their operations and business models. These\nfailures alone do not justify layering on inefficient and overly complex supervision on a broad\nrange of other banks.\nNimble Supervision\nOne reasonable expectation from the many reviews of the recent bank failures will likely\nbe an analysis of and recommendation for changes in supervision. How do we prioritize these\nissues for improving risk-based supervision? How do we revise those priorities when underlying\neconomic conditions evolve or banks begin to engage in new activities that present new risks?\nWe will need to be sure that whatever approach we adopt, we devote sufficient supervisory\nattention to the areas of highest risk, while not hindering innovation.\nAs I’ve briefly discussed today, we need to have a supervisory system that focuses\nappropriate attention on the traditional risks that are inherent to the business of banking: credit,\nliquidity, concentration, and interest rate risk. Historically, supervision has been an effective\ntool to address these traditional risks. Supervisors can make sure that banks are working to\nmitigate such risks with effective risk management and liquidity planning.\nAs we consider changes to our framework, we need to understand potential unintended\nconsequences and be mindful that we do not inhibit innovation so that banks remain competitive\nand well positioned to effectively serve the needs of their customers.\n- 7 -\nIt will continue to be a challenge to ensure the appropriate focus on traditional banking\nrisks while encouraging innovation. But it can be accomplished if we approach it from the need\nfor transparency, transparency by banks about their innovation activities and agenda, and\ntransparency by regulators regarding supervisory expectations and emerging risks. Transparency\ncan help us promote these dual objectives, maintaining a focus on traditional risks, while\nenabling banks to innovate in a safe and sound manner, with a clear understanding of our\nexpectations. At the same time, failure to adopt a transparent approach can lead to adverse\nconsequences for consumers, businesses, and communities by limiting banking products and\nservices and pushing activities outside of the regulated banking system. We need to preserve\nregulatory support for innovation conducted safely and soundly consistent with applicable laws,\nincluding consumer protection.\nPromoting Bank Readiness\nVoices calling for broad, fundamental reforms of the U.S. banking system appear to\nadvocate a shift away from tailoring and risk-based supervision. The view that we extend the\nreach of overly complex and outsized regulatory requirements to banks that are smaller and less\ncomplex ignores some likely results—doing so will lead to bank consolidation, and will\npotentially push banking activities outside of the regulated banking system. This could also lead\nto the elimination of all but the largest too-big-to-fail banks who would then be insulated from\nother competition. This is surely not the outcome that supporters of the 2008 financials crisis\nreforms were seeking.\nIt is also, in my mind, not the right approach. In a time of potential stress, we need to be\nforward focused on bank preparedness so that banks are positioned to address issues of concern.\nThese include being prepared to address contingency funding needs, with a plan in place that has\n- 8 -\nbeen tested and is ready to be executed. Regulators need to be supportive of this kind of\nplanning. One of the preliminary lessons learned from the recent bank failures is that bank\nmanagement, and their boards of directors, should be prepared to test the banks’ ability to\nmanage liquidity needs during times of stress.\nThis is one area where I think bankers can make an important, immediate contribution. I\nstrongly encourage bankers to consider creating a plan to handle liquidity needs during times of\nunexpected stress—and then test the ability to execute the plans. Adverse conditions can\nescalate quickly, and influences beyond a bank management’s control, including irrational\nactors, can impact your business in very short order. For example, we know that a number of\nbanks have not registered for or accessed the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nBut if the bank plans include accessing discount window lending—even if the likelihood\nof that stress is extremely remote—it is critical to understand in advance the steps needed to be\ntaken during the emergency. This could include testing the capacity to pledge collateral or even\njust contacting your local Reserve Bank to learn about or complete the necessary onboarding\nprocedures.\nThe Path Forward\nMy views on the path forward are informed by serving as the bank commissioner for the\nstate of Kansas as its lead regulator and supervisor, my experience as a banker, and especially by\nmy service on the Board of Governors since 2018, during a time when the banking system has\nexperienced many unique stresses including those associated with the COVID pandemic. There\nhave already been some preliminary and expedited internal reports published on the failures of\nSVB and Signature Bank, and I fully expect to see additional reports and analysis of these\n- 9 -\nfailures, and the failure of First Republic, in the coming months.4\n These preliminary reviews are\nan important first step for the U.S. bank regulators working to identify root causes of these bank\nfailures and holding themselves accountable for supervisory mistakes. There are additional steps\nthat we can take.\nFirst, I believe that the Federal Reserve should engage an independent third party to\nprepare a report to supplement the limited internal review to fully understand the failure of SVB.\nThis would be a logical next step in holding ourselves accountable and would help to eliminate\nthe doubts that may naturally accompany any self-assessment prepared and reviewed by a single\nmember of the Board of Governors.5\n This external independent report should also cover a\nbroader time period, including the events of the weekend following the failure of SVB, and a\nbroader range of topics beyond just the regulatory and supervisory framework that applied to\nSVB, including operational issues, if any, with discount window lending, Fedwire services, and\nwith the transfer of collateral from the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nSecond, I believe we need to do a better job identifying the most critical issues and\nmoving quickly to remediate them. It is evident that both supervisors and bank management\nneglected key, long-standing risk factors that should be an area of focus in any examination.\nThese include concentration risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. We have the tools to\n4\n See Government Accountability Office, “Bank Regulation: Preliminary Review of Agency Actions Related to\nMarch 2023 Bank Failures” GAO-23-106736 (Washington: Government Accountability Office, April 2023),\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106736.pdf; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “FDIC’s Supervision of\nSignature Bank” (Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, April 28, 2023),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23033a.pdf; Michael Barr, Vice Chair for Supervision of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation\nof Silicon Valley Bank” (April 28, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review20230428.pdf.\n5 As noted in Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr’s review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley\nBank, “[the] report was written with the benefit of hindsight on the particular facts and circumstances that proved\nmost relevant for SVB and SVBFG. The report was prepared in a compressed time frame from March 13, 2023,\nthrough April 28, 2023, and further work over a longer period could draw additional or different conclusions.” Barr,\nReview of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.\n- 10 -\naddress these issues, but we need to ensure that examiners focus on these core risks and are not\ndistracted by novel activity or concepts.\nFinally, we should consider whether there are necessary—and targeted—adjustments we\nshould make to banking regulation. This will likely include a broad range of topics, including\ntaking a close look at deposit insurance reform, the treatment of uninsured deposits, and a\nreconsideration of current deposit insurance limits.6\n We should avoid using these bank failures\nas a pretext to push for other, unrelated changes to banking regulation. Our focus should be on\nremediating known, identified issues with bank supervision and issues that emerge from the\npublic autopsy of these events.\nA debate about regulatory changes must also consider where we are today as compared to\nprior to the 2008 financial crisis. The banking system is strong and resilient despite recent\nbanking stress. The Fed has refined regulatory standards over time at the direction of Congress,\nand through the “tailoring” regulations I discussed earlier that are designed to better align\nregulation with risk. 7\n Even with the implementation of these changes, banks today are better\ncapitalized, with more liquidity, and are subject to a new range of supervisory tools that did not\nexist prior to 2008. This banking system is not only strong today but is well prepared to continue\nsupporting the provision of credit and the broader economy.\nRadical reform of the bank regulatory framework—as opposed to targeted changes to\naddress identified root causes of banking system stress—is incompatible with the fundamental\nstrength of the banking system. I am extremely concerned about calls for casting aside tiering\n6\n See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Options for Deposit Insurance Reform” (Washington: Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, May 1, 2023), https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/options-deposit-insurancereforms/report/options-deposit-insurance-reform-full.pdf.\n7\n Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law No. 115-174, 132 Stat. 1296\n(2018).\n- 11 -\nexpectations for less complex institutions, given the clear statutory direction to provide for\nappropriately calibrated requirements for these banks.\nI have also heard calls for broad, fundamental reforms for the past several years, shifting\naway from tailoring and risk-based supervision. I believe this is the wrong direction for any\nconversation about banking reform. The unique nature and business models of the banks that\nrecently failed, in my view, do not justify imposing new, overly complex regulatory and\nsupervisory expectations on a broad range of banks. If we allow this to occur, we will end up\nwith a system of significantly fewer banks serving significantly fewer customers. Those who\nwill likely bear the burden of this new banking system are those at the lower end of the economic\nspectrum, both individuals and businesses.\nThe American economy relies on a broad and diverse range of businesses supported by a\nbroad and diverse range of banks. Eliminating regional banks from the U.S. banking system\nwould be devastating to businesses and communities across America. Especially in those\nregions whose communities are not sufficiently served by larger institutions.\nAs I conclude, I want to reiterate that the banking system remains strong and resilient,\nand that bankers across Texas, and the United States, are deeply engaged in their work to support\nand build their local businesses and communities. It is imperative that going forward\npolicymakers preserve a framework that supports a diverse and dynamic banking sector, with\nbanks of all sizes that serve the needs of their unique customers wherever they are located.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today"

    "text": "I would like to thank the New Jersey Bankers Association for the invitation to share my\nthoughts with you today.1\n While I welcome the opportunity to share my thoughts about\nmonetary policy, the economy, and the path of regulatory reform, I find it even more valuable to\nhear your views on local banking and economic conditions in the communities you serve, and\nyour perspectives on trends in bank regulation and supervision. These conversations provide\nvaluable insights to inform my work at the Federal Reserve—both for my understanding of the\neconomy and the banking environment.\nBefore discussing bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly\ntightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our most recent meeting in\nJanuary, we voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5¼ to 5½ percent and\nto continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.\nWe have seen continued progress on inflation over the past year, with the 12-month\nreadings through January of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation\nmoving down to 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, both at the lowest rates we have seen\nsince early 2021. Although inflation declined over the second half of 2023, the January inflation\ndata suggest that progress in bringing inflation down further may be slower going forward.\nThroughout this time, economic activity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer\nspending. We had also seen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, but recent\n1\n The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- 2 -\nstrong jobs reports—including upward revisions to employment growth—show a continued tight\nlabor market. Last year, the average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation\nrate rose through November, with the unemployment rate edging up to 3.7 percent. In recent\nmonths, however, job growth has rebounded, and the labor force participation rate declined,\nretracing some of its earlier gains.\nAt its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be\nappropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. As I’ve noted recently, my baseline\noutlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I\nstill see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. These include risks from\ngeopolitical developments, including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the\nextent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences.\nThere is also the risk that a loosening in financial conditions and additional fiscal stimulus could\nadd momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.\nFinally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core\nservices inflation. Recent labor market data suggest ongoing elevated wage growth as some\nbusinesses continue to report above-average wage increases to compensate for elevated prices\nand high inflation.\nGiven these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will\ncontinue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The\nfrequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as seen in the most recent\nemployment report, make the task of assessing the current state of the economy as well as\npredicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my\napproach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Should the incoming data\n- 3 -\ncontinue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will\neventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy\nfrom becoming overly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. Reducing our policy\nrate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2\npercent over the longer run.\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I\nwill make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications\nfor the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level\nthat will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds\nrate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or\nreversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable\nprices over the longer run.\nNotable Developments in Bank Regulation and Supervision\nAs I look at the bank regulatory agenda, I am struck by the sheer volume of matters that\nhave recently been completed, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline. These\nreforms touch on a wide range of topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. This\nwork shows no signs of slowing down. The large number of finalized, proposed, and potential\nchanges suggest insufficient prioritization in furthering the primary goal of prudential bank\nregulation and supervision—promoting a safe and sound banking system. In fulfilling this\nstatutory objective, we must also focus on efficiency and effectiveness and always consider how\nregulatory reforms affect the banking market, the economy, and those who use banking services.\nWe should also ensure, in our pursuit of reform, that our efforts result in a bank framework that\nis appropriately tailored and calibrated.\n- 4 -\nI have spoken at length over the past few months about some recent notable\ndevelopments in bank regulation, touching on capital reform, the Community Reinvestment Act,\nthe cap on debit card interchange fees, and climate-related financial risk guidance.2\n Today, I\nwant to recap my views on some of these developments, particularly around bank mergers and\nacquisitions (M&A), liquidity regulation, and trends in bank supervision.\nBank mergers and acquisitions\nBank mergers and acquisitions continue to be an important part of the banking\necosystem. In this process, timing is key. However, this is another policy area where I expect to\nsee ongoing focus from federal regulators, the Department of Justice, and others. As\npolicymakers engage on this topic, a key consideration should be whether the application process\nis fair, transparent, and consistent with the applicable statutory requirements.\n3 And yet, policy\nreforms may make bank M&A transactions more difficult for regulators to approve and slow the\napplication processing timeline.\nAs all bankers know, application processing delays can be quite harmful, resulting in\ngreater operational risk, increased expenses due in part to contract delays, reputational risk, and\nstaff attrition due to the prolonged uncertainty. In the broader context, reducing the efficiency of\nbank mergers and acquisitions may also act as a deterrent to a healthy evolution of the banking\nsystem. Taken together, reducing merger or acquisition activity could have the consequence of\nprohibiting transactions that may preserve the presence of banks in rural or underserved areas,\n2\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the Florida Bankers\nAssociation Leadership Luncheon Events, Miami, FL, February 27, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240227a.pdf.\n3\n See, e.g., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), “Business Combinations Under the Bank Merger Act:\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking,” OCC Bulletin 2024-4, January 29, 2024, https://occ.gov/newsissuances/bulletins/2024/bulletin-2024-4.html.\n- 5 -\ntransactions that may further prudent growth strategies, or transactions that may result in\nincreased competition with larger peers.\nRegulatory reforms in this area should prioritize speed and timeliness. Stakeholders who\nare concerned about current bank M&A procedures and policies should consider direct\nengagement with regulators.\n4\nLiquidity\nFollowing the bank failures last spring, significant attention has been paid to the alleged\n“lessons learned” creating a path for regulatory reform efforts. This has generated discussion\namong both policymakers and the public on how to think about liquidity regulation: Should\nthese requirements be expanded to a broader range of institutions? Should the calibration or\noperation of liquidity requirements like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding\nRatio be modified? Should we consider new liquidity requirements, and if so, what form should\nthey take?\nI have significant concerns about the path ahead as it comes to regulatory reforms\ninvolving liquidity requirements. All banks must manage their liquidity but should have\nflexibility based on a range of factors, including risk, business model, size, complexity, funding\nneeds, vulnerability to deposit runs, and other considerations. Liquidity requirements, if not\nappropriately designed and calibrated, could trap resources that would otherwise be put to better\n4\n One avenue by which interested parties can provide feedback is through the recently launched mandatory review\nof regulatory burdens under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. See Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and OCC, “Federal Bank\nRegulatory Agencies Seek Comment on Interagency Effort to Reduce Regulatory Burden,” joint news release,\nFebruary 6, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240206a.htm; and “Statement\nof Michelle W. Bowman on the Review of the Board’s Regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory\nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), February 6, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240206a1.htm.\n- 6 -\nuse, like lending to bank customers. Before moving forward, we need to identify gaps in the\ncurrent framework and build a foundation for any proposed changes that is based on research,\nevidence, and data.\nLiquidity regulation also has the potential to impose significant costs and limit the\nlending capacity and business operations of banks, which we must recognize and take into\naccount before imposing any new requirements.\nWe must think about liquidity broadly, including the sources and uses of liquidity that\ninstitutions use today, including the Federal Reserve’s discount window and its role as lender of\nlast resort, advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, and other sources that may be\navailable in the market. In this context, we must be honest about the capability and capacity of\nthese resources, and the challenges and limits of these tools.\nRevisions to the liquidity framework must also be coordinated to ensure that reform\nefforts are complementary and can support the banking system’s liquidity needs. When\nconsidering new liquidity requirements, we must think about not only calibration and scope, but\nalso the unintended consequences of any such requirements and whether these measures will be\neffective during stressed conditions.\nTrends in supervision\nDuring 2023 and into 2024, many banks reported very material shifts in bank\nexaminations and ongoing intensification in supervisory expectations. Many of these\nexamination-related shifts have received little public acknowledgement or attention in large part\nbecause the rules designed to protect confidential supervisory information frustrate visibility into\nstructural shifts in the supervisory process. As you all know well, changes in supervisory\nexpectations frequently come without the benefit of guidance, advance notice, or published\n- 7 -\nrulemaking, and in the worst-case scenario these shifts, cloaked by the veil of supervisory\nopacity, can have significant financial and reputational impacts or can disrupt the management\nand operations of affected banks.\nThese changes largely occurred after the bank failures in the spring of 2023 and the\nensuing banking stress. In part, the changes in supervisory practices may be attributable to\nflawed post-mortem reviews conducted in the immediate aftermath of these failures. Many of\nthese reviews suffered from serious shortcomings, including compressed timeframes for\ncompletion and the significantly limited matters that were within the scope of review.\nNevertheless, these reviews were, and continue to be, singularly relied upon as a basis for\nresetting regulatory and supervisory priorities. These trends in supervision are concerning and\nadd to the already significant burdens placed on regulated institutions from an aggressive\nregulatory reform agenda. I worry that the mere fact of bank failures and the material banking\nstress we experienced last year has been interpreted as a “blank check” to remake supervision as\na blunt instrument, one that ignores the unique characteristics of each firm and the benefits of an\napproach that prioritizes engagement and communication between banks and examiners.\nOf course, the banking agencies cannot regulate our way to better or more effective\nsupervision; in the aftermath of the banking stress, it is appropriate to look carefully at what is\nworking, and what isn’t, in the realm of bank supervision. But in doing so, we must\nappropriately manage our supervisory programs and teams to ensure that effective and consistent\nsupervision is implemented within each firm, and that it is effective and consistent across our\nregulated entities. Conducting supervision in a manner that respects due process and provides\ntransparency around supervisory expectations can help us accomplish these goals.\n- 8 -\nClosing Thoughts\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. We are experiencing\nsignificant changes in the banking industry, not least of which are those coming from the\nregulators. It is imperative that you continue engaging on all matters involving regulatory\nreform. Policymakers cannot fulfill the responsibility of promoting a safe and sound banking\nsystem if we ignore efficiency, tailoring, and appropriate calibration of requirements in the\nreform agenda. These tenets should be central to the reform process. I welcome your insight on\nwhat is working, what is not, and the real-world consequences of regulations and regulatory\nreform efforts. Your input helps us ensure that the bank regulatory framework supports safety\nand soundness in an efficient and fair way.\nThank you for your continued engagement, and I look forward to our conversation."

    "text": "Thank you for the invitation to join you here in Phoenix at the ABA’s Conference for\nCommunity Bankers.1\n For the past seven years, this conference provided an excellent forum for\nme and bankers to meet and interact with a range of state and federal regulators, policymakers,\nservice providers, and other stakeholders. Today I would like to share a brief update on my\nviews on monetary policy and the economy, before I turn to bank regulatory issues, and describe\nhow I think that regulators should approach the important work of “maintenance” of the\nregulatory framework.\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nToward the end of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began the\nprocess of moving the target range for the federal funds rate to a more neutral setting to reflect\nthe progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the labor market. At our\nSeptember meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range, for the first time since we began\ntightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 50 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent.\nYou may remember that I dissented from that decision, the first time a Fed Governor\ndissented from an FOMC rate decision in nearly 20 years. I preferred a smaller initial cut to\nbegin the policy recalibration phase. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the\nmeeting noting that the strong economy and a healthy labor market did not warrant a larger cut.\nIn addition, moving the policy rate down too quickly could unnecessarily risk stoking demand,\npotentially reigniting inflationary pressures, and could be interpreted as a premature “declaration\nof victory” on our price-stability mandate.\n1\n The views expressed in these remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n- 2 -\nAt the most recent FOMC meeting last month, my colleagues and I voted to hold the\nfederal funds rate target range at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal\nReserve's securities holdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the policy rate\nby 100 basis points through the December meeting, I think that policy is now in a good place,\nallowing the Committee to be patient and pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves.\nIn my view, the current policy stance also provides the opportunity to review further\nindicators of economic activity and get further clarity on the administration's policies and their\neffects on the economy. It will be very important to have a better sense of these policies, how\nthey will be implemented, and establish greater confidence about how the economy will respond\nin the coming weeks and months.\nFor now, the U.S. economy remains strong, with solid growth in economic activity and a\nlabor market near full employment. Core inflation is still somewhat elevated, but has appeared\nto resume its downward path, and my baseline expectation has been that it will moderate further\nthis year. Even with this outlook, there are upside risks to my baseline expectation for the\ninflation path.\nIn 2023, the rate of inflation declined significantly, but it has taken longer to see further\nmeaningful declines since that time. The latest consumer and producer price index reports\nsuggest that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation—which\nexcludes food and energy prices—likely moved down to around 2.6 percent in January, which\nwould represent a noticeable stepdown from its 2.8 percent reading in December and 3.0 percent\nat the end of 2023. Progress had been especially slow and uneven since the spring of last year\nmostly due to rising core goods price inflation.\n- 3 -\nAfter increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the first nine months of last year, gross\ndomestic product appears to have risen a bit more moderately in the fourth quarter, reflecting a\nlarge drop in the volatile category of inventory investment. In contrast, private domestic final\npurchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity,\nmaintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly\nagain in the fourth quarter. Following strong readings in December, retail sales and sales of\nmotor vehicles softened in January. However, these data can be noisy around this time of the\nyear and sales were likely affected by the cold and wintery weather last month.\nPayroll employment gains have picked up since the summer of last year and averaged a\nstrong pace of about 240,000 per month over the past three months, with last month’s gains\nlikely held back by the Los Angeles wildfires and the harsh winter weather. The unemployment\nrate edged down further to 4.0 percent in January and has moved sideways since the middle of\nlast year, remaining below my estimate of full employment.\nThe labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after it\nloosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023\nlargely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking\nlonger to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed\nworkers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more\navailable jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight,\nbut wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.\nThe recent revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data further vindicates my\nview that the labor market was not weakening in a concerning way during the summer of last\nyear. Although payroll employment gains were revised down considerably in the 12 months\n- 4 -\nthrough March 2024, job gains were little revised, on net, over the remainder of last year. It is\ncrucial that U.S. official data more accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real\ntime, so we can confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. But in\nthe meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data\nrevisions in recent years, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of realtime data releases.\nAssuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this\nyear. As the inflation data since the spring of last year show, its progress may be bumpy and\nuneven, and progress on disinflation may take longer than we would hope. I continue to see\ngreater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains strong.\nWith encouraging signs that geopolitical tensions may be abating in the Middle East,\nEastern Europe, and in Asia, I will be monitoring global supply chains which could continue to\nbe susceptible to disruptions, and lead to inflationary effects on food, energy, and other\ncommodity markets. In addition, the release of pent-up demand following the election could\nlead to stronger economic activity, which could also influence inflationary pressures.\nHaving entered a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a\nmore neutral policy stance, there are a few considerations that lead me to prefer a cautious and\ngradual approach to adjusting policy, as it provides us time to assess progress in achieving our\ninflation and employment goals.\nGiven the current policy stance, I think that easier financial conditions from higher equity\nprices over the past year may have slowed progress on disinflation. And I am watching the\nincrease in longer-term Treasury yields that has occurred since the start of policy recalibration at\nthe September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a reflection of investors' concerns about\n- 5 -\ninflation risks and the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be required to address\ninflationary pressures.\nThere is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal.\nI would like to gain greater confidence that progress in lowering inflation will continue as we\nconsider making further adjustments to the target range. We need to keep inflation in focus\nwhile the labor market appears to be in balance and the unemployment rate remains at\nhistorically low levels. Before our March meeting, we will have received one additional month\nof inflation and employment data.\nLooking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course.\nAt each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming\ndata and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals\nof maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of\ncontacts to help me interpret the signals provided by real-time data and as I assess the\nappropriateness of our monetary policy stance.\nBringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy\nlabor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.\nMaintenance of the Regulatory Framework\nI will now turn to bank supervision, the bank applications process, and regulation.\nCommunity banks experience the burden of the regulatory framework most acutely when it is not\nappropriately tailored to their size, risk, complexity, and business model. While promoting\nsafety and soundness in the banking system—particularly among community banks—is an\nimportant and necessary regulatory objective, we must also be cautious to ensure that the\n- 6 -\nframework does not become an impediment to their operations, preventing them from providing\ncompetitive products and services, innovating, and engaging in appropriate risk-taking.\nDuring my tenure at the Board, I have laid out a wide range of issues and concerns that I\nsee as critical components that are necessary to build and maintain an effective regulatory\nframework.2\n While I will only address a subset of these issues today, I’d like to begin by\nclarifying what I mean by this.\nOur work to maintain an effective framework is never really complete. Just as\ncomplacency can be fatal to the business of a bank, complacency can also prevent regulators\nfrom meeting their statutory obligation to promote a safe and sound banking system that enables\nbanks to serve their customers effectively and efficiently.\n2\n See, e.g., Michelle W.

In our everyday\nlives, we invest significant time in maintenance. We schedule regular oil changes for our cars,\nand we invest in the infrastructure that allows our economy to function. Devoting resources to\nmaintenance often prevents more costly issues down the road—it’s easier to get oil changes than\nit is to rebuild an engine.\nSo, what does maintenance look like in practice? To address this question, I think it’s\nhelpful to look at three core areas in the bank regulatory framework: Supervision, Bank\napplications, and Regulation.\nApproach to Supervision\nLet’s start with supervision. Supervision operates almost entirely outside of the public\nview. Much of the work involves the review of proprietary business information from banks,\nand the preparation of examination reports shielded from public scrutiny under the auspices of\nprotecting confidential supervisory information. But confidentiality should not be used to\nprevent scrutiny and accountability in the assignment of ratings.\nSo, today, I am going to dig a bit deeper into the realm of supervision to discuss\nsupervisory ratings, accountability, and the troubling trend of inaction and opacity within the\nsupervisory toolkit.\nRational Standards & Ratings\nWhile there is some public disclosure of supervisory information, it is often difficult to\nget a true understanding of supervision based on data that may be released. In fact, this data\noften sends confusing and conflicting signals. For example, the Board’s Supervision and\nRegulation Report presented information stating that only one-third of large financial institutions\n- 8 -\nmaintained satisfactory ratings across all relevant ratings components in the first half of 2024.3\n\nAt the same time, this report noted that most large financial institutions met supervisory\nexpectations with respect to capital and liquidity.4\n\nThe odd mismatch between financial condition and overall supervisory condition as\nassessed by the prudential regulators raises a more significant issue, whether subjective examiner\njudgment—those evaluations based on subjective, examiner-driven, non-financial concerns—is\ndriving the firm’s overall rating. Are ratings trends based on the materiality of the identified\nissues, or do they imply that the regulators see widespread fragility in the banking system?\nWhile this example highlights a large bank ratings framework issue, it is symptomatic of\na broader issue that warrants scrutiny—whether the approach to supervision has led to a world in\nwhich core financial risks have been de-prioritized, and non-core and non-financial risks—things\nlike IT, operational risk, management, risk management, internal controls, and governance—\nhave been over-emphasized. These issues are important, and certainly worthwhile topics for\nexaminers to consider, but their review should not come at the expense of more material\nfinancial risk considerations—and they should not drive the overall assessment of a firm’s\ncondition. There is evidence that supervision has undergone such a shift, not only among large\nbanks, but among regional and community banks as well.\n5\n For all institutions, financial metrics\nare not among the primary findings determined from the examination process, and arguably they\nhave been de-emphasized when assigning supervisory ratings.\n3\n See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report at 16-17\n(Washington: Board of Governors, November 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202411-\nsupervision-and-regulation-report.pdf (describing data for the first half of 2024, the most recent period for which\ndata is available).\n4\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report.\n5\n Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report at 17, 20.\n- 9 -\nPrioritization is valuable in the supervisory process, both to inform how examiners\nallocate their time, but also in helping banks allocate resources to remediate issues identified\nduring the supervisory process. The frequency of supervisory findings related to non-financial\nmetrics may be a byproduct of how long it takes to remediate these issues, like longstanding\nissues with IT systems that have not been enhanced over many years of growth. However, we\nshould also be vigilant and deliberate about any shift in supervisory focus from financial risk\ntoward non-financial risks and internal processes, as this shift is not focused on fundamental\nsafety and soundness issues and it is not cost-free.\nWe should also not expect every firm to coalesce around a single set of products, internal\nprocesses, and risk-management practices. Variety in banking models is a strength and a\nnecessity of the U.S. banking system, relying on management and boards of directors to\ndetermine bank strategy, rather than a bank’s business model effectively being set by supervisory\ndirectives.\nSupervisory practices like horizontal reviews can create examiner incentives to expect\nuniformity and “grade on a curve,” but this approach perversely punishes variation among bank\npractices, stifling competition and innovation. Supervisory findings also inform bank ratings,\nwhich can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions (M&A);\nraising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more important bank\nmanagement priorities.\nDiagnostic Accountability\nTo maintain strong and appropriate supervisory standards and practices, we need to take a\nstep back and diagnose the bank regulatory system in its entirety: what is working, what is\nbroken, and what needs to be updated. When things go wrong, having an impartial check on\n- 10 -\nsubjective judgments can lead to a better diagnosis. Of course, a better diagnosis can produce\nmore efficient and targeted improvements, and better promote accountability. Accountability is\ncritical to maintaining an effective regulatory system, and yet it can be difficult to establish a\nregulatory culture that includes mechanisms to promote accountability for supervisors and\nregulators.\n6\n\nAt every organizational level, from examiners to agency leadership, judgments are made\nthat contribute to the overall effectiveness of the supervisory process. Reserve Bank examiners\nplay a critical role in examining Fed-regulated institutions, both banks and holding companies.\nThe Federal Reserve exercises its supervisory responsibilities by supervisory portfolio, with each\nportfolio relying on a combination of Board and Reserve Bank staff.7\n But this split allocation of\nresponsibility should not diminish the accountability for supervisory decision making.\nResponsibility for supervisory decisions must be coupled with accountability for these decisions.\nThe misalignment of responsibility and accountability limits our ability to conduct effective\nsupervision.\nThis division of responsibility can pose a challenge to accountability. In the aftermath of\nthe bank failures in 2023 and the broader stress to the banking system, the Board and other\nagencies proposed a variety of regulatory reform measures to remediate and address identified\nissues, based on internal reviews of the failures and banking stress. While I applaud efforts to\nhold ourselves accountable, we must ensure that self-reviews are credible, both in the causes they\nidentify and in the reform agenda that they are used to support. An internal review process poses\n6\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “Accountability for Banks, Accountability for Regulators” (Essay published in\nStarling Insights, February 13, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/bowman-starling-insights-20240213.pdf.\n7\n “Understanding Federal Reserve Supervision,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, last modified\nApril 27, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/approaches-to-bank-supervision.htm.\n- 11 -\nthe temptation to avoid responsibility by assigning blame elsewhere, even when the review may\nbe motivated by good intentions and with the outward appearance of impartiality.\nMany of the core problems in the lead-up to the bank failures involved well-known, core\nbanking risks—interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and poor risk management. But if we look at the\nsubsequent reform agenda, we see that the policy emphasis has been on broader regulatory\nchanges rather than addressing supervisory program deficiencies. In my mind, this highlights the\nneed to have a process that challenges the subjective judgments of those that were involved in\noversight, not only in performing the diagnostics, but evaluating how identified issues can best\nbe remediated.\nPurging Inaction and Opacity from the Supervisory Toolkit\nSupervision differs significantly from the regulatory process. Implementing new\nregulations, or amending existing ones, requires a public notice and comment process established\nby the Administrative Procedure Act. When done appropriately, regulations require regulators to\n“show their work” by providing extensive analytical and factual support for proposals and final\nrules and soliciting comment from the public and addressing those comments before finalizing a\nregulation. In contrast, the execution of bank examinations and the issuance of supervisory\nguidance lack these procedural safeguards, instead relying heavily on discretion and judgment\nwith far lower standards for justifying actions taken with factual and analytical support under the\nveil of confidential supervisory information. The greater flexibility afforded in the supervisory\nprocess can lead to poor outcomes, often caused by the temptation to use inaction and opacity as\nsupervisory tools. In my view, these tools, inaction and opacity, are not appropriate and must be\nsubject to appropriate scrutiny or purged from the toolkit altogether.\n- 12 -\nFirst let’s consider inaction. The exam process requires open communication between\nexaminers and banks. Often interpretive questions arise during the exam process; how do\nexisting rules and statutes apply in a particular circumstance? These questions arise when\nexisting rules and guidance are unclear, which is a frequent occurrence. For example, how can a\nbank operate in a safe and sound manner while offering a new product or service, or when\nserving customers in particular business lines with unique needs? Banks go to great effort to\nmeet all applicable requirements and regulatory expectations, and regulators should welcome\nbanks seeking supervisory input and relying on a compliance-focused mindset.\nOpen communication with regulated banks is a hallmark of good supervision, but\nregulators must live up to their end of the bargain by not leaving banks in “limbo” for extended\nperiods of time. When a bank requests feedback and engages in good faith to provide\ninformation and respond to reasonable questions, regulators have an obligation to provide a clear\nresponse. Banks should not be left to wonder whether an interpretation of existing laws,\nregulations, and guidance is consistent with the understanding of regulators.\nNext, let’s consider opacity. Questions raised in the supervisory channel often result\nfrom supervisory expectations that lack sufficient clarity or the application of rules and\nregulations to new and emerging products and services. While regulators should not form an\nopinion without understanding the relevant facts and circumstances, they must also strive to\nprovide clarity—not just to the bank being examined, but to all banks. Supervisory expectations\nshould not surprise regulated firms, and yet transparency around expectations is often\nchallenging to achieve.8\n\n8\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “Approaching Policymaking Pragmatically” (speech at the Forum Club of the Palm\nBeaches, West Palm Beach, Florida, November 20, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20241120a.pdf.\n- 13 -\nThe problem of opacity in supervisory expectations is exacerbated by the umbrella of\nconfidential supervisory information, or CSI, which is the label given to most materials\ndeveloped in the examination process. The rules designed to protect CSI limit the public’s\nvisibility into shifting priorities and expectations in the supervisory process.9 Changes in\nsupervisory expectations frequently come without the benefit of guidance, advance notice, or\npublished rulemaking. In the worst-case scenario these shifts, cloaked by the veil of supervisory\nopacity, can have significant financial and reputational impacts or can disrupt the management\nand operations of affected banks.\nOpacity in supervisory expectations, or in the interpretation of applicable laws and\nregulations, should not be discovered only at the conclusion of an examination with the issuance\nof deficiencies, matters requiring attention, matters requiring immediate attention, or other\nshortcomings.\nApproach to Applications\nSunshine is the best disinfectant when it comes to an approach that fosters transparency\nand accountability. So, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing how we can better shine a\nlight into the dark corners of the bank applications process.\nDe Novo Formation\nDe novo formation has essentially stagnated over the past several years. While many\nfactors have contributed to the decline in the aggregate number of banks in the United States, one\nkey factor has been the lack of new bank formation to replace banks that have been acquired or\nclosed their doors. This lack of de novo bank approvals does not necessarily indicate a lack of\n9\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “Reflections on the Economy and Bank Regulation” (speech at the New Jersey\nBankers Association Annual Economic Leadership Forum, Somerset, New Jersey, March 7, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20240307a.pdf.\n- 14 -\ndemand for new charters though, particularly in light of ongoing demand for bank “charter strip”\nacquisitions where banks have been acquired just for their charters, the growing demand for\nbanking-as-a-service partnerships, and the shift of activities outside of the banking sector into the\nnon-bank financial system.\n10\n We should consider whether the applications process itself has\nbecome an unnecessary impediment to de novo formation.\nHow can we improve the process of de novo formation? As fewer applications come in,\ninstitutional muscle memory for how to deal with new bank charters erodes, and it becomes\ndifficult to navigate and ultimately to overcome institutional inertia. A few steps like developing\nspecialized expertise, streamlining the application process, and improving transparency can yield\nsignificant improvements.\nFirst, de novo formations are very different from other bank applications where there are\nexisting institutions with established supervisory ratings and examination records. A de novo\nformation has no supervisory record of performance on which to base a decision or inform\njudgments about whether an application is consistent with approval. Instead, regulators must\nevaluate the proposal based on applicable statutory requirements: Is the business plan sound? Is\nappropriate bank leadership in place? Does the bank have a viable business plan and strategy?\nIs the bank’s proposal supported by sufficient capital? Should there be an expectation that all of\nthese questions are answered exhaustively often well over a year before the bank would be\nformed, if it is approved?\nIn recent years de novo formations have been rare, and therefore staff tasked with\nevaluating these proposals do not have a recent perspective or deep well of experience from\n10\n See Michelle W. Bowman, “The Consequences of Fewer Banks in the U.S. Banking System” (speech at the\nWharton Financial Regulation Conference, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, April 14, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bowman20230414a.pdf.\n- 15 -\nwhich to draw. Under our current approach, regional Reserve Banks are the primary point of\ncontact for de novo applicants. We should consider creating a specialized resource that can be\nutilized by any reserve bank to assist them during the pre-filing conversations with de novo\napplicants. Our goal should be to facilitate new bank creation—identifying and finding\nachievable pathways to yes, instead of expecting and insisting on increasing requirements to\nunachievable levels or those that are intended to deter applicants from filing or moving forward.\nWe should also consider whether there are ways to streamline the application process,\nincluding, if needed, by recommending statutory changes. While the agencies use some common\nforms, de novo formations currently involve a range of regulatory approvals. A de novo\napplicant must apply for a bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a\nstate banking authority, deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\npotentially membership or a parallel holding company formation application with the Federal\nReserve.\nEach regulator may be focused on different aspects of the application, and each has the\nright to ask for additional information as part of the application review and analysis potentially\nsignificantly extending the review timeframe. We should have clear standards of review and\napproval—and coordinated actions—among the state and federal regulators involved in any\napplication. This should include clear timelines for the point at which a regulator forfeits their\nopportunity to object due to inaction, delay, or stalling tactics.\nBut standards for de novo approval are not always clear to applicants, which can lead to\nlengthy back-and-forth discussions with banking agency staff even after an applicant has\nprepared the information required by the appropriate application forms. The need for extensive\nadditional information from de novo applicants can be caused by a failure to provide information\n- 16 -\nrequested in the application form, but I suspect the submission of incomplete information is often\na product of forms that do not include all necessary information.\nWe should not need to constantly supplement application forms with ad hoc information\nrequests. If additional information is needed, we should modify the required application forms.\nOne area where the lack of transparent and clear standards is most evident is with the amount of\ncapital required to establish a de novo bank. Discussions around required capital often hinge on\nsubjective assessments based on planned business model and growth, but they rarely involve\nregulators providing a minimum required capital amount. Standards for approval should not be\nshrouded in mystery.\nReform of the de novo applications process should not be thought of as a deregulatory\nexercise. Clear and transparent standards do not imply “low” or inadequate standards. At the\nsame time, if we want to encourage a pipeline of de novo bank formations, we should also be\ncomfortable with the uncertainty that accompanies any new business, including the risk that\nsome de novo banks will not succeed.\nThe cost of eliminating the failure of de novo banks—or really of any banks at any\ntime—is simply too great. Banking is fundamentally about appropriately managed risks, and\nregulators play a key role in promoting a system that is safe and sound while also serving to\nsupport the banking needs of customers and broader economic growth. Our goal should not be\nto create a banking system that is safe, sound, and ultimately irrelevant.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nThe issues with the banking applications process extend beyond de novo formations, but\ninvolve some of the same concerns, whether there are clear standards, and we are able to act in a\ntimely manner. As a threshold matter, if regulators are clear about the information they need to\n- 17 -\nprocess an application—for example, by updating applications forms to include the full set of\ninformation needed to analyze each statutory approval requirement—then we should also hold\nourselves to fixed approval timelines. In my view, the purgatory of a long application process is\nanother form of regulatory “inaction” that must be eliminated.\nWe should also address aspects of the applications process that contribute to delay,\nincluding both the approach to competition and the public comment process.\nThe banking agencies have long relied on competitive “screens” to evaluate the pro\nforma effect of a merger. This process looks at the standalone institutions, imagines a merger in\nwhich their operations are combined, and then looks at how measures of competition will change\nin the areas served by the merged institutions. Where there is overlap in markets served, there is\nthe potential for tripping competitive screens and triggering additional scrutiny. At the Federal\nReserve, when a competitive screen is triggered the application process takes more time, as staff\nreviews the conflict, and the matter is removed from the Reserve Bank-delegated processing\ntrack.\nPerversely, many banks that trigger additional scrutiny operate in rural markets and have\nless aggregate banking business over which institutions can compete. In these concentrated\nmarkets, the analytical approach may involve a counterfactual in which only two future states of\nthe world exist—the banks continue to operate on a standalone basis, or the banks merge and\noperate as a consolidated whole. However, this framing ignores a possible third option, that one\nor both of the institutions will cease being viable and shut its doors, or be acquired by a credit\nunion, similarly leading to an erosion of market competition and potentially greater disruption to\nthe communities served. This analytical approach to evaluating competition no longer remains\nappropriate, and it needs to be reformed to better reflect actual market realities. This must\n- 18 -\ninclude competition from credit unions, the farm credit system, internet banks, financial\ntechnology firms and other non-banks.\nFinally, many M&A applications come to the Board due to the receipt of an adverse\ncomment from the public about the past supervisory record of one or both of the institutions\ninvolved in a merger. The receipt of an adverse comment causes substantial delays in the\nprocessing of an application, as this too removes an application from the “delegated” processing\nby the local Federal Reserve Bank, escalating the matter to the Board of Governors in D.C.\nWhile it is important that regulators take into account public feedback—and indeed, is required\nby applicable law—we should also be concerned about comments that may lack factual support\nor may solely rely on matters always considered in the review of a proposal, like the existing\nsupervisory records of the acquirer and the target institution, and may be negated by the\nregulator’s own examination report.\nApproach to Regulation – Cleanup and the Statutory Regulatory Review\nSince the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act nearly 15 years ago, the body of regulations that\nall banks are subject to has increased dramatically. Many of the reforms made after the 2008\nfinancial crisis were important and essential to ensuring a stronger and more resilient banking\nsystem. Yet, a number of the changes are backward looking—responding only to that mortgage\ncrisis—not fully considering the potential future unintended consequences or future states of the\nworld.\nWith well over a decade of change in the banking system now behind us postimplementation, it is time to evaluate whether all these changes continue to be relevant. Some of\nthe regulations put in place immediately after that financial crisis resulted in pushing\nfoundational banking activities out of the banking system into less regulated corners of the\n- 19 -\nfinancial system. We need to ask whether this is appropriate. These tradeoffs are complicated,\nand we must consider not only the changes that were made but also the evolution of and\ndifferences in the banking system today.\nDriving all risk out of the banking system is at odds with the fundamental nature of the\nbusiness of banking. Banks, after all, are businesses. And they must be able to earn a profit and\ngrow while also managing their risks. Adding requirements that impose more costs must be\nbalanced with whether the new requirements make the correct tradeoffs between safety and\nsoundness and enabling banks to serve their customers and run their businesses. The task of\npolicymakers and regulators is not to eliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure\nthat risk is appropriately and effectively managed.\nIn a well-functioning and appropriately regulated banking system, banks serve an\nindispensable role in credit provision and economic stability. The goal is to create and maintain\na system that supports safe and sound banking practices, and results in the implementation of\nappropriate risk management. No efficient banking system can eliminate all bank failures. But\nwell-designed and well-maintained systems can limit bank failures and mitigate the harm caused\nby any that occur.\nMaintenance of the regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that our regulations\ncontinue to strike the right balance between encouraging growth and innovation, and safety and\nsoundness. One easily identifiable way to achieve this is using the Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process, which the agencies initiated in\nFebruary last year.\nAlthough to-date it has not done so, the EGRPRA review requires the federal banking\nagencies to identify any outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome regulations and eliminate\n- 20 -\nunnecessary regulations and take other steps to address the regulatory burdens associated with\noutdated or overly burdensome regulations. As I noted, prior iterations of the EGRPRA process\nhave been underwhelming in their ability to result in meaningful change, but it is my expectation\nthat this review, and eventually the accompanying report to Congress, will provide a meaningful\nprocess for stakeholders and the public to engage with the banking agencies in identifying\nregulations that are no longer necessary or are overly burdensome. It is also my expectation that\nregulators will be responsive to concerns raised by the public.\nAnother area that is ripe for review are several of the Board’s rules that address core\nbanking issues—from loans to insiders, to transactions with affiliates, to state member bank\nactivities, and holding company requirements. Many of the Board’s regulations have not been\ncomprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given the dynamic nature of the\nbanking system and how the economy and banking and financial services industries have\nevolved over that period, it is imperative that we update and simplify many of the Board’s\nregulations, including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks.\nFinally, I want to address the unintended consequences of anti-money laundering\nrequirements in the provision of banking services. I think we can agree that fighting money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities is not only a statutory responsibility of\nthe banking system but it also serves important public policy goals. But while the regulatory\nframework prescribing how banks fulfill this role is not within the Federal Reserve’s\nresponsibilities, it is important to consider how these requirements affect the ability of banks to\nserve customers. For example, the threshold for currency transaction reports (CTR) was\nestablished more than 50 years ago and has not been updated or indexed to inflation during that\n- 21 -\ntime. Just as an example, at the time it was implemented, a fully loaded Cadillac cost less than\nthe CTR threshold. We’ve come a long way since 1972.\nIt has also created a regime of more extensive and invasive reporting of customers’\ntransactions that may pose little actual risks related to tracking illicit activities. This reporting\nregime is also not cost-free, as banks may opt to avoid banking customers that trigger high\nvolumes of CTR reporting, or that otherwise trigger the filing of suspicious activity reports. The\ncalibration of reporting requirements, their effect on bank customers, and the growing problem\nof customer “de-banking,” warrant greater public attention.\nThe Federal Reserve should review the supervisory messages given to banks and their\nholding companies about how supervisors will evaluate and consider the bank’s risks associated\nwith customers that are caught in the Bank Secrecy Act or Anti-Money Laundering reporting\nweb. I am concerned that this framework is being used to downgrade a bank’s condition based\non a disproportionate weighting of its compliance with these requirements in comparison to its\noverall condition. There are separate examinations conducted for this purpose, and they should\nbe viewed separately, not as a cudgel for downgrading a bank’s condition through the\ngovernance and controls mechanism or management assessment.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe banking system can be an engine of economic growth and opportunity, particularly\nwhen it is supported by a bank regulatory framework that is rational and well-maintained. The\nwork of rationalizing and maintaining this system is an ongoing cycle. While my remarks today\nhave touched on a wide range of issues that require rationalization and “maintenance,” this is by\nno means an exhaustive list.\n- 22 -\nMaintaining an effective framework is not only about ensuring the existing plumbing\ncontinues to work (and making it more efficient where possible) but it also must include\npromoting a system that is responsive to emerging threats and the needs of the banking system.\nAs an example, the significant increase in fraud over the past few years has not generated the\nstrong regulatory and governmental response necessary, even though fraud can become a source\nof material financial risk, particularly to smaller institutions.\nThank you again for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today. As always, it\nis a pleasure to be with you!"

    "text": "Mandate for Maximum Employment\nGood afternoon and welcome to the third day of the Federal Reserve’s Uneven Outcomes\nin the Labor Market Conference.1\n It is a pleasure to join so many researchers, policymakers, and\npractitioners interested in understanding the labor market and its implications for the overall\neconomy and the financial well-being of workers.\nAt the Federal Reserve, the labor market is often top of mind. As many of you are aware,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a mandate to effectively promote maximum\nemployment and price stability. My FOMC colleagues and I strive to find the balance between\nthese objectives, and when considering how best to promote a healthy economy, it is important\nthat the Fed supports a labor market that works for both employees and employers.\nToday, I’d like to highlight the role of small businesses and entrepreneurship in the U.S.\nlabor market and, in turn, the importance of access to capital in creating and maintaining jobs in\nthose businesses. I’m sure many of us know business owners who put their own personal\nsavings—even their homes—at risk to start or to grow their businesses. I will discuss why\nexternal sources of capital and financial institutions that provide access to capital are vital for\nboth successful small businesses and a robust labor market.\nThere are many pathways for workers to find employment. For some, entrepreneurship\noffers the opportunity to fulfill a personal goal to create a new business or to have more control\nover their careers. While not all start-ups are successful, many grow into stable businesses that\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n- 2 -\nemploy additional workers. In fact, small businesses currently employ nearly half of America’s\nprivate sector workers and have accounted for over 60 percent of net new jobs since 1995.2\n\nThroughout my experience as a banker, bank commissioner, and Federal Reserve\nGovernor, I have been inspired by the success stories shared by entrepreneurs from across the\ncountry. At the same time, I’ve also heard about many of the difficulties they face, particularly\nin hiring and retaining employees, and sourcing capital for business operations. For example, a\nbakery owner in Texas recently shared the challenges her business has faced in hiring and\nretaining workers. Another small business owner in Maryland shared the difficulties he has\nfaced in accessing capital to open new restaurant locations. While these are just two examples\nthat I have heard personally, I know that it can be very difficult for many small businesses to find\nqualified workers and access the capital they need to grow.\nAs policymakers consider making changes to existing rules and expectations that may\nimpact a business’s access to funding sources, we need to identify and understand any potential\nunintended consequences of these new policies, especially if those policies may affect the ability\nof small businesses and entrepreneurs to access capital.\nRecent Trends in Small Business\nWhile many of these challenges are typical hurdles for entrepreneurs and start-ups, the\npandemic created new complications for businesses, small and large. Firms owned by women\nand minorities were particularly vulnerable due to many being newer businesses, more fragile\n2 “Frequently Asked Questions,” U.S. Small Business Administration, March 2023, https://advocacy.sba.gov/wpcontent/uploads/2023/03/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Small-Business-March-2023-508c.pdf.\n- 3 -\nfinancially, and more likely to be part of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, including food\nservices, personal services, and retail.3\n\nYet, while many small businesses shut their doors due to the effects of the pandemic, in\n2020, the United States saw a boom in business creation, which began shortly after the initial\nlockdown period. This increase has continued long after the labor market recovery. In fact, the\nCensus Bureau’s November 2023 analysis of business applications shows that business\nformation since 2021 has remained 32 percent higher than in the previous ten years.4\n Many of\nthese new businesses were started by minority business owners.5\n Increased rates of workers\nvoluntarily quitting their jobs and high levels of unemployment during the pandemic appear to\nhave encouraged some workers to become self-employed or become entrepreneurs.\nThis growth in start-up businesses could help to address the challenge of closing\nemployment gaps for workers who typically face the greatest headwinds in the labor market. For\nexample, start-ups are more likely to hire new workers and workers with lower levels of\neducational attainment.6\n New businesses have also been responsible for a surprising amount of\njob growth, with an average of nearly one million jobs created each quarter from early 2021\nthrough the beginning of 2023, which is a significantly higher pace than was typical prior to the\npandemic.7\n3 August Benzow and Nora Esposito, “Minority- and Women-Owned Businesses Tend to be Younger, Making them\nMore Vulnerable in the Coming Recession,” Economic Innovation Group, August 2020, https://eig.org/minorityand-women-owned-businesses-vulnerable-recession. 4 U.S. Census Bureau data accessed in Federal Reserve Economic Data. 5 Current Population Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n6 “2023 Report on Employer Firms: Findings from the 2022 Small Business Credit Survey,” Small Business Credit\nSurvey, Federal Reserve Banks, March 8, 2023, https://doi.org/10.55350/sbcs-20230308. 7 Bureau of Labor Statistics data on jobs created by new establishments averaged 976,000 per quarter from 2020:Q3\nto 2023:Q1, compared with 810,000 per quarter from 2009 to 2019.\n- 4 -\nFed Support for Access to Capital for Small Businesses\nOf course, in order to create jobs, small businesses need access to sufficient amounts of\naffordable credit and capital to form, grow, and succeed. Otherwise, they may underperform, not\nreaching their growth potential either in revenue or employment. The share of small businesses\nreporting that they rely on personal sources for capital increased from about half in 2019 to twothirds in 2022, according to the Fed’s Small Business Credit Survey (or SBCS) from that year.8\nThis suggests a high degree of personal risk for owners and their workers. Moreover, personal\nfinancial resources are often limited, which can constrain growth. Ideally, small businesses\nshould be able to access external funding, which can be a key to their growth and stability.\nMost businesses that seek external financing turn to banks—community banks and larger\ninstitutions. Community banks remain an essential resource for many small businesses to access\ncapital to support their businesses. These banks are focused on relationship banking, which\nuniquely positions them to meet the challenge of assessing the creditworthiness of local, small\nbusinesses. Community banks make greater investments in small business lending relative to\nlarger banks.9\n Furthermore, according to the 2022 Small Business Credit Survey, small\nbusinesses were more likely to be satisfied with their experiences dealing with small bank\nlenders than with large bank lenders or finance companies.10\nI’d like to take a moment to share some of the ways the Fed supports small businesses\nthrough community banks. First, the Fed engages community banks through its Community\n8 From the 2023 SBCS Report on Employer Firms, 56 percent of small businesses relied on personal sources for\ncapital in the 2019 SBCS compared to 66 percent in the 2022 SBSC. 9 A Fed analysis of June 2023 call report data shows that community banks have larger shares of small-business\nloans relative to their total assets than larger institutions. See Eldar Beiseitov, “Small Banks, Big Impact:\nCommunity Banks and Their Role in Small Business Lending,” October 20, 2023,\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/2023/oct/small-banks-big-impact-community-bankssmall-business-lending. 10 2023 SBCS Report on Employer Firms.\n- 5 -\nDepository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC), which advises the Board on matters of\npublic policy. CDIAC members include community bankers who provide insight and\ninformation about the economy, lending conditions, and other issues that they see firsthand in\ntheir communities. Second, the Federal Reserve supervises and regulates smaller banks based on\na variety of factors specific to their size, condition, risk profile, and business model to assess\ntheir safety and soundness. One of the Federal Reserve’s unique strengths is the localized nature\nof our supervision, which relies on regional Reserve Banks that understand their local markets\nand community needs.\nMany community banks also have a mission to serve historically underserved\npopulations. These include Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Women-Owned\nDepository Institutions (WDIs), and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs).\nThese banks are vital sources of capital to many underrepresented small businesses. For\nexample, the Philadelphia Fed found that community banks, including these unique banks, are\ntraditionally more successful than larger institutions at small business lending in times of crisis.\nThis finding was well supported by volume of lending conducted by these banks through the\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP) during the COVID-19 pandemic.11\nThe PPP provided loans to small businesses to keep their workers employed. The\nprogram was implemented in large part through community banks, including MDIs, WDIs and\nCDFIs. The Fed supported the PPP by providing liquidity through its emergency lending\n11 Allen N. Berger, Maryann P. Feldman, W. Scott Langford, and Raluca A. Roman, “‘Let Us Put Our Moneys\nTogether’: Minority-Owned Banks and Resilience to Crises” (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, June 2023),\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2023/wp23-13.pdf.\n- 6 -\nprogram, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.12 Notably, MDIs originated more\nthan 20,000 PPP loans to support small businesses during that time.13\nThe Federal Reserve has also supported CDFIs and MDIs through their work with the\nU.S. Treasury Department on the implementation of the Emergency Capital Investment Program\n(ECIP). This COVID-relief program provided $9 billion in capital directly to CDFIs and MDIs.\nThese funds were to be used for loans, grants, and forbearance to small and minority-owned\nbusinesses, especially in low-income and underserved communities.14\nI’d like to close with a brief note on the CDFI Fund’s recently released revisions to the\nCDFI Certification Application. In addition to ECIP funding, certified CDFIs are eligible to\naccess other federal resources, state and local governmental funds, philanthropic support, and\nprivate sector investment. I look forward to engaging with community banks as they and other\nfinancial institutions begin to digest these revised application requirements. I also look forward\nto learning about how these changes may affect the certification process for renewing or\nobtaining a CDFI certification.\nConclusion\nThe Fed continues to support the growth of start-ups and small businesses as a means of\ncreating opportunity for all workers. This afternoon’s discussion will focus on how employer\n12 See the Federal Reserve Board's website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/ppplf.htm. 13 Anthony Barr and Mac McComas, “Minority Depository Institutions: State of Knowledge, Sector Summary &\nLending Activity, and Impact, 2010-2020” (paper presented at the National Bankers Association Foundation and\nJohns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative, May 2023),\nhttps://www.nationalbankers.org/_files/ugd/93bce2_97f4419fd0c140aaa28a79d4ee543fa5.pdf?index=true.\nSeparately, the Fed supports MDIs through the Fed’s Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, which provides\ntechnical assistance on regulatory matters, conducts research, hosts convenings, and provides examiner training to\nsupport and promote the stability of MDIs.\n14 U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Biden-Harris Administration Announces Over $8.28 Billion in Investments in\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions through the Emergency\nCapital Investment Program,” press release, September 22, 2022, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ECIPPress-Release.pdf.\n- 7 -\nstructure and financing may affect employee wages and benefits.

    "text": "Thanks to the Kansas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my\nperspective on the economy and bank regulation. It is always a pleasure to be here with\nyou for this annual gathering. I am especially looking forward to hearing what is on your\nminds about supervision and regulation, how you are navigating current economic\nconditions, and your expectations going forward.\nI’ll start with a recap of the decision from July’s Federal Open Market Committee\nmeeting and then move on to my thoughts about the current economic uncertainty and\nchallenges that lie ahead. The number one challenge, of course, is inflation, which\ncontinues to be much too high, and a heavy burden for households and businesses. As\nI’m sure you all already know, the Federal Open Market Committee decided last week to\nraise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, to a range of 2¼ to 2½ percent. I will\nshare my reasoning for supporting this increase and why I support continued increases\nuntil inflation is on a consistent path to significantly decline. I will then touch on the\ncurrent federal regulatory climate and the Fed’s agenda for supervision.\nInflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the\nconsumer price index. This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another\n40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked\nearlier in the year. I have seen few, if any, concrete indications that support this\nexpectation, and I will need to see unambiguous evidence of this decline before I\nincorporate an easing of inflation pressures into my outlook.\nMany of the underlying causes of excessive inflation are the same as they have\nbeen over the past year or so—supply chain issues, including those related to China’s\n- 2 -\nCOVID containment policies, constrained housing supply, the ongoing conflict in\nUkraine, fiscal stimulus, and limitations on domestic energy production.\nRegardless of the source of the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve has a\nduty to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target. This duty is mandated by Congress\nto carry out monetary policy that results in price stability—meaning low and stable\ninflation. We all understand why this is a critically important responsibility, especially in\ntimes of extreme inflation. Rising prices for food, housing, and energy negatively impact\naffordability for all Americans, but especially those with low or moderate incomes. For\nthose workers who drive long distances to get to work, high inflation is especially\nconcerning, requiring some to make tradeoffs between feeding their families and buying\nfuel to fill gas tanks. Some workers have seen their wages grow significantly over the\npast two years, but most have seen any gains in wages far outpaced by higher prices.\nTherefore, in my mind, it is absolutely critical that we continue to use our monetary\npolicy tools until we are successful in returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.\nBusinesses are also suffering from elevated inflation through rising and volatile\nprices for inputs and the need to price their own goods and services to cover costs without\nlosing customers. This dynamic is evident in agriculture and what we are hearing\ndirectly from farmers and ranchers, who are dealing with added weather challenges and\non-going drought. Prices for commodities have declined lately but are still at historically\nhigh levels. In contrast, prices for fertilizer and many crop inputs continue to rise. In\nsome areas, high input costs and drought conditions are contributing to record early\nseason cattle auction sales, as many ranchers choose to sell herds early to limit further\noutlays for input expenses.\n- 3 -\nI see a significant risk of high inflation into next year for necessities including\nfood, housing, fuel, and vehicles. Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales\nhave slowed, the continued increasing price of single-family homes indicates to me that\nrents won’t decline anytime in the near future. Recently, gasoline prices have moderated\nbut are still roughly 80 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels due to constrained\ndomestic supply and the disruption of world markets. And I see continued inflation risk\nfrom motor vehicle prices, as auto manufacturers struggle with supply chain problems\nthat haven’t improved significantly. Demand for cars continues to exceed supply, and\nretail used car prices are still very high, about 50 percent more than before the pandemic.\nThe supply problems pushing up inflation seem likely to persist. Indications are\nthat the conflict in Ukraine will continue, and that the effects of shipping disruptions of\nagriculture products and limits on energy supplies from Russia will continue to be a\nsignificant problem. Even with the recent agreement intended to facilitate Ukrainian\ngrain exports, it is unclear whether supply pressures on global markets will ease as a\nresult. An announced reduction in Russian natural gas supplies to Western Europe has\ndriven European prices even higher, causing ripple effects on world energy markets and\nraising concerns about shortages this winter. China has eased some of its most stringent\nCOVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and\nits approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation. Despite a slowdown in\nsales of new and existing homes, inventories of homes for sale and rental vacancies\nremain low, supporting ongoing increases in housing costs.\nOn the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we continue to see\na tight labor market, though there are some emerging signs that would support\n- 4 -\nexpectations of loosening. Yesterday’s job report showed continued significant growth in\nhiring with the unemployment rate finally returning to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5\npercent. As I am sure you all know, the job market in Kansas is even stronger, with an\nunemployment rate of 2.4 percent in June. In our state, finding workers is a bigger\nproblem in most communities than finding a job.\nOne aspect of the job market that has not recovered is labor force participation.\nBased on the pre-pandemic trend, there are nearly four million people who are still sitting\nout of a strong labor market.\nIn contrast to this labor market strength in Kansas and nationwide, output growth\nhas slowed this year. Real gross domestic product, GDP, edged lower in the second\nquarter, following a larger decline in the first quarter.\nMy base case is for a pickup in growth during the second half of this year and for\nmoderate growth in 2023. As we learned during the summer and fall of 2021, both GDP\nand jobs numbers are subject to significant revision, both in subsequent months and then\nagain the next year. From my perspective, had we known at the time about the eventual\nlarge upward revisions in last year’s employment data, we likely would have significantly\naccelerated our monetary policy actions. Going forward, we have to consider the\npossibility of these kinds of revisions when making real-time judgments as policymakers,\nwhich includes looking at other kinds of indicators instead of relying too heavily on the\ndata. Taking all of that on board, while the data on economic activity are indeed lower\nand the view is murky, the evidence on inflation is absolutely clear, which brings me to\nthe implications for monetary policy.\n- 5 -\nBased on current economic conditions and the outlook I just described, I\nsupported the FOMC’s decision last week to raise the federal funds rate another 75 basis\npoints. I also support the Committee’s view that “ongoing increases” would be\nappropriate at coming meetings. My view is that similarly-sized increases should be on\nthe table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way.\nOn the subject of forward guidance, I am pleased to see that following the July\nmeeting, the FOMC ended the practice of providing specific forward guidance in our\npost-meeting communications. I believe that the overly specific forward guidance\nimplemented at the December 2020 FOMC meeting requiring “substantial further\nprogress” unnecessarily limited the Committee’s actions in beginning the removal of\naccommodation later in 2021. In my view, that, combined with data revisions that were\ndirectly relevant to our decision making, led to a delay in taking action to address rising\ninflation.\nIt is helpful that the FOMC provided clear direction earlier this year that it was\nprepared to act quickly to tighten monetary policy. Since we have now taken actions to\nraise rates and finally reduce the Fed’s balance sheet, we are following through on that\ncommitment. Looking ahead, the FOMC will be getting two months of data on inflation\nand another month on employment before our next meeting in September, and while I\nexpect that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, given the uncertainty in how those\ndata and conditions will evolve, I will allow that information to guide my judgment on\nhow big the increases will need to be.\nI do expect that the labor market will remain strong as we continue to increase\ninterest rates and allow the balance sheet to run off, but there is a risk that our actions will\n- 6 -\nslow job gains, or even reduce employment. Growth has softened, and perhaps this is an\nindication that our actions to tighten monetary policy are having the desired effect, with\nthe ultimate goal of bringing demand and supply into greater balance.\nWhen considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the\ncontext of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to\nget inflation under control. In fact, the larger threat to the strong labor market is\nexcessive inflation, which if allowed to continue could lead to a further economic\nsoftening, risking a prolonged period of economic weakness coupled with high inflation,\nlike we experienced in the 1970s.\nIn any case, we must fulfill our commitment to lowering inflation, and I will\nremain steadfastly focused on this task.\nWith my outlook out of the way, let me turn to another of my responsibilities at\nthe Fed, which is bank regulation and supervision. I am sure that we will have the\nopportunity to discuss many issues of interest to you during our discussion, but I’d like to\nmention a pending rulemaking that would update the Community Reinvestment Act. I\nunderstand that the draft rule was intended to provide greater clarity to banks regarding\ncommunity development activities and their consideration for CRA. While I am a strong\nsupporter of the fundamentals behind CRA, and I support community development\nactivities, I am concerned that the proposal does not adequately account for the costs and\nbenefits of certain provisions, and that no attempt has even been made to either ensure\nthat or to analyze whether the benefits exceed the costs, which is a fundamental element\nof effective regulation. The comment period for the proposal ended on August 5, and I\nwill repeat what I have said in the past: if this proposal affects you or your business, I\n- 7 -\nhope that you made your voice heard by submitting a comment to the more than 600-\npage proposal within the short 90-day comment period. Public comments really do\nmatter when considering the content of proposed rulemakings.\nOf course, my comments about the benefits of public participation in rulemaking\napply beyond the CRA proposal, and there are other regulatory topics on the horizon that\nwould benefit from robust engagement. One that comes to mind is the regulatory\nframework for analyzing bank mergers. Earlier this year, the Justice Department\nrequested comment on whether to revise their 1995 Bank Merger Competitive Review\nguidelines, seeking input on a wide range of issues. The FDIC also issued a request for\ninformation on the Bank Merger Act framework. I expect this review will be a focus\nacross the banking agencies, and I will be very interested to see how the framework for\nsmall and regional banks is affected by any proposed change. I would be concerned\nabout any changes that would result in making mergers among these institutions more\ndifficult or would not address some of the longstanding issues with the existing\nframework. Among those are that the framework doesn’t account for new technologies\nor overwhelming competition posed by credit unions, internet based financial services,\nand non-bank financial companies. Another concern is that overly strict criteria for\nmergers could have the unintended consequence of depriving consumers in some areas of\naccess to any banking services. “Banking deserts” in rural and underserved areas are a\nreal problem and regulators should guard against this outcome when proposing or\nevaluating rules.\nI should also briefly mention three other regulatory topics of interest to all banks,\nincluding those here today.\n- 8 -\nFirst, the Fed’s LIBOR proposal is currently out for comment on a short timeline.\nThat proposal implements the recently passed LIBOR Act by providing default rules for\ncertain contracts that use the soon to be discontinued reference rate. Second, comments\nare currently under review for the third-party risk management guidance jointly proposed\nby the Fed with the other banking agencies. Banks and third parties will benefit from\nclear guidance that helps banks navigate the challenging issues and risks raised by third\nparty engagement.\nFinally, another area that could benefit from more regulatory clarity is digital\nassets, including stablecoins and crypto assets. Some banks are considering expanding\ninto a range of crypto activities, including custody, lending backed by crypto collateral,\nand facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets for their customers. In the absence\nof clear guidance, banks should consult with their primary regulator and exercise caution\nwhen engaging with customers in these types of activities.\nI will conclude with a brief comment on supervision. While the trend of returning\nto on-site bank examination is continuing, progress has been somewhat slow. This may\nbe driven in part by the varied pace of employees returning to the office. That said, the\nFed intends to return to some form of on-site supervision. We find substantial value in\nthose in-person interactions during bank examinations.\nIn closing, thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today. I look\nforward to hearing how high inflation is affecting you and your communities and your\nthoughts on the regulatory agenda"

    "text": "Thank you, President Evans, for hosting this event today, and to our moderator\nand participants for taking part in this valuable discussion. Today’s event is the last in\nour series of Fed Listens events held across the country to learn about how Americans\nthink about monetary policy and how they think about the Federal Reserve.\nIn keeping with the purpose of Fed Listens, I would like to spend most of our time\nin conversation. But I do want to offer a few thoughts about why the Fed is reaching out\nto seek a broad range of views, and what we are hoping to accomplish through this\ninitiative.\nFed Listens is a new comprehensive outreach to the public on monetary policy.\nFor many decades there was a sense at the Board that the public wasn’t interested or even\nwilling to dive into the complexities of monetary policy. That view has changed in a\nfundamental way, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis when it was urgently\nimportant that the public understand what we were doing. So we began explaining as\naccessibly and as clearly as we could what we were doing and why. Now we are\nlistening carefully.\nSince I became a Board member almost a year ago, it has become clear to me that\npeople are not only willing to engage on complex economic issues, but they also want to\nknow that their concerns are being taken into consideration on issues that affect their\nfinancial well-being. The Fed’s movement toward greater transparency and public\nengagement is well underway, and advancing that effort is one of my top priorities.\nAt the same time, we recognize that the clear communication of our policies\nactually helps us achieve our goals. When we communicate our views on the economic\noutlook and our expectations for where interest rates may be heading, consumers and\n- 2 -\nbusinesses take that information into account when making decisions on spending,\ninvestment, and hiring. For that reason, our policy communications are an important part\nof the Fed’s toolkit for influencing the direction of the economy.\nFed Listens is a natural outcome of this commitment to public engagement. We\nhave heard from many people from different parts of the country and from different\nsectors of the economy about how monetary policy affects them and their communities.\nIt is our responsibility as a public institution to be accountable to the public. Hearing a\nbroad range of perspectives on these issues will help us make good decisions as we\nconsider new approaches to monetary policy.\nAs I mentioned before, this afternoon’s discussion is the last in a series of Fed\nListens events that we began back in February. Looking at the depth of experience of our\npanelists and of David Wessel, our distinguished moderator, I think we can make a strong\ncase that we saved the best for last. Our first panel focuses on disadvantaged workers’\nlong-term job prospects. I am eager to hear from our panelists how they think the labor\nmarket and our policies are impacting the communities they serve in Illinois, Michigan,\nand in other states in the Midwest.\nAs a former community banker, I am also very interested to hear from people who\nare implementing creative strategies to build wealth and support access to credit for lowand moderate-income communities. The panelists in our second session can speak to\ntheir experiences doing just that, because they are helping to bring credit and housing\nopportunities to Appalachia, Indianapolis as well as right here in Chicago.\nOur monetary policy review will have implications for financial markets, but we\nalso want to know more about what the impact will be on Main Street. My colleagues\n- 3 -\nand I are keenly aware of our responsibility to focus on how the decisions we make affect\nthe real economy for people in communities all across the country.\nThe two goals for monetary policy—maximum employment and stable prices—\nare determined by the Congress and are not subject to our framework review. How we\nreach those goals is the topic for discussion. One question I hope to explore is whether\nwe need new strategies to more effectively achieve our goals. For example, inflation has\nrun modestly below our 2 percent objective for many years. Given that, it would be\nhelpful to hear whether you think the Federal Open Market Committee should consider\nstrategies that aim to have inflation exceed our target for a period of time to make up for\nthe earlier shortfall or whether you think that would threaten the decades of success the\nFed has had keeping the public’s inflation expectations low and stable.\nAnother question concerns the Fed’s existing toolkit for monetary policy.\nCurrently, our available policy tools include setting interest rates, purchasing longer-term\nassets, and forward guidance about the expected future path of policy. Are there other\ntools we should consider to help us reach and sustain our objectives more effectively? I\nalso want to know how the Federal Open Market Committee’s communication of its\npolicy framework might be improved. How can we help you better understand our work\nso you can hold us accountable?\nYour perspectives on questions like these are a vital part of this monetary policy\nreview. So I want to thank you again for your time and your contributions. Once the\npolicy review is complete, we will share our findings with the public, probably during the\nfirst half of next year. I look forward to our discussion. "
