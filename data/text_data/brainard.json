The current global environment highlights the importance of having strong\nanalytic and empirical foundations to understand financial stability considerations for monetary\npolicy, and the research presented today will help strengthen those foundations.1 The global\nenvironment of high inflation and rising interest rates highlights the importance of paying\nattention to financial stability considerations for monetary policy. As monetary policy tightens\nglobally to combat high inflation, it is important to consider how cross-border spillovers and\nspillbacks might interact with financial vulnerabilities.\nInflation is very high in the United States and abroad, and the risk of additional\ninflationary shocks cannot be ruled out. In August, CPI (consumer price index) inflation on a\n12-month basis was 8.3 percent in the United States, 9.9 percent in the United Kingdom,\n9.8 percent in Sweden, 9.1 percent in the euro area, 8.7 percent in Mexico, 7.0 percent in\nCanada, and 5.7 percent in Korea.\nCentral banks facing high inflation are tightening monetary policy rapidly to damp\ndemand and bring it into alignment with supply, which is constrained in a variety of sectors. The\nprocess of resolving imbalances will be easier the more supply improves in markets for\ncommodities, labor, and key intermediate inputs, as is generally expected, but there is a risk that\nsupply disruptions could be prolonged or aggravated by Russia’s war against Ukraine,\nCOVID-19 lockdowns in China, or weather disruptions. Russia’s war against Ukraine has\ngenerated spikes in prices for energy, food, and agricultural inputs. Most recently, inflation in\nEurope was pushed higher by Russia’s cessation of natural gas deliveries through the Nord\n1 I want to thank Kurt Lewis and Shaghil Ahmed of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance on these remarks.\nThese views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nStream 1 pipeline, creating hardships for households and risking disruptions for some industries\nin the affected countries. China’s COVID lockdown policy could also lead to supply disruptions\nif cases again increase. Separately, weather conditions in several areas, including China, Europe,\nand the United States, are exacerbating price pressures through disruptions to agriculture,\nshipping, and utilities.\nMany central banks around the world have pivoted monetary policy strongly in order to\nmaintain anchored expectations and forestall second-round effects from high inflation becoming\nembedded in wage and price setting. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has increased the\nfederal funds rate target range by 300 basis points in the past seven months—a rapid pace by\nhistorical standards—and the Federal Open Market Committee’s most recent Summary of\nEconomic Projections indicates additional increases through the end of this year and into next\nyear. In addition, beginning this month, balance sheet shrinkage accelerated to its maximum rate\nof up to $60 billion in Treasury securities per month, and up to $35 billion in agency mortgage-\nbacked securities per month. Broader U.S. financial conditions have tightened rapidly: The 10-\nyear Treasury yield has risen more than 200 basis points since the beginning of the year and is\nnear its highest level in over a decade at 3.8 percent.\nAt a global level, monetary policy tightening is also proceeding at a rapid pace by\nhistorical standards. Including the Federal Reserve, nine central banks in advanced economies\naccounting for half of global GDP have raised rates by 125 basis points or more in the past six\nmonths.2 Global financial conditions have likewise tightened. Yields on 10-year sovereign debt\n2 The central banks of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the euro area, Australia, New Zealand,\nNorway, Sweden, and Switzerland together account for 49 percent of nominal global GDP measured in dollars at\nmarket exchange rates. Each of these central banks has raised its policy rate by at least 125 basis points in the past\nsix months.\n\n- 3 -\nin the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the largest euro area economies are\nhigher year to date between 170 and 350 basis points.\nIt will take some time for the global tightening to have its full effect in many sectors.\nWhile the effect on financial conditions tends to be immediate or even anticipatory, the effects\non activity and price setting in different sectors may occur with a lag, with highly interest-\nsensitive sectors such as housing adjusting quickly and less rate-sensitive sectors such as\nconsumer spending on services adjusting more slowly.\nIn addition to the domestic effects from domestic tightening, there are cross-border\neffects of tightening through both trade and financial channels. U.S. monetary policy tightening\nreduces U.S. demand for foreign products, thus amplifying the effects of monetary tightening by\nforeign central banks. The same is true in reverse: Tightening in large jurisdictions abroad\namplifies U.S. tightening by damping foreign demand for U.S. products.\nTightening in financial conditions similarly spills over to financial conditions elsewhere,\nwhich amplifies the tightening effects. These spillovers across jurisdictions are present for\ndecreases in the size of the central bank balance sheet as well as for increases in the policy rate.3\nSome estimates suggest that the spillovers of monetary policy surprises between more tightly\nlinked advanced economies such as the United States and Europe could be about half the size of\n3 See Lael Brainard (2015), “Unconventional Monetary Policy and Cross-Border Spillovers,” speech delivered at\n“Unconventional Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies,” 16th International Monetary Fund Jacques Polak Research\nConference, Washington, November 6, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151106a.htm;\nand Lael Brainard (2017), “Cross-Border Spillovers of Balance Sheet Normalization,” speech delivered at the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research’s Monetary Economics Summer Institute, Cambridge, Mass., July 13,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170713a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nthe own-country effect when measured in terms of relative changes in local currency bond\nyields.4\nIn contrast, spillovers through exchange rate channels tend to go in opposite directions.\nThe Federal Reserve’s broad nominal U.S. dollar index has appreciated over 10 percent year to\ndate.5 On balance, dollar appreciation tends to reduce import prices in the United States. But in\nsome other jurisdictions, the corresponding currency depreciation may contribute to inflationary\npressures and require additional tightening to offset.\nWe are attentive to financial vulnerabilities that could be exacerbated by the advent of\nadditional adverse shocks. For instance, in countries where sovereign or corporate debt levels\nare high, higher interest rates could increase debt-servicing burdens and concerns about debt\nsustainability, which could be exacerbated by currency depreciation. An increase in risk\npremiums could kick off deleveraging dynamics as financial intermediaries de-risk. And\nshallow liquidity in some markets could become an amplification channel in the event of further\nadverse shocks.\nFor some emerging economies, high interest rates in combination with weaker demand in\nadvanced economies could increase capital outflow pressures, particularly commodity importers\nfacing higher commodity prices and weaker exchange rates. And these pressures would be\n4 A paper based on data between 2005 and 2017 found that about half of the reaction in German domestic yields\nspills over to U.S. yields following ECB announcements, which was nearly identical to the spillover from U.S.\nyields to German bund yields measured following Federal Open Market Committee announcements. See Stephanie\nE. Curcuru, Michiel De Pooter, and George Eckerd (2018), “Measuring Monetary Policy Spillovers between U.S.\nand German Bond Yields,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1226 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, April), https://doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2018.1226.\n5 The Federal Reserve’s broad trade-weighted dollar index is based on 26 currencies of major U.S. trading partners.\nIt is published in Statistical Release H.10, “Foreign Exchange Rates,” available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/current/default.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nparticularly challenging for borrowers with currency mismatches between their assets and\nliabilities.\nThis is especially true at times when fiscal, macroprudential, and monetary buffers are\nmore limited. Fiscal and monetary policy were both supportive in response to the pandemic, and\nboth were naturally expected to reverse course as the recovery gathered steam. But the advent of\nthe war has led to a significant hit to real incomes from large price increases in energy and other\ncommodities in some of the most severely affected economies.\nWith respect to macroprudential buffers, nearly all of the jurisdictions that built\ncountercyclical capital buffers before the pandemic released those buffers at the outset of the\npandemic, and the buffers have not been fully replenished so far. A European Central Bank\nanalysis concluded that the release of capital buffers increased headroom for banks relative to not\nonly their regulatory thresholds, but also their internal risk controls, and enabled banks to\ncontinue providing credit to households and businesses.6\nAnd of course, monetary policy is focused on restoring price stability in a high-inflation\nenvironment. As the program’s first research paper illustrates, in circumstances in which\nmacroprudential policy cannot on its own eliminate the amplification of shocks through financial\nvulnerabilities, in a low-inflation environment, monetary policy has been relatively more\naccommodative than would be prescribed by a conventional monetary policy rule in order to\nreduce the likelihood of adverse output and employment outcomes.7 But in a high-inflation\n6 These findings were part of a box in the ECB’s May 2022 Financial Stability Review titled “Transmission and\nEffectiveness of Capital-Based Macroprudential Policies.” See European Central Bank (2022), Financial Stability\nReview (Frankfurt: ECB, May), pp. 93–95, https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-\nstability/fsr/focus/2022/html/ecb.fsrbox202205_08~7c0f8067de.en.html.

We engage in frequent and\ntransparent communications with monetary policy officials from other countries about the\nevolution of the outlook in each economy and the implications for policy. We meet regularly not\nonly with monetary policy officials from different countries, but also with fiscal and financial\nstability officials in a variety of international settings, which helps us to take into account cross-\nborder spillovers and financial vulnerabilities in our respective forecasts, risk scenarios, and\npolicy deliberations.8\nHigh inflation imposes significant hardships by eroding purchasing power, especially for\nthose households that spend the greatest share of their incomes on essentials like food, housing,\nand transportation.9 Following a period where a combination of high demand and a lengthy\nsequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities drove inflation to\nmultidecade highs, monetary policymakers are taking a risk-management posture to guard\nagainst risks of longer-term inflation expectations moving above target, which would make it\nmore difficult to bring inflation down.\n8 See Richard H. Clarida (2021), “Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and\nCorrelation,” speech delivered at the “Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery” 2021 Asia Economic\nPolicy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San\nFrancisco (via webcast), November 19, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20211119a.htm.\n9 See Lael Brainard (2022), “Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households,” speech delivered at the Spring\n2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis, Minneapolis (via webcast), April 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nIn the modal outlook, monetary policy tightening to temper demand, in combination with\nimprovements in supply, is expected to reduce demand–supply imbalances and reduce inflation\nover time.10 The real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest\nmaturities, and with the additional tightening and deceleration in inflation that is expected over\ncoming quarters, the entire real curve will soon move into positive territory.\nIt will take time for the full effect of tighter financial conditions to work through different\nsectors and to bring inflation down. Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to\nhave confidence that inflation is moving back to target. For these reasons, we are committed to\navoiding pulling back prematurely. We also recognize that risks may become more two sided at\nsome point. Uncertainty is currently high, and there are a range of estimates around the\nappropriate destination of the target range for the cycle. Proceeding deliberately and in a data-\ndependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity and inflation are adjusting to\nthe cumulative tightening and to update our assessments of the level of the policy rate that will\nneed to be maintained for some time to bring inflation back to 2 percent.\n10 See, for example, the year-to-date improvement in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain\nPressure Index, available on the Bank’s website at https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/interactive.",

In the United States, in\nmy assessment, normalization of the federal funds rate is now well under way, and the\nFederal Reserve is advancing plans to allow the balance sheet to run off at a gradual and\npredictable pace. And for the first time in many years, the global economy is\nexperiencing synchronous growth, and authorities in the euro area and the United\nKingdom are beginning to discuss the time when the need for monetary accommodation\nwill diminish.\nUnlike in previous tightening cycles, many central banks currently have two tools\nfor removing accommodation. They can therefore pursue alternative normalization\nstrategies--first seeking to guide policy rates higher before initiating balance sheet runoff,\nas in the United States, or instead starting to shrink the balance sheet before initiating a\n1 I am grateful to John Ammer, Bastian von Beschwitz, Christopher Erceg, Matteo Iacoviello, and John\nRoberts for their assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my own views, which do not\nnecessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 The new commitment stated: “We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will\nremain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that\nwe will not target exchange rates.” See Group of Seven (2013), “Statement by G7 Finance Ministers and\nCentral Bank Governors,” February 12, paragraph 1, www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm130212.htm. The\ncorresponding Group of Twenty statement included the new commitment: “We will not target our\nexchange rates for competitive purposes.” See Group of Twenty (2013), “Communiqué of Meeting of G20\nFinance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,” February 16, paragraph 5,\nwww.g20.utoronto.ca/2013/2013-0216-finance.html.\n\n- 2 -\ntightening of short-term rates, or undertaking both in tandem. Shrinking the balance\nsheet and raising the policy rate can both contribute to achieving the domestic goals of\nmonetary policy, but it is an open question whether alternative normalization approaches\nmight have materially different implications for the composition of demand and for cross-\nborder spillovers, including through exchange rates and other financial channels.\nBefore discussing the cross-border effects of normalization, it is worth noting that\nthe two tools for removing accommodation--raising policy rates and reducing central\nbank balance sheets--appear to affect domestic output and inflation in a qualitatively\nsimilar way. This means that central banks can substitute between raising the policy rate\nand shrinking the balance sheet to remove accommodation, just as both were used to\nsupport the recovery following the Great Recession.\nInsofar as a range of approaches is likely to be consistent with achieving a central\nbank’s domestic objectives, the choice of normalization strategy may be influenced by\nother considerations, including the ease of implementing and communicating policy\nchanges, or the desire to minimize possible credit market distortions associated with the\nbalance sheet. In the case of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) decided to delay balance sheet normalization until the federal funds rate had\nreached a high enough level to enable it to be cut materially if economic conditions\ndeteriorate, thus guarding against the risk of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB)\nin an environment with a historically low neutral interest rate.3 The greater familiarity\nand past experience with the federal funds rate also weighed in favor of this instrument\n3 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, December 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20151216a.htm; and Brainard (2015b).\n\n- 3 -\ninitially. Separately, for those central banks that, unlike the Federal Reserve, moved to\nnegative interest rates, there may be special considerations associated with raising policy\nrates back into positive territory.\nOne question that naturally arises is whether the major central banks’\nnormalization plans may have material implications for cross-border spillovers--an\nimportant issue that until very recently had received scant attention. This question is a\nnatural extension of the literature examining the cross-border spillovers of the\nunconventional policy actions taken by the major central banks to provide\naccommodation.\nAlthough this literature suggests there are good reasons to expect broadly similar\ncross-border spillovers from tightening through policy rates as through balance sheet\nrunoff, the effects may not be exactly equivalent. The balance sheet might affect certain\naspects of the economy and financial markets differently than the short-term rate due to\nthe fact that the balance sheet more directly affects term premiums on longer-term\nsecurities, while the short-term rate more directly affects money market rates. As a\nresult, similar to the domestic effects, while the international spillovers of conventional\nand unconventional monetary policy may operate broadly similarly, the relative\nmagnitude of the different channels may be sufficiently different that, on net, the two\npolicy strategies have distinct effects. For example, as will be discussed at greater length\nshortly, the two strategies may have very different implications for the exchange rate.\nMoreover, as was evident with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) asset purchases in\nlate 2014 and early 2015, and as we have seen again in reverse in recent weeks, in\naddition to the standard demand and exchange rate channels, expected or actual asset\n\n- 4 -\npurchases may have spillovers to foreign financial conditions--by lowering term\npremiums and the associated longer-term foreign bond yields--that are greater than\nconventional monetary policy.\nTo explore possible differences, it is useful to compare two different approaches\nto policy normalization, each of which is designed to have identical effects on aggregate\ndomestic activity and thus, at least in the long run, on inflation. At one extreme, a central\nbank could opt to tighten primarily through conventional policy hikes, while maintaining\nthe balance sheet by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets. At the other extreme, a\ncentral bank could rely primarily on reducing the balance sheet, while keeping policy\nrates unchanged in the near term.\nThe question is whether there are circumstances in which the choice of\nnormalization strategies, which are similarly effective in achieving domestic mandates,\nmight matter for the global economy. Where the two approaches have entirely equivalent\neffects, the central bank could freely substitute between them without changing the\ncomposition of home demand, and net exports, the exchange rate, and foreign output\nwould also be unaffected.\nConversely, under different assumptions about the transmission channels of\nmonetary policy, alternative approaches to normalization can have quite different\nimplications for foreign economies. Most prominently, the exchange rate may be more\nsensitive to the path of short term rates than to balance sheet adjustments, as some\nresearch suggests.4 Although several papers using an event study approach find on\nbalance little disparity in the exchange rate sensitivity to short-term compared to long-\n4 See, for instance, Stavrakeva and Tang (2016).\n\n- 5 -\nterm interest rates, this lack of empirical consensus may simply reflect the difficulty of\ndisentangling changes in short-term and longer-term interest rates, which are highly\ncorrelated.5\nIndeed, the greater sensitivity of exchange rates to expected short-term interest\nrates than to term premiums was a key rationale behind the Operation Twist strategy in\nthe early 1960s.6 Under Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury made\nlarge-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to drive down yields and\nstimulate the economy, which was suffering from an unemployment rate of nearly 7\npercent. This policy was combined with a modest increase in short-term interest rates\nintended to alleviate the capital outflow pressures that threatened the sustainability of the\nBretton Woods global monetary system. Ultimately, this policy mix did succeed in\nreducing long-term interest rates, and also contributed to a reduction in private capital\noutflows that relieved pressure on U.S. international reserves, at least for a time.\nLet’s turn to a simulation of a highly stylized model to explore how a greater\nsensitivity of the exchange rate to conventional policy relative to balance sheet actions\ncan make a difference in terms of cross-border transmission. In particular, let’s assume a\n100-basis-point rise in long-term yields coming from the conventional channel of higher\npolicy rates has double the effect on the exchange rate as a 100 basis point rise in yields\ncoming from higher term premiums.7 If a large country, which is already at potential,\nexperiences a favorable domestic demand shock, it would need to tighten monetary\n5 See Glick and Leduc (2015), Ferrari, Kearns, and Schrimpf (2016), and Swanson (2017); Swanson\nattempts to identify separately the effects of forward guidance and asset purchases.\n6 See Ross (1966), Modigliani and Sutch (1966), Stein (1965), and Alon and Swanson (2011).\n7 This simulation is shown in figure 1 in the appendix. The stylized model is composed of two identical\ncountries that are linked through trade flows. The model is calibrated so that either type of policy action\nkeeps the home country’s GDP at baseline.\n\n- 6 -\npolicy to return output to potential. If the central bank chooses to use the short-term\ninterest rate as its active policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, the current and\nexpected path of short-term interest rates rises, putting upward pressure on long-term\nbond yields and causing the real exchange rate to appreciate. The stronger currency\ncoupled with some initial expansion of domestic demand in turn cause a deterioration in\nreal net exports.\nTurning to the effects abroad, the decline in domestic real net exports corresponds\nto an increase in foreign net exports, which will tend to boost foreign GDP, other things\nbeing equal. How this affects a particular foreign economy will depend on its\ncircumstances and the corresponding policy response of the foreign central bank. In the\ncase where the foreign economy is pinned at the effective lower bound, the increase in\nnet exports will provide a welcome boost to aggregate demand. By contrast, if foreign\noutput is already near potential, the foreign central bank will need to respond by\ntightening policy in order to keep its economy in balance.\nNow, let’s instead consider tightening through the balance sheet. If the same\namount of policy tightening in the country experiencing a positive demand shock is\nachieved exclusively through a reduction in the balance sheet, while keeping the policy\nrate unchanged, the exchange rate would appreciate to a smaller degree, reflecting the\nlower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to the term premium than to policy rates.\nNet exports would decline by less--reflecting both the smaller exchange rate appreciation\nand the smaller rise in domestic demand--and similarly this would result in smaller cross-\nborder spillovers to foreign GDP.\n\n- 7 -\nThus, for a foreign economy that is at the effective lower bound, tightening in the\nhome country through balance-sheet policy will be less welcome than through short-term\nrates. The foreign economy will experience less exchange rate depreciation, and so less\nof a boost to net exports. In addition, the stimulus to the foreign economy could be\nfurther diluted to the extent that the balance sheet policy boosted term premiums on its\nlong-term bonds and hence tightened financial conditions, although this effect has not\nbeen built into the simulation model. By contrast, for a foreign economy that is close to\npotential, adjustment through the balance sheet in the home country will mean less of a\nneed for the foreign central bank to respond by tightening policy than under home\ncountry adjustment through conventional policy.\nSo far, we have considered the case of central banks with freely floating exchange\nrates and well-anchored inflation expectations. What about central banks with managed\nexchange rates or weakly anchored inflation expectations? To keep the analysis simple,\nlet’s assume a foreign central bank aims to completely stabilize its exchange rate vis-à-\nvis a core country. Let’s again consider circumstances in which the core country\nexperiences a positive demand shock that calls for policy tightening. Although the\npegging economy is likely to experience spillovers under either approach to\nnormalization in the core country, the spillovers are likely to be greater when the core\ncountry tightens through the policy rate. The tightening in the core country will compel\nthe country that is fixing its exchange rate to tighten policy in sync and the core country’s\ncurrency will rise more against its trading partners with conventional tightening, leading\nto greater effective appreciation of the pegging country’s currency as well. Although the\npegging economy will benefit somewhat from the stronger demand of the core country,\n\n- 8 -\nthat benefit is likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects of a tightening of domestic\nmonetary policy when domestic conditions would not otherwise call for it. Such\nconsiderations may have played a role in the market dynamics experienced by China as\ndiscussions about initiating rate hikes progressed in the United States in the second half\nof 2015 and early 2016.8\nNext let’s explore alternative approaches to policy normalization by countries\nfacing a similar need to tighten. This question is timely; with synchronous expansions\nnow underway, we may be approaching a turning point before too long. In particular,\nlet’s consider the case when two large countries, which are assumed identical for the sake\nof simplicity, experience the same positive shock to domestic demand. Under these\nassumptions, if both economies were to choose the same normalization strategy--putting\nprimary reliance on either the balance sheet or short-term interest rates--the implications\nfor the exchange rate and net exports are the same: In both cases, the exchange rate\nbetween the two countries does not change, and neither do net exports between the\ncountries. Each central bank would adjust interest rates by the same amount--enough to\noffset the stimulus from the demand shock--and with interest differentials unchanged,\nthere would be no pressure on the exchange rate between them to move.9 Of course, if\nthere are other economies in the rest of the world that do not experience the same shock,\nthe choice of normalization strategy does matter, similar to the analysis of spillovers from\n8 See Brainard (2015a). A number of recent studies have considered financial spillovers to EMEs,\nincluding Rey (2014) and Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2015). The analysis of Hofmann, Shim, and\nShin (2016) suggests that EMEs may be hurt more if their banks or nonfinancial corporations have\nrelatively large dollar liabilities, as the larger dollar appreciation associated with the policy rate tool would\nprecipitate greater EME balance sheet deterioration in this case.\n9 In this simple example, in which the two countries are hit by identical shocks, the offset in spillovers\nbetween the two economies will be complete. If one country faces a larger aggregate demand shock than\nthe other, then the situation becomes more like the one-country case we examined before, the policy\nadjustments lead to spillovers of different magnitudes, and the offset will be partial.\n\n- 9 -\nthe single core country, presumably magnified by the larger combined global weight of\nthe two economies.\nNow let’s turn to the case in which the two central banks choose to rely on\ndifferent policy tools. 10 In this case, one country responds to the positive shock by\nhiking its policy rate to reduce output to its initial level, while the second country\nresponds by shrinking its balance sheet. The country that relies on the policy rate to\nmake the adjustment experiences an appreciation in the exchange rate, a deterioration in\nnet exports and some expansion of domestic demand, while the country that chooses to\nrely solely on the balance sheet for tightening experiences a depreciation of its exchange\nrate and an increase in net exports. Thus, while both countries achieve their domestic\nstabilization objectives, whether the requisite policy tightening occurs through increases\nin policy rates or reductions in the balance sheet matters for the composition of demand,\nthe external balance, and the exchange rate.\nI highlighted at the outset the commitment adopted by many leading nations to\nset monetary policy to achieve domestic objectives such that the exchange rate would not\nbe a primary consideration in the setting of monetary policy. In the case that balance-\nsheet and conventional monetary policies have equivalent effects on both domestic\nspending and the exchange rate, this common principle is straightforward. But if the\ncross-border spillovers of reductions in the balance sheet and increases in the policy rate\nare not equivalent, the sequencing of policy rate and balance sheet normalization could\nhave important implications for the exchange rate and external balance.\n10 This simulation is shown in figure 2 in the appendix.\n\n- 10 -\nFinally, in circumstances where a major central bank is continuing to expand its\nbalance sheet or maintaining a large balance sheet over a sustained period, this policy\nwould likely exert downward pressure on term premiums around the globe, especially in\nthose foreign economies whose bonds were perceived as close substitutes. Indeed, until\nvery recently, it had been notable how little long yields moved up in the United States\neven as discussions of balance sheet normalization have moved to the forefront. This\nlikely reflects at least in part the expectation that ongoing asset purchase programs in\nother advanced economies would continue holding down long-term yields globally. The\ntide seems to have turned in recent weeks, as long yields in the U.S. have increased\nnotably on market perceptions that foreign officials are beginning to deliberate their own\nnormalization strategies.\nI have used a simple stylized model to illustrate circumstances in which the\nchoice of normalization strategies adopted by major central banks can potentially be quite\nconsequential. If anything, the analysis presented here serves to highlight the importance\nof research assessing this question from both an empirical and theoretical perspective.\nLet me conclude by returning to the policy choices facing central banks. The\nFederal Reserve chose to remove accommodation initially through increases in the\nfederal funds rate. In light of recent policy moves, I consider normalization of the federal\nfunds rate to be well under way. If the data continue to confirm a strong labor market\nand firming economic activity, I believe it would be appropriate relatively soon to\ncommence the gradual and predictable process of allowing the balance sheet to run off.\nOnce that process begins, I will want to assess the inflation process closely before\nmaking a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate in light of the\n\n- 11 -\nrecent softness in core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation. In my view,\nthe neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain close to zero in real terms\nover the medium term. If that is the case, we would not have much more additional work\nto do on moving to a neutral stance. I will want to monitor inflation developments\ncarefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to\nhelp guide inflation back up around our symmetric target.\nMeanwhile, in recent days, we have begun to hear acknowledgement from other\nmajor central banks that they too are seeing conditions that suggest policy normalization\ncould be on the table before too long, against the backdrop of a brighter global outlook.\nAs I just discussed, the pace and timing of how central banks around the world proceed\nwith normalization, and the importance of balance sheet policy relative to changes in\nshort term rates in these normalization plans, could have important implications for\nexchange rates and financial conditions globally.\n\n- 12 -\nAppendix: Description of Stylized Model and Simulation Results\nA. Model Description\nThe model is a stylized open economy model that includes two symmetric\ncountries linked through trade flows. The model is specified in real terms under the\nimplicit assumption that inflation is constant (so that real and nominal variables move by\nthe same amount). Moreover, the model abstracts from any financial linkages between\nthe two economies, including the possibility that monetary policy actions in one country\ncould directly affect yields in the other (e.g., through portfolio balance channels), though\nsuch effects are clearly important empirically.\nThe two countries include a “Home” (H) county and a “Foreign” (F) country of\nequal size. Variables in the foreign country are denoted with an asterisk. In each\ncountry, the national accounting identity specifies that output, y, is equal to the sum of\nabsorption d and net exports nx, that is:\ny = d +nx,\ny∗ = d∗ −nx,\nwhere the second equation incorporates the global resource constraint that nx + nx* = 0.\nHere output (y) and absorption (d) are expressed in percent deviation from their\nrespective steady states, while net exports are expressed as share of output, and are equal\nto zero in the steady state (that is, prior to any shocks).\n\n- 13 -\nHome and foreign absorption depend on long–term interest rates according to the\nfollowing expressions:\n( )\nd = −σrc+ru +u,\n( )\nd∗ = −σrc∗ +ru∗ +u∗,\nHere rc is the component of long–term interest rates that is driven by\nconventional monetary policy, ru is the component of long–term interest rates that is\ndriven by unconventional monetary policy, and u is an exogenous aggregate demand\nshock (with autocorrelation given by ρ). These interest rate components are assumed to\nhave identical effects on aggregate demand, with the parameter σ determining the\nsensitivity of aggregate demand to either component (n..b., interest rates are expressed in\npercentage points deviation from the steady state).\nNet exports are assumed to fall if the real exchange rate (e) rises/appreciates, and\nalso if domestic demand is higher relative to foreign demand (since this boost imports).\nThus:\n( )\nnx=−ηe−αd −d∗\nwhere η is the elasticity of net exports with respect to the exchange rate, and α is the\nelasticity of net exports to the differential between home and foreign absorption. The real\nexchange rate is expressed in percent deviation from the steady state.\nThe exchange rate is determined according to an interest rate parity condition\nwhich implies that the exchange rate appreciates when domestic interest rates are higher\n\n- 14 -\nthan foreign interest rates, with elasticities ( φ and φ ) that can differ depending on\nc u\nwhether interest rate movements are driven by conventional or unconventional policy:\n( ) ( )\ne =φ rc−rc∗ +φ ru−ru∗ .\nc u\nThe model is closed by specifying the behavior of the monetary authority. We\nassume that the monetary authority can adjust either the interest rate associated with\nconventional policy (rc), or the interest rate linked to balance sheet actions (ru), or both,\nto affect output (its goal variable). The conventional feedback rule is thus:\nrc =γ y,\nc\nrc∗ =γ∗y∗,\nc\nwhereas the unconventional feedback rule is:\nru =γ y\nu\nru∗ =γ∗y∗.\nu\nThe system above contains 10 equations in 10 endogenous variables (y, y*, d, d*,\nnx, e, rc, rc*, ru, ru*), as well two shocks, u and u*, that can move GDP, its components,\nexchange rates\nB. Simulation Results\nFigures 1 and 2 show the results of simulating the model under alternative\nassumptions about the shocks and monetary policy reaction. In each case, the economy\nstarts in steady state with all variables at zero and experiences a demand shock in period\n1 that dies out with an autocorrelation ρ of 0.95. All parameter values are reported in\nTable 1.\n\n- 15 -\nFigure 1. Home Demand Shock\nFigure 1 illustrates the case of a favorable demand shock in the home country.\nThe solid lines illustrate the case when Home uses the short-term interest rate as its active\npolicy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, consistent with a desire to delay balance\nsheet normalization.\nThe policy reaction is calibrated to be sufficiently aggressive that home GDP\nalways remains at baseline (see column 2 of Table 1). The higher policy rate path (that\nis, higher rc) causes the long-term interest rate (panel A) to rise, which in turn induces the\nreal exchange rate to appreciate (panel B). The stronger currency and an expansion in\ndomestic absorption (panel C) causes a deterioration in net exports (panel D). At the end\nof the period shown, domestic demand has nearly returned to baseline, while net exports\nare just a bit below baseline--consistent with Home country’s GDP remaining at baseline\n(panel E). Because foreign monetary policy rates is assumed to remain on hold, foreign\nGDP (panel F) rises by the improvement in its net exports (that is, by the mirror image of\npanel D, given that foreign domestic absorption is unchanged).\nThe dashed lines illustrate the case of a favorable demand shock in the Home\ncountry when the central bank opts to tighten exclusively through reducing its balance\nsheet (again, by enough to keep output at potential--see column 3 of Table 1). Long-term\ninterest rates (panel A) rise in response, but the exchange rate appreciates less in this case\n(panel B), reflecting the lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to unconventional\nmonetary policy actions (φ < φ ). Net exports decline (panel D) by less--reflecting both\nu c\nthe smaller exchange rate appreciation and a smaller rise in absorption (panel C)--which\ntranslates into less of a boost to foreign GDP (panel F) than when the home country\nadjusts through conventional policy.\n\n- 16 -\nFigure 2. Common Demand Shock, Asymmetric Policy Tightening across Countries\nFigure 2 shows a simulation in which the demand shock is assumed to be\ncommon across countries ( u = u* ). The home country is assumed to pursue a policy of\nactively adjusting its policy rate, while the foreign Country is assumed to rely exclusively\non normalizing through the balance sheet. In each case, the central banks of the two\ncountries tighten policy aggressively enough to keep output at potential (see the\nparameter settings in column 4 of Table 1).\nAs policy rates rise in the home country (panel A) and the exchange rate is more\nsensitive to policy rates than to the balance sheet, the home country's exchange rate\n(panel B) appreciates, while its net exports (panel D) decline. Although GDP remains at\nbaseline in each country (panels E and F) given our assumption that monetary policy\nkeeps output at potential (which is unchanged), the alternative policy normalization\nchoices clearly have important effects--even under a common shock--on both exchange\nrates and the composition of demand in each country. In particular, because exchange\nrates in the foreign country are less sensitive to balance sheet than to interest rate policy,\nthe foreign central bank must enact a relatively larger interest rate tightening in order to\nkeep its GDP at potential.\n\n- 17 -\nTable 1: Parameter Values\n\n- 18 -\n\n- 19 -\n\n- 20 -\nReferences\nAlon, Titan, and Eric Swanson (2011). “Operation Twist and the Effect of Large-Scale\nAsset Purchases,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2011-13.

This benign outlook is clouded somewhat by\nuncertainty about government funding and the fiscal outlook, and geostrategic risk has\nrisen. While the heartbreaking human toll exacted by Hurricane Harvey is already all too\nclear, it will take some time to assess the macroeconomic impact.\nThe labor market continues to bring more Americans off the sidelines and into\nproductive employment, which is a very welcome development. Nonetheless, there is a\nnotable disconnect between signs that the economy is in the neighborhood of full\nemployment and a string of lower-than-projected inflation readings, especially since\ninflation has come in stubbornly below target for five years. With normalization of the\nfederal funds rate under way and the start of gradual balance sheet normalization widely\nanticipated, I will want to take some time to assess the path of the federal funds rate that\nwill best support a sustainable move in inflation to our 2 percent goal.1 Sustainably\nachieving our inflation objective is especially important, given the apparent persistently\nlow level of the neutral rate and the resulting limited room for maneuver above the\neffective lower bound.\nLet me start by reviewing the economic outlook. There has been a noteworthy\npickup in business investment this year compared with last year. Investment in the\nequipment and intellectual property category has risen at an annual rate of 6 percent so\nfar this year after remaining roughly flat last year. The latest data on orders and\n1 I am grateful to John Roberts for his assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my own\nviews, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\n- 2 -\nshipments of capital equipment suggest that solid growth will likely continue in the\nsecond half of the year. In addition, oil drilling had rebounded this year after dropping\nsharply last year, although Hurricane Harvey creates uncertainty about drilling in coming\nmonths. While lackluster consumer spending was one of the key reasons for the weak\nincrease in first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), growth in personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) bounced back strongly in the second quarter, and recent readings on\nretail sales suggest another solid increase in consumer spending this quarter.\nOf course, the likely economic effects of Hurricane Harvey raise uncertainties\nabout the economic outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on past experience, it\nappears likely that the hurricane will have a notable effect on GDP in the current quarter,\nalthough output is likely to rebound by the end of the year. According to the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy, between 20 and 30 percent of the nation’s oil refining capacity\nwas shut down at the peak last week, and it is estimated that about 50 percent of\npetrochemical production was similarly shut down. Some oil production has also been\ndisrupted. These developments have put upward pressure on gasoline prices. Based on\nprevious hurricane events, the increase in gasoline prices should be short lived, but this\noutcome is uncertain and will depend on the extent of damage to refining capacity.\nImprovements in the labor market have continued. According to last Friday’s\nlabor market report, nonfarm payrolls have increased around 185,000 per month over the\nthree months through August, about the same as the average monthly gains last year. The\nunemployment rate has been roughly flat for the past several months at 4.4 percent,\nwhich is 1/2 percentage point lower than at the same time last year. The employment-to-\n\n- 3 -\npopulation ratio for prime-age workers has also improved over the past year, although it\nis still 2 percentage points lower than its pre-crisis peak in 2007.\nEarlier this year, many observers saw the prospect of fiscal stimulus as presenting\nthe possibility of a substantial boost to domestic demand. Since then, however, many\ncommentators have downgraded their assessments of the extent and timing of fiscal\nstimulus, and I have revised my outlook as well.\nThat said, we are seeing synchronized global economic growth for the first time in\nmany years. Foreign economies--including Canada, the euro area, and China--have\nposted robust GDP growth so far this year. This improvement has been reflected here at\nhome in dollar depreciation; higher earnings and stock prices; tighter risk spreads; and an\nincrease in net exports, which made a small positive contribution in the first half of this\nyear after holding down GDP growth over the past several years. In addition, there are\nindications that, before too long, central banks in several major economies could begin\nnormalizing monetary policy, in many cases through adjustments to their balance sheets\nas well as their policy rates. Those changes in foreign monetary policies could have\nimportant implications for term premiums and, in turn, longer-term Treasury rates,\ndepending on the timing and approach.2\nDespite this benign picture for the U.S. economy and continued increases in\nresource utilization, core inflation, as measured by changes in the PCE price index for\nitems other than food and energy, slowed by almost 1/2 percentage point relative to the\npace a year ago. Indeed, both overall and core inflation were only 1.4 percent for the\n2 See Brainard (2017) for a fuller discussion of this topic.\n\n- 4 -\nyear through July, well short of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC)\nobjective.\nTo what extent does it make sense to look through the recent low inflation\nreadings on the grounds they are transitory? It appears that temporary factors, such as\ndiscounted cell phone plans, are pushing down inflation to some extent this year. By the\nsame token, it is likely that other temporary factors--for example, prescription drug\nprices--boosted inflation last year. Going forward, we should see a temporary boost to\nheadline inflation due to Hurricane Harvey’s effect on gasoline prices that I mentioned\nearlier. Temporary factors, by their nature, have little implication for the underlying\ntrend in inflation.\nIn contrast, what is troubling is five straight years in which inflation fell short of\nour target despite a sharp improvement in resource utilization. It is instructive to put the\nshortfall in inflation in recent years in perspective by comparing inflation in the past few\nyears with the last time the economy was in the neighborhood of full employment--\nnamely, just before the financial crisis. In particular, over the past three years,\nunemployment has averaged roughly 5 percent. Similarly, over the three years ending in\nearly 2007--before the unemployment rate started rising--the unemployment rate also\naveraged 5 percent. Despite a similar degree of resource utilization, core inflation\naveraged 2.2 percent from 2004 to 2007, notably higher than the comparable three-year\naverage inflation rate today of 1.5 percent. Why is inflation so much lower now than it\nwas previously? The fact that the period from 2004 to 2007 had inflation around target\nwith similar unemployment rates casts some doubt on the likelihood that resource\n\n- 5 -\nutilization is the primary explanation.3 Similarly, a 12-quarter average is typically long\nenough that temporary factors should not be the dominant concern.\nOne key factor that may have played a role in the past three years is the decline in\nimport prices, reflecting the dollar’s surge, especially in 2015. By contrast, in the\n2004-07 period, non-oil import prices increased at roughly a 2 percent annual rate and\nhad a more neutral effect on inflation. Nonetheless, while the decline in non-oil import\nprices likely accounts for some of the weakness in inflation over the past few years, these\nprices have begun rising again in the past year at a time when inflation remains relatively\nlow.\nSo if import prices, resource utilization, and transitory factors together do not\nprovide a complete account, why has inflation been so much lower in the past few years\nthan it was previously? In many of the models economists use to analyze inflation, a key\nfeature is “underlying,” or trend, inflation, which is believed to anchor the rate of\ninflation over a fairly long horizon. Underlying inflation can be thought of as the slow-\nmoving trend that exerts a strong pull on wage and price setting and is often viewed as\nrelated to some notion of longer-run inflation expectations.\nThere is no single highly reliable measure of that underlying trend or the closely\nassociated notion of longer-run inflation expectations. Nonetheless, a variety of\nmeasures suggest underlying trend inflation may currently be lower than it was before the\ncrisis, contributing to the ongoing shortfall of inflation from our objective. That\nconclusion is suggested by estimates based on time-series models, longer-run\n3 According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the natural rate of unemployment was about the\nsame in the two periods: It was 4.8 percent in the 2014-17 period and 5.0 percent a decade earlier.\n\n- 6 -\nexpectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters, and market-based measures of inflation compensation.\nStarting with time-series models, one model that has been used by a variety of\nresearchers suggests that underlying trend inflation may have moved down by perhaps as\nmuch as 1/2 percentage point over the past decade.4 Market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation provide another read on inflation expectations. Comparing the three-year\nperiod ending in the second quarter of this year with the three-year period ended just\nbefore the financial crisis, 10-year-ahead inflation compensation based on TIPS\n(Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) yields is 3/4 percentage point lower.5 Survey-\nbased measures of inflation expectations are also lower. The Michigan survey measure\nof median household expectations of inflation over the next five to 10 years suggests a\n1/4 percentage point downward shift over the most recent three-year period compared\nwith the pre-crisis years, similar to the five-year, five-year forward forecast for the\nconsumer price index from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.\nWhy might underlying inflation expectations have moved down since the\nfinancial crisis? One simple explanation may be the experience of persistently low\ninflation: Households and firms have experienced a prolonged period of inflation below\nour objective, and that may be affecting their perception of underlying inflation. A\nrelated explanation may be the greater proximity of the federal funds rate to its effective\nlower bound due to a lower neutral rate of interest.6 By constraining the amount of\n4 Stock and Watson (2007) introduced an estimate of trend inflation that assumed time-varying volatility.\nCecchetti and others (2017) provided a recent update of that model; their estimate of trend inflation for core\nPCE prices has been about 1-1/2 percent in the past few years, compared with readings above 2 percent in\nthe 2006-08 period (see figure 4.1, p. 23).\n5 Of course, inflation compensation isn’t a straight read on inflation expectations, as liquidity and term\npremiums can affect it. Still, inflation suggests a notable downward shift in expectations.\n6 See Brainard (2016) for a fuller discussion of this topic.\n\n- 7 -\npolicy space available to offset adverse developments using our more effective\nconventional tools, the low neutral rate could increase the likely frequency of periods of\nbelow-trend inflation. In short, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk\nof pulling down private-sector inflation expectations.7\nGiven today’s circumstances, with the economy near full employment and\ninflation below target, how should the FOMC achieve its dual-mandate goals? Some\nmight determine that preemptive tightening is appropriate on the grounds that monetary\npolicy operates with long lags, and inflation will inevitably accelerate as the labor market\ncontinues to tighten because of the Phillips curve. However, in today’s economy, there\nare reasons to worry that the Phillips curve will not prove very reliable in boosting\ninflation as resource utilization tightens. Since 2012, inflation has tended to change\nrelatively little as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, from 8.2 percent to 4.4\npercent.8 In short, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously.9\nThis is also apparent in a number of advanced foreign economies, where declines in their\nunemployment rates to relatively low levels have failed to generate significant upward\npressures on inflation.10 Given the flatness of the Phillips curve, it could take a\nconsiderable undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to achieve our inflation\nobjective if we were to rely on resource utilization alone.\nFor all these reasons, achieving our inflation target on a sustainable basis is likely\nto require a firming in longer-run inflation expectations--that is, the underlying trend.\n7 See, for example, Kiley and Roberts (2017) and Nakata and Schmidt (2016).\n8 The inflation information refers to core PCE inflation measured on a 12-month average basis.\n9 Similarly, inflation did not fall very much as the unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent during the\nGreat Recession. See Blanchard (2016), Kiley (2015), and Brainard (2015).\n10 See IMF (2013).\n\n- 8 -\nThe key question in my mind is how to achieve an improvement in longer-run inflation\nexpectations to a level that will allow us to achieve our inflation objective. The persistent\nfailure to meet our inflation objective should push us to think broadly about diagnoses\nand solutions.\nThe academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for\npreventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation\nexpectations.11 One feature that is common to many proposals is that the persistence of\nthe shortfall in inflation from our objective should be one of the considerations in setting\nmonetary policy. Most immediately, we should assess inflation developments closely\nbefore making a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate.\nMonetary Policy\nThis brings me to the implications for monetary policy. A key upcoming decision\nfor the Committee is when to commence balance sheet normalization. I consider\nnormalization of the federal funds rate to be well under way, the criterion for\ncommencing balance sheet normalization. The approaching change to our reinvestment\npolicy has been clearly communicated and is well anticipated.\nIn principle, the FOMC could use both the balance sheet and the federal funds\nrate as active tools for setting monetary policy. However, I view the federal funds rate as\nthe preferred active tool, because its effect on financial conditions and the economy has\nbeen more extensively tested and therefore is better understood than changes to the\nbalance sheet. As a result, once we set in motion the change in balance sheet policy, as\nlong as the economy evolves broadly as expected, we should allow the balance sheet to\n11 See, for example, Kiley and Roberts (2017).\n\n- 9 -\nrun off in the background at the gradual pace that was announced. We would primarily\nlook to ongoing adjustments in the federal funds rate to calibrate the stance of monetary\npolicy as economic conditions evolve.\nOnce balance sheet normalization is under way, I will be looking closely at the\nevolution of inflation before making a determination about further adjustments to the\nfederal funds rate. We have been falling short of our inflation objective not just in the\npast year, but over a longer period as well. My own view is that we should be cautious\nabout tightening policy further until we are confident inflation is on track to achieve our\ntarget.\nUnless we expect inflation to move quickly back toward target--or there are\nindications that the short-run neutral rate has moved up further--a variety of empirical\nestimates suggest we could approach neutral without too many additional rate increases.\nMany forecasters assume that the neutral rate of interest is very low currently, and that it\nis likely to be low relative to historical norms in the longer run.12 For example, the well-\nknown Laubach-Williams model currently suggests an estimate of the longer-run neutral\nfederal funds rate that is actually slightly below zero.13 And in the most recent Summary\nof Economic Projections (SEP), the median longer-run nominal federal funds rate was\n3 percent, which implies the long-run real federal funds rate would only be 1 percent,\nlower than its average in the decades before then of around 2½ percent.14\n12 See, for example, the July 2017 Survey of Market Participants from the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork (https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey/2017/jul-2017-smp-results.pdf).\n13 Latest estimates from the Laubach-Williams model are available at http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/files/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.\n14 Over the 1960-2007 period, the real federal funds rate--measured as the nominal federal funds rate less\ntrailing four-quarter core PCE inflation--averaged 2-1/2 percent.\n\n- 10 -\nThese estimates suggest that the neutral rate of interest is likely to rise only\nmodestly in the medium term. It is worth remembering, in addition, that the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet policy may be reinforcing this tendency over the next several\nyears. A recent study suggests balance sheet runoff could boost the level of the term\npremium on the 10-year Treasury yield by about 40 basis points over the first few years.15\nTypical rules of thumb suggest that such an increase in term premiums would imply a\ndecrease in the short-run neutral rate of interest.\nAlthough the FOMC expects to begin normalizing its balance sheet relatively\nsoon, several foreign central banks are continuing their purchases of longer-term assets in\ntheir own currencies.16 Because longer-term government securities in the major\neconomies are close substitutes, the ongoing balance sheet programs of some foreign\ncentral banks will likely continue to hold down U.S. longer-term interest rates. But with\neconomies abroad strengthening, it may not be too long before some foreign central\nbanks will end their net purchases and, eventually, begin reducing their balance sheets.\nAs that happens, the current downward pressure on longer-term interest rates from\nforeign spillovers will abate.\nFor these reasons, my current expectation is that the short-run neutral rate of\ninterest may not rise much over the medium term. But this is an open question and bears\nclose monitoring. Of course, it is entirely possible that other factors will be working to\noffset this downward pressure on the equilibrium funds rate--as could be the case, for\ninstance, if fiscal stimulus is greater than many observers currently expect.\n15 Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei (2017).\n16 For more information, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “Federal Reserve\nIssues FOMC statement,” press release, July 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170726a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nTo the extent that the neutral rate remains low relative to its historical value, there\nis a high premium on guiding inflation back up to target so as to retain space to buffer\nadverse shocks with conventional policy. In this regard, I believe it is important to be\nclear that we would be comfortable with inflation moving modestly above our target for a\ntime. In my view, this is the clear implication of the symmetric language in the\nCommittee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\nBefore concluding, it is worth considering the possible implications of a sustained\nperiod of low neutral rates and low unemployment for financial imbalances. Historically,\nextended periods with very low unemployment rates tend to be associated with below-\naverage spreads of expected returns on risky assets over safe interest rates--low bond risk\npremiums, for example, or low equity premiums. Although, to some extent, low risk\npremiums and rising asset valuations may be consistent with strong economic\nfundamentals, such as low default rates and strong corporate earnings, there have also\nbeen episodes when a very strong economy and low unemployment rate have led to\novervaluation of asset prices, underpricing of risk, and growing financial imbalances.\nThus, in today’s environment, it is important to be vigilant to the signs that asset\nvaluations appear to be elevated, especially in areas such as commercial real estate and\ncorporate bonds, as well as the exceptionally low levels of expected volatility.\nNonetheless, there are few signs of a dangerous buildup of leverage or of maturity\ntransformation, which have traditionally been important contributors to financial\ninstability. This is due, in no small measure, to the improvements in capital, liquidity,\nand risk management made by the financial institutions at the core of the system, which\n\n- 12 -\nare associated with post-crisis financial reforms, as well as money market reform and the\ngreater transparency in the derivatives markets.\nTo conclude, much depends on the evolution of inflation. If, as many forecasters\nassume, the current shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent objective indeed proves\ntransitory, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate would be warranted, perhaps\nalong the lines of the median projection from the most recent SEP. But, as I noted\nearlier, I am concerned that the recent low readings for inflation may be driven by\ndepressed underlying inflation, which would imply a more persistent shortfall in inflation\nfrom our objective. In that case, it would be prudent to raise the federal funds rate more\ngradually. We should have substantially more data in hand in the coming months that\nwill help us make that assessment.\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nBlanchard, Olivier (2016). “The U.S. Phillips Curve: Back to the 60s?” Policy Brief\nPB16-1.

Today, financial stability is more important than ever to the work of the Federal\nReserve Board. With the lessons from the crisis still fresh, we are in the process of\nstrengthening our financial stability capabilities.1\nIn carrying out the work of financial stability, the Federal Reserve is seen as the\nagency with the broadest sight lines across the economy and one that has some important\nstability tools, as well as a critical first responder when a crisis hits. But the Federal\nReserve also faces limitations as a financial stability authority: It is predominantly a\nsupervisor of banks and bank holding companies2 in a system with large capital markets,\nseveral independent agencies have responsibilities for regulation of nonbank financial\nintermediaries and markets, and no U.S. agency yet has access to complete data regarding\nbank and nonbank financial activities.\nRecognizing these limitations, the Federal Reserve is likely to actively utilize the\ntools under its authority, which means placing a strong emphasis on structural resilience\nin the largest and most complex institutions, while strengthening less tested time-varying\ntools to lean against the buildup of risks and, in some circumstances, looking to the\nunique capacity of monetary policy to act across the financial system. It will also need to\ncooperate closely with other regulators to develop well-rehearsed working protocols and\n1 See Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “A Century of U.S. Central Banking: Goals, Frameworks, Accountability,”\nspeech delivered at “The First 100 Years of the Federal Reserve: The Policy Record, Lessons Learned, and\nProspects for the Future,” a conference sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research,\nCambridge, Mass., July 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130710a.htm.\n2 More precisely, it is predominantly a supervisor of depository institutions and depository institution\nholding companies.\n\n- 2 -\na joint sense of responsibility for financial stability, while respecting that each\nindependent agency has its own specific statutory mandate and governing body.\nFinancial Stability Agenda\nIn the wake of the financial crisis, the Congress and the Federal Reserve itself\nbecame more deliberate and explicit about the responsibility for safeguarding the stability\nof the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, charged the Federal\nReserve with specific authorities for the purposes of safeguarding financial stability. At\nthe Federal Reserve, we created the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research to\nstrengthen our cross-disciplinary approach to the identification and analysis of potential\nrisks to the financial system and the broader economy and to support macroprudential\nsupervision of large financial institutions and, following its creation, participation on the\nFinancial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). This work is carried out by staff in that\noffice as well as in many areas across the Board and is overseen by the Board’s newly\ncreated Committee on Financial Stability. This work is proceeding in four pillars, which\nare in varying stages of advancement.\nFirst pillar: Surveillance\nThe first pillar is surveillance of the possible risks that could threaten financial\nstability. Research and historical case studies suggest that increasing valuation pressures\naccompanied by rising leverage, widening maturity mismatches, and the erosion of\nunderwriting standards often provide important warning signals. Drawing on this\ninformation and other analysis, each quarter Federal Reserve Board staff systematically\nassess a standard set of financial vulnerabilities, including asset valuations and risk\n\n- 3 -\nappetite, leverage, maturity and risk transformation, and interconnectedness in the broad\nfinancial system, and borrowing by households and businesses.\nThe research that informs this work, by helping to identify financial patterns\nlikely to be associated with rising risks of financial crisis, continues to grow. But its\npredictive power is still limited; it remains difficult to identify ahead of time credit booms\nthat are likely to cause severe damage, such as the subprime housing crisis, from those\nthat do not, such as the high-tech boom, in part because risk-taking by financial market\nparticipants cannot always be well-observed.3\nOver time, our and others’ surveillance will benefit as the Office of Financial\nResearch established by the Dodd-Frank Act, makes progress in facilitating the sharing of\npreviously siloed data sets among the independent regulators and as international\nimpediments are overcome, allowing more comprehensive analysis of financial\ntransaction flows across different types of financial intermediaries and activities.\nThis regular, systematic surveillance of financial vulnerabilities is buttressed by\nthree other valuable types of analysis. First, we use the detailed information gathered\nthrough bank examinations and loan reviews that are the regular work of our supervisors\nto assess emerging risky practices; these reviews helped identify deteriorating\nunderwriting standards in the leveraged loan market. Second, we undertake periodic\nanalyses of potential systemwide consequences of possible, particularly salient shocks,\nsuch as a sharp rise in the level or volatility of interest rates, including possible\n3 According to the International Monetary Fund, only about one in three credit booms have historically\nended in some form of financial crisis. See Giovanni Dell’Ariccia, Deniz Igan, Luc Laeven, Hui Tong, Bas\nBakker, and Jérôme Vandenbussche (2012), “Policies for Macrofinancial Stability: How to Deal with\nCredit Booms,” IMF Staff Discussion Note Series 12/06 (Washington: International Monetary Fund,\nJune 7), www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=25935.0.\n\n- 4 -\nbottlenecks that could impede orderly adjustments. Finally, when there is a close brush\nwith specific risk events, we closely study the behavior of markets and institutions for\ninsights into possible structural vulnerabilities that might be revealed and assess possible\npolicy actions.\nSecond pillar: Macroprudential policy\nThe ultimate objective of our surveillance is to build resilience of firms and\nmarkets and to counter risks early enough to prevent disruptions to financial stability that\ncould damage the real economy. While the macroprudential toolkit is larger than it was\npre-crisis, there is a substantial amount of work remaining to implement some of these\ntools. In particular, as I will discuss in more detail, the ability of the available tools to\ncounteract time-varying risks has yet to be tested in the U.S.\nFirst, the Federal Reserve is well along in promulgating an important system of\nnew, through-the-cycle safeguards that together should deliver much greater structural\nresilience and make excessive risk-taking costly for the large, complex institutions that\npose the greatest risks to the financial system. Second, the Federal Reserve is assessing\nthe kinds of broad time-varying regulatory tools that might further buttress resilience\nduring periods in which risks associated with rapid credit expansion are building. Third,\nthe Federal Reserve is exploring tools that can be varied over the cycle to target specific\nactivities, recognizing that we will have limited authorities relative to some foreign\nfinancial regulators in operating on the borrowing side and outside the regulatory\nperimeter of the banking system. Let’s take each in turn.\nTool One: Structural resilience\nWe are relatively far advanced, and compare favorably to other jurisdictions, in\nimplementing a framework of rules and supervision that compels large, complex financial\n\n- 5 -\ninstitutions to build substantial loss-absorbing buffers and to internalize the costs of\nundertaking activities that pose risks to the system. This framework represents a\nsubstantial improvement on structural resilience relative to the pre-crisis framework\nacross a number of dimensions: It is forward looking in assessing risks under severely\nstressed conditions, and it is explicitly macroprudential in design so that bank\nmanagement internalizes risks not only to the safety and soundness of their own\ninstitution, but also to the system as a whole.\nReforms undertaken in recent years help ensure that institutions that are large,\ninternationally active, and interconnected face significantly higher capital and liquidity\ncharges when undertaking risky activities. The core of the framework is the requirement\nof a very substantial stack of common equity to absorb shocks and to provide incentives\nagainst excessive risk-taking. The new framework imposes “belts and suspenders” on the\ncapital cushion by requiring a simple, non-risk-adjusted ceiling on leverage as well as\nrequiring the largest banking firms to satisfy two sets of risk-based capital requirements:\none derived from internal models and a second based on standardized supervisory risk\nweights. Beyond that, the largest, most complex firms will face an additional common\nequity requirement that reflects the risk they pose to the system and an additional layer of\nloss absorbency on top of that to provide adequate support to operating subsidiaries in\nresolution. Large financial institutions are also required to maintain substantial buffers of\nhigh-quality liquid assets calibrated to their funding needs and to their likely run risk in\nstressed conditions. Similar to the equity cushions, the liquidity buffers are calibrated to\naffect disproportionately those financial institutions that pose the greatest risks.\n\n- 6 -\nRegular stress tests of both capital and liquidity at our largest banking firms\nprovide a key bulwark in the new supervisory architecture.4 Minimum capital\nrequirements must be met under severely adverse macroeconomic conditions and, for the\nvery largest firms, in the face of severe market shocks, including the failure of a firm’s\nlargest counterparty. By providing a forward-looking assessment that takes into account\ncorrelations among risks under stressed conditions, these stress tests on capital and\nliquidity are powerful tools for building resilience in our largest banking firms. But they\nalso have some limitations. For instance, while the severity of the stresses can be varied\nfrom year to year, it is difficult to introduce entirely new scenarios each year to target\nspecific sectoral risks without introducing excessive complexity. And while the new U.S.\nframework requires that capital buffers are calibrated for the riskiness of their assets and\nexposures, the proportion of capital required does not vary systematically to counter the\ncyclicality that arises through elevated asset valuations and other channels.5\n4 The Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, or CLAR, is the Federal Reserve Board’s periodic\nsimultaneous supervisory examination of firms’ liquidity buffers and risk-management policies. We use\nCLAR to analyze and adjust our supervisory program for emerging firm practices and risk areas not\ncaptured in the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). For example, CLAR enables monitoring of firm liquidity\npositions for buildups of concentrations of risk beyond the 30-day threshold. It also allows us to look more\nclosely at risks that may emanate from areas such as intraday credit, which are not captured within the LCR\nbut are captured by firms’ internal stress-testing frameworks.\n5 As the Board laid out in its November 2013 policy statement on the scenario design framework for stress\ntesting, it uses a recession approach to develop the severely adverse scenario of the stress tests. See Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Policy Statement\nfor Developing Scenarios for Future Capital Planning and Street Testing Exercises,” press release,\nNovember 7, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20131107a.htm. The severely adverse\nscenario is anticipated to feature an unemployment rate over the first six to eight quarters of the scenario\nthat increases between 3 percentage points and 5 percentage points, which is the amount by which\nunemployment has increased in the most recent three severe recessions. However, if such an increase does\nnot raise the level of the unemployment rate to at least 10 percent--the average level to which it has\nincreased in the most recent three severe recessions--the path of the unemployment rate in most cases will\nbe specified so as to raise the unemployment rate to at least this level. Under this methodology, the\nincrease in the unemployment rate would be slightly greater if the initial unemployment rate were low--as it\nwould be after a sustained long expansion. Moreover, setting a floor for the unemployment rate recognizes\nthe fact that not only do cyclical systemic risks build up at financial intermediaries during robust\nexpansions, but that these risks are also easily obscured by the buoyant environment. Note, however, that\nwhile the approach to specifying the severely adverse scenario is designed to avoid adding sources of\n\n- 7 -\nTool two: Time-varying broad macroprudential tools\nWhile our efforts are far advanced in building structural resilience, progress is\nless advanced in developing time-varying tools that counter the buildup of excesses\nacross the system broadly or in a particular financial sector. These efforts are in earlier\nstages of elaboration and more of a departure from recent practice. Here we can learn\nfrom financial authorities in other countries that have recent experience deploying a\nbroader array of macroprudential tools.\nThe classic case for time-varying broad macroprudential tools is to lean against a\ndangerous acceleration of credit growth at a time when the degree of monetary tightening\nthat would be needed to slow it down would be highly inconsistent with conditions in the\nreal economy. The Basel Committee agreed on a common countercyclical capital buffer\nframework for addressing such circumstances, and the Federal Reserve and the other U.S.\nbanking agencies issued a final rule to implement the Basel 3 countercyclical capital\nbuffer for U.S. banking firms in 2013. Under the rule, starting in 2016 and phasing in\nthrough 2019, the U.S. banking agencies could require the largest, most complex U.S.\nbanking firms to hold additional capital in amounts up to 2.5 percent of their risk-\nweighted assets if the agencies determine it is warranted by rising risks. We are currently\nconsidering how best to implement the countercyclical capital buffer. The existing\nresearch would suggest that indicators related to debt growth, leverage, and other signs of\ngrowing financial imbalances would provide guidance on when to implement the buffer\nand when to deactivate it.\nprocyclicality to the financial system, it is not designed to explicitly offset any existing procyclical\ntendencies. The purpose of the stress-test scenarios is to make sure that banks are properly capitalized to\nwithstand severe economic and financial conditions, not to serve as an explicit countercyclical offset to the\nfinancial system.\n\n- 8 -\nThe countercyclical capital buffer may enhance financial stability by building\nadditional resilience at systemic banking institutions near the height of the credit cycle.\nHowever, it may prove to be less effective in leaning against credit growth, since, as\ncredit booms progress, there is greater potential for capital to be relatively cheap, asset\nvaluations to be inflated, and risk weights to be incorrect. Moreover the countercyclical\ncapital buffer has some practical limitations: It applies to a subset of the U.S. banking\nsystem and is designed to act with a one-year lag. It also cannot be used efficiently to\ntarget specific asset classes that appear frothy, a challenge I turn to next.\nTool three: Time-varying sector-specific tools\nThe countercyclical buffer may be a relatively blunt tool for circumstances where\nthe buildup of risk is highly concentrated in a particular sector. This was, of course, the\nchallenge U.S. policymakers faced early in the recent housing bubble, with home prices\nrising and capital markets developing the complicated, opaque securities built on\nsubprime mortgages that would ultimately cause damage throughout the financial system.\nIndeed, property booms are perhaps the most common macroprudential challenge that\nhave confronted financial authorities in advanced economies over the years, although\nmacroprudential challenges have also surfaced in other sectors, such as the corporate\nlending boom that confronted Korea in the mid-to-late 1990s.\nIn addition to time-varying broad macroprudential tools, such as countercyclical\ncapital buffers and dynamic provisioning, many financial authorities have the authority to\npromulgate rules that target activity in a specific sector. For instance, Swiss authorities\nactivated, in early 2013, a countercyclical capital buffer that added 1 percentage point of\ncapital requirement for direct and indirect mortgage-backed positions secured by Swiss\nresidential property, and then increased this amount in 2014 to 2 percentage points.\n\n- 9 -\nTime-varying lending-side tools\nIn the United States, there is a more limited set of authorities the Federal Reserve\ncould exercise either on its own or jointly with the other banking agencies to address\nsector-specific risks. Most commonly, as we have seen with leveraged lending, the\nbanking regulators acting together can use the tools of supervisory guidance and intensive\nsupervision to discourage banks from taking on additional risk on safety and soundness\ngrounds. Moreover, the annual supervisory stress tests can be tailored to increase the\nseverity of losses in specific portfolios of loans or the market shock. However, these\nauthorities fall short of direct restrictions on activities in a particular sector. Such\nsupervisory actions usually flow from microprudential concerns about the safety and\nsoundness of individual institutions rather than macroprudential concerns about the\nstability of the entire system. By contrast, section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act provides\nthat the Federal Reserve could restrict the activities of banks with assets greater than $50\nbillion or nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) designated by the\nFSOC “to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States,” thus\nproviding potential macroprudential authority.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has authority under the Securities and Exchange\nAct of 1934 to set initial and variation margin requirements for repurchase agreements\nand securities financing transactions, which applies across the financial system. This\nauthority was used to curb perceived excesses in the equity markets through the mid-\n1970s with what was seen as limited success, and it has not been used in such a manner\nsince. There is some interest in exploring whether imposing minimum margin\nrequirements on additional forms of securities credit could prevent margins from\ncompressing during booms and likewise help mitigate destabilizing procyclical margin\n\n- 10 -\nincreases at times of stress, reducing the associated “fire sales” in short-term wholesale\nfunding markets.\nConsideration of the utility of these authorities is in preliminary phases. It is\nbeing undertaken as part of a broad review of macroprudential authorities and not with\nregard to developments in any particular sector.\nTime-varying borrower-side tools\nFor purposes of comparison, it is instructive to focus on how central banks in\nseveral advanced economies have dealt with housing booms in recent years.6 Financial\nauthorities in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, and New Zealand have recently\nconfronted rapidly rising residential housing prices in macroeconomic environments\nwhere there were compelling reasons not to use the policy rate as the first line of defense.\nThey responded by imposing strictures on borrowers, through loan-to-value or debt-to-\nincome limits, in some cases in concert with disincentives to lenders, and in many cases\nin an escalating pattern. Indeed, restrictions on borrowing are among the most commonly\nemployed macroprudential tools and, according to some research, among the most\neffective in stemming the buildup of borrowing.7\nThis is not a problem we face today. If anything, the most pressing problem\ncurrently facing housing authorities in the United States is to restore vitality to the single-\nfamily housing market, where construction activity remains puzzlingly weak. However,\n6 As shown by Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert (2013), the United States had an active macroprudential\npolicy that included frequent use of borrower restrictions until 1980; however, the use of borrower\nrestrictions, and the underlying legal authorities, have diminished significantly since then. See Douglas J.\nElliott, Greg Feldberg, and Andreas Lehnert (2013), “The History of Cyclical Macroprudential Policy in\nthe United States,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-29 (Washington: Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, May), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201329/201329abs.html.\n7 See Stijn Claessens, Swati R. Ghosh, and Roxana Mihet (2014), “Macro-Prudential Policies to Mitigate\nFinancial System Vulnerabilities,” IMF Working Paper Series 14/155 (Washington: International\nMonetary Fund, August), www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41851.\n\n- 11 -\nif, in the future, a mortgage-credit fueled house price bubble were to reemerge, the\nbanking regulators could perhaps impose higher risk weights on mortgage loans with\ncertain characteristics either directly or through expectations around stress testing.8 This\napproach would be slow, perhaps requiring upwards of a year to adjust, and narrow in its\nscope of application, and it may prove ineffective at times when bank regulatory capital\ncomfortably exceeds the required thresholds.\nThird pillar: Working across the regulatory perimeter\nIn some cases, foreign central banks acted in concert with other financial\nauthorities to address the buildup of risk in their housing sectors. In the American\ncontext, the Federal Reserve’s work is embedded in a larger web of efforts by other\nfinancial authorities. In parallel to the Federal Reserve’s own efforts to formalize its\nfinancial stability surveillance and policy making, the network of independent financial\nagencies is enhancing cooperation through the formal structure and responsibilities of the\nFSOC as well as through joint rulemakings and joint supervisory efforts.9\nIt is vitally important that the bank and market regulators actively work to share\nassessments of risks across the financial system and to develop joint macroprudential\nefforts to address risks that stretch across regulatory perimeters. Realistically, however,\n8 The Federal Reserve Board and five other federal agencies approved risk-retention rules in October 2014\ndesigned to ensure that securitization sponsors have an incentive to monitor and ensure the quality of the\nsecuritized assets underlying a securitization transaction. Sponsors of securities collateralized solely by\n“qualified residential mortgages,” or QRMs, as defined by the agencies, are not required to hold credit risk\nin their securitizations. The QRM definition rests, in part, on the debt service-to-income of the mortgage\nborrower, but it does not include loan-to-value ratios. The agencies have committed to review the QRM\ndefinition at five-year intervals, or earlier at the request of any agency, in order to ensure that the definition\nremains appropriate as mortgage and securitization market conditions and practices change. Altering the\nQRM definition more frequently would likely be cumbersome and time-consuming.\n9 A parallel evolution is also under way internationally across the major financial jurisdictions and the\ninternational standard-setting bodies under the umbrella of the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\n- 12 -\nthose efforts are in early stages and must respect differences of mission and mandate,\nauthority, and governance structures.\nAs an example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has authority\nto adjust the definition of qualifying mortgages (QM), which affects mortgage credit at\nall lenders, whether inside or outside the banking regulatory perimeter. It is worth\nnoting, however, that the CFPB operates primarily under a consumer protection mandate.\nWhile the ultimate consequences of a mortgage credit boom have, in the past, proved\nvery costly for families, the danger to consumers in the initial stages of such a boom may\nbe too unclear to warrant timely action.\nFourth pillar: Monetary policy\nRecognition of the limits to the macroprudential framework brings us to a\nconsideration of monetary policy—a powerful tool with broad reach, but also relatively\nblunt.10 Monetary policy is the only tool available to the Federal Reserve that has far-\nreaching effects on private credit creation across the entire financial system and one of\nthe few tools that can be changed rapidly (although its effects have famously long and\nvariable lags).\nWhile recognizing the far-reaching effects of monetary policy on financial\nconditions, there are good reasons to view monetary policy as the second line of defense.\nIt is better viewed as a complement to rather than an alternative to macroprudential tools.\nIn many circumstances, standard monetary policy and financial stability considerations\nwill reinforce one another.\n10 See Janet L. Yellen (2014), “Monetary Policy and Financial Stability,” speech delivered at “2014 Michel\nCamdessus Central Banking Lecture,” a lecture series sponsored by the International Monetary Fund,\nWashington, July 2, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20140702a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nNevertheless, there may be times when standard monetary policy and financial\nstability considerations conflict. In several recent instances, foreign economies have\nfaced some tension between high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to the\ncentral bank’s target, on the one hand, and financial stability concerns associated with\nrapidly rising real estate prices on the other. In the United Kingdom, policymakers put in\nplace a range of measures to limit the buildup of risks in the housing market, and, partly\nas a result, the housing market appears to be cooling somewhat. Nonetheless, U.K.\npolicymakers have acknowledged the potential for monetary policy adjustments to play a\nrole in the pursuit of financial stability. The Bank of England’s 2013 forward guidance\nhad a specific financial stability “knockout” for monetary policy accommodation if the\nFinancial Policy Committee (FPC) judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a\nsignificant threat to financial stability that cannot be contained by the substantial range of\nmitigating policy actions available to the FPC.”11\nIf, in the future, the United States did face a similar dilemma, where financial\nimbalances are growing rapidly against a backdrop of subpar economic conditions, the\nFederal Reserve may consider monetary policy for financial stability purposes more\nreadily than some foreign peers because our regulatory perimeter is narrower, the capital\nmarkets are more important, and the macroprudential toolkit is not as extensive. Even in\nthese circumstances, however, it is important to be prudent about the role of monetary\npolicy, recognizing that the necessary adjustments in monetary policy could have broader\nconsequences. For example, a tightening in monetary policy sufficient to limit strong\n11 See Bank of England (2013), “Forward Guidance,” webpage,\nwww.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx, August 7, paragraph 5.\n\n- 14 -\ncredit growth could depress employment and potentially trigger a sharp correction in\nfinancial markets.\nThese limitations should lead us to be circumspect regarding the use of monetary\npolicy as a tool to address financial stability risks, perhaps viewing it as a second line of\ndefense. But it is equally important to acknowledge the potential utility of monetary\npolicy for addressing risks to financial stability and to the broader economy and to\ncontinue expanding our work on the appropriate role of financial stability in our\nmonetary policy framework.\nConclusion\nIn sum, while the Federal Reserve has an inherent responsibility for financial\nstability, it has an incomplete set of authorities and a limited regulatory perimeter in a\nfinancial system that has large capital markets and a fragmented regulatory structure. It\nis therefore important that we actively utilize the tools under our authority—which place\nparticular emphasis on building structural resilience at the largest, most complicated\ninstitutions through tougher through-the-cycle standards, along with broad\ncountercyclical measures to limit the buildup, and potential consequences, of risks to\nfinancial stability, while exploring the design of time-varying sector-specific tools, and,\nat times, looking to monetary policy as a powerful tool that unlike any other operates\nacross the entire financial system.",

The EGRPRA review\nprovides an opportunity for the agencies to consider whether current regulations are well-\nbalanced and effective or whether any are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.\nPublic input is critical to this process and will help us identify potential solutions to\nalleviate undue burden.\nWell-conceived regulations help to ensure the safety and soundness of our\nbanking system, as well as the fair treatment of consumers. But unnecessary regulations\ndrain bank resources and reduce the important services that depository institutions\nprovide to households and businesses.\nCreating balanced regulations that are effective and thoughtfully calibrated to\navoid undue burden requires input from stakeholders. In-person meetings, like the one\nwe are holding today, help us gather information that is critical to our understanding of\nhow regulations affect not only the banking industry but also the consumers and\ncommunities they serve. They also enable stakeholders to learn from one another and\nprovide us with multiple perspectives on the complex issues that our regulations address.\nOutside of these meetings, we also look forward to receiving written comments in which\n\n- 2 -\nyou can elaborate on how to improve our regulations in more detail than we can cover in\nthe time we have today.\nWe recognize that depository institutions come in many sizes, have different\nbusiness models, and manage different risks. As a result, it is often necessary to tailor\nregulations to the institution. Applying a one-size-fits-all approach to regulations may\nproduce a small benefit at a disproportionately large compliance cost to smaller\ninstitutions.\nOf particular concern in this regard is the need to ensure our regulations are\nappropriately calibrated for smaller institutions. For example, because the largest banks\npresent the greatest risk to the stability of our financial system, many of the regulations\npassed under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010\n(Dodd-Frank Act) are specifically targeted at these firms. It would be counterproductive\nto apply those same expectations to small banks. Accordingly, we think it is important to\ntailor rules whenever possible to clearly differentiate expectations for different portfolios\nof banks and reduce undue burden on community banks. Tailoring regulations may be\nmore challenging in some areas, such as rules that provide transparency and fairness in\nconsumer transactions. Those are standards that apply throughout the financial system.\nI should note that the Dodd-Frank Act transferred rule-writing authority for many\nof the consumer laws and regulations to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or\nCFPB. The review of those regulations must be undertaken by the CFPB under\nprocedures incorporated in the Dodd-Frank Act rather than EGRPRA. However, the\nFederal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation retained rule-writing authority for the Community\n\n- 3 -\nReinvestment Act, and we are interested in your comments regarding ways we can\nimprove the regulation.\nIn addition to changes in the regulatory and supervisory landscape, the banking\nindustry itself has also undergone major changes. Advances in technology and shifts in\nindustry composition between depository institutions and nondepository companies have\nchanged the types of financial services and products that are offered, as well as how those\nservices and products are accessed. We will be very interested in your feedback\nregarding how these types of industry changes have impacted the effectiveness of our\nregulations.\nLet me conclude by saying that we will consider your comments carefully as the\nagencies coordinate to discuss and consider the appropriate action that is likely to best\nserve our financial system and the interests of institutions and consumers. The result will\nbe contained in the agencies’ report to the Congress summarizing the issues raised and\nthe agencies’ conclusions about the need for regulatory or legislative changes.\nThank you for joining us today.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:00 p.m. EST\nDecember 13, 2017\nWorkforce Development in Today’s Economy\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Leading the Way: A Workforce Development Video Campaign” awards ceremony\nhosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pathways in Technology\nEarly College High Schools in the Greater Rochester Area\nRochester, N.Y.\nDecember 13, 2017\n\nI would like to thank the staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for\ninviting me to attend this awards ceremony.1 As many of you may already know, the\nLeading the Way campaign is a joint effort between the Federal Reserve Bank and the P-\nTECH2 schools of the Greater Rochester area. It is wonderful to be part of an event that\ncelebrates collaboration between educational institutions, local government, the Federal\nReserve, and employers as they work together to provide appropriate training for young\nworkers to fill local jobs needs. Collaboration creates a more vibrant workforce that is\nconnected to actual jobs.\nToday’s Job Market\nI have just come from a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe FOMC is one of the main policymaking committees of the Federal Reserve System.\nOur main job on the FOMC is to set interest rates to achieve the maximum level of\nemployment in the country and sustain inflation at a moderate level.\nThe nation’s unemployment rate is currently around 4.1 percent, which is a\nrelatively low level by historical standards. What that means for the young people\nparticipating in this program is that this is a great time to find a job. Moreover, not only\nis the national unemployment rate low, so are unemployment rates for young people and\nmembers of ethnic and racial groups that have traditionally faced greater challenges in\nthe labor market. As many of you know, during the deep recession of 2008 and 2009,\nmany Americans were so discouraged by poor job prospects that they stopped even\nlooking for work. That meant that too many Americans were sitting on the sidelines. In\n1 I am grateful to Heidi Kaplan for her assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my own\nviews, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n2 P-TECH is short for Pathways in Technology Early College High.\n\n- 2 -\nthe past few years, the job market has gotten so strong that many of these people have\ncome off the sidelines--and many are now back at work.\nThe Rochester area, like much of the country, has now recovered from the Great\nRecession. The education and health-care sectors continue to be the main drivers of job\ngrowth. And, the local community colleges have partnered with local employers to align\ntheir curriculums with the employers’ job openings, to increase workers’ connections to\njobs, and to become a resource for regional job information. Finally, the local\ngovernment has worked to contend with a long-term loss of jobs in manufacturing and a\nmore recent loss of jobs in professional services by attracting investment in a world-class\nphotonics hub in Rochester.\nI often meet with people who run large companies to get their take on the strength\nof the economy. Whereas a few years ago, they might not have been engaged in a lot of\nhiring, today they tell me that it is becoming more challenging to find well-qualified\nworkers for the job openings they want to fill. That’s good news for those of you\nparticipating in the P-TECH program. It means employers are looking for graduates of\nprograms just like yours, which are attuned to the job opportunities of employers.\nP-TECH Rochester programs offer students professional mentors, job shadowing\nopportunities, and on-the-job experience to ensure that they are ready to contribute\npositively to the workplaces of local employers. I also understand that companies are\ninvesting more in on-the-job training and are strengthening efforts to retain more of the\nworkers they attract, which means younger workers--such as P-TECH graduates--have a\nbetter chance of securing jobs that lead to long-lasting careers. By any measure, the\n\n- 3 -\nmarket for younger workers today looks much better than it did in the years just after the\nGreat Recession, when unemployment rates for teenagers were above 20 percent.3\nIn fact, firms are turning more and more to programs like P-TECH to help them\nfind and train the workers they need. So the skills you are gaining today are likely to\nprovide pathways not only to the jobs of today but also the careers of the future.\nWorkforce Development\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York is one of the facilitators of the Leading\nthe Way campaign. The Federal Reserve System has a long-standing interest in\nunderstanding labor market dynamics and promoting workforce development\nopportunities. Programs like this help workers prepare for jobs and help firms invest in\nworkforce development. Together, these efforts help make the economy more productive\nand help us achieve our goal of maximum employment. In addition to the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York’s efforts, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is learning\nabout labor markets in small industrial cities through their Working Cities Challenge and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has focused on the importance of infrastructure\nincluding broadband for economic inclusion. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has\nbeen a leader within the Federal Reserve System in establishing the Investing in\nAmerica’s Workforce Initiative, an effort across the Federal Reserve System to reframe\ntraining expenditures as investments in human capital rather than costs. In October,\nAtlanta established the Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity to focus on\nemployment policies and labor market issues that affect low- and moderate-income\n3 See Lael Brainard, “Coming of Age in the Great Recession,” speech given to the Federal Reserve’s\nconference on “Economic Mobility: Research and Ideas on Strengthening Families, Communities, and the\nEconomy,” April 2, 2015, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20150402a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nindividuals. The System also recently hosted a national conference in Austin to promote\nthe importance of investing in America’s workforce.4\nAs employers’ demand for specific education and training increase, collaborative\ninitiatives, like those exhibited through the P-TECH programs of Greater Rochester, will\nhelp minimize the skills mismatch appearing in many communities with burgeoning job\nmarkets.\nYoung Workers\nSince 2013, the Federal Reserve Board has been administering the Survey of\nYoung Workers to learn more about work experiences and future prospects for 18-to-30-\nyear-olds nationwide. When I look at the survey findings, I am struck by how well the P-\nTECH program addresses many of the issues young people identified in the survey.\nAs a first example, the survey findings highlight the important correlation\nbetween postsecondary education and labor market outcomes. The survey data indicate\nthat higher levels of educational attainment are associated with higher earnings, greater\njob satisfaction, and increased optimism about one’s job future. P-TECH focuses on\nproviding students with postsecondary credentials, helping to address one of the survey’s\nmain concerns.\nSecond, responses to the survey underscore the importance of young workers\nreceiving appropriate information that enables them to select an educational program that\nprovides better labor market outcomes. The survey found that more than 30 percent of\n4 For more information on the Working Cities Challenge, see www.bostonfed.org/community-\ndevelopment/smaller-industrial-cities/working-cities-challenge.aspx.

And on the Investing in America’s\nWorkforce Initiative, see www.investinwork.org.\n\n- 5 -\nyoung adults did not receive information about jobs and careers in high school and\ncollege. P-TECH is focused on providing information about educational opportunities\nand jobs to students before they enter high school.\nThird, the survey found that many young workers are not employed in fields\naligned with their education. Fewer than half (45 percent) of the young workers surveyed\nsaid they were employed in a career field that is closely related to their educational and\ntraining background. P-TECH focuses on aligning education with actual jobs.\nFinally, the survey found that steady employment is very important to young\nworkers. In 2015, young adults had a strong preference for steady employment (62\npercent) over higher pay (36 percent). And, among the respondents who preferred steady\nemployment, 80 percent would rather have one steady job than a stream of steady jobs for\nthe next five years. The work that P-TECH students do directly with employers helps\nsteer them toward long-term, steady employment.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I am proud that the Federal Reserve is contributing to the efforts of\nthe P-TECH program in the Rochester area and I look forward to the video presentations\nwe will have shortly. I want to congratulate in advance the winners of the video\ncompetition, who will also be announced shortly. I also want to congratulate all of you\nfor being part of a 21st century education program that will help connect you to pathways\nof opportunity and help enable you to make important contributions to the vitality of your\ncommunity.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:00 a.m. EDT\nApril 19, 2018\nSafeguarding Financial Resilience through the Cycle\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nGlobal Finance Forum\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 19, 2018\n\nI am honored to be here today to participate in the Global Finance Forum.\nIt is a good moment to take stock of the cyclical position of the economy and the health\nof the banking system.1 In many respects, where we are today is the mirror image of where we\nwere just a decade ago. The job market is strong, household balance sheets have improved, and\nbusiness activity is solid. Banks are doing well--credit growth is robust, profitability is strong,\nand capital and liquidity buffers have been fortified. While this progress is heartening, we\ncannot afford to be complacent. If we have learned anything from the past, it is that we must be\nespecially vigilant about the health of our financial system in good times, when potential\nvulnerabilities may be building. Safeguarding resilience through the cycle should be a critical\nconsideration in our ongoing evaluation of the regulatory framework. With that in mind, I will\nspend a few minutes describing current conditions and then outline our ongoing work to ensure\nthe financial system’s buffers continue to sustain resilience over the cycle.\nCurrent Conditions\nCyclical conditions have been strengthening. Our growth here at home has been\nbolstered by synchronized growth abroad as well as supportive financial conditions.\nEmployment growth has been heartening, and we are seeing the strong labor market continue to\ndraw prime age Americans back into the labor force from the sidelines. Sizable fiscal stimulus is\nlikely to reinforce cyclical pressures at a time of above-trend growth and tightening resource\nutilization. There are few historical episodes of similar pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus to draw upon\nas we assess the outlook. But in the few cases where resource utilization has been near the levels\n1 I am grateful to Anna Harrington of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing this text. The\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n2\n\nwe may soon be approaching, there have been heightened risks either of inflation, in earlier\ndecades, or of financial imbalances more recently.\nCurrently, inflation appears to be well-anchored to the upside around our 2 percent target,\nbut there are some signs of financial imbalances. Our scan of financial vulnerabilities suggests\nelevated risks in two areas: asset valuations and business leverage. First, asset valuations across\na range of markets remain elevated relative to a variety of historical norms, even after taking into\naccount recent market volatility. Corporate bond yields remain low by historical comparison,\nand spreads of yields on junk bonds above those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities are\nnear the lower end of their historical range. Spreads on leveraged loans and securitized products\nbacked by those loans remain narrow. Prices of multifamily residential and industrial\ncommercial real estate (CRE) have risen, while capitalization rates for these segments have\nreached historical lows.\nSecond, business leverage outside the financial sector has risen to levels that are high\nrelative to historical trends. In the nonfinancial business sector, the debt-to-income ratio has\nincreased to near the upper end of its historical distribution, and net leverage at speculative-grade\nfirms is especially elevated. As we have seen in previous cycles, unexpected negative shocks to\nearnings in combination with increased interest rates could lead to rising levels of delinquencies\namong business borrowers and related stresses to some banks’ balance sheets.\nSafeguarding Resilience through the Cycle\nWe continue to assess the overall vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system to be\nmoderate by historical standards in great measure because post-crisis reforms have strengthened\nthe regulatory and supervisory framework for the largest U.S. banking firms. The crisis revealed\na stark weakness in the capital and liquidity positions of many of our large banking organizations\n3\n\nthat left many of them incapable of dealing with financial stress and necessitated unprecedented\ngovernment intervention. A primary focus of post-crisis financial reform has been strengthening\ncapital and liquidity buffers at large banking institutions, which has bolstered the safety and\nsoundness of these institutions and reduced systemic risk more broadly.\nIn terms of liquidity, not only do our largest firms now have the right kind and amount of\nliquidity calibrated to their funding needs and to their likely run risk in stressed conditions, but\nthey also are required to know where it is at all times and to ensure it is positioned or readily\naccessible where it is most likely to be needed in resolution. Prior to the crisis, many of the\nlargest firms did not even have a good handle on where their liquidity was positioned. For\nexample, our largest banking firms have increased their holdings of high quality liquid assets\nfrom 12 percent of assets in 2011 to 20 percent of assets in 2017, and they have reduced their\nreliance on short-term wholesale funding from 37 percent of liabilities in 2011 to 25 percent of\nliabilities in 2017.2 This, combined with critical reforms to money market funds and other vital\nshort-term funding markets, have reduced the vulnerabilities in the financial system associated\nwith liquidity mismatch and maturity transformation.\nIn terms of capital, the quality of capital has improved with a particular focus on common\nequity, the most loss-absorbing form of capital. The quantity of capital also has increased\nthrough higher minimum requirements and new capital conservation buffers that require banking\nfirms to keep their capital levels well above the minimums in order to maintain full flexibility to\nallocate profits to capital distributions and employee bonus payments. These buffers increase the\nability of banking organizations to absorb losses and continue to lend to households and\n2 These statistics reflect the 18 advanced approaches bank holding companies subject to the standard Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio.\n4\n\nbusinesses, including during times of stress. Indeed, the common equity capital to risk-weighted\nassets ratio of the bank holding companies participating in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12 percent in\nthe fourth quarter of 2017.3\nWe now regularly conduct comprehensive stress tests of the largest banking firms to help\nensure that their capital distribution plans are consistent with their ability to lend and withstand\nsevere macroeconomic and financial stress like that observed during the financial crisis. One\nkey benefit of our stress testing program is that it promotes a dynamic forward-looking\nassessment of a bank’s capital adequacy in the face of severe stress. It is critical to maintain a\ndynamic capital regime that anticipates rapidly changing risks and business conditions. Without\nsuch a dynamic focus, there is a risk that regulators and banking institutions end up spending too\nmuch time looking in the rear-view mirror and not enough time looking ahead for emerging\nrisks. The stress testing capital regime applied to Fannie and Freddie before the crisis offers a\nsobering reminder of the dangers of failing to update stress tests in the face of changing market\npractices and emerging risks.\nThe Federal Reserve has also imposed risk-based and leverage capital surcharges on the\nmost systemic banking firms to ensure they internalize the costs their failure would have on the\nfinancial system and to provide an incentive to reduce their systemic footprint. We have recently\nreleased a proposal for comment to introduce a “stress capital buffer” or SCB that would\n3 These statistics are for the 18 bank holding companies that participated in both the 2009 and 2017 stress tests. The\nrisk-based capital statistics for 2009 report tier 1 common equity, and for 2017 report Basel III common equity tier\n1.\n5\n\nintegrate the forward-looking stress test results into each institution’s ongoing capital\nrequirements.\nSome observers contend that current capital requirements are too onerous and are\nchoking off credit. But the evidence suggests otherwise: U.S. bank lending has been healthy\nover recent years and profits are strong. By any measure, U.S. banks appear very competitive\nrelative to their international peers. In that regard, the current level of capital is a sign of\nstrength. While there is a natural tendency to question the value of capital buffers when times\nare good, the severe costs associated with not having enough capital to absorb losses become all\ntoo evident in a downturn. By the time losses are rising, it is generally too late to start building\nbuffers, which became all too clear with devastating consequences in some countries during the\nlast crisis.\nI support efforts to identify improvements that make regulations less burdensome. But it\nis vital to be prudent regarding any material changes to the core capital and liquidity framework,\nand not lose sight of the need to safeguard financial resilience through the cycle. Prudence\nwould argue for waiting until we have tested how the new framework performs through a full\ncycle before we make judgments about its performance. At this point in the cycle, it is\npremature to revisit the calibration of core capital and liquidity requirements for the large\nbanking institutions.4\n4 Cost-benefit studies support capital requirements at current levels or higher. See, for example, the review of\nevidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An Empirical Economic Assessment of the\nCosts and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US (PDF),” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-034\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April), available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017034pap.pdf.\n6\n\nHistory suggests that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards\nand an attendant increase in risky debt levels. I would be reluctant to see our large banking\ninstitutions releasing the capital and liquidity buffers that they have built so effectively over the\npast few years, at a time when cyclical pressures and vulnerabilities in the broader financial\nsystem are building.\nIndeed, if cyclical pressures continue to build and financial vulnerabilities broaden, it\nmay become appropriate to ask the largest banking organizations to build a countercyclical\nbuffer (CCyB) of capital to maintain an adequate degree of resilience against stress. The CCyB\nis an additional margin of capital that the nation’s largest banks can be asked to build to sustain\nresilience when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often follow periods of\nrapid asset price appreciation or credit growth. This buffer is intended to be released as the\neconomy weakens in order to allow banks to lend more when it is most needed. Countercyclical\ncapital requirements can lean against rising financial vulnerabilities at a time when the degree of\nmonetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal would be inconsistent with\nthe dual mandate goals of full employment and price stability. Moreover, countercyclical capital\nrequirements build resilience, unlike monetary policy.\nThe CCyB framework, which was finalized in September 2016, requires the Federal\nReserve Board to vote at least once per year on the level of the CCyB. While other jurisdictions\nhave developed some experience with the use of countercyclical buffers, in the United States, the\nCCyB has so far not yet been activated. The condition set out in September 2016 for raising the\nCCyB above its minimum value of zero is that financial system vulnerabilities are meaningfully\nabove normal.\n7\n\nWhen the CCyB rule was issued in September 2016, it was calibrated against the\nbackdrop of the established levels of required U.S. structural buffers. Thus, it would be prudent\nto accompany any consideration of material adjustments to the calibration of the structural\nbuffers held by the large banking institutions, with compensating adjustments to the\ncountercyclical buffer in order to achieve the same overall level of resilience through the cycle.\nCompleting the Agenda\nWhile we have made important progress in our regulatory framework, we still have not\nimplemented a few key elements. The list of remaining items is short but important and well\nanticipated.\nFirst, we are close to finalizing the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR. This significant\nliquidity regulation is important to ensure that large banking firms maintain a stable funding\nprofile over a one-year horizon. It will serve as a natural complement to our existing liquidity\ncoverage ratio, which helps ensure firms can withstand liquidity strains over a 30-day time\nhorizon. And by most estimates, our large complex banking institutions are in a position to meet\nthe expected requirements with little adjustment.\nSecond, we need to finalize Dodd-Frank Act limits on large counterparty exposures.\nThese limits will reduce the chances that outsized exposures, particularly between large financial\ninstitutions, could spread financial distress and undermine financial stability as we witnessed\nduring the last financial crisis. Moreover, these large exposure limits will effectively update the\ntraditional bank lending limits that proved useful for well over 100 years for today’s challenges,\nby recognizing the many ways in which banks and their affiliates take on credit exposure beyond\ndirectly extending loans.\n8\n\nI support efforts to improve the efficacy of the Volcker rule while preserving its\nunderlying goal of prohibiting banking firms from engaging in speculative activities for which\nfederal deposit insurance and other safeguards were never intended. The interagency regulation\nimplementing the Volcker rule is not the most effective way of achieving its very laudable and\nimportant goal. We are exploring ways to streamline and simplify the regulation to reduce costs\nwithout weakening the key objectives. We should be able to provide firms and supervisors with\ngreater clarity about what constitutes permissible market-making. We should also identify ways\nto further tailor the Volcker compliance regime to focus on firms with large trading operations\nand reduce the compliance burden for small banking entities with limited trading operations.\nI also support moving forward with minimum haircuts for securities financing\ntransactions (SFTs) on a marketwide basis to counter the growth of volatile funding structures\noutside the banking sector. International agreement on a regulatory framework for minimum\nSFT haircuts was reached by financial regulators in 2015, and it is important to follow through\non this work plan. While current market practices in this area may well exhibit much better risk\nmanagement than pre-crisis, past experience suggests we cannot rely on prudent practices to\nremain in place as competitive and cyclical pressures build. Regulatory minimum haircuts\ncalibrated to be appropriate through the cycle could help ensure that repo, securities lending, and\nsecurities margin lending and related markets do not become a source of instability in periods of\nfinancial stress through fire sales and run-type behavior.\nHere, I have focused primarily on the reforms that are most important for the resilience of\nthe large interconnected banking organizations at the core of our system. Outside of this group, I\nfavor better tailoring the regulatory framework for our smaller banking firms so as to decrease\nregulatory burden. While we have taken some important steps to reduce burden on smaller\n9\n\nbanking organizations such as streamlining the Call Report for small, less complex community\nbanks, increasing appraisal thresholds for CRE loans, and reducing the frequency of exams in\ncertain circumstances, there is more we should do.\nConclusion\nHistory and experience show that stable economic growth is aided by strong regulatory\nbuffers that bolster the resilience of our large banking organizations and help reduce the severity\nof downturns. At a time when cyclical pressures are building, and asset valuations are stretched,\nwe should be calling for large banking organizations to safeguard the capital and liquidity buffers\nthey have built over the past few years. Maintaining resilience over the cycle can be\naccomplished through a combination of structural and countercyclical buffers whose calibrations\nare inherently linked. While we should carefully consider how to make our regulations more\neffective and better tailored, we must take great care to ensure that we do not inadvertently\ncontribute to pro-cyclicality that would exacerbate financial conditions that are, on some\ndimensions, somewhat stretched. Although I believe it is too early today to reassess the\ncalibration of existing capital and liquidity buffers because they have yet to be tested through a\nfull economic cycle, I look forward to efforts that are planned in future years in the international\nstandard-setting bodies to assess the framework quantitatively.\n10",

The Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco is a leader of our engagement with the tech community. And the\nFederal Reserve’s Innovation Office Hours serve as an important forum to engage on innovation\nin the financial system with financial institutions, fintechs, technology companies, nonprofits,\nand other stakeholders.

These remarks represent my own views, which do\nnot necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For information on the impact of COVID-19 on communities around the country, see Federal Reserve System,\nFedListens: Perspectives from the Public (Federal Reserve System, June 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/fedlistens-report-20200612.pdf; and Claire Kramer Mills and\nJessica Battisto, “Double Jeopardy: COVID-19’s Concentrated Health and Wealth Effects in Black Communities,\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York,” Brief (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, August 2020),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/DoubleJeopardy_COVID19andBlackOwnedBusine\nsses.\n\n- 2 -\nlower incomes, greater income declines, and lower liquid savings.3 The urgency with which the\nCARES Act emergency payments were spent underscores the importance of immediate and\ntrusted access to funds for the many households and businesses that face cash-flow constraints.\nThat is why the Federal Reserve remains committed to delivering on the FedNowSM Service,\nwhich will enable millions of American households and small businesses to get instant access to\nfunds rather than waiting days for checks to clear.4\nMore broadly, banks, fintech companies, and technology firms are all exploring the use\nof innovative technologies to enhance payments efficiency, expand financial inclusion, speed up\nsettlement flows, and reduce end-user costs. Digital currencies, including central bank digital\ncurrencies (CBDCs), present opportunities but also risks associated with privacy, illicit activity,\nand financial stability. The introduction of Bitcoin and the subsequent emergence of stablecoins\nwith potentially global reach, such as Facebook’s Libra, have raised fundamental questions about\nlegal and regulatory safeguards, financial stability, and the role of currency in society. This\nprospect has intensified calls for CBDCs to maintain the sovereign currency as the anchor of the\nnation’s payment systems. Moreover, China has moved ahead rapidly on its version of a CBDC.\nWith these important issues in mind, the Federal Reserve is active in conducting research\nand experimentation related to distributed ledger technologies and the potential use cases for\ndigital currencies. Given the dollar’s important role, it is essential that the Federal Reserve\nremain on the frontier of research and policy development regarding CBDCs. As part of this\n3 Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer, Pagel, and Yannelis (2020) examine a panel of households using a financial planning\napp and find that these households responded quickly to CARES Act stimulus payments; see Scott R.

Like other central banks, we are continuing to assess the opportunities and\nchallenges of, as well as the use cases for, a CBDC, as a complement to cash and other payments\noptions. There continues to be strong demand for U.S. currency, and we remain committed to\nensuring the public has access to a range of payments options.\nWe have been conducting in-house experiments for the last few years, through means that\ninclude the Board’s Technology Lab, which has been building and testing a range of distributed\nledger platforms to understand their potential opportunity and risk. This multidisciplinary team,\nwith application developers from the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Dallas, and New\nYork, supports a policy team at the Board that is studying the implications of digital currencies\non the payments ecosystem, monetary policy, financial stability, banking and finance, and\nconsumer protection.\nTo enhance the Federal Reserve’s understanding of digital currencies, the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston is collaborating with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology in a multiyear effort to build and test a hypothetical digital currency oriented to\ncentral bank uses. The research project will explore the use of existing and new technologies as\nneeded. Lessons from this collaboration will be published, and any codebase that is developed\nthrough this effort will be offered as open-source software for anyone to use for experimentation.\nThe objectives of our research and experimentation across the Federal Reserve System\nare to assess the safety and efficiency of digital currency systems, to inform our understanding of\nprivate-sector arrangements, and to give us hands-on experience to understand the opportunities\nand limitations of possible technologies for digital forms of central bank money. These efforts\n\n- 4 -\nare intended to ensure that we fully understand the potential as well as the associated risks and\npossible unintended consequences that new technologies present in the payments arena.\nSeparately, a significant policy process would be required to consider the issuance of a\nCBDC, along with extensive deliberations and engagement with other parts of the federal\ngovernment and a broad set of other stakeholders. There are also important legal considerations.\nIt is important to understand how the existing provisions of the Federal Reserve Act with regard\nto currency issuance apply to a CBDC and whether a CBDC would have legal tender status,\ndepending on the design. The Federal Reserve has not made a decision whether to undertake\nsuch a significant policy process, as we are taking the time and effort to understand the\nsignificant implications of digital currencies and CBDCs around the globe.\nIn addition to these experiments, the Federal Reserve continues to collaborate with and\nlearn from other central banks. We are participating in the CBDC coalition of central banks.\nWhile each country will make decisions on whether to issue and how to design a CBDC based\non its own domestic legal framework and financial and economic context, we benefit from\ncollaboration on CBDC research. Sharing lessons learned, jointly conducting experiments, and\nbringing diverse expertise to bear helps us make progress in developing potential approaches to\naddress challenging hurdles, such as threats to cybersecurity, counterfeiting and fraud, and anti-\nmoney laundering, to name a few, as well as on shared goals, such as increasing the ease and\nefficiency of cross-border transactions. Since financial and payments systems share extensive\ncross-border linkages, a poorly designed CBDC issued in one jurisdiction could create financial\nstability issues in another jurisdiction. A cyberattack on a CBDC arrangement in one jurisdiction\ncould create domestic financial stress, which could, in turn, affect linked economies or have\nbroader effects if confidence in certain technologies or payment mechanisms is eroded.\n\n- 5 -\nMore broadly, the Federal Reserve looks forward to increased international engagement\non matters related to innovation and technological change that impact central banks and those we\nserve. Our new initiative with the Bank of International Settlement’s Innovation Hub, through an\ninnovation center at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, will provide a useful venue for\nincreased cooperation and exchange.5\nLet me conclude by noting that innovation is central to our work. We remain committed\nto understanding how technological advances can help the Federal Reserve carry out our core\nmissions, as well as how they are changing the ways that banks, payments, and financial markets\noperate. For example, we are leveraging machine learning, natural language processing, and\nother artificial intelligence tools to help us analyze data, and we are monitoring how financial\ninstitutions use these tools in their decisionmaking. We are expanding our use of cloud\ncomputing to enhance our operations, and we continue to enhance our cybersecurity tools to\nstrengthen our cyber posture. These and other technologies are fundamentally changing every\naspect of our work, and the Federal Reserve remains optimistic about the power of healthy\ninnovation to improve the resilience, efficiency, and inclusiveness of our financial system when\nthe appropriate safeguards are in place.\n5 Bank for International Settlements, “BIS Innovation Hub to Expand to New Locations in Europe and North\nAmerica,” news release, June 30, 2020, https://www.bis.org/press/p200630a.htm.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:00 p.m. EDT\nOctober 7, 2016\nDistributed Ledger Technology: Implications for Payments, Clearing, and Settlement\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nInstitute of International Finance Annual Meeting Panel on Blockchain\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 7, 2016\n\nWe recognize the potential of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to\ntransform the way financial market participants transfer, store, and maintain ownership\nrecords of digitized assets. The genuinely innovative aspect of distributed ledger\ntechnology combines a number of core elements that can be used to support the transfer\nprocess and distributed recordkeeping for digital assets and digital representations of\nassets. These elements include peer-to-peer networking and distributed data records,\nwhich provide broadly shared access to a single ledger across participants in the system,\nso that all participants maintain a shared, accurate history of all transactions in the\nsystem. In addition, cryptography provides a secure way to initiate a valid transaction as\nwell as to securely transmit and store data. And consensus algorithms provide a process\nfor transactions to be confirmed and added to the single ledger, which is an important\nfeature when more than one participant has permission to propose updates to the ledger.\nWe are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain,\nrecognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in\npayments, clearing, and settlement.1\nThe Federal Reserve Board has established a working group that is engaged in a\n360-degree analysis of financial innovation across the broad range of our responsibilities,\ndrawing on engagement with industry stakeholders and on expertise from across the\nFederal Reserve System, including in supervision, consumer protection, financial stability\nand information technology. One important area of oversight is the payments system,\nwhere technology changes are viewed through the prism of our responsibilities for\n1 See http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20160414a.htm. Also, see the\nforthcoming Feds working paper, “Staff Study on Distributed Ledger Technology in Payments, Clearing,\nand Settlement,” 2016.\n\n- 2 -\npromoting the safety and efficiency of the payments and settlements systems; supervising\nfinancial institutions engaged in payments, clearing and settlement; and safeguarding\nfinancial stability. We want to maintain public confidence in the payments system, while\nsupporting innovation that provides broadly shared benefits to the public over time,\nincluding through the reduction of unnecessary frictions, costs, and delays.\nIllustrative Use Cases\nLet me briefly mention a few of the use cases that we have explored in our\ndiscussions with industry stakeholders in order to illustrate the potential of distributed\nledger technologies to improve payments, clearing, and settlement, as well as the\nconsiderations that are important to us in our assessment of benefits and risks.\nIn cross-border payments and trade finance, significantly faster processing and\nreduced costs relative to the long and opaque intermediation chains associated with\ncurrent methods of correspondent banking are promising potential benefits of the\ntechnology. Reducing intermediation steps in cross-border payments may help decrease\ntime, costs, and counterparty risks and may materially diminish opacity, for instance by\nenabling small businesses or households remitting payments across borders to see the\nassociated transfer costs and processing times up front. In trade finance, where\ndocument-intensive processes are not fully automated, distributed ledger technology may\nbe able to reduce significant costs and speed up processing associated with issuing and\ntracking letters of credit and associated documents. To see the full potential of this\ntechnology realized for cross-border payments, it will be important to identify and track\nidentities associated with the transactions, which in itself may be facilitated by the use of\ndistributed ledgers, depending on their design.\n\n- 3 -\nIn securities markets, the industry is exploring activities ranging from the issuance\nof securities on a distributed ledger, to the clearing and settlement of trades, to tracking\nand administering corporate actions. For securities clearing and settlement in particular,\nthe potential shift to one master record shared “simultaneously” among users of a\ndistributed ledger-based system could be compelling. Sharing one immutable record may\nhave the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for the reconciliation of multiple\nrecords linked to a single trade among and between dealers and other organizations. In\nconcept, such technology could lead to greater transparency, reduced costs, and faster\nsettlement. Likewise, distributed ledgers may improve collateral management by\nimproving the tracking of ownership and transactions. Nonetheless, as is frequently true\nin the complex arena of payments, clearing, and settlement, we can also expect that\npractical details covering a host of technical, business, and market issues will have an\nimportant role in determining how new technologies ultimately perform.\nFor commodities and derivatives, there are projects to streamline some of the\nmore antiquated corners of the markets. In markets that are heavily paper-based and lack\nany central means for coordination, distributed ledger technology could potentially be\nleveraged to provide coordination that facilitates exchange, clearing, and settlement of\nobligations.\nA related development is the potential coupling of distributed ledger protocols\nwith self-execution and possibly self-enforcement of contractual clauses, using so-called\n“smart contracts.” To take a familiar example, for a corporate bond with a specified par\nvalue, tenor, and coupon payment stream, a smart contract would automatically execute\npayments on the specified schedule to the assigned owner over the life of the bond.\n\n- 4 -\nAlthough the idea of automating certain aspects of contracts is not new, and banks do\nsome of this today, the potential introduction of smart contracts does raise several issues\nfor consideration. For example, what is the legal status of a smart contract, which is\nwritten in code? Would consumers and businesses rely on smart contracts to perform\ncertain services traditionally done by their banks or other intermediaries? Could the\nwidespread automated interaction of multiple counterparties lead to any unwanted\ndynamics for financial markets? These and other considerations will be important factors\nin determining the extent of the application of smart contracts.\nRegardless of the application, much of the industry is at a “proof of concept”\nstage of development. These proofs of concept are often simple, experimental uses of the\ntechnology on a small scale that help stakeholders understand the potential and\nlimitations of the technology for a specific purpose, which in turn typically lead to\nrefinements and more developed proofs of concept. As such, many potential applications\nare in their infancy, and the industry may still be several years away from an application\nthat is ready to be fully implemented. Even so, the industry seems to be making\nannouncements daily on new proofs of concept and progress that may lead to pilots, so\nthat timeline could accelerate. In some cases, there have been announcements the\ntechnology will be used within the next year or two in actual production environments.\nThe initial relatively simple proofs of concept must be followed by much more complex\ndemonstrations in real-world situations before these technologies can be safely deployed\nin today’s highly interconnected, synchronized, and far-reaching financial markets.\nAlthough many private and inward-facing projects are being explored, the\nindustry has also recognized the need to collaborate at early stages of development. An\n\n- 5 -\nimportant positive development is that industry participants are actively engaging with\neach other to look for common approaches. Some groups are creating standards that\nfacilitate common platforms to enable greater interoperability of often proprietary\napplications that are built on them and interoperate through application program\ninterfaces, or APIs.\nIn coming months and years, innovators, investors, and financial practitioners will\nno doubt make important strides in addressing key challenges such as adopting common\nstandards, achieving interoperability between and among legacy systems and evolving\ndistributed ledgers, improving scalability and computational throughput, and improving\ncryptographic security. These are positive developments that we will monitor closely.\nManaging Risks\nAll of this activity demonstrates that we are in a very innovative period. The\nindustry is eager to get on with adopting the various possibilities that distributed ledger\ntechnology may bring. However, established players and, increasingly, new entrants\nunderstand that there are important guardrails that have been carefully developed over\nmany years in the arena of payments, clearing, and settlement. The safety and soundness\nof financial institutions, safety and efficiency of the payment system, and broader\nfinancial stability are critical to a healthy financial environment that fosters innovation\nwith broad public benefits over the long run. We expect the private sector to bear\nimportant responsibility for developing and deploying new financial technologies in a\nsafe and sound manner, even as we all seek an innovative and efficient payment system\nover the long run. The deployment of any new financial technology must be undertaken\nwith a thorough understanding and management of risks.\n\n- 6 -\nLike many new financial technologies, distributed ledgers could ameliorate or\nexacerbate traditional financial risks. What matters to us as policymakers and regulators\nis not only whether the migration to a new technological platform increases or reduces\nrisks, but also whether risks are rendered more or less opaque, and how they are\ndistributed among and between financial intermediaries and end users. In the payments,\nclearing, and settlement arena, some important risk areas for consideration include\nsettlement, operations, and cybersecurity, as well as money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing. In managing risks, important considerations include system resiliency and\ngovernance as well as the role of licensing in ensuring proper oversight.\nIn securities settlements, for example, a difference in timing between the delivery\nof securities and the delivery of funds introduces settlement risk between counterparties\nand other institutions involved in this process. To the extent that distributed ledger\ntechnologies are designed to supplant the traditional reliance on trusted intermediaries to\nensure settlement, they will need to reliably demonstrate their ability to mitigate or even\neliminate settlement risk, especially in cases where the delivery of the securities and the\nassociated payment take place on different platforms.\nTraditional payment, clearing, and settlement are subject to operational risk, and it\nis critically important that new technologies operate reliably, securely, and with integrity.\nThe daily operation of markets and their clearing and settlement functions are built on\ntrust and confidence. Market participants trust that clearing and settlement functions and\ninstitutions will work properly every day. Confidence has built over time that when\nmarket participants trade, accurate and timely clearing and settlement will follow.\n\n- 7 -\nThus, robust security is an important element of any system. The distributed\nnature of this new technology, combined with the fact that many connected participants\ncan update the shared ledger, means that end-point security is another critical component\nof any successful implementation of the technology. Adverse actors that can take over a\nparticipant’s access to the ledger remains a key security concern, as thefts of\ncryptographic keys in Bitcoin continue to demonstrate. Thus, advances in cryptography\nwill remain a key priority to enable widespread adoption of distributed ledger\ntechnologies, along with systems for securing private keys, the management of access to\nprivate keys, and differentiated permissions for participants in the system to read and\nwrite to the ledger. Recent episodes have illustrated the importance of having protocols\nagreed at the outset to determine whether and under what circumstances to reverse\ntransactions once they have been recorded in a distributed master ledger.\nFinally, it will be important that users and administrators of distributed ledger\ntechnologies can meet their responsibilities to combat money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and other key law enforcement concerns. Some of the new technologies\nwould potentially allow authorized access to certain data records in a much more efficient\nmanner than has previously been possible. For example, distributed ledgers could be\ndeveloped to collect personally identifiable information and country identifiers that\nenable banks to identify and report on suspicious activity. It will be important that these\nnew technological developments and their implementation perform in a safe and sound\nmanner that is transparent and satisfies regulatory requirements.\n\n- 8 -\nWhile prevention will remain the preferred approach, realistically, resiliency and\nrecovery will also need to be high-priorities. Indeed, many firms have suggested that the\ndistributed data storage concept has the potential to increase the level of resiliency and\ndata integrity. The basic idea is it should be harder to corrupt multiple copies of the same\ndata simultaneously such that digital ledgers could reduce the vulnerability associated\nwith a single point of failure. We must press firms and experts to identify the strengths\nand vulnerabilities of this concept, even as we all look for ways to make databases more\nsecure and resilient. In an interesting development, some financial institutions have also\nbegun to consider using distributed ledgers to back up critical databases and enable quick\nrecovery from potentially virulent cyberattacks. We will be interested in whether such\ntechniques can make new contributions to cybersecurity.\nOverall, the public needs to have confidence that any system employing\ndistributed ledgers will operate properly, particularly in stressed conditions, and know\nthat when adverse scenarios do occur, there will be robust management and governance\nto respond effectively. Recent events, such as thefts from accounts on distributed ledger\nplatforms, highlight the challenge that distributed ledgers may have when adverse\nscenarios occur and there is uncertainty around what an appropriate response would be.\nSuch uncertainty around management and governance can raise doubts about the integrity\nof a system employing distributed ledgers.\nTraditionally, financial regulators in the United States have been given licensing\nauthority as a key way of ensuring that responsibility for managing risks is transparently\nassigned with appropriate oversight. The development of new business models\nassociated with evolving financial technologies has raised questions about the\n\n- 9 -\napplicability of existing licenses and their adequacy to new business models. For\ninstance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore recently issued a consultation paper that\nproposes an activity-based payments framework as a way to address the introduction of\nnon-traditional payment providers.2 The United States has seen several noteworthy\nrecent developments, including the New York State Department of Financial Services’\nBitLicense, a distributed ledger company, securing Federal Reserve Bank of New York\napproval for participation in the National Settlement Service, and, most recently,\ndiscussion by the OCC of a limited-purpose charter.\nOngoing Engagement\nBecause of the notable potential of distributed ledger technology, financial\nauthorities, both domestic and international, will follow these developments with keen\ninterest. At the Federal Reserve, we expect to publish a research paper later this year that\nsummarizes some of the key findings from our industry engagement so far. Going\nforward, we will continue to deepen our engagement with a range of financial\ninstitutions, technologists, multi-stakeholder consortia, and academic experts to refine our\nunderstanding of the new technologies, along with their possibilities and limitations, with\na particular focus on our responsibilities for the payments system, as well as our\noversight of financial market intermediaries. We will also continue to discuss these\nissues with other central banks and authorities around the world. We will work together\nto foster socially beneficial innovation, while insisting that risks are thoroughly\nunderstood, managed, and controlled.\n2 See\nwww.mas.gov.sg/~/media/resource/publications/consult_papers/2016/Proposed%20Activity%20Based%20\nPayments%20Framework%20and%20Establishment%20of%20a%20National%20Payments%20Council.p\ndf.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:45 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 12, 2018\nWhat Do We Mean by Neutral and What Role Does It Play in Monetary Policy?\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nDetroit Economic Club\nDetroit, Michigan\nSeptember 12, 2018\n\nIt is a pleasure to be in Detroit. I started my career working here in the Motor\nCity, and I have followed the fortunes of this area with interest ever since. A few years\nago, I visited some of Detroit’s neighborhoods with our local officials at a time when\ndamage from the crisis was still pervasive. While challenges remain in many of the city’s\nneighborhoods, since that time the metropolitan area overall has seen signs of a rebound\nin business activity and investment, and the unemployment rate has continued to trend\ndownward, recently falling to 4.3 percent.1\nThis is similar to the nation’s economy more broadly. While challenges remain\nfor many, aggregate growth is strong, and the economy is meeting our full employment\nand inflation objectives. Given the outlook, it comes as no surprise that the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) has been gradually raising interest rates from crisis-era lows\nand sees further gradual increases as likely to be appropriate in its most recent statement.2\nBefore discussing the outlook, it might be useful to first explore some concepts that are\nimportant in informing the path of rates.\nWhat Is the Neutral Rate of Interest?\nIn thinking about how we should set the federal funds rate, many policymakers\nand economists find the concept of the neutral rate of interest to be a useful frame of\nreference. So, what does the neutral rate mean? Intuitively, I think of the nominal\nneutral interest rate as the level of the federal funds rate that keeps output growing around\nits potential rate in an environment of full employment and stable inflation.3\n1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Board of Governors (2018a).\n3 The closely related concept of the natural rate of interest--the rate of interest at which investment and\nsavings are equilibrated at full employment--is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.\n\n- 2 -\nFocusing first on the “shorter-run” neutral rate, this does not stay fixed, but rather\nfluctuates along with important changes in economic conditions. For instance, legislation\nthat increases the budget deficit through tax cuts and spending increases can be expected\nto generate tailwinds to domestic demand and thus to push up the shorter-run neutral\ninterest rate. Heightened risk appetite among investors similarly can be expected to push\nup the shorter-run neutral rate. Conversely, many of the forces that contributed to the\nfinancial crisis--such as fear and uncertainty on the part of businesses and households--\ncan be expected to lower the neutral rate of interest, as can declines in foreign demand for\nU.S. exports.\nIn many circumstances, monetary policy can help keep the economy on its\nsustainable path at full employment by adjusting the policy rate to reflect movements in\nthe shorter-run neutral rate. In this context, the appropriate reference for assessing the\nstance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal shorter-run\nneutral rate.\nSo far, I have been focusing on the shorter-run neutral rate of interest that is\nresponsive to headwinds or tailwinds to demand. The longer-run equilibrium rate is a\nrelated concept. The underlying concept of the “longer run” generally refers to the output\ngrowing at its longer-run trend, after transitory forces reflecting headwinds or tailwinds\nhave played out, in an environment of full employment and inflation running at the\nFOMC objective.4\nThe natural rate and the neutral rate are closely related concepts whose technical differences matter for\neconomic theory and estimation, but less for the intuitive discussion here.\n4 See Brainard (2015).\n\n- 3 -\nThe longer-run federal funds rate estimated by FOMC participants in their\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) meets the definition of a longer-run\nequilibrium rate of interest.5 It is worth highlighting that the longer-run federal funds\nrate is the only neutral interest rate reported in the FOMC projections. But the shorter-\nrun neutral rate, rather than the longer-run federal funds rate, is the relevant benchmark\nfor assessing the near-term path of monetary policy in the presence of headwinds or\ntailwinds.\nEstimating the Neutral Rate of Interest\nSimilar to other equilibrium macroeconomic concepts such as potential gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and the natural rate of unemployment, the shorter- and longer-\nrun levels of the neutral rate are not directly observable, so they must be estimated or\ninferred from the movements of variables that are observed, such as market interest rates,\ninflation, the unemployment rate, and GDP.6 In recent years, considerable work has\nderived estimates of the longer-run equilibrium rate, in some cases using statistical\ntechniques that can be thought of as capturing the highly persistent component of the\nneutral rate. The central tendency of those estimates suggests that the longer-run trend\nrate is in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent in nominal terms.7 This range lines up well with\nthe most recent median estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate in the FOMC SEP,\n5 As defined in the FOMC SEP, “Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate\nto which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the\nabsence of further shocks to the economy.” See the most recent SEP, an addendum to the minutes of the\nJune 2018 FOMC meeting, available in a July 5, 2018, press release on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180705a.htm.\n6 See Powell (2018).\n7 See Kiley (2015); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Laubach and\nWilliams (2003) (current estimates available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/economists/williams/data/Laubach_Williams_cu\nrrent_estimates.xlsx); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2017); and Lubik and Matthes (2015).\n\n- 4 -\nwhich is just below 3 percent. By these estimates, the longer-run neutral rate has fallen\nconsiderably from the estimated range in earlier decades of 4 to 5 percent.8\nTurning to the shorter-run neutral rate, although the estimates are model\ndependent and uncertain, we can make some general inferences about its recent evolution\nthat are largely independent of the details of specific models.9 Estimates suggest the\nshorter-run neutral rate tends to be cyclical, falling in recessions and rising during\nexpansions, and our current expansion appears to be no exception.10\nLast year, the unemployment rate returned to pre-crisis levels, which required real\ninterest rates that were below zero for nearly 10 years.11 This year, the unemployment\nrate has fallen further, and job market gains have gathered strength, at the same time that\nthe federal funds rate has increased. This combination suggests that the short-run neutral\ninterest rate likely has also increased. If, instead, the neutral rate had remained constant\nas the federal funds rate increased, we would have expected to see labor market gains\nslow. That inference is consistent with the formal model estimates, which indicate that\nthe shorter-run neutral rate has gone up as the expansion has advanced. This is also\nsuggested by the observation that overall financial conditions, as measured by a variety of\nindexes, have remained quite accommodative during a period when the federal funds rate\nhas been moving higher.\nIn the latest FOMC SEP median path, by the end of next year, the federal funds\nrate is projected to rise to a level that exceeds the longer-run federal funds rate during a\n8 A variety of hypotheses have been advanced to explain this decline, including slower labor force growth,\nslower productivity growth, and an increase in savings propensities. See Kiley (2015) and Brainard (2015).\n9 Estimates of real natural rates of interest based on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models include\nDel Negro and others (2015) and Edge, Kiley, and Laforte (2008).\n10 See, for example, Cúrdia (2015) and Del Negro and others (2015).\n11 See Yellen (2015, 2016, 2017).\n\n- 5 -\ntime when real GDP growth is projected to exceed its longer-run pace and unemployment\ncontinues to fall. The shift from headwinds to tailwinds may be expected to push the\nshorter-run neutral rate above its longer-run trend in the next year or two, just as it fell\nbelow the longer-run equilibrium rate following the financial crisis. Notably, the sizable\nfiscal stimulus in the pipeline is likely to continue to bolster the short-run neutral rate\nover the next two years. The relatively rich level of current asset valuations relative to\nhistorical levels is another factor that could push the short-run neutral rate above its\nlonger-run value. As was noted in the recent FOMC minutes, corporate credit spreads are\nvery narrow, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after\ntaking into account the low level of interest rates.12 Business and consumer confidence is\nhigh, which is also consistent with a higher shorter-run neutral rate of interest.\nThe Outlook\nHaving provided some context for how we might assess policy, I will turn to\nsome observations on the outlook. By any measure, overall growth in the second quarter\nwas strong. Real GDP increased at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate, a very rapid pace nine\nyears into the expansion. Looking ahead, it seems likely that growth will remain solid.\nConfidence is high, private domestic demand momentum is solid, and recent fiscal\nstimulus will continue to work its way through the economy, at least for the next year or\nso.\nThe labor market is also strong. So far this year, payroll gains have averaged\nmore than 200,000 per month, a step-up from the 2017 pace and well above estimates of\nthe pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force. Among prime-age\n12 See Board of Governors (2018b).\n\n- 6 -\nworkers, the employment-to-population ratio is 79.3 percent, up almost 1 percentage\npoint over the past year. These developments are heartening, suggesting the tight labor\nmarket is providing employment opportunities to more Americans. Nonetheless, this is\nstill about 1 percentage point below its previous cyclical peak, suggesting there may be\nsome room for further gains.\nIn another encouraging development, wage gains in the August report reached\ntheir highest level since the depth of the financial crisis, although wage growth remains\nmoderate by historical standards. While a variety of wage measures have accelerated\nover the past year and there is anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in some sectors\nand regions, there is no evidence of rapid acceleration in the aggregate wage indicators.\nAt 3.9 percent, the August unemployment rate was about 1/2 percentage point\nlower than the previous year. If unemployment continues to decline at the same rate as\nwe have seen over the past year, we will soon see unemployment rates not seen since the\n1960s. Historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been at similarly tight\nlevels have tended to see elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial\nimbalances.13 For instance, the inflation process may change in unexpected ways.\nSo far, the data on inflation remain encouraging, providing little signal of an\noutbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, and some reassurance that underlying\ntrend inflation may be moving closer to 2 percent, on the other. Core personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) prices have increased 2 percent over the past\n12 months, consistent with the FOMC’s objective. Survey measures of inflation\nexpectations remain stable in the lower end of the historical ranges, while market-based\n13 See Brainard (2018).\n\n- 7 -\nmeasures of inflation compensation remain stable at levels above the lows seen in 2016.\nWith various measures of underlying trend inflation having come in below our 2 percent\nobjective over a sustained period, it is important to sustainably achieve inflation around\n2 percent to prevent an erosion of underlying trend inflation the next time the economy\nfaces a downturn and the federal funds rate hits its lower limit.14\nThe past few times unemployment fell to levels as low as those projected over the\nnext year, signs of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in\naccelerating inflation. The Federal Reserve’s assessment suggests that financial\nvulnerabilities are building, which might be expected after a long period of economic\nexpansion and very low interest rates. Rising risks are notable in the corporate sector,\nwhere low spreads and loosening credit terms are mirrored by rising indebtedness among\ncorporations that could be vulnerable to downgrades in the event of unexpected adverse\ndevelopments. Leveraged lending is again on the rise; spreads on leveraged loans and the\nsecuritized products backed by those loans are low, and the Board’s Senior Loan Officer\nOpinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggests that underwriting standards for\nleveraged loans may be declining to levels not seen since 2005.\nWhile tightening resource utilization and loose financial conditions present upside\nrisks, recent foreign developments present downside risks. Trade policy has introduced\nuncertainty. Growth in Europe and Japan has moderated from its strong pace of last year,\nand political risks have reemerged in countries such as Italy. China is contending with\ndeleveraging and deceleration as well as a challenging trade environment. As U.S.\ngrowth has pulled away from foreign growth, in part reflecting fiscal policy divergence,\n14 See Brainard (2017).\n\n- 8 -\nexpectations of monetary policy divergence strengthened, contributing to upward\npressure on the dollar earlier this year. The resulting currency adjustments are\ncompounding challenges faced by some emerging market economies, along with a\ncomplicated and unpredictable trade environment and gradually increasing interest rates.\nAlthough capital flow reversals have been contained to several notably vulnerable\ncountries so far, I am attentive to the risk that a pullback from emerging markets could\nbroaden.\nThe Path of Policy\nWhat are the implications for policy? Over the next year or two, barring\nunexpected developments, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely\nto be appropriate to sustain full employment and inflation near its objective. With\ngovernment stimulus in the pipeline providing tailwinds to demand over the next two\nyears, it appears reasonable to expect the shorter-run neutral rate to rise somewhat higher\nthan the longer-run neutral rate. Further out, the policy path will depend on how the\neconomy evolves.\nThese developments raise the prospect that, at some point, the Committee’s\nsetting of the federal funds rate will exceed current estimates of the longer-run federal\nfunds rate. Indeed, the median projection in the SEP has this property. This raises the\npossibility of a flattening or inversion of the yield curve in the event that term premiums\ndo not rise from their currently very low levels.15\n15 The standard expectations hypothesis model decomposes longer-term interest rates into a component that\nrepresents the influence of expectations of future short-term interest rates and a “term premium.” Most\nestimates of the term premium, which are model-based, suggest that term premiums have been very low\nrecently, and some suggest that term premiums are roughly zero across the yield curve. If term premiums\nremain low and stable, the component associated with expectations of future short-term interest rates will\ndominate movements in long-term interest rates.\n\n- 9 -\nLike many of you, I am attentive to the historical observation that inversions of\nthe yield curve between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury rates have had a relatively\nreliable track record of preceding recessions in the United States.16 But unlike these\nhistorical episodes, today the current 10-year yield is very low at around 3 percent, which\nis well below the average of 6-1/4 percent during the decades before the crisis.\nPart of the reason the 10-year Treasury yield is unusually low is that market\nexpectations of interest rates in the longer run are themselves quite low, as discussed\nearlier. Another important reason the 10-year Treasury yield is very low is that the term\npremium has fallen to levels that are very low by historical standards. According to one\nestimate from Federal Reserve staff, the term premium has been slightly negative until\nvery recently and remains very low.17 By contrast, it was close to 100 basis points when\nthe spread between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields was at its peak of 325 basis\npoints in early 2010. This may temper somewhat the conclusions that we can draw from\nhistorical yield curve relationships characterized by a substantially higher term premium.\nIf the term premium remains very low, any given amount of monetary policy tightening\nwill lead to an inversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led\nto an inversion historically could do so today.\nOne reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed\ncorrelation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected\ninflation outcomes.18 The other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is\n16 See Estrella and Mishkin (1997); Johansson and Meldrum (2018); and Favara and others (2016) for more\nrecent analysis.\n17 See Kim and Wright (2005). The latest update is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/researchdata/feds200533.xls.\n18 See Chen, Engstrom, and Grishchenko (2016).\n\n- 10 -\nthe asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19 In this case, if the\nterm premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be\nto forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve.\nIt is worth highlighting that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP\nmedian is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and\ninflation around target. So, while I will keep a close watch on the yield curve as an\nimportant signal on financial conditions, I will want to interpret yield curve movements\nas one of several considerations informing appropriate policy.\nIndeed, the possibility that the projected policy path may have unintended\nconsequences is one of the compelling reasons for raising interest rates gradually. The\ngradual pace of interest rate increases anticipated in the SEP median path should give us\nsome time to assess the effects of our policies as we proceed.\nWhile the information available to us today suggests that a gradual path is\nappropriate, we would not hesitate to act decisively if circumstances were to change. If,\nfor example, underlying inflation were to move abruptly and unexpectedly higher, it\nmight be appropriate to depart from the gradual path. Stable inflation expectations is one\nof the key achievements of central banks in the past several decades, and we would\ndefend it vigorously.\nConclusion\nOur challenge is to sustain full employment and inflation at 2 percent, which is\nlikely to warrant continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate. With fiscal\nstimulus in the pipeline and financial conditions supportive of growth, the shorter-run\n19 See, for example, Li and Wei (2013); Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018); and Curcuru and others\n(2018).\n\n- 11 -\nneutral interest rate is likely to move up somewhat further, and it may well surpass the\nlonger-run equilibrium rate for some period. Beyond the near term, how much the\nneutral rate is likely to rise and whether it flattens or moderates further out will depend on\na variety of developments--such as whether fiscal stimulus is extended or expires,\nwhether foreign and trade risks grow or recede, and whether financial system\nvulnerabilities extend. As such, the gradual pace of rate increases implicit in the SEP’s\nmedian policy path incorporates a degree of caution, which is appropriate, in my view.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018a). “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, August 1,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180801a.htm.\n-------- (2018b). “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, July 31-August 1,\n2018,” press release, August 22,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180822a.htm.\nBrainard, Lael (2015). “Normalizing Monetary Policy When the Neutral Interest Rate Is\nLow,” speech delivered at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research,\nStanford, Calif., December 1,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151201a.htm.\n-------- (2017). “Understanding the Disconnect between Employment and Inflation with a\nLow Neutral Rate,” speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, New\nYork, September 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170905a.htm.\n-------- (2018). “Navigating Monetary Policy as Headwinds Shift to Tailwinds,” speech\ndelivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, March 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180306a.htm.\nChen, Andrew, Eric Engstrom, and Olesya Grishchenko (2016). “Has the Inflation Risk\nPremium Fallen?

I have been working with Benoît now for a decade—starting at our\nrespective Treasuries where we both were drafted as financial firefighters, migrating to\nour respective central banks to help with stabilization, recovery, and normalization, and\nmost recently preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. Over the course of that decade,\nI have developed deep admiration for Benoît’s keen insights and outstanding judgment.1\nEqually important, Benoît always has a plan. Generally, it is the right plan\naddressed to the right problem, and he executes it with exceptional efficacy and strong\nsupport. That is a rare and invaluable combination in public service. Indeed, Benoît’s\ntenure at the ECB coincided with an incredible turnaround in unemployment and output\ngrowth. Both the euro area and the global economy have benefited greatly from Benoît\nCoeuré’s outstanding public service.\nMoreover, Benoît’s research interests are forward-looking and extend well\nbeyond the macro economy. When Benoît was appointed chair of the Committee on\nPayments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), the global standard setter for payment\nissues, he doubled its output, resulting in 75 reports.2 He turned its focus to distributed\nledger, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies long before many other central\nbankers realized these issues would be transforming their worlds. Indeed, the number of\nGoogle searches for “central bank digital currencies” increased sharply over the course of\nBenoît’s tenure as chair of the CPMI.\n1 I am grateful to Paul Wong, David Mills, Theresa Dinh, and Lacy Douglas of the Federal Reserve Board\nfor assistance in preparing this text. These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily\nrepresent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See https://www.bis.org/cpmi.\n\n-2 -\nDigital Currencies, Money, and Payments\nI was asked to provide some brief thoughts about digital developments in the\nworld of monetary policy and central banking. At the start of Benoît’s ECB term,\nbitcoin’s market capitalization was small, and only a handful of cryptocurrencies existed.\nIn the eight years since then, bitcoin’s market capitalization has grown rapidly and now\nexceeds 100 billion euros, and thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created.3\nThe potential of “global stablecoins” to scale rapidly is evident from the\nincreasingly fast rates of technology adoption and the growth of large networks.\nAdoption rates for new technologies have accelerated over time. In 1921, 35 percent of\nU.S. households had telephone service, and it took 40 more years for telephone lines to\nreach 80 percent of homes. In contrast, the internet achieved the same level of adoption\nin only 13 years. More recently, smartphones and social media have achieved the same\nlevel of U.S. household adoption in less than a decade.4\nRapid adoption is also evident in the payments landscape, where network\nexternalities figure prominently. Between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of\n2019, transactions through Venmo grew over 66 times to $21 billion (18.5 billion euros).5\nSystems in other countries have also scaled rapidly. In China, mobile payments grew\nover 35 times during the same period to $8.2 trillion (7.2 trillion euros).6 India’s Unified\nPayments Interface (UPI) has grown even faster: between the fourth quarter of 2016 and\n3 See https://www.blockchain.com and https://www.coinmarketcap.com.\n4 Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2019), “Technology Adoption,” published online at\nOurWorldInData.org, retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption [Online Resource].\n5 “Venmo’s Monetization Will Be Worth Watching,” Business Insider, January 31, 2017,\nwww.businessinsider.com/venmos-monetization-will-be-worth-watching-2017-1.\n6 See http://www.iresearchchina.com/. Roughly 90 percent of mobile payments in China from 2014-19\nwere through Alipay and Tenpay.\n\n-3 -\nthe first quarter of 2019, the transaction value grew nearly 400 times to $49.7 billion\n(43.8 billion euros).7\nDigital currency payments projects from big technology firms that have network\nadvantages have the potential to scale even more rapidly. Because the utility of any\nmedium of exchange increases with the size of the network using it, the power of a\nstablecoin payment system depends on the breadth of its adoption. With nearly one-third\nof the global population as active users on Facebook, the Libra stablecoin project stands\nout for the speed with which its network could reach global scale in payments.\nStablecoin networks at global scale are leading us to revisit questions over what\nform money can take, who or what can issue it, and how payments can be recorded and\nsettled. While central bank money and commercial bank money are the foundations of the\nmodern financial system, nonbank private “money” or assets also facilitate transactions\namong a network of users. In some cases, such nonbank private assets may have value\nonly within the network, while in other cases, the issuer may promise convertibility to a\nsovereign currency, such that this becomes a liability of the issuing entity. Stablecoins\naspire to achieve the functions of traditional money without relying on confidence in an\nissuer—such as a central bank—to stand behind the “money.” For some potential\nstablecoins, a close assessment suggests users may have no rights with respect to the\nunderlying assets or any issuer.\nWe have already seen the growth of massive payments networks on existing\ndigital platforms, such as Alibaba and WeChat. So far, these networks operate within a\njurisdiction based on the sovereign currency as the unit of account, and balances are\n7 See https://www.npci.org.in/product-statistics/upi-product-statistics.\n\n- 4 -\ntransferable in and out of bank or credit card accounts. We have also seen the issuance of\nstablecoins on a smaller scale, such as Gemini or Paxos. What would set Facebook’s\nLibra apart, if it were to proceed, is the combination of an active-user network\nrepresenting more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private\ndigital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies.8\nLibra, like any stablecoin project with global scale and scope, must address a\ncore set of legal and regulatory challenges. A significant concern regarding Facebook’s\nLibra project is the potential for a payment system to be adopted globally in a short time\nperiod and to establish itself as a potentially new unit of account. Unlike social media\nplatforms or ridesharing applications, payment systems cannot be designed as they\ndevelop, due to the nexus with consumers’ financial security. This is why in many\njurisdictions, including the European Union, there is a regime to oversee retail payment\nsystems.\nWithout requisite safeguards, stablecoin networks at global scale may put\nconsumers at risk. Cryptocurrencies already pose a number of risks to the financial\nsystem, and these could be magnified by a widely accepted stablecoin for general use.\nEstimated losses from fraud and thefts associated with cryptocurrencies are rising at a\nstaggering pace – from $1.7 billion (1.4 billion euros) in 2018 to over $4.4 billion (3.9\nbillion euros) in 2019, based on one industry estimate.9 The hacking of exchanges\nrepresents a significant source of the theft, followed by the targeting of individual users\n8 Active-user network includes people who were using at least one of the company’s core products (i.e.,\nFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, or WhatsApp).\n9 Ciphertrace (2019b), Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2019 Q3, November,\nhttps://ciphertrace.com/q3-2019-cryptocurrency-anti-money-laundering-report/ and Ciphertrace (2019a),\nCryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2018 Q4, January 2019,\nhttps://ciphertrace.com/cryptocurrency-anti-money-laundering-report-q4-2018/.\n\n- 5 -\nthrough scams using QR codes, malware, and ransomware. These estimates reflect only\nknown fraud and thefts; it is likely that not all losses are reported and some amount of\ncryptocurrencies is lost or forgotten. In most cases, customers bear the losses.\nBy contrast, over many decades, consumers in the United States and euro area\nhave come to expect strong safeguards on their bank accounts and the associated\npayments. Statutory and regulatory protections on bank accounts in the United States\nmean that consumers can reasonably expect their deposits to be insured up to a limit;\nmany fraudulent transactions to be the liability of the bank; transfers to be available\nwithin specified periods; and clear, standardized disclosures about account fees and\ninterest payments. Not only is it not clear whether comparable protections will be in\nplace with Libra, or what recourse consumers will have, but it is not even clear how much\nprice risk consumers will face since they do not appear to have rights to the stablecoin’s\nunderlying assets.\nAnti-money laundering (AML), counterterrorist financing (CTF), and know-your-\ncustomer (KYC) requirements are significant concerns. In one industry report,\nresearchers found that roughly two-thirds of the 120 most popular cryptocurrency\nexchanges have weak AML, CTF, and KYC practices.10 Only a third of the most popular\nexchanges require ID verification and proof of address to make a deposit or withdrawal.\nThis is troubling, since a number of studies conclude that cryptocurrencies support a\nsignificant amount of illicit activity. One study estimated that more than a quarter of\n10 Ciphertrace (2019b).\n\n- 6 -\nbitcoin users and roughly half of bitcoin transactions, for example, are associated with\nillegal activity.11\nThere are also questions related to the implications of a widely used stablecoin\nfor financial stability. If not managed effectively, liquidity, credit, market, or operational\nrisks, alone or in combination, could trigger a loss of confidence and run-like behavior.\nThis could be exacerbated by the lack of clarity about the management of reserves and\nthe rights and responsibilities of various market participants in the network. The risks\nand spillovers could be amplified by potential ambiguity surrounding the ability of\nofficial authorities to provide oversight, backstop liquidity, and collaborate across\nborders.\nThe precise risks would depend on the design of the cryptocurrency as well as the\nscale of adoption. The effect of a stablecoin on financial stability, for example, would be\ndriven in part by how the stablecoin is tied to an asset (if at all) and the features of the\nasset itself. A stablecoin tied one-to-one to an individual currency would have different\nimplications than one tied to a basket of currencies. A stablecoin that is built on a\npermissioned network would have different risk implications than a permissionless\nnetwork, which may be more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing\nrisks. A stablecoin used solely by commercial banks would have a different risk profile\nthan one for consumer use.\nSimilarly, there are potential implications for monetary policy. For smaller\neconomies, there may be material effects on monetary policy from private sector digital\n11 Sean Foley, Jonathan R Karlsen, and Tālis J Putniņš (2019), “Sex, Drugs, and Bitcoin: How Much Illegal\nActivity Is Financed Through Cryptocurrencies?,” The Review of Financial Studies, volume 32(5), (May),\npp. 1798–1853, https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhz015.\n\n- 7 -\ncurrencies as well as foreign central bank digital currencies. In many respects, these\neffects may be similar to dollarization aside from the fast pace and wide scope of\nadoption.\nThe Work Ahead\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies—and particularly stablecoins—has raised\nimportant questions for central banks and other authorities, including on the appropriate\nregulatory framework. In the United States, the regulatory framework for\ncryptocurrencies is not straightforward. Our current framework is based largely on\nwhether a cryptocurrency is deemed to be a security or has associated derivative financial\nproducts and whether the participating institutions have a supervisory agency overseeing\ntheir activities. Unlike many other jurisdictions, regulators do not have plenary authority\nover retail payments in the United States. Moreover, the regulatory challenges are likely\nto be inherently cross-border in nature. Because stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies\nare unlikely to be bound by physical borders, regulatory actions in one jurisdiction are\nunlikely to be fully effective without coordinated action elsewhere.\nThe prospect of global stablecoin payment systems has intensified the interest in\ncentral bank digital currencies. Central bank digital currency typically refers to a new\ntype of central bank liability that could be held directly by households and businesses\nwithout the involvement of a commercial bank intermediary.12 Proponents argue that\ncentral bank digital currencies would be a safer alternative to privately issued stablecoins\nbecause they would be a direct liability of the central bank. A more relevant question\nmay be whether some intermediate solutions may be able to offer the safety and benefits\n12 The Federal Reserve and other central banks currently provide money digitally in the form of central\nbank deposits in traditional reserve or settlement accounts.\n\n- 8 -\nof real-time digital payments based on sovereign currencies without necessitating radical\ntransformation of the financial system.\nIn the United States, there are important advantages associated with current\narrangements. Physical cash in circulation for the U.S. dollar continues to rise due to\nrobust demand, and the dollar plays an important role as a reserve currency globally.\nMoreover, we have a robust and diverse banking system that provides important services\nalong with a widely available and expanding variety of digital payment options that build\non the existing institutional framework with its important safeguards.\nCircumstances where the central bank issues digital currency directly to consumer\naccounts for general-purpose use would raise profound legal, policy, and operational\nquestions. That said, it is important to study whether we can do more to provide safer,\nless expensive, faster, or otherwise more efficient payments. Some jurisdictions are likely\nto move in this direction faster than others, based on the particular attributes of their\npayments and currency systems. At the Federal Reserve, we look forward to\ncollaborating with other jurisdictions as we continue to analyze the potential benefits and\ncosts of central bank digital currencies.\nMost immediately, the Federal Reserve is actively working to introduce a faster\npayment system for the United States, to improve the speed and lower the cost of\nconsumer payments. In many countries, consumers are already able to make real-time\npayments at low cost. This summer, the Federal Reserve announced the first new\npayment service in more than 40 years—the FedNow Service—to provide a platform for\nconsumers and businesses to send and receive payments immediately and securely 24\nhours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n- 9 -\nAs the public and private sectors work to reduce payment frictions, one of the\nmost important use cases is for cross-border payments, such as remittances. Current\ncross-border payments solutions are often slow, cumbersome, and opaque. Authorities in\nmany jurisdictions, including the United States, recognize the importance of cooperating\nacross borders with each other and the private sector to address these cross-border\nfrictions.13\nTechnology will continue driving rapid change in the way we make payments and\nthe concept of “money.” As central bankers, we recognize the power of technology and\ninnovation to transform the financial system and reduce frictions and delays, and the\nimportance of preserving consumer protections, data privacy and security, financial\nstability, and monetary policy transmission and guarding against illicit activity and cyber\nrisks. Given the stakes, any global payments network should be expected to meet a high\nthreshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching operations. The work\nahead is not easy—the policy issues are complex, the coordination challenges are\nsignificant, and there are likely to be few simple fixes. Because the road ahead is\ncomplicated and challenging, I am especially pleased that Benoît will continue to help us\nnavigate these issues as the new Head of the Bank for International Settlements’\nInnovation Hub.\n13 Similarly, the introduction of a central bank digital currency in one country could affect other\njurisdictions.\n\nUpdate on Digital Currencies,\nStablecoins, and the Challenges Ahead\nLael Brainard\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nDecember 18, 2019\n\nStrengthening Jobs and Growth\n2\n\nIncreasing Research Output\n3\n\nAnd Turning to New Challenges…\n4\n\nIn Eight Short Years…\n2086\n1355\n617\n551\n491\n67\n4 6\n5\n\nNew Technology Adoption is Accelerating\n6\n\nThe Value of Payment Networks Increases with Scale\n7\n\nA Notable Share of the Global Population is\nActive on Some Social Media Platforms\n8",

The\nreduced scope to cut the interest rate could increase the frequency and duration of periods\nwhen the policy rate is pinned close to zero, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is\nbelow target. In turn, the greater likelihood of extended periods of low inflation at the\nlower bound risks eroding inflation expectations and further compressing the scope for\ncutting the interest rate. The risk here is a downward spiral where the scope for cutting\nthe interest rate gets compressed even further, the lower bound binds even more\nfrequently, and it becomes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and\ninflation back up to target. The experience of some foreign central banks illustrates the\nchallenges associated with such a downward spiral.\nSecond, underlying trend inflation appears to be somewhat below the\nCommittee’s 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.4 The near decade\nof inflation persistently short of 2 percent creates the risk that households and businesses\ncome to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in a\nway that fulfills that expectation, which greatly complicates the task of monetary policy.\nWhile inflation expectations are difficult to measure with precision, some market-based\nand survey-based indicators show signs of a downward drift.

It also means\nthat it is harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis when\ninflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent.\nKey Changes in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Strategy\nThe new statement on goals and strategy responds to these features of the new\nnormal in a compelling and pragmatic way by making four important changes. First, the\nstatement defines the statutory maximum level of employment as a broad-based and\ninclusive goal and eliminates the reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run\nnormal unemployment rate.6 The longstanding presumption that accommodation should\nbe reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears the neutral rate in\nanticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize risks an unwarranted loss of\nopportunity for many Americans. llow the labor market to continue\nhealing after the unemployment ra tTeh eef fdeecctiivseiolyn rteoa cahed the 5 percent median Summary\n5 Lael Brainard (2015), “Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the 57th National\nAssociation for Business Economics Annual Meeting, Washington, D.C., October 12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151012a.htm.\n6 In the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the longer-run unemployment rate represents\neach participant’s assessment of the rate to which the unemployment rate would be expected to converge\nunder appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The SEP is an\naddendum to the FOMC meeting minutes, which are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nof Economic Projections (SEP) estimate of the normal unemployment rate in the fourth\nquarter of 2015 supported a further decrease of 3½ percentage points in the Black\nunemployment rate and of 2¼ percentage points in the Hispanic unemployment rate, as\nwell as an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the labor force participation rate of\nprime-age women. It also created conditions for the entry of a further 3½ million prime-\nage Americans into the labor force, a movement of nearly 1 million people out of long-\nterm unemployment, and opportunities for 2 million involuntary part-time workers to\nsecure full-time jobs.7 Beyond that, had the changes to monetary policy goals and\nstrategy we made in the new statement been in place several years ago, it is likely that\naccommodation would have been withdrawn later, and the gains would have been\ngreater.\nInstead of an aggregate “normal” unemployment rate, the Committee’s\ncommitment to defining the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and\ninclusive goal, together with our continued commitment to consider a wide range of\nindicators, may be particularly significant for the groups that are most vulnerable to\nemployment fluctuations.8 Both research and experience suggest the groups that face the\ngreatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience\nlayoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.\nResearch by the Federal Reserve Board staff finds that unemployment rates, as well as\n7 These numbers are based on the observed changes in various aggregate labor market statistics between the\nfourth quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2019—the last quarter of data unaffected by the COVID-19\npandemic.\n8 See Janet L.

By committing to seek inflation\nthat averages 2 percent over time, FAIT means that appropriate monetary policy would\nlikely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for a\nperiod, such as the present, when it has been persistently below 2 percent. 13 Consistent\nwith this, I would expect the Committee to accommodate rather than offset inflationary\npressures moderately above 2 percent, in a process of opportunistic reflation.\nFlexible average inflation targeting is a pragmatic way to implement a makeup\nstrategy, which is essential to arrest any downward drift in inflation expectations.14\nWhile a formal average inflation target (AIT) rule is appealing in theory, there are likely\nto be communications and implementation challenges in practice related to time-\nconsistency and the mechanical nature of such rules. Analysis suggests it could take\nmany years with a formal AIT rule to return the price level to target following a lower-\nbound episode, and a mechanical AIT rule is likely to become increasingly difficult to\nexplain and implement as conditions change over time.15 In contrast, FAIT is better\nsuited for the highly uncertain and dynamic context in which policymaking takes place.\nIn my mind, the commitment to undertake a review of the new strategy and goals\nin roughly five years is a necessary complement to the flexibility embedded in the new\ninflation averaging strategy. Since the Committee is adopting a new approach, it is\n13 See Lael Brainard (2019), “Federal Reserve Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and\nCommunications: Some Preliminary Views,” speech delivered at the presentation of the 2019 William F.\nButler Award, New York Association for Business Economics, New York, November 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20191126a.htm.\n14 See Ben S.

As such, the five-year review will provide a vital checkpoint to see how well\nflexible average inflation targeting is working and, in my thinking, provide some insights\ninto an appropriate makeup period. Depending on conditions at the time of the review,\nthe Committee will have the opportunity to tweak FAIT or to make a more fundamental\nchange, if deemed necessary.\nThird, the statement highlights an important change in the Committee’s reaction\nfunction. Whereas previously it sought to mitigate deviations of employment and\ninflation from their targets in either direction, the Committee will now seek “to mitigate\nshortfalls of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum level and\ndeviations of inflation from its longer-run goal.” This change implies that the Committee\neffectively will set monetary policy to minimize the welfare costs of shortfalls of\nemployment from its maximum and not preemptively withdraw support based on a\nhistorically steeper Phillips curve that is not currently in evidence and inflation that is\ncorrespondingly much less likely to materialize.16 Consistent with this, the statement\ndrops language about a “balanced approach” that might be interpreted as calling for the\npreemptive withdrawal of accommodation and replaces it with a more accurate\ndescription of how we pursue our dual-mandate goals in parallel.\n16 As we heard consistently in the Fed Listens events, in many circumstances, consumers and businesses\ncan see very low inflation as having benefits at the individual level. In contrast, at the aggregate level,\ninflation that is too low can make it very challenging for monetary policy to cut the short-term interest rate\nsufficiently to support the economy effectively in a downturn.\n\n- 8 -\nFourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial\nCrisis—that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. The same changes in the macroeconomic\nenvironment that prompted our monetary policy review have important implications for\nfinancial stability. Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to\nrise as the economy heated up. The rise in inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to\nraise interest rates to restrictive levels, which would have the effect of tightening\nfinancial conditions more broadly. In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of\nbehavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation,\nwere notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.\nWith a flat Phillips curve and low inflation, the Committee would have to sustain\nthe federal funds rate below the neutral rate for much longer in order to push inflation\nback to target sustainably. The resulting expectation of lower-for-longer interest rates,\nalong with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is conducive to increasing risk\nappetite, reach-for-yield behavior, and incentives for leverage—which can boost financial\nimbalances as an expansion extends. In this way, the combination of a low neutral rate, a\nflat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation can lead to more cyclical volatility in\nasset prices. With financial stability risks more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is\nvital to use macroprudential as well as standard prudential tools as the first line of\ndefense in order to allow monetary policy to remain focused on achieving maximum\nemployment and 2 percent average inflation.17\n17 See Lael Brainard (2019), “Financial Stability,” statement before the House Financial Services\nSubcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions, U.S. House of Representatives,\nSeptember 25, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/brainard20190925a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nSupporting the Recovery\nThe Committee’s new statement on goals and strategy will put us in a stronger\nposition to support a full and timely recovery in employment and average inflation of\n2 percent. Overall financial conditions are supportive. Encouragingly, the housing sector\nhas rebounded strongly from its initial decline, supported by historically low mortgage\nrates, and consumer spending on goods has held up well, in part reflecting earlier fiscal\nsupport.18 At the same time, however, the strong pace of improvement in employment in\nMay and June, which was importantly driven by recall hiring out of temporary layoffs,\nappears to have slowed.19 And on the inflation front, despite some bounceback in July,\ninflation remains weaker than pre-crisis, and it is likely to take some time to return closer\nto target.20\nLooking ahead, the economy continues to face considerable uncertainty\nassociated with the vagaries of the COVID-19 pandemic, and risks are tilted to the\ndownside. The longer COVID-19-related uncertainty persists, the greater the risk of\nshuttered businesses and permanent layoffs in some sectors. While the virus remains the\nmost important factor, the magnitude and timing of further fiscal support is a key factor\nfor the outlook. As was true in the first phase of the crisis, fiscal support will remain\nessential to sustaining many families and businesses.\n18 In the housing sector, single-family construction permits and sales of both new and existing homes\nincreased in June and July, and have returned to pre-pandemic levels. In the consumption sector, goods\nspending posted robust gains in both June and July, and is now well above pre-crisis levels. The data on\nbusiness investment—including shipments of nondefense capital goods for June and July—have also\nsurprised to the upside.\n19 After falling by 22.2 million over March and April, nonfarm payroll employment increased by\n7.5 million over May and June and by 1.8 million in July. Furthermore, various high-frequency indicators\ntracked by Federal Reserve Board staff—including initial claims for unemployment insurance and\nemployment in small businesses—suggest that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed.\n20 This refers to inflation as measured by the price index of personal consumption expenditures excluding\nfood and energy.\n\n- 10 -\nWith the recovery likely to face COVID-19-related headwinds for some time, in\ncoming months, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from stabilization to\naccommodation. As we move to the next phase of monetary policy, we will be guided by\nthe Committee’s new goals and strategy statement. It will be important to provide the\nrequisite accommodation to achieve maximum employment and average inflation of 2\npercent over time, following persistent underperformance. While the Committee did not\nanticipate the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic when the review was\nlaunched, the new statement puts us in a stronger position to support a full and timely\nrecovery.21\n21 I would like to express appreciation for the leadership of the review by Chair Powell and Vice Chair\nClarida, the important contribution of President Williams, and the excellent and indispensable contribution\nof Ellen Meade of the Federal Reserve Board.

Like many of you, I have\nlong been interested in the potential for innovation to improve financial access for\nfamilies and small businesses who are underserved. The combination of smartphone\napps, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud technology holds out intriguing\npossibilities in financial services. But no single app is likely to be a silver bullet for the\ncomplex challenges faced by underserved households and small businesses. Achieving\ninclusion will require a holistic understanding of the challenges faced by underserved\ngroups in order to develop full stack solutions to address them.1\nFortunately, an emerging generation of metrics may offer a more complete picture\nof consumers’ financial needs. In addition, technological infrastructure is developing,\nsuch as faster payment systems, along with the potential for more transparent and simpler\nproduct offerings enabled by richer data and lower-cost processing. These new building\nblocks may make a difference on their own--and, more importantly, may be combined in\npowerful ways to bring end-to-end solutions to financial inclusion. I will briefly discuss\neach of these developments in turn.\nLessons from the First Wave\nLet’s start with the basic question of how to measure financial inclusion in order\nto evaluate the impact of financial innovations and inclusion policies. The World Bank’s\nGlobal Findex Database starts with a seemingly reasonable proxy for financial inclusion:\naccess to financial accounts. Having access to basic transaction and savings accounts has\n1 I am grateful to Kelvin Chen of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nbeen shown to be an important step to financial inclusion, particularly in developing\ncountries. For instance, a 2013 experiment provided savings accounts to a random\nsample of market vendors in Kenya, most of whom were women. The vendors with\naccounts saved at a higher rate and invested 60 percent more in their businesses relative\nto those who did not have accounts.2 Similarly, women-headed households in Nepal\nultimately spent more on nutritious foods and education when they received free savings\naccounts relative to those who did not.3\nUsing account access as a proxy for financial inclusion suggests substantial\nprogress has been made. According to the Findex Database, over two-thirds of adults\naround the globe now have some form of financial account, up from roughly half just\nseven years ago.4 This represents an increase of 800 million people. Here in the United\nStates, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) most recent survey of\nunbanked and underbanked households found that 7 percent of U.S. households in 2015\nwere “unbanked.”5 The unbanked rate was nearly a percentage point lower than the prior\nsurvey in 2013 and is lower than in earlier years. Even with this modest improvement,\n2 Pascaline Dupas and Jonathan Robinson, “Savings Constraints and Microenterprise Development:\nEvidence from a Field Experiment in Kenya,” American Economic Journal: Applied Economics (2013):\n163–192, https://web.stanford.edu/~pdupas/SavingsConstraints.pdf cited in World Bank Group, The Global\nFindex Database 2017 (2017).\n3 Silvia Prina, “Banking the poor via savings accounts: Evidence from a field experiment,” Journal of\nDevelopment Economics, vol. 115, (July 2015): 16–31,\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387815000061\n4 World Bank Group, The Global Findex Database 2017, (2017): xi, https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/.\nThe Findex Database is widely considered the authoritative database for measuring progress and need for\nfinancial inclusion from an international perspective.\n5 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2015 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked\nHouseholds (October 20, 2016), https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2015/2015report.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nhowever, lower-income and minority households have substantially higher rates of being\nunbanked.\nThe widespread adoption of mobile phones and the data they generate are\nexpected to extend these gains even further. The World Bank noted, for instance, that\nabout 1.1 billion unbanked people, about two-thirds of the unbanked population, has a\nmobile phone.6 Here in the United States, the Federal Reserve Board’s 2015 Survey of\nConsumers’ Use of Mobile Financial Services found that nearly 60 percent of the U.S.\nadult population had a smart (internet-enabled) phone. 7 It also found that the rates of\nmobile banking usage are higher among minorities. And even amongst the unbanked\npopulation, 40 percent of adults had access to a smartphone in their households; the same\nwas true for 70 percent of underbanked adults.\nAnother proxy used to gauge financial inclusion is access to credit. When I\nworked on microcredit 3 decades ago, it was very difficult to scale up the provision of\nloans to small businesses.8 Reaching small enterprises and evaluating their\ncreditworthiness was very expensive, especially in small cities and rural areas, and it was\ndifficult to secure loans with collateral. The high transaction costs were reflected in\ninterest rates many times greater than those available for established businesses in urban\nareas.\n6 The Global Findex Database 2017, 11, https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/.\n7 Federal Reserve Board, Consumers and Mobile Financial Services, 12, see table 4.\n8 See, e.g., Brainard, “Senegal Community and Enterprise Development Project” in C.

A recent analysis by staff at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Atlanta notes that automated fintech platforms have lower operating\ncosts relative to storefront payday lenders.9 A recent study by staff at the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York finds that fintech lenders process mortgages on average\n20 percent faster than traditional lenders. Of course, these differences focus on costs and\ndo not address loan pricing.10\nBut alongside these promising developments, we have also learned some\ncautionary tales from the early wave of fintech. In particular, while access to accounts\nand to credit may be beneficial, they are by no means sufficient to ensure financial\nresilience on their own.\nNot surprisingly, access to an account is only a small part of achieving financial\nhealth. The Findex database itself notes that a quarter of all accounts worldwide are\n“inactive,” meaning that there were no deposits or withdrawals made over the prior\n12 months. In some cases, customers that are provided financial accounts quickly return\nto the cash economy. For example, in 2014, India launched an ambitious financial\ninclusion program with the goal of connecting every citizen to a basic bank account that\n9 Larry D.

Before too long, however, it became\nevident that over a quarter of the new accounts held balances of one rupee or less.11\nAs for credit, fintech lending has moved beyond niche to the mainstream. In\n2010, fintech lenders made only 1 percent of personal loan originations in the United\nStates. By mid-2017, fintech lenders--often in conjunction with bank partners--were\nresponsible for nearly a third of the personal loan market.12 It is not clear how much of\nthis fintech lending is making a significant dent in financial inclusion, as opposed to\nserving prime and near-prime consumers in the United States.13 A 2017 study by\nTransUnion found that fintech lenders focused 59 percent of their originations in the near\nprime and prime risk tiers by the end of 2016--up marginally over the previous two\nyears.14 Researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Chicago found\nthat at least some fintech lenders were able to slot “some borrowers who would be\nclassified as subprime by traditional criteria” into better loan grades.15 But the\ndifferences from existing channels may not be large: TransUnion found that around\n11 See, e.g., “Financial inclusion is making great strides,” The Economist, May 3, 2018,\nhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/05/03/financial-inclusion-is-making-great-strides.\n12 John Wirth, “Fact or Fiction: Are FinTechs Different than Other Lenders,” TransUnion (blog),\nNovember 17, 2017, https://www.transunion.com/blog/fact-or-fiction-are-fintechs-different-than-other-\nlenders.\n13 See, e.g., Press Release, TransUnion, FinTechs Taking Larger Share of Personal Loan Market While\nIncreasing Portfolio Risk-Return Performance (Nov. 2, 2017), https://newsroom.transunion.com/fintechs-\ntaking-larger-share-of-personal-loan-market-while-increasing-portfolio-risk-return-performance /\n14 Wirth, “Fact or Fiction,” https://www.transunion.com/blog/fact-or-fiction-are-fintechs-different-than-\nother-lenders and TransUnion, “FinTechs Taking Larger Share of Personal Loan Market While Increasing\nPortfolio Risk-Return Performance,” press release, November 2, 2017,\nhttps://newsroom.transunion.com/fintechs-taking-larger-share-of-personal-loan-market-while-increasing-\nportfolio-risk-return-performance/.\n15 Julapa Jagtiani and Catharine Lemieux, “Do Fintech Lenders Penetrate Areas That Are Underserved by\nTraditional Banks?” Working Paper 18-13, (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, March 2018),\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2018/wp18-\n13.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\n10 percent of loans originated by fintech lenders were to subprime consumers, as\ncompared to 14 percent for the overall market for personal loans.\nWhat We Are Learning About Financial Inclusion\nAccount access and credit may be helpful and possibly even necessary\ncomponents of a solution. But they are unlikely to provide a complete solution on their\nown. Continued progress on financial inclusion is likely to require solutions that are\ndesigned with an understanding of the issues that underserved communities face.\nIn particular, it appears that many unbanked or underbanked people in the United\nStates are intentionally choosing not to maintain a bank account, which may hold clues to\nwhat underserved families and small businesses actually need. The data show that nearly\nhalf of the unbanked households actually had bank accounts in the past, based on a 2015\nFDIC survey.16 A third of these previously banked households explained that they\ncurrently did not have bank accounts because of high or unpredictable fees, as did\nroughly a fifth of unbanked households that previously did not have accounts. The single\nmost cited reason for not having accounts was not having “enough money.” More than\n10 percent of the unbanked explained that they simply “don’t trust banks.” Those\nfindings were echoed at an international level by the Findex database, where roughly a\nfifth of adults without a financial account cited a lack of trust in the financial system.17\nTo explore why consumers would choose to use alternative financial services over\ntraditional bank accounts, Lisa Servon of the University of Pennsylvania worked for both\n16 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households,\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2015/2015report.pdf.\n17 The Global Findex Database 2017, 5, https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/.\n\n- 7 -\na check-cashing firm and a payday lender.18 Servon observed that check-cashing firms\nused simple fee structures that were transparent and prominently displayed, similar to an\noverhead priced menu at a fast-food restaurant. As a result, individuals could understand\nclearly what fees they will have to pay up front. In contrast, checking accounts can be\nmore unpredictable. The funds from a deposited check may not be immediately\navailable. By the same token, it may not be clear exactly when the funds associated with\na payment by check are likely to be deducted from the account. That lack of\npredictability can be extremely important to a family that is living paycheck to paycheck.\nBouncing a rent check, phone payment, or utility payment can have a\ndestabilizing impact on day-to-day life with further knock-on effects and costs. When a\ncheck for a utility payment is rejected due to insufficient funds, for instance, the account\nholder may have to make time-consuming calls to get the lights turned back on, while\nalso struggling to pay the associated overdraft fee. That may, in turn, lead to a vexing\nchain of additional late payments and fees. A 2013 study by the Bureau of Consumer\nFinancial Protection found that more than a quarter of checking accounts in the study\nexperienced at least one overdraft fee in 2011.19 The average fee total for overdrawn\naccounts was $225, but varied as much as $200 between banks. Among bank customers\nwho bounced checks, a relatively small minority bore the brunt of the fees: A quarter of\n18 See, e.g., “What Is Driving the ‘Unbanking of America’?” National Public Radio, Fresh Air, January 10,\n2017, https://www.npr.org/2017/01/10/509126878/what-is-driving-the-unbanking-of-america, cited in\nWall, “Fintech and Financial Inclusion,”\nhttps://www.frbatlanta.org/cenfis/publications/notesfromthevault/08-fintech-and-financial-inclusion-2017-\n08-30.aspx#_edn6 .\n19 Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, “CFPB Study of Overdraft Programs,” white paper (June\n2013), https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201306_cfpb_whitepaper_overdraft-practices.pdf.

It is\ncommon to assess households’ earnings and living expenses in terms of annual totals.\nBut what keeps many people up at night is their ability to pay this week’s bills, especially\nwhen their paycheck is not coming until next week.\nThe U.S. Financial Diaries Project finds that the low- and moderate-income\nfamilies studied experienced fluctuations in income either 25 percent above or below\naverage for five months over the course of a year. Nearly a third of households whose\nannual incomes were twice the supplemental poverty measure dipped below the poverty\nline for at least one month during the year.21 The Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of\nHousehold Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) similarly finds that 10 percent of all\nadults self-reported that they struggled to pay their bills at least once in the past year due\nto volatile income.22 Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, the principal investigators\n20 The findings here refer to banks in the study “that tracked all incidences for all accounts opened at any\ntime during 2011.”\n21 See Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a\nWorld of Uncertainty (Princeton University Pres, 2017).

The Pew Charitable Trusts showed that 60 percent\nof households self-reported that over the prior 12 months, they had experienced at least\none financial shock, like a job change, divorce, major illness, or breakdown of a car or\nmajor household appliance.24 The median household spent half-a-month’s income on the\nmost expensive shock (the median expense being $2,000). Further complicating things,\nexpense shocks rarely occur on their own, but instead can cascade into additional\nexpenses and stress for families on the margins. Pew showed that a third of households\nthey studied self-reported two or more different financial shocks over the course of a\nyear.25 Morduch and Schneider found that 65 percent of spending spikes involved\nincreases in two categories of expenses, such as transportation and health care. In more\nthan half of the spending spikes they studied, spending was well above average in three\ncategories.26 Moreover, the spikes in expenses tended not to coincide with corresponding\nspikes in income.\n23 Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, “Mismatch: How Income and Expense Volatility Are\nUndermining Households,” Stanford Social Innovation Review, January 12, 2016,\nhttps://ssir.org/articles/entry/mismatch_how_income_and_expense_volatility_are_undermining_households\n24 The Pew Charitable Trusts, The Role of Emergency Savings in Family Financial Security:\nHow Do Families Cope With Financial Shocks?

Households in\nthe Financial Diaries expected to spend more than 80 percent of their savings within the\nyear. 27 Nearly half of households studied by the Pew Charitable Trust had not recovered\nfrom financial shocks at least six months afterward.28 And the Federal Reserve SHED\nfinds that 40 percent of adults report they would have difficulty covering an unexpected\nexpense of $400.29\nThis inability to plan for the future dramatically affects individuals’ ability to\nengage in the investments, such as cutting back on work hours to pursue education and\ntraining, and the risk-taking that is necessary to improve their financial lives.30\nAccess to credit can be an important part of weathering these shocks. The Federal\nReserve SHED finds that families with less access to credit are more likely to self-report\nfinancial hardship due to income volatility.31 But credit is only useful if consumers have\nthe means to repay the debt in a timely manner and stabilize their financial lives.\nResearch increasingly shows that borrowers often choose lenders based on their\n27 Morduch and Schneider, “Mismatch: How Income and Expense Volatility Are Undermining\nHouseholds,”\nhttps://ssir.org/articles/entry/mismatch_how_income_and_expense_volatility_are_undermining_households\n28 The Pew Charitable Trusts, The Role of Emergency Savings, http://www.pewtrusts.org/-\n/media/assets/2015/10/emergency-savings-report-1_artfinal.pdf.\n29 Federal Reserve Board, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households, 21,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-us-households-\n201805.pdf (“Over the past five years, as the economy has recovered, the fraction of families able to easily\ncover this emergency expense has increased by about 9 percentage points.”).\n30 See Marra, “The Financial Diaries Authors Discuss Income Volatility,”\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/bridges/fall-2017/financial-diaries-authors-income-volatility.\n31 Federal Reserve Board, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-us-households-\n201805.pdf.

Accordingly,\npolicymakers and financial services providers are beginning to assess financial inclusion\nin more nuanced ways. And, in parallel, new technological building blocks increasingly\ncan be used to build more full-stack approaches to financial inclusion.\nWhen considering how to think about progress, we are seeing a move away from\nbasic financial inclusion to a more holistic understanding of financial health. Financial\nhealth is more difficult to measure than bank accounts, and policymakers and researchers\nare learning how to better work with that complexity. For instance, when the Bureau of\n32 Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New\nYork, Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco, 2017 Small Business Credit Survey: Report\non Employer Firms, https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/fedsmallbusiness/files/2018/sbcs-\nemployer-firms-report.pdf.\n33 Kathleen Burke, Jonathan Lanning, Jesse Leary, and Jialan Wang, Bureau of Consumer Financial\nProtection, CFPB Data Point: Payday Lending, (March 2014),\nhttps://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201403_cfpb_report_payday-lending.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nConsumer Financial Protection released the findings of its research on financial well-\nbeing, it included a 10-item Financial Well-Being Scale Questionnaire, a self-evaluation\ntool designed to help an individual think comprehensively about his or her financial life.34\nThe questionnaire asks consumers to rate statements such as “I can enjoy life because of\nthe way I’m managing my money” and “I am securing my financial future.”\nSimilarly, this April, the Center for Financial Services Innovation announced the\nlaunch of a new data set that uses subjective consumer responses to survey questions and\npairs that information with actual data on their financial transactions.35 The regularly\nrefreshed data is designed to give industry, researchers, and policymakers better insight\ninto consumers’ financial lives by providing more accurate metrics for assessing changes\nover time. The new initiative, which they call “Financial Health Pulse,” aims to bring the\nsiloes of a consumer’s financial life into one comprehensive picture, encompassing\n“income, spending, savings, debt, retirement, and credit scores.”\nJust as we are learning how to assess financial health more effectively, we are\nalso seeing progress on tools that are specifically designed to address the challenges\nunderlying financial inclusion. Moreover, these tools can be built upon a new generation\n34 “Measuring financial well-being: A guide to using the CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale,” Bureau of\nConsumer Financial Protection, https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-\nwell-being-scale/.\n35 Center for Financial Services Innovation, “Center for Financial Services Innovation Launches ‘U.S.\nFinancial Health Pulse,’” press release, April 3, 2018, https://s3.amazonaws.com/cfsi-innovation-files-\n2018/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/27001554/U.S.-Financial-Health-Pulse-2018-Press-Release-FINAL-\nFOR-WEB.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nof platforms and other basic building blocks, which can be used in combination to\ndevelop more effective full-stack solutions.\nWithin the Federal Reserve System, we recognize that we have a role and,\npotentially, a responsibility to help create an infrastructure that facilitates safe,\ninnovative, and ubiquitous faster payment services. Earlier this month, we announced\nthat we are seeking public comment on whether the Reserve Banks should take a more\nactive role in modernizing our infrastructure to support interbank settlement of faster\npayments in real time.36\nFor households living paycheck to paycheck, the difference between waiting for a\npayment to clear and receiving a payment in real time is not merely an inconvenience; it\ncould tip the balance toward overdraft fees, bounced checks, or collection fees. Of\ncourse, faster payments would not address the root causes of financial fragility, but they\ncould help reduce the strain on some.37\nIn addition, many small businesses cite immediate access to working capital to\nfinance inventories or pay employees as their number one constraint on growth. If a\nsmall business could count on its customers’ payments being immediately accessible in\nits bank account, it could reduce the need for short-term financing to cover the costs of\nordering materials and goods well in advance.\nThis could also make a difference for the many hourly wage employees that\nreceive their pay in the form of paper checks. Electronic payments currently can take\n36 Lael Brainard, “Supporting Fast Payments for All,” (speech at the Fed Payments Improvement\nCommunity Forum, Chicago, IL, October 3, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20181003a.htm.\n37 See, e.g., Aaron Klein, How the Fed can help families living paycheck to paycheck, Brookings\n(November 22, 2017), https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-the-fed-can-help-families-living-\npaycheck-to-paycheck/.\n\n- 14 -\nmultiple days to process, so if an employer seeks to ensure that an employee receives\ntheir pay on the last day of a pay period, the employer usually has to release the funds a\nfew days in advance. With hourly employees, it can be hard to know how much pay is\nowed until the hours are actually worked. So employers may wait until the last day of the\npay period and then release a paper check at the end of the day, potentially leading to\ndelays for the employee in receiving the funds or a fee to obtain immediate availability.38\nFaster payment systems can change that. Employers would be able to push funds\nto employees shortly after their shifts have ended. Indeed, some “gig economy”\nemployers have begun to offer “instant pay” options that allow contractors to cash out\ntheir earnings as frequently as five times a day.39 But when these options recently\nstopped working for about a week, news reports cited comments from drivers that were\nhindered in their ability to refuel, pay rent, or buy groceries because they were\ntemporarily unable to access their pay as they earned it.40\nWe are similarly seeing infrastructure-level innovations in the basic accounts\noffered to consumers.

Some banks\nhave introduced innovative online-only accounts that are fee-free and require no\nminimum deposits, while offering phone-based deposits, account interfaces, and bill\npayment.41\nSome banks offer no-fee, phone-based accounts that incorporate savings and\nbudgeting tools that look and feel like nonbank fintech apps. Consumers can set goals\nand ask that the account begin “automatically” saving toward those objectives.42 For\nexample, consumers might be able to swipe to see how much they can safely spend on a\npurchase without falling behind on their financial goals or missing scheduled payments.\nWith other tools, using just their phone, a customer can set rules for their bank account,\nranging from declining transactions that would overdraw the account, to automatically\ntransferring funds from a related account, to opening an overdraft line of credit, or being\ncharged a fixed-dollar overdraft fee, with a one-day grace period to avoid the fee.\nNew platforms like faster payment systems have the potential to combine with\nother technological improvements, like cheap access to cloud computing and an open-\nsource approach to artificial intelligence, to create more full-stack approaches to financial\ninclusion.

Again and again, we are reminded that when\nproducts are free, the consumers themselves may be the product. For instance, many\nfinancial apps that provide “free” services earn revenue by being paid for lead generation.\nOther apps may sell consumer data in ways that consumers may not be aware of.46 For\nsome workers, their employers may be able to be part of the solution, by subsidizing\nsome or all of the costs of using these new tools. For example, some employers are\npartnering with fintechs to offer their employees better savings tools and the ability to\ndraw emergency funds as an advance on their paycheck.\nWhile financial innovation may hold great promise, a lot of work is needed to\nensure it will be able to reach communities that lack infrastructure for digital service\ndelivery.

Recognizing that the retail payment\ninfrastructure touches every American, a year ago, the Federal Reserve committed to build its\nfirst major new payment system in four decades. At that time, no one anticipated the challenges\nour nation would soon face. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the urgency and\nimportance of delivering a resilient instant payment system that is accessible to all Americans. 1\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is taking a tremendous toll on communities across America,\nespecially households and small businesses with the least liquid resources to weather the storm.2\nEmergency relief payments authorized in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security\nAct, or CARES Act, provided a vital lifeline for many households.3 The rapid expenditure of the\nCOVID emergency relief payments highlights the critical urgency of immediate access to funds\nfor the many households and businesses managing cash-flow constraints. After sharply reducing\ntheir spending early in the COVID crisis, many households increased their spending starting on\nthe day they received the emergency relief payments and continued for the following 10 days.4\n1 I am grateful to Kirstin Wells of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing this text. These remarks\nrepresent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n2 For information on the impact of COVID-19 on communities around the country, see Federal Reserve System,\nFedListens, Perspectives from the Public (Federal Reserve System, June 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/fedlistens-report-20200612.pdf; and Claire Kramer Mills and\nJessica Battisto, “Double Jeopardy: COVID-19’s Concentrated Health and Wealth Effects in Black Communities,\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York,” Brief (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, August 2020),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/DoubleJeopardy_COVID19andBlackOwnedBusine\nsses.\n3 Bhutta, Blair, Dettling, and Moore (2020) show that in the absence of the CARES Act, only half of families\nsuffering job loss would have been able to finance spending for six months using only liquid savings and standard\nunemployment benefits, while 94 percent of families would be able to maintain spending for six months with\nadditional benefits from the CARES Act, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3631903.\n4 Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer, Pagel, and Yannelis (2020) examine a panel of households using a financial planning\napp and find that these households responded quickly to CARES Act stimulus payments; see Scott R. Baker, R.A.\nFarrokhnia, Steffen Meyer, Michaela Pagel, and Constantine Yannelis, “Income, Liquidity, and the Consumption\nResponse to the 2020 Economic Stimulus Payments,” NBER Working Paper Series 27097 (Cambridge, Mass.:\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, May 2020), https://www.nber.org/papers/w27097.\n\n- 2 -\nThe rapid increase in spending was greatest for households with lower incomes, greater income\ndeclines, and lower liquid savings.5\nThe urgency with which the emergency payments were spent underscores the importance\nof rapid access to funds for many households and businesses that face cash flow constraints. The\nFederal Reserve, acting as Fiscal Agent for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, processed most\nof the CARES Act payments to households using direct deposit, prepaid debit cards, and checks,\nwhich can take several days between the time the funds are sent and the time recipients get\naccess to their funds. By contrast, the ability to disburse funds via instant payments could have\nhelped reduce the strain for those who needed the funds quickly in order to meet financial\nobligations. The same is true for other payments intended to provide immediate assistance, for\nexample, in the wake of natural disasters.\nIn good times as well as bad, instant payments will enable millions of American\nhouseholds and small businesses to get instant access to funds, rather than waiting days for\nchecks to clear. An instant payment infrastructure ensures the funds are available immediately,\nwhich could be especially important for households on fixed incomes or living paycheck to\npaycheck, when waiting days for the funds to be available to pay a bill can mean overdraft fees\nor late fees that can compound, or reliance on costly sources of credit. For small businesses, the\nability to receive customer payments instantly could help them manage cash flows when working\ncapital is tied up in materials or inventory.

One year ago, the Federal\nReserve announced we would build the FedNow Service to enable banks of every size and in\nevery community in America to provide safe and efficient instant payment services around the\nclock, every day of the year. 7 The FedNow Service will facilitate end-to-end instant payment\nservices for consumers and businesses, increase competition, and ensure equitable access to\nbanks of all sizes nationwide.\nThe Federal Reserve is uniquely positioned to build an instant payment infrastructure,\ngiven our long history of operating payment systems to promote a safe, efficient, and broadly\naccessible payment infrastructure. The decision to build an instant payment infrastructure\nreflected support from a broad set of stakeholders, including the vast majority of over 400\ncommenters that responded to the Board’s 2018 notice, as well as the U.S. Treasury.8 Our public\nmission in providing payment services is built on the proposition that all banks and the\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in\n2019, Featuring Supplemental Data from April 2020 (Washington: Board of Governors, May 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202005.pdf.\n7 Lael Brainard, “Delivering Fast Payments for All” (remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Town\nHall, August 5, 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20190805a.htm; “Supporting\nFast Payments for All” (remarks at the Fed Payments Improvement Community Forum, Chicago, October 3, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20181003a.htm.

Through the direct connections that we have with more than 10,000\nbanks, the FedNow Service will be broadly accessible to banks and the communities they serve\nacross the country.\nThe FedNow Service will not only expand but also strengthen the U.S. payment\ninfrastructure by operating alongside the private-sector instant payment service, the Clearing\nHouse’s RTP network. As they do for other payment services, many banks may choose to\nmaintain access to more than one instant payment service to attain resiliency through\nredundancy. Moreover, the Federal Reserve has always had a vital role in the payment system\nby providing liquidity and operational continuity in times of stress, and the FedNow Service will\nextend this role directly into the instant payment market. Together, the FedNow and RTP\nservices should significantly increase the speed and efficiency of the U.S. payment system. The\npresence of more than one service provider also brings the efficiency benefits associated with\ncompetition and benefits consumers, according to analysis from the U.S. Government\nAccountability Office.9\nThe First Year of Progress\nSince last August, the Federal Reserve has made substantial strides in developing the\nFedNow Service, including on the evaluation of prototypes of the core clearing and settlement\nfunctionality. Across the Federal Reserve System, work has continued apace, commensurate\nwith the high priority of the initiative, even as we have mobilized an unprecedented response to\n9 The GAO found that competition by the Federal Reserve in payment markets has generally had a positive impact,\nwith benefits that include lowered cost of processing payments for end users.

We have a team of over 100 people working on the program, including\nexperts drawn from across the Federal Reserve System and key external hires.\nSince we initiated the FedNow Service one year ago, we have been meeting our project\nmilestones, and today I am pleased to announce the Federal Reserve Board has approved the core\nfeatures and functionality based on extensive input from stakeholders. The FedNow Service\ndesign we are announcing today benefited tremendously from industry feedback, including\nalmost 200 comment letters responding to our notice regarding desired features and\nfunctionality. In addition to the core interbank clearing and settlement functionality that will\nenable consumers and businesses to send and receive instant payments through participating\nbanks, the FedNow Service will include features that enhance the usability of the service. We\nheard loud and clear from stakeholders the primary importance of getting this service to the\nmarket as quickly as possible. To meet this goal, we are announcing a phased approach that will\nenable the FedNow Service to get to market expeditiously with a core set of features and to\nexpand available features over time in response to changes in technology and market needs.\nLet me highlight several key features of the initial service offering. First, we heard\nstrong support for fraud tools within the FedNow Service to support banks’ efforts to mitigate\nthe risk of fraud with instant payments. Accordingly, upon implementation, banks will be able\nproactively to set parameters that limit transaction activity in the FedNow Service based on\nbanks’ knowledge of their own customers. As we gain insights from banks’ experience with the\ninitial set of fraud tools, we will explore other tools that may be valuable, including centralized\nmonitoring by the FedNow Service.\nSecond, banks told us they want to be able to ensure they have adequate funds in their\nFederal Reserve accounts on a 24x7x365 basis to cover outflows related to instant payments,\n\n- 6 -\nespecially during hours when existing payment services are not open and funds cannot be\ntransferred into Federal Reserve accounts to cover intraday overdrafts. Accordingly, we will\ndevelop a liquidity management tool that allows a participant with excess funds in its Federal\nReserve account to transfer funds to another participant who needs the funds on weekends,\nholidays, and after hours. Moreover, we will make the liquidity management tool available for\ninstant payments broadly, including to banks that choose not to participate in the FedNow\nService. Participants in a private-sector instant payments service will be able to use the tool to\ntransfer funds from their Federal Reserve accounts to the joint account at a Reserve Bank that\nbacks settlement in that service.\nThird, it will be important for the FedNow Service to be interoperable with the private-\nsector instant payment service to accomplish the goal of nationwide reach for instant payments.\nAs we have learned from experience with our other payment services, the form and timeline for\nachieving interoperability will depend on the level of commitment and engagement from\nstakeholders across the industry, including the operators of other instant payment settlement\nservices, both present and future. In part to facilitate interoperability, the FedNow Service\ndesign will use the widely accepted ISO 20022 message standard and other industry best\npractices.10 To the extent other instant payment services fully adopt the same publicly available,\nwidely accepted standards, this approach would enable a form of interoperability where banks\ncan route payments through either the FedNow Service or other instant payment services based\non the available path to the receiver. This is similar to the prevailing approach in payment card\ntransactions, for instance. We are also open to collaborating on a form of interoperability where\nmessages can be exchanged between the FedNow Service and private-sector instant payment\n10 The ISO 20022 standard is a message format standard for payments, securities, trade services, payment cards,\nand foreign exchange. For more information, see https://www.iso20022.org/.\n\n- 7 -\nservice operators, similar to the approach used in automated clearinghouse (ACH) systems.\nImplementing this approach would significantly increase the required level of commitment and\nactive engagement of the private-sector instant payment service operator from the outset.\nIn order to minimize time to market, additional features of the FedNow Service would be\nintroduced in phases after launch. It will be important for the FedNow Service to support alias-\nbased payments, whereby a payment can be sent to a recipient using an alias, such as an email\naddress or phone number, rather than requiring an account number. But providing this feature\nsecurely requires addressing legal, operational, and security challenges that would increase the\ntime to market for the core service. Balancing these considerations, we will explore the best\nways to add a directory service or other approach to alias-based payments with the goal of\nproviding this feature as a high priority following the initial launch.\nThe Road Ahead\nAs we proceed with the development of the FedNow Service, we will continue our\nengagement with a broad set of stakeholders to gain input on desired features and to work with\nbanks and their service providers on preparations to adopt the service. In May, the Federal\nReserve Banks announced the formation of the FedNow Community for stakeholders who would\nlike to help inform the development of the FedNow Service.11 The Community currently has\nover 500 members from all segments of the payment ecosystem. We are working with service\nproviders, recognizing their importance in providing essential payment processing services for\nthousands of banks in this country. We are also engaging directly with the fintech and software\ncompanies who provide customer-facing services that will help banks build innovative instant\n11 See the FedNow Community press release, Federal Reserve, “Federal Reserve Announces FedNowSM\nCommunity,” press release, May 6, 2020,\nhttps://frbservices.org/news/press-releases/050620-federal-reserve-announces-fednow-community.html.\n\n- 8 -\npayment products to serve their communities. The readiness of these stakeholders to support\nbanks’ participation in the FedNow Service and expand potential uses through value-added\nservices is key to widespread adoption of instant payments. We look forward to our continued\npartnership with banks and other stakeholders in this transformative initiative to deliver a safe\nand efficient instant payment system with national reach.\nIt has been an eventful year for retail payments with technology players introducing new\nbusiness models and accelerating the pace of digitalization. As the central bank, our focus on the\nsafety and integrity of the payment system means we need to ensure that payment innovations do\nnot come at the cost of security, reliability, or consumer protections. Some newer payment\nservices, while providing what has the look and feel of an instant payment experience for\nconsumers, in fact rely on legacy infrastructure that actually settles transactions on a deferred\nbasis, creating risk for consumers, banks, and the payment system overall. In contrast, the\nFedNow Service will offer real-time gross settlement of transactions, an approach that involves\neach transaction being processed individually and immediately, which avoids interbank credit\nrisk.\nEfforts by global stablecoin networks such as Facebook’s Libra project to drive the next\nstage of payment innovation have raised other fundamental questions about legal and regulatory\nsafeguards, financial stability, and the appropriate role of private money.12 The Federal Reserve\nremains optimistic about the power of technology and innovation to deliver payments safely,\nimmediately, and efficiently when the appropriate safeguards are in place.13 We are committed\n12 Lael Brainard, “Digital Currencies, Stablecoins, and the Evolving Payments Landscape”\n(remarks at The Future of Money in the Digital Age, Sponsored by the Peterson Institute for International\nEconomics and Princeton University’s Bendheim Center for Finance, Washington, D.C., October 16, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20191016a.htm.\n13 Lael Brainard, “The Digitalization of Payments and Currency: Some Issues for Consideration” (speech at the\nSymposium on the Future of Payments, Stanford, Calif., February 5, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200205a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nto building an instant payment system that delivers the payment speed that users want without\nbypassing the legal and regulatory protections they have come to expect from banking\nrelationships. Ultimately, the FedNow Service can be a catalyst for innovation in the market by\nproviding a neutral platform on which the private sector can build to offer safe, efficient instant\npayment services to users across the country. The promise of the FedNow Service is that it will\nprovide a modern payment infrastructure for the future, bringing the benefits of instant payments\nto communities across America and improving the way households, businesses, and government\nagencies make payments for many years to come.",

Some of these innovations hold considerable promise\nto reduce transaction costs and frictions, increase competition, and improve financial\ninclusion, but there are also potential risks. With technology driving profound change, it\nis important we prepare for the financial system of the future and not limit our thinking to\nthe financial system of today.1\nThe Evolving Digitalization and Decentralization of Finance\nIn recent years, there has been explosive growth in the development and adoption\nof new digital assets that leverage distributed ledger technologies and cryptography. The\nmarket capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew from less than $100 billion five years ago\nto a high of almost $3 trillion in November 2021 and is currently around $2 trillion.2\nIn parallel, we have seen rapid growth in the platforms that facilitate the crypto\nfinance ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. These crypto\nplatforms facilitate a variety of activities, including lending, trading, and custodying\ncrypto-assets, in some cases outside the traditional regulatory guardrails for investor and\nconsumer protection, market integrity, and transparency.\nThe growth in the crypto finance ecosystem is fueling demand for stablecoins—\ndigital assets that are intended to maintain stable value relative to reference assets, such\nas the U.S. dollar. Stablecoin supply grew nearly sixfold in 2021, from roughly $29\nbillion in January 2021 to $165 billion in January 2022. There is a high degree of\n1 I am grateful to Alexandra Fernandez, Lacy Douglas, David Mills, Sonja Danburg, and David Pope of the\nFederal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing this text.

So it is important to have strong frameworks for the quality\nand sufficiency of reserves and risk management and governance. As noted in a recent\nreport on stablecoins by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, it is\nimportant to guard against run risk, whereby the prospect of an issuer not being able to\npromptly and adequately meet redemption requests for the stablecoin at par could result\nin a sudden surge in redemption demand.4 It is also important to address settlement risk,\nwhereby funds settlement is not certain and final when expected, and systemic risk,\nwhereby the failure or distress of a stablecoin provider could adversely affect the broader\nfinancial system.5\n3 “Total Stablecoin Supply,” The Block, last modified on February 14, 2022,\nhttps://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins/total-stablecoin-supply-daily.\n4 President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Report on Stablecoins (Washington: President’s Working\nGroup on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, November 2021),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf.\n5 See “Virtual Hearing - Digital Assets and the Future of Finance: The President’s Working Group on\nFinancial Markets’ Report on Stablecoins,” February 8, 2022,\nhttps://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=409026.\n\n- 3 -\nThe prominence of crypto advertisements during the Super Bowl highlighted the\ngrowing engagement of retail investors in the crypto ecosystem.6 In late 2021, Pew\nResearch found that 16 percent of survey respondents reported having personally\ninvested in, traded, or otherwise used a cryptocurrency—up from less than 1 percent of\nrespondents in 2015.7 There is also rising interest among institutional investors.8 So it is\nperhaps not surprising that established financial intermediaries are undertaking efforts to\nexpand the crypto services and products they offer. If the past year is any guide, the\ncrypto financial system is likely to continue to grow and evolve in ways that increase\ninterconnectedness with the traditional financial system.\nAs a result, officials in many countries are undertaking efforts to understand and\nadapt to the transformation of the financial system. Many jurisdictions are making efforts\nto ensure statutory and regulatory frameworks apply like rules to like risks, and some\njurisdictions are issuing or contemplating issuing central bank currency in digital form.9\n6 Khristopher Brooks and Aimee Picchi, “Super Bowl ads 2022: Crypto companies are spending millions to\nwin over viewers,” CBS News, February 11, 2022, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-bowl-2022-\ncommercials-cryptocurrency/.\n7 The 2015 survey focused on Bitcoin use.

In light of the\nrapid digitalization of the financial system, the Federal Reserve has been thinking\ncritically about whether there is a role for a potential U.S. central bank digital currency\n(CBDC) in the digital payment landscape of the future and about its potential properties,\ncosts, and benefits.\nOur financial and payment system delivers important benefits today and is\ncontinuing to improve with developments like real-time payments. Nonetheless, certain\nchallenges remain, such as a lack of access to digital banking and payment services for\nsome Americans and expensive and slow cross-border payments. Growing interest in the\ndigital financial ecosystem suggests that technology is enabling potential improvements\nthat merit consideration.10 In addition, it is important to consider how new forms of\ncrypto-assets and digital money may affect the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities to\nmaintain financial stability, a safe and efficient payment system, household and business\naccess to safe central bank money, and maximum employment and price stability. It is\nprudent to explore whether there is a role for a CBDC to preserve some of the safe and\neffective elements of the financial system of the present in a way that is complementary\nto the private sector innovations transforming the financial landscape of the future.\nThe public and private sector play important complementary roles within the\nfinancial system in the United States. From Fedwire to FedNow, the Federal Reserve has\n10 Lael Brainard “The Future of Retail Payments in the United States” (speech at the FedNow Service\nWebinar, Washington, D.C., August 6, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200806a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nover a century of experience working to improve the infrastructure of the U.S. payment\nsystem to provide a resilient and adaptable foundation for dynamic private sector\nactivity.11 In parallel, private sector banks and nonbanks have competed to build the best\npossible products and services on top of that foundation and to meet the dollar-\ndenominated needs of consumers and investors at home and around the world. The result\nis a resilient payment system that is responsive to the changing needs of businesses,\nconsumers, and investors.\nWhile the official sector provides a stable currency, operates some important\npayment rails, and undertakes regulation and oversight of financial intermediaries and\ncritical financial market infrastructures, the private sector brings competitive forces\nencouraging efficiency and new product offerings and driving innovation. Responsible\ninnovation has the potential to increase financial inclusion and efficiency and to lower\ncosts within guardrails that protect consumers and investors and safeguard financial\nstability.\nAs we assess the range of future states of the financial system, it is prudent to\nconsider how to preserve ready public access to government-issued, risk-free currency in\nthe digital financial system—the digital equivalent of the Federal Reserve’s issuance of\nphysical currency. The Board recently issued a discussion paper that outlines the Federal\nReserve’s current thinking on the potential benefits, risks, and policy considerations of a\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Major Events in the History of the Federal\nReserve’s Role in the U.S. Payment System,” in The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does, 11th ed.\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf#page=91.\n\n- 6 -\nU.S. CBDC.12 The paper does not advance any specific policy outcome and does not\nsignal that the Board will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of\nissuing a U.S. CBDC. It lays out four CBDC design principles that analysis to date\nsuggests would best serve the needs of the United States if one were created. Those\nprinciples are that a potential CBDC should be privacy-protected, so consumer data and\nprivacy are safeguarded; intermediated, such that financial intermediaries rather than the\nFederal Reserve interface directly with consumers; widely transferable, so the payment\nsystem is not fragmented; and identity-verified, so law enforcement can continue to\ncombat money laundering and funding of terrorism.\nFinancial Stability\nGiven the Federal Reserve’s mandate to promote financial stability, any\nconsideration of a CBDC must include a robust evaluation of its impact on the stability of\nthe financial system—not only as it exists today but also as it may evolve in the future.\nIn consideration of the financial system today, it would be important to explore design\nfeatures that would ensure complementarity with established financial intermediation. A\nCBDC—depending on its features—could be attractive as a store of value and means of\npayment to the extent it is seen as the safest form of money.13 This could make it\nattractive to risk-averse users, perhaps leading to increased demand for the CBDC at the\n12 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age\nof Digital Transformation,” research paper (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, January 2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/money-and-payments-\n20220120.pdf.\n13 Bank for International Settlements, Central bank digital currencies: financial stability implications\n(Basel: Bank for International Settlements, September 2021),\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/othp42_fin_stab.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nexpense of other intermediaries during times of stress. So it is important to undertake\nresearch regarding the tools and design features that could be introduced to limit such\nrisks, such as offering a non-interest bearing CBDC and limiting the amount of CBDC an\nend user could hold or transfer.\nAs I noted at the start, the digital asset and payment ecosystem is evolving at a\nrapid pace. Thus, it is also important to contemplate the potential role of a CBDC to\npromote financial stability in a future financial system in which a growing range of\nconsumer payment and financial transactions would be conducted via digital currencies\nsuch as stablecoins. If current trends continue, the stablecoin market in the future could\ncome to be dominated by just one or two issuers. Depending on the characteristics of\nthese stablecoins, there could be large shifts in desired holdings between these\nstablecoins and deposits, leading to large-scale redemptions by risk-averse users at times\nof stress that could prove disruptive to financial stability. In such a future state, the\ncoexistence of CBDC alongside stablecoins and commercial bank money could prove\ncomplementary, by providing a safe central bank liability in the digital financial\necosystem, much like cash currently coexists with commercial bank money. It is\nessential that policymakers, including the Federal Reserve, plan for the future of the\npayment system and consider the full range of possible options to bring forward the\npotential benefits of new technologies, while safeguarding stability.\nInternational Considerations\nAnalysis of the potential future state of the financial system is not limited to the\ndomestic implications. The dollar is important to global financial markets: It is not only\n\n- 8 -\nthe predominant global reserve currency, but the dollar is also the most widely used\ncurrency in international payments.14\nDecisions by other major jurisdictions to issue CBDCs could bring important\nchanges to global financial markets that may prove more or less disruptive and that could\ninfluence the potential risks and benefits of a U.S. CBDC. Thus, it is wise to consider\nwhat the future states of global financial markets and transactions would look like both\nwith and without a Federal Reserve-issued CBDC. For example, the People’s Bank of\nChina has been piloting the digital yuan, also known as e-CNY, in numerous Chinese\ncities over the past two years.15 The substantial early progress on the digital yuan may\nhave implications for the evolution of cross-border payments and payment systems. And\nit may influence the development of norms and standards for cross-border digital\nfinancial transactions.\nIt is prudent to consider how the potential absence or issuance of a U.S. CBDC\ncould affect the use of the dollar in payments globally in future states where one or more\nmajor foreign currencies are issued in CBDC form. A U.S. CBDC may be one potential\nway to ensure that people around the world who use the dollar can continue to rely on the\nstrength and safety of U.S. currency to transact and conduct business in the digital\nfinancial system. More broadly, it is important to consider how the United States can\n14 Carol Bertaut, Bastian von Beschwitz, Stephanie Curcuru, “The International Role of the U.S. Dollar,”\nOctober 6, 2021, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-international-role-of-the-u-s-\ndollar-20211006.htm.\n15 Coco Feng, “China’s digital currency: e-CNY wallet nearly doubles user base in two months to 261\nmillion ahead of Winter Olympics,” South China Morning Post, January 19, 2022,\nhttps://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3163953/chinas-digital-currency-e-cny-wallet-nearly-\ndoubles-user-base-two.

Given the dollar’s important role as a payment instrument across the world, it is\nessential that the United States be on the frontier of research and policy development\nregarding CBDC, as international developments related to CBDC can have implications\nfor the global financial system.\nTechnology Research and Experimentation\nGiven the range of possible future states with significant digitization of the\nfinancial system, it is important that the Federal Reserve is actively engaging with the\nunderlying technologies. Our work to build 24x7x365 instant payments rails leverages\nlessons from some of today’s most resilient, high-performing, and large-scale technology\nplatforms across the globe. It is providing important insights on the clearing and\nsettlement models associated with real time payments as well as on fraud, cyber\nresilience, cloud computing, and related technologies.\nIn parallel with the Board’s public consultation on CBDC, the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has\ndeveloped a theoretical high-performance transaction processor for CBDC.16 They\nrecently published the resulting software under an open-source license as a way of\nengaging with the broader technical community and promoting transparency and\nverifiability.17\n16 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, “Project Hamilton Phase 1 A High Performance Payment Processing\nSystem Designed for Central Bank Digital Currencies,” news release, February 3, 2022,\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/press-releases/2022/frbb-and-mit-open-cbdc-phase-one.aspx.\n17 “A transaction processor for a hypothetical, general-purpose, central bank digital currency,” GitHub,\nhttps://github.com/mit-dci/opencbdc-tx.\n\n- 10 -\nMoreover, the Board is studying how innovations, such as distributed ledger\ntechnology, could improve the financial system. This work includes experimentation\nwith stablecoin interoperability and testing of retail payments across multiple distributed\npayment ledger systems. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently established an\nInnovation Center, focused on validating, designing, building, and launching new\nfinancial technology products and services for the central bank community.18\nThese technology research and development initiatives are vital to our\nresponsibilities to promote a safe and efficient payment system and financial stability,\nwhatever the future may bring.\nConclusion\nThe financial system is not standing still, and neither can we. The digital\nfinancial ecosystem is evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly connected with the\ntraditional financial system. It is prudent for the Board to understand the evolving\npayment landscape, the technological advancements and consumer demands driving this\nevolution, and the consequent policy choices as it seeks to fulfill its congressionally-\nmandated role to promote a safe, efficient, and inclusive system for U.S. dollar\ntransactions.19 To prepare for the financial system of the future, the Federal Reserve is\nengaging in research and experimentation with these new technologies and consulting\nclosely with public and private sector partners.\n18 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “New York Fed Launches the New York Innovation Center to\nSupport Financial Technology Innovation in Central Banking,” press release, November 29, 2021,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/aboutthefed/2021/20211129.\n19 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Fostering Payment and Settlement System\nSafety and Efficiency” in The Fed Explained, 11th ed.",

Your insights into local conditions and your long-standing customer relationships\nafford you a deep understanding of the needs and characteristics of the households and\nsmall businesses in your communities, and enable you to meet their credit needs\neffectively. The value of these relationships has never been more evident than during this\ncrisis—a fact that my colleague, Governor Michelle Bowman, highlighted yesterday\nwhen she said “it is no surprise that community banks are standing shoulder to shoulder\nwith their customers, on the front lines.” Governor Bowman referred to an Independent\nCommunity Bankers of America (ICBA) report that cites preliminary data on the\nPaycheck Protection Program that community banks have been the main source of\nlending for minority-owned small businesses during the pandemic and noted the same is\ntrue for veteran-owned businesses.2\nAs you know, last week, the Federal Reserve Board unanimously voted to\napprove an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA).3 The ANPR is built on ideas advanced by stakeholders.\n1 I am grateful to Amanda Roberts, Nancy Riley, and Joseph Firschein of the Federal Reserve Board for\ntheir assistance in preparing this text. These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily\nrepresent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Independent Community Bankers of America, \"Data Show Community Banks Lead Economic\nRecovery,\" news release, August 19, 2020. Also see, Michelle W. Bowman, “Community Banks Rise to\nthe Challenge” (speech at the “Community Banking in the 21st Century” Research Conference, St. Louis,\nMO, September 30, 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20200930a.htm.\n3 See Federal Reserve Board, “Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: the Community Reinvestment\nAct,” (September 21, 2020).\n\n- 2 -\nThroughout this process, the ICBA has been an important source of information, which\nhas provided the Federal Reserve valuable insights into the unique role and needs of\ncommunity banks as you invest in your communities. We have benefited from the\nICBA’s engagement on CRA both in the form of detailed comment letters and through a\nnumber of meetings to discuss different aspects of CRA reform. We thank you for your\nrobust engagement and trust that you see your input reflected in the ANPR.\nThroughout our outreach, we consistently heard from both bankers and\ncommunity groups that they value the CRA and that they want to see it improved and\nupdated. This was important feedback as we contemplated how to modernize the\nregulations, while still staying true to the core purpose of the statute to meet the broad\nrange of banking needs in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities and address\ninequities in credit access.\nOur first major goal for the ANPR was to strengthen the regulations in alignment\nwith the CRA statute. This means strengthening the regulations to ensure that a wide\nrange of LMI banking needs are being met. It also entails promoting financial inclusion\nby, among other things, providing credit for activities in areas with unmet needs outside\nof assessment areas, such as Indian Country. Additionally, we aim to create incentives\nfor investment in minority depository institutions and community development financial\ninstitutions, many of whom are ICBA members. We know that banking has evolved over\nthe past 25 years, so we also sought to update standards in light of changes to banking\nover time, including mobile and internet banking. Lastly, we wanted to continue to\npromote community engagement to inform the examination process.\n\n- 3 -\nOur second major goal for the ANPR was to provide greater certainty, tailor\nregulations, and minimize burden. The ANPR seeks feedback on several approaches\ndesigned to make the rules clearer, more transparent, and less subjective. For example,\nthe proposed metrics for the retail test and the community development test would\nprovide more clarity and transparency on how bank ratings are determined. In talking\nwith community banks, Federal Reserve staff and I also heard about the need for clearer\nstandards and greater limitations on the size of assessment areas—especially for small\nbanks operating just in a portion of a large county or only making a few loans in a part of\na county. The ANPR offers ideas to provide greater clarity in response to these concerns.\nImportantly, the ANPR proposes to tailor CRA to bank size and business model.\nIn discussing CRA reform with bankers and community organizations, it has been clear\nthat there is a need for a tailored approach for small banks and better outcomes for rural\ncommunities. I am encouraged that the ANPR offers ideas that advance these objectives.\nSo let me say a bit more about the proposals in the ANPR that are tailored to small banks.\nSmall retail banks could continue to have their retail lending activities evaluated\nunder the current framework, or they could elect to be evaluated under the proposed retail\nlending metric. Small banks that opt for the retail lending metric can also elect to have\nother activities considered. Additionally, the ANPR minimizes data collection and\nreporting burden by relying on existing data as much as possible, as well as exempting\nsmall banks from deposit and certain other data collection requirements.\nWe also heard from stakeholders like ICBA that rural areas, and banks in rural\nareas, have particular needs. Therefore, the ANPR proposes providing incentives for\nbanks in rural areas to participate in beneficial civic and other nonprofit activities (e.g.,\n\n- 4 -\nserving on a board of a civic institution) that may not have a primary purpose of\ncommunity development. In rural areas, bank participation in these kinds of activities\ncan make a difference in supporting economic development. The ANPR also seeks\nfeedback on providing CRA credit for bank volunteer activities in rural areas that do not\ninvolve the provision of financial or related services but have a clear community\ndevelopment purpose and greatly impact local communities, like helping to build\naffordable housing.\nOur final major goal of the ANPR is to provide a foundation for the agencies to\nconverge on a consistent approach that has broad support among stakeholders.\nStakeholders such as the ICBA have expressed strong support for the agencies to work\ntogether to modernize CRA. By reflecting stakeholder views and providing an\nappropriately long period for public comment, we hope the ANPR advances the goal of\nbuilding a foundation for the banking agencies to converge on a consistent approach that\nhas the broad support of stakeholders. All three regulators have benefited from\nstakeholder input provided through comment letters, roundtables, and meetings. There is\nsignificant interagency agreement on the objectives of CRA reform, and many of the\nideas in the ANPR reflect interagency discussions and regulatory proposals.\nIn closing, we look forward to modernizing the CRA in a way that strengthens the\nregulations to advance the core purposes of the statute, while providing greater certainty,\ntailoring regulations, and minimizing burden. We have appreciated the ICBA’s strong\nengagement throughout this process, and we look forward to your continued engagement\nas we seek to converge on a consistent approach that has broad stakeholder support.\nThank you.",

What better place to discuss digital currencies than in\nSan Francisco, home to so many technology innovators working on new ways to disrupt various\naspects of our daily lives? 1\nBecause of the transformative potential of digital currency and distributed ledger\ntechnologies, the Federal Reserve is actively monitoring digital innovations in the financial\nsystem. We have been keenly evaluating developments in fintech and digital currencies through\na multidisciplinary lens, combining information technology and policy analysis to study their\npotential implications for payments policy, supervision and regulation, financial stability,\nmonetary policy, and the provision of financial services. This work draws from expertise\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System and benefits from engagement with our colleagues\ninternationally.\nCryptocurrencies\nThe past decade has seen a wave of important new developments in digital technologies\nfor payments, clearing, and settlement. Cryptocurrencies represent the leading edge of this\ndigital wave. And it was the advent a decade ago of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, that first\ngave shape to the vision of a decentralized digital currency.\nAt the heart of any cryptocurrency is the creation of a new type of asset--the unit of the\ncryptocurrency itself--that is distinct from any traditional form of money used in routine\ntransactions, such as U.S. currency or checking accounts in commercial banks. A typical\ncryptocurrency would not be a liability of any individual or institution. There is no trusted\ninstitution standing behind it. This is in stark contrast to U.S. currency and reserve balances,\n1 I am grateful to David Mills of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. The remarks\nrepresent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nwhich are liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks, and deposit accounts, which are liabilities of a\nbank or another regulated depository institution backed by federal insurance up to a specific\nlevel. And while a typical cryptocurrency may be used in payments, it is not legal tender, in\ncontrast to U.S. currency.\nA typical cryptocurrency relies on the use of distributed ledger technology, which\nprovides a new way to keep ownership records and transfer ownership from one user to another,\noften with little to no information about the identity of the owner. For instance, Bitcoin relies on\nthe blockchain, which is run by anonymous computers all over the world linked together through\na ledger of anonymized transactions. Digital currencies use automation via computer processing\npower, networking via the internet, and cryptography to transfer value from one person to\nanother. What is innovative is that the computer code behind these transactions uses automated\nchecks and balances to validate the sender and receiver, and whether there is enough value in the\nsender’s account to make the payment. Traditionally, this validation would be done by banks\nand payment networks. Instead, with a cryptocurrency, this validation could be done by anyone\nwith enough computing power and resources to participate. Importantly, this technology is not\nowned or managed by any entity--regulated or not--that would be responsible for its\nmaintenance, security, and reliability. Rather, its maintenance, security, and reliability are\nhandled by a decentralized developer community, which often lacks strong governance.\nThis combination of a new asset, which is not a liability of any individual or institution,\nand a new recordkeeping and transfer technology, which is not maintained by any single\nindividual or institution, illustrates the powerful capabilities of today’s technologies. But there\nare also serious challenges. For instance, cryptocurrencies have exhibited periods of extreme\nvolatility. If you purchased Bitcoin in December 2017 at a value of over $19,000, your\n\n- 3 -\nelectronic claims would be worth close to half that today.2 Indeed, Bitcoin’s value has been\nknown to fluctuate by one-quarter in one day alone. Such extreme fluctuations limit an asset’s\nability to fulfill two of the classic functions of money: to act as a stable store of value that\npeople can hold and use predictably in the future, and to serve as a meaningful unit of account\nthat can be used to assign a comparable value of goods and services.\nIn addition to losses, individual investors should be careful to understand the potential for\nother risks.3 Cryptocurrencies may raise important investor and consumer protection issues.\nThe lack of strong governance and questions about the applicable legal framework for some\ncryptocurrencies may make consumers vulnerable to mistakes, thefts, and security breaches\nwithout much, or any, recourse. Although the cryptographic technology may be robust to some\nevents, such as the fraudulent double spending of the same units of the cryptocurrency for more\nthan one transaction, the large number of breaches at some cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet\nproviders suggest that significant vulnerabilities may remain with respect to security protections\naround customers’ accounts.4 These breaches remind us that relying solely on cryptography\nwithin the transfer technology is not enough. Ultimately, a more holistic approach to the security\nof the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, along with added layers of security on top of\ncryptography, are likely to be necessary for cryptocurrencies to be widely adopted.\nSome cryptocurrencies also appear quite vulnerable to money-laundering (BSA/AML, or\nBank Secrecy Act/anti-money-laundering) concerns. Since many cryptocurrencies store in their\n2 See, for example, https://www.coinbase.com/charts.\n3 Lael Brainard, “An Update on the Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Agenda” (speech delivered at the Center\nfor Global Economy and Business, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY, April 3, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180403a.htm.\n4 For example, Coincheck, a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange was hacked in 2018. See\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-worth-530-million-missing-from-japanese-exchange-1516988190. A\nsimilar attack occurred back in 2014 to another Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange, Mt. Gox. See\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/mt-gox-to-hold-news-conference-1393579356.\n\n- 4 -\nledger little to no information about the identity of owners of the cryptocurrency, this essentially\nmimics a bearer instrument--that is, an instrument whereby the holder of the instrument is\npresumed to be its owner. Further, cryptocurrencies are easy to transfer across borders. Indeed,\na cryptocurrency that mimics a bearer instrument and provides significant anonymity in\ntransactions, including across borders, could raise significant concerns regarding the potential to\nfacilitate illicit activities and associated money laundering. For example, electronic instruments\ncan be easily transferred and stored in large amounts, and peer-to-peer transactions outside of the\nUnited States could be very hard to prevent and detect. Such instruments appear to have proven\nsusceptible for use to convey payments to illicit actors--for example, to pay ransoms.\nOverall, however, the still relatively small scale of cryptocurrencies in relation to our\nbroader financial system and relatively limited connections to our banking sector suggest that\nthey do not currently pose a threat to financial stability.5 Of course, if cryptocurrencies were to\nachieve wide-scale use, or their impact were greatly magnified through leverage, the effects\ncould be broader. In particular, adverse developments and shifts in sentiment could cause a\nglobal rush to exit this market. As we have seen in other speculative activity in the past, rush-\nfor-the-exits behavior can aggravate price fluctuations, create trading difficulties, and even\ninduce market breakdowns. Thus, we will continue to monitor cryptocurrencies as they evolve,\nwith particular vigilance for any signs of growing materiality to the broader financial system.\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies\nGiven some of the inherent issues and challenges that cryptocurrencies pose for investor\nand consumer protection and the prevention of money laundering, some have advocated that\ncentral banks should create their own digital forms of currency as more stable and reliable\n5 See https://g20.org/sites/default/files/media/communique_-_fmcbg_march_2018.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nalternatives to cryptocurrencies. After all, a central bank digital currency could overcome the\nvolatility risks associated with an unbacked asset with no intrinsic value by substituting a digital\ninstrument that is the direct liability of the central bank. Moreover, advocates suggest a central\nbank would be able to develop a transfer mechanism that has robust governance.\nEven though central bank digital currencies may at first glance appear to address a\nnumber of challenges associated with the current crop of cryptocurrencies, this appeal may not\nwithstand closer scrutiny.6 First, there are serious technical and operational challenges that\nwould need to be overcome, such as the risk of creating a global target for cyberattacks or a\nready means of money laundering. For starters, with regard to money laundering risks, unless\nthere is the technological capability for effective identity authentication, a central bank digital\ncurrency would provide no improvement over physical notes and could be worse than current\nnoncash funds transfer systems, especially for a digital currency that could circulate worldwide.\nIn addition, putting a central bank currency in digital form could make it a very attractive target\nfor cyberattacks by giving threat actors a prominent platform on which to focus their efforts.\nAny implementation would need to adequately deal with a variety of cyber threats--especially for\na reserve currency like the U.S. dollar.\nSecond, the issuance of central bank digital currency could have implications for retail\nbanking beyond payments. If a successful central bank digital currency were to become widely\nused, it could become a substitute for retail banking deposits. This could restrict banks’ ability to\nmake loans for productive economic activities and have broader macroeconomic consequences.\nMoreover, the parallel coexistence of central bank digital currency with retail banking deposits\n6 See, for example, the recent joint Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and Markets Committee\nreport “Central Bank Digital Currencies,” March 2018, https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf. A Fed-issued\ndigital currency might have implications for the rates and terms of funding for U.S. financial institutions and even\nthe U.S. government as well as the transmission of monetary policy that I will not discuss here.\n\n- 6 -\ncould raise the risk of runs on the banking system in times of stress and so have adverse\nimplications for financial stability.\nFinally, there is no compelling demonstrated need for a Fed-issued digital currency.\nMost consumers and businesses in the U.S. already make retail payments electronically using\ndebit and credit cards, payment applications, and the automated clearinghouse network.\nMoreover, people are finding easy ways to make digital payments directly to other people\nthrough a variety of mobile apps. New private-sector real-time payments solutions are beginning\nto gain acceptance in the United States. And the Faster Payments Task Force has laid out a\nroadmap embraced by a variety of stakeholders for a fast, ubiquitous, and secure payments\nsystem to be in place in the United States in the next few years.7 In short, a multiplicity of\nmechanisms are likely to be available for American consumers to make payments electronically\nin real time. As such, it is not obvious what additional value a Fed-issued digital currency would\nprovide over and above these options.\nWholesale Digital Settlement Tokens\nIt is important for the Fed and other central banks to continue to research these issues as\ntechnology evolves, exploring the technical and economic possibilities and limitations of central-\nbank-issued digital currencies. Even though the case for a digital currency for general use may\nnot be compelling, opportunities for more targeted and restricted use may nonetheless prove to\nhave value. The private sector has been exploring a variety of ways of deploying the underlying\ntechnologies of digital assets that are native to a particular wholesale platform, to help to\n7See https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/faster-payments/path-to-faster-payments/.\n\n- 7 -\nfacilitate finality of settlement. Such wholesale digital settlement tokens could potentially\nreduce the time and costs required for wholesale financial transactions. This is being discussed,\nfor instance, for the use cases of interbank payments, securities settlements, and cross-border\ntransactions, where the introduction of a digital token native to a platform may facilitate certain\ntypes of settlement.\nLikewise, it is possible at some point in the future that a limited central bank digital\ninstrument that serves as a settlement asset for wholesale payment and settlement activity may\nhold some promise. Several central banks have been studying this issue, and we have been\nactively watching these developments.8 We are also interested in work that decouples the\nunderlying distributed ledger technology from cryptocurrencies and attempts to build on the\nbenefits of the technology, a topic to which I now turn.\nDistributed Ledger Technology\nEven if cryptocurrencies prove to have a very limited role in the future, the technology\nbehind them is likely to live on and offer improvements in the way we transfer and record more\ntraditional financial assets. Distributed ledger technology could also facilitate other applications\nthat could improve the way we share information, validate possessions, and handle logistics.\nRecall that distributed ledger technology is the mechanism for recordkeeping and transfer\nof ownership that underpins cryptocurrencies. Over the past few years, the financial industry has\nconducted a great deal of research and development on how to adapt the more promising aspects\nof distributed ledger technology for use with more traditional financial assets. The industry has\nmoved a number of these projects through a series of phases, often developing more incremental\nchanges at first in order to gain confidence in the technology before tackling large projects with\n8 For example, see Bank of Canada’s Project Jasper, https://www.bankofcanada.ca/research/digital-currencies-and-\nfintech/fintech-experiments-and-projects/.\n\n- 8 -\nsignificant operational impacts. The industry is making steady progress and some projects could\nbe live in some form this year.\nMany of the use cases focus on the areas of post-trade clearing and settlement of\nsecurities transactions, cross-border payments solutions, and trade finance. The common thread\nrunning through these use cases is the presence of operational “pain points” that generate\ninefficiencies and delays for users. For example, post-trade reconciliation of securities\ntransactions can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that involves numerous\nparties, operational steps, and message flows across the counterparties and their various agents\ninvolved in the transactions. Distributed ledger technology has the potential to provide\nsynchronized, real-time views for those counterparties and agents that can speed up the process\nand reduce errors.\nFor cross-border transactions, the process for sending payments via the existing\ncorrespondent banking network can add time and money. Distributed ledger technology could\npotentially lower the costs and time it takes funds to reach the recipient through more direct\nconnections, reducing the number of intermediaries required to effect the transaction.\nThe financial industry has been working on versions of distributed ledger technology that\nhelp address a number of concerns, including the loose governance around the maintenance,\nsecurity, and reliability of the technology for cryptocurrencies. Most projects are organized\neither as partnerships between technology and financial services firms or through consortia of\ntechnology firms, financial firms, and other interested parties. To some degree, these alliances\nmay provide prototype governance arrangements for future technology deployments in financial\nservices. In addition, there are exchanges and clearinghouses that are actively exploring the use\nof distributed ledger technology, which represent the more traditional model of multilateral\n\n- 9 -\norganization in the financial markets. Although the governance arrangements may need to\nevolve over time, one thing that is clear is that strong governance arrangements will be required\nto provide the coordinated operational and financial risk management for the critical clearing and\nsettlement operations that underpin our financial markets.\nIn addition, the industry continues to make progress on the ability of distributed ledger\ntechnology to handle the very large volumes of transactions that take place both in financial\nmarkets and in retail payments every day. As I highlighted in 2016, this technical challenge of\nachieving the necessary scale and through put is an important hurdle.9 Much of this challenge\nhas been tied to the time it takes to achieve “consensus” on a distributed ledger. Consensus is\nthe process by which new transactions are broadcast to all the participants, or nodes, in the\nnetwork and each node accepts those new transactions as valid additions to the ledger. The\ninitial consensus method used by Bitcoin, called “proof of work,” is designed to deal with the\nlack of information and trust among the users of the network by providing tools and incentives to\novercome this problem. But it is a highly resource-intensive process that limits the number of\ntransactions that can be processed each second. The proof of work consensus model represents a\ntradeoff between operational efficiency and scalability, on the one hand, and the ability to\noperate without sufficient trust or information about the entities in the network, on the other\nhand.\nFundamentally, however, the financial industry does not operate as a trustless network.\nRather, the industry has long specialized in the collection and analysis of information about\n9 Lael Brainard, “The Use of Distributed Ledger Technologies in Payment, Clearing, and Settlement” (speech\ndelivered at the Institute of International Finance Blockchain Roundtable, Washington, DC, April 14, 2016),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20160414a.htm; and Lael Brainard, “Distributed Ledger\nTechnology: Implications for Payments, Clearing, and Settlement” (speech delivered at the Institute of International\nFinance Annual Meeting Panel on Blockchain, Washington, DC, October 7, 2016),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20161007a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\ncustomers and counterparties as a core part of banking operations. Even allowing for the\ninevitable imperfect information that may result, it would seem natural for the financial industry\nto be able to leverage institutional information and trust in ways that allow for more efficient\nmethods to achieve consensus than proof of work. Consequently, the industry and the academic\ncommunity have focused a great deal of attention on various consensus methods that can provide\ngreater scalability either by leveraging trust, which relaxes some operational and incentive\nconstraints, or possibly by devising methods without trust that are much less resource intensive.\nSome of the technology firms working with the financial industry are taking different approaches\nin this fast-moving arena.\nAnother important challenge for the industry has been leveraging distributed ledger\ntechnology while preserving the confidentiality of transactional information. At its core,\ndistributed ledger technology is a shared ledger across multiple nodes in a network, likely\nrepresenting multiple firms and legal entities. Ownership records and transactions flows from\naccounts on such a ledger are typically copied and stored on all the nodes in the network. The\nfinancial industry, however, must develop distributed ledgers that adhere to laws, regulations,\nand policies that protect important information of the parties and their customers. Clearly, a\nmodel where every entity on the network can see everyone else’s account holdings and\ntransactions history will not satisfy broad industry confidentiality requirements. In addition,\nstored data that may be protected cryptographically today may not be protected as the technology\ncontinues to advance, which adds even more difficulty and urgency to the work on\nconfidentiality.\nThe industry has been working to develop approaches to preserve confidentiality so that\nonly the authorized parties relevant to a transaction can see the details recorded on the ledger.\n\n- 11 -\nSome of these approaches involve encrypting data on the ledger so that the ledgers can still be\ncopied across all the nodes in the network, but an entity cannot look at any element of that ledger\nexcept for transactions in which it has been involved. Other approaches include so-called zero-\nknowledge proofs or ring signatures that allow entities to validate transactions without seeing\nconfidential information. Still others are looking at platforms that connect multiple ledgers\nrather than having one single ledger that is copied across all nodes in the network. While\nquestions remain about the usefulness and viability of each of these approaches, it is important to\nunderscore that preserving confidentiality is an important area of research.\nFinally, perhaps the biggest potential benefit for payments, clearing, and settlement of\ndistributed ledger technology may be resiliency. Distributed ledger technology may enable a\nnetwork to continue to operate even if some of the nodes on the network are compromised\nbecause of the ability of the other nodes in the network to pick up the slack and continue\nprocessing transactions. One challenge going forward will be to understand the implications that\nthe confidentiality tools and different approaches to consensus under consideration may have on\nthe resilience of the distributed ledger. Given that resiliency is a key potential benefit of\ndistributed ledger technology over existing platforms, it is critical to understand the trade-offs\nbetween resiliency and a consensus method that focuses on operational speed, or between\nresilience and confidentiality.\nConclusion\nIt is an exciting time for the financial sector as digital innovations are challenging\nconventional thinking about currency, money, and payments. Cryptocurrencies are strikingly\ninnovative but also pose challenges associated with speculative dynamics, investor and consumer\nprotections, and money-laundering risks. Although central bank digital currencies may be able\n\n- 12 -\nto overcome some of the particular vulnerabilities that cryptocurrencies face, they too have\nsignificant challenges related to cybersecurity, money laundering, and the retail financial system.\nEven so, digital tokens for wholesale payments and some aspects of distributed ledger\ntechnology--the key technologies underlying cryptocurrencies--may hold promise for\nstrengthening traditional financial instruments and markets. I have highlighted a few key areas\nwhere the technology is advancing to deal with some important policy, business, and operational\nchallenges. The Federal Reserve is dedicated to continuing to monitor industry developments\nand conduct research in these vital areas. I remain optimistic that the financial sector will find\nvaluable ways to employ distributed ledger technology in the area of payments, clearing, and\nsettlement in coming years.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:00 p.m. EDT (1:00 p.m. CDT)\nSeptember 27, 2017\nLabor Market Disparities and Economic Performance\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Banking and the Economy: A Forum for Minority Bankers,” a conference hosted by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\nKansas City, Missouri\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\nI would like to thank President George and her staff at the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Kansas City for inviting me to participate in today’s conference, which is a joint effort\nof the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia,\nRichmond, and St. Louis as well as the Federal Reserve Board.1\nDiversity in Financial Services\nAs you may know, this is the second minority bankers forum hosted by the\nFederal Reserve System. Diversity and inclusion are important to the strength of the\nbanking industry, and therefore I am pleased that the Federal Reserve System is\nsponsoring this conference. Among other benefits, diversity and inclusion strengthen\norganizations by improving deliberations and decisionmaking. Banks with more diverse\nworkforces are also better able to reach broader groups of customers, especially\ncustomers who have historically been underbanked, when they show that serving those\ncustomers is a top priority. One of the most effective ways of showing a commitment to\na diverse customer base is showing a commitment to a diverse workforce.\nWe now have substantial empirical evidence documenting the benefits of\ndiversity in broadening the range of ideas and perspectives that are brought to bear on\nsolving problems, and thereby contributing to better outcomes, in research, policy, and\nbusiness. Studies suggest that increased diversity alters group dynamics and\ndecisionmaking in positive ways. Microeconomic experiments and other research have\nconfirmed these ideas. One experiment found that greater racial diversity helped groups\nof business students outperform other students in solving problems. And another found\n1 I am grateful to Amanda Roberts and Christopher Smith for their assistance in preparing this text. The\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nsimilar benefits from gender diversity. A study of 2.5 million research papers across the\nsciences found that those written by ethnically diverse research teams received more\ncitations and had a greater influence than papers by authors with the same ethnicity.2\nAs a bank regulator, the Federal Reserve has an interest in promoting diversity in\nthe financial services industry. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is\nactively engaged in developing diverse talent in the financial services industry as a key\npartner of the Financial Services Pipeline Initiative (FSP). The FSP is a collaborative of\nabout 20 financial services organizations that are working together to increase the\nrepresentation of Latinos and African Americans, at all levels, within the Chicago-area\nfinancial services industry. The members of this initiative recognize they have a\ncollective interest in developing a diverse pipeline of talent. They are more likely to be\nmore successful in achieving their internal pipeline goals if they succeed in improving\ndiversity and inclusion in the finance workforce more broadly.\nAnother example of our work to promote diversity at banking institutions is the\nstandards developed by the Board’s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion to promote\ntransparency and awareness of diversity policies and practices within banking\ninstitutions. The Board encourages banking institutions not only to provide their policies,\npractices, and self-assessment information to the Board, but also to disclose this\ninformation to the public. We hope that this new self-assessment tool will help\nindividual banks achieve their own diversity and inclusion goals and contribute to greater\ndiversity in the banking industry more generally.\n2 See Bayer and Rouse (2016).\n\n- 3 -\nI also want to take this opportunity to update you on what we are doing to\npreserve and promote Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs). Though I know that only\nsome of you work for MDIs, the Federal Reserve recognizes their vital role in serving\nlow- and moderate-income and minority communities as well as bringing diversity to the\nfield of banking. I make a point of meeting with the leadership of MDIs as I travel\naround the country so I can hear firsthand about the challenges these institutions face and\nthe important work they are doing to provide financial services to minority and\nhistorically underserved populations. I have heard from CEOs of MDIs about how\nchallenging it can be to simultaneously serve their target market and be a bank of choice\nin a competitive banking market. Some have managed to thread that needle successfully\nby remaining firmly rooted and accessible in the communities they serve as well as\nmaintaining their focus on trust, loyalty, and personalized relationship banking, which is\na particular strength and competitive advantage for MDIs.\nThe Federal Reserve has developed a national outreach program called the\nPartnership for Progress to assist MDIs in confronting business model challenges,\ncultivating safe banking practices, and competing more efficiently. Recently, the Board\ndoubled its resources for this program to better support MDIs. We brought to bear the\nresources of our community development function, which promotes economic growth\nand financial stability in lower-income communities. Combining the resources of our\nbanking and supervision staff with our community development staff allows us to be\nmore creative in supporting MDIs around the country. Recognizing that there has been a\ndearth of MDI research in recent decades, last year, for the first time, we commissioned\ntwo external researchers to develop papers on MDIs. The resulting new papers, along\n\n- 4 -\nwith another written by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, were\npresented at the interagency biennial MDI conference this past April in Los Angeles. We\nare in the process of commissioning research for next year in an effort to deepen our\nunderstanding of these unique institutions.\nLabor Market Disparities\nTurning to the workforce more broadly, I want to spend some of my time today\ntalking about disparities and share some findings from a conference we hosted yesterday\nat the Board titled “Disparities in the Labor Market: What Are We Missing?” In\nfulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target\nof 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum\nemployment. That is because the level of maximum employment depends on\n“nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,” which\n“may change over time and may not be directly measurable.”3 Understanding how close\nthe labor market is to our full-employment goal requires consulting a variety of evidence\nalong with a healthy dose of judgment. This approach to maximum employment has\nallowed the FOMC to navigate the current expansion in a way that has likely brought\nmore people back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed\nunemployment rate target based on pre-crisis standards.\nThe Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor\nforce participation, income, and wealth because they may have implications for the\ngrowth capacity of the economy. When we consider appropriate monetary policy, we\nneed to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive\n3 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nprice inflation. At a time when the retirement of the baby-boom generation looks likely\nto be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to\nconsider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for\nsome prime working-age groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could\nincrease the labor force and boost economic activity.\nMore broadly, when a person who was previously unemployed or discouraged\nsecures a job, not only does it boost the economy, but that person also may gain a greater\nsense of economic security, self-sufficiency, and self-worth and be better able to invest in\ntheir family’s future. With a richer understanding of economic or social barriers that\ninhibit labor market success and prosperity for some groups, we may better grasp how\nmuch these individuals can be helped by broad economic expansion and how much\ntargeted intervention is required through other policy means.4\nThere is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth\nrate and equality of opportunity. Large disparities in opportunity based on race, ethnicity,\ngender, or geography mean that the enterprise, exertion, and investments of households\nand businesses from different groups are not rewarded commensurately. To the extent\nthat disparities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect\nsuch disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged\ngroups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth\nwill fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.5\n4 For evidence on the relationship between monetary policy and labor market disparities between some\ndemographic groups, see Carpenter and Rodgers (2004).\n5 For more on inequality of opportunity see Marrero and Rodriquez (2013).\n\n- 6 -\nAside from reducing the long-run productive potential of the economy,\npersistently high levels of income and wealth inequality may also have implications for\nthe robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of aggregate\nspending in the United States. The gaps in household income and wealth between the\nrichest and poorest households are at historically high levels, as income and wealth have\nincreasingly accrued to the very richest households. For example, results from the\nFederal Reserve’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is due to be released\nsoon, indicate that the share of income held by the top 1 percent of households reached\n24 percent in 2015, up from 17 percent in 1988. The share of wealth held by the top\n1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.6 Some research\nsuggests that widening income and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in\nthe aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of\nany additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are\nlikely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.7\nDisparities by Race and Ethnicity\nWhen we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we find\nsignificant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.8 In August, the national\nunemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked\nsubstantial differences across different demographic groups. As shown in figure 1,\nunemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians,\n6 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data (to be released on September 27); for additional analysis of\nthese data, see Bricker and others (forthcoming).\n7 See Bernstein (2013) and Alichi, Kantenga, and Solè (2016) for more on the potential link between\nincome and wealth inequality and consumer spending.\n8 For a discussion of gender disparities, see Yellen (2015).\n\n- 7 -\n5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 7.7 percent for African Americans. Labor force\nparticipation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than\nunemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at 62.2 percent. These\ndifferences are not a recent development--similar differences across racial and ethnic\ndimensions have existed for as long as these data have been collected. Even more\nstriking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic\ngroups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age\nand education levels.9\nAlthough the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups\nare still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably\nduring the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades. Differences in\nunemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during\nrecessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and\nthese differences shrink during recoveries. For example, in the second quarter of 2017,\nthe unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 percentage points\nhigher than for white adult men. This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to\nthe smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.\nDifferences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women\nrelative to white women, and for Hispanics relative to whites. Since racial disparities\ntend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that\n9 See Cajner and others (2017) for more on racial gaps and the labor market.\n\n- 8 -\nracial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall\nunemployment rate falls further.10\nMore broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in\nsignificant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in families’ income and wealth.\nAccording to forthcoming findings from the latest SCF and as shown in figure 3, the\naverage income for white families in 2015 was about $123,000 per year, compared with\n$54,000 for black families and $57,000 for Hispanic families.11 Disparities in wealth,\nshown in figure 4, are even larger: Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016\nwere about $933,000, compared with $191,000 for Hispanic families and $138,000 for\nblack families.12 Moreover, these racial and ethnic gaps in average family income and\nwealth have generally widened rather than narrowed over the past few decades. Based on\nSCF data, median family wealth has grown much more rapidly for white families than for\nother families over the past few decades, while median family incomes have risen by\nabout the same amount for white, black, and Hispanic families.\nAs the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the\nsidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in\nemployment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue.\n10 Data on recent estimates of unemployment rates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity\nare available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Historical gaps are provided by Cajner and others\n(2017).\n11 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data. Recent estimates of household income from Current\nPopulation Survey data and reported by the Census in Semega, Fontenot, and Kollar (2017) are\nqualitatively similar, in that between 2013 and 2016 for both sets of data, family income has increased for\nwhites, blacks, and Hispanics (with greater increases, in percentage terms, for black and Hispanic families).\n12 Racial and ethnic differences in median income and wealth are somewhat smaller. For example, in 2016\nmedian income for white families was about $61,000, compared with $35,000 for black families and\n$39,000 for Hispanic families. Median wealth was about $171,000 for white families, compared with\nabout $20,000 for black and Hispanic families. The larger gap in average income and wealth than median\nincome and wealth reflects a greater concentration of income and wealth among the wealthiest white\nfamilies than for other races and ethnicities.\n\n- 9 -\nThat said, the benefits of a lengthy recovery can only go so far, as the research points to\nsome barriers to labor market outcomes for particular groups that appear to be structural.\nAfter controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these\nfactors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and\ninformal social networks that may be an important source of information and support\nregarding employment opportunities.13\nFederal Reserve Work on Labor Market Disparities\nWhile the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are not well suited to\naddressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in labor market outcomes,\nunderstanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximum\nemployment as well as potential growth. The Federal Reserve is deeply engaged in\nunderstanding disparities through our data collection, research collaboration, and\ncommunity development work. One way the Federal Reserve seeks to obtain a clearer\npicture is by collecting data ourselves. For instance, some of the data I have cited today\ncome from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides\ndetailed information on income and wealth holdings by demographic groups. The Survey\nof Household Economics and Decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances,\nemployment, housing, and debt; the Survey of Young Workers provides insights into\nyounger adults’ employment experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the\nEnterprising and Informal Work Activities Survey provides information about income\n13 For example, see Fryer (2011) and Ritter and Taylor (2011).\n\n- 10 -\ngenerating activities that are often outside the scope of other employment and income\nsurveys.14\nEach recent edition of the semiannual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) has focused on\nsome aspect of the comparative economic experience of different racial and ethnic groups. In\naddition, as indicated in the minutes published after each meeting of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC), Federal Reserve staff regularly report on the differential\nlabor experiences of different racial and ethnic groups as background for the FOMC’s\ndeliberations on monetary policy.\nAcross the Federal Reserve System, a variety of initiatives are aimed at\nunderstanding economic disparities and how to foster more-inclusive growth. The\nOpportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\nbrings together researchers from a variety of fields to analyze barriers to economic\nopportunity and advancement. The Economic Growth and Mobility Project at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia aims to bring together researchers with community\nstakeholders to focus on differences in poverty and economic mobility across\ndemographic characteristics. The Investing in America’s Workforce Initiative is a\ncollaboration between the Federal Reserve System and academic research institutions to\npromote investment in workforce skills that better align with employers’ needs.15\n14 Further information on these surveys are found on the Board’s website; see the Surveys of Consumer\nFinances, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm; the Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking, https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm; the Survey of Young\nWorkers, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2016-survey-young-workers-executive-\nsummary.htm; and the Survey of Enterprising and Informal Work Activities,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/files/EIWA_Chartbook_2016.pdf.\n15 For information about the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, see\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute, for information about the Economic Growth and Mobility\nProject, see https://www.philadelphiafed.org/egmp, and for information about the America’s Workforce\nInitiative, see https://www.investinwork.org.\n\n- 11 -\nIn short, a deeper understanding of labor market disparities is central to the\nmission of the Federal Reserve because it may help us better assess full employment,\nwhere resources may be underutilized, and the likely evolution of the labor market and\noverall economic activity. Let me conclude by thanking you again for having me here\ntoday and allowing me the opportunity to explore some of the factors that influence labor\nmarket disparities.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nAlichi, Ali, Kory Kantenga, and Juan Solè (2016). “Income Polarization in the United\nStates,” IMF Working Paper 16/121.

We are determined to stay the course.1\nFinancial conditions have tightened considerably over the last year as the Federal\nReserve and foreign central banks have tightened policy. Real yields have risen\nsignificantly across the curve over the past year: 2-year yields on Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities (TIPS) have risen more than 4-1/2 percentage points to 2.1 percent,\nand 10-year TIPS yields have risen more than 2-1/4 percentage points to 1.2 percent.\nShort-term real interest rates have moved into decidedly positive territory.2 Mortgage\nrates have doubled.3\nInflation has been declining over the past several months against a backdrop of\nmoderate growth. Yesterday’s industrial production index points to a significant\nweakening in the manufacturing sector, and the retail sales report points to a further\nmoderation in consumer spending. Looking forward, weaker readings on real income,\nwealth, and sentiment, along with indicators of spending on services, such as the ISM\nservices index, point to subdued growth in 2023.4 Real disposable personal income\ndeclined, on net, at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2022,\n1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis for his assistance on these remarks. These views are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For instance, the expected 3-month T-bill rate is currently 4.7 percent, 1.5 percentage points above the\n3-month 3.2 percent median projection of the 2023:Q1 annualized total PCE (personal consumption\nexpenditures) inflation rate in the January Blue Chip survey.\n3 In addition, over the course of the past year, investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads\nover Treasury securities have widened by roughly 50 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively; broad\nequity prices have declined by 17 percent; and the trade-weighted dollar has appreciated by about 4 percent\non net. The Federal Reserve’s broad trade-weighted dollar index is based on 26 currencies of major U.S.\ntrading partners. It is published in Statistical Release H.10, “Foreign Exchange Rates,” available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/current/default.htm.\n4 The Institute for Supply Management’s services index fell by 6.9 points to contractionary territory at 49.6\nin December, reflecting declines in the subindexes for business activity, new orders, and employment.\n\n- 2 -\nsuggesting that recent consumption has been supported by running down pandemic\nsavings and greater reliance on credit.5 In particular, savings among low-income\nhouseholds appear to be lower and to have declined more rapidly than was previously\nappreciated.6\nThe widespread expectation for U.S. growth to be below potential over 2022 and\n2023 reflects significant tightening in both fiscal and monetary policy in an environment\nof broader global tightening. The expiration of previous fiscal stimulus imposed a\nsubstantial drag on real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2022, whereas\nfiscal policy is expected to make a modest contribution over the next few years, in line\nwith its longer-run average.\nBy contrast, the drag on U.S. growth and employment from monetary policy is\nlikely to increase in 2023 because of transmission lags from the rapid, large swing from\naccommodation to restraint in 2022. From March to December 2022, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) undertook a large cumulative tightening in the stance of\nmonetary policy by raising the policy rate 4-1/4 percentage points and shrinking the\nbalance sheet. Although financial conditions adjust immediately to reflect expected and\nactual changes in monetary policy, the full adjustment of output, employment, and\ninflation occurs with a lag.7 Given the speed and magnitude of the swing in the stance of\n5 Total credit card balances were $1.19 trillion in November, relative to $1.09 trillion in December 2019,\nand the share of borrowers with consumer loans in delinquency has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. For\nmore information on credit card balances, see Statistical Release G.19, “Consumer Credit,” available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm.\n6 For a recent assessment of savings since the onset of the pandemic and a decomposition of excess savings\nacross income quartiles, see Aditya Aladangady, David Cho, Laura Feiveson, and Eugenio Pinto (2022),\n“Excess Savings during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, October 21), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3223.\n7 Romer and Romer (2004) and Gertler and Karadi (2015) find that it takes about 9 and 12 months,\nrespectively, for monetary policy actions to begin to affect inflation and additional time for that effect to\n\n- 3 -\nmonetary policy, the lagged effects of earlier accommodation likely offset some of the\ninitial effects of tightening over the course of 2022, and it is likely that the full effect on\ndemand, employment, and inflation of the cumulative tightening that is in the pipeline\nstill lies ahead. That said, there is uncertainty about the timing and magnitude.\nWith that in mind, let’s turn to the implications for the employment leg of our\ndual mandate. In contrast to the slowing of output growth, labor markets remained tight\nthroughout 2022, with layoffs remaining below pre-pandemic levels and the\nunemployment rate ending the year at 3.5 percent, its historical low. Quit rates and the\nratio of job postings to job seekers also remain elevated, although they are off their peaks\nfrom early in the year.\nRecent declines in average weekly hours, temporary-help services, and monthly\npayrolls growth suggest tentative signs that labor demand is cooling. Employment at\ntemporary-help services firms—a good leading indicator—peaked in July 2022 and has\nbeen declining since then, ending the year only slightly above its December 2019 level.\nSimilarly, average weekly hours have declined: After peaking in early 2021 and\npeak. In contrast, Bauer and Swanson (2022) find that inflation effects from monetary policy occur much\nsooner and peak within the first 10 months. See Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer (2004), “A New\nMeasure of Monetary Shocks: Derivation and Implications,” American Economic Review, vol. 94\n(September), pp. 1055–84; Mark Gertler and Peter Karadi (2015), “Monetary Policy Surprises, Credit\nCosts, and Economic Activity,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 7 (January), pp. 44–\n76; and Michael D. Bauer and Eric T. Swanson (2022), “A Reassessment of Monetary Policy Surprises and\nHigh-Frequency Identification,” in Martin Eichenbaum, Erik Hurst, and Valerie A. Ramey, eds., NBER\nMacroeconomics Annual 2022, vol. 37 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press). In addition, recent\nresearch suggests that there may have been an acceleration in the maximum effect on inflation following\nthe broader use of balance sheet and forward-guidance tools in 2009, bringing the arrival of that maximum\neffect from three years to as little as 12 months, though considerable uncertainty surrounds that estimate.\nSee Taeyoung Doh and Andrew T. Foerster (2022), “Have Lags in Monetary Policy Transmission\nShortened?” Economic Bulletin (Kansas City: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, December),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/have-lags-in-monetary-policy-transmission-\nshortened.\n\n- 4 -\nremaining elevated through May 2022, average weekly hours have declined and now\nstand at the bottom of the range for this metric over the five years before the pandemic.\nThe continued decline in average weekly hours is notable because this margin is among\nthe easiest to adjust by firms facing declining demand, especially those who may be\nreluctant to undertake layoffs following the challenges encountered in restoring\nemployment following the pandemic-induced layoffs. In addition, average payrolls\ngrowth in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ establishment survey fell from 540,000 jobs per\nmonth in the first quarter of 2022 to 250,000 jobs per month in the fourth quarter.\nThat said, labor supply appears likely to remain constrained. On net, the labor\nforce participation rate flattened out over 2022 at a level that is about 1 percentage point\nlower than pre-pandemic, primarily reflecting an estimated 2.5 million in excess\nretirements, as well as some impact from long COVID.8 Immigration has also been low\nin recent years.9\nDespite constrained supply, wages do not appear to be driving inflation in a\n1970s-style wage–price spiral. It is true that wages have grown faster than the pace\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation and productivity growth. It is also true that wages\nhave grown slower than inflation over the past two years, and that aggregate real wages\n8 A discussion of the labor market impact of long COVID can be found in Price (2022) and the references\nwithin. See Brendan M. Price (2022), “Long COVID, Cognitive Impairment, and the Stalled Decline in\nDisability Rates,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nAugust 5), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3189.\n9 By one estimate, the changes in immigration policy since 2016, in combination with the pandemic travel\nrestrictions, reduced the total level of immigration by 3.4 million people over the period from 2016 to 2021.\nAs the authors of this study note, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey,\naround 50 percent of immigrants from 2001 to 2020 joined the labor force within a year of their arrival.\nSee Elior Cohen and Samantha Shampine (2022), “Immigration Shortfall May Be a Headwind for Labor\nSupply,” Economic Bulletin (Kansas City: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/immigration-shortfall-may-be-a-headwind-for-\nlabor-supply.\n\n- 5 -\nhave fallen. It appears that workers in lower-wage sectors who saw high pandemic\nlayoffs initially and benefited from job switching subsequently as businesses scrambled\nto hire have seen wage gains in real terms. However, in the aggregate, the gains among\nlower-wage workers were more than offset by real wage declines among middle- and\nhigher-wage workers in the context of a broader compression in the real wage\ndistribution, as David Autor points out.10 Overall, the labor share of income has declined\nover the past two years and appears to be at or below pre-pandemic levels, while\ncorporate profits as a share of GDP remain near postwar highs.\nRetail markups in a number of sectors have seen material increases in what could\nbe described as a price–price spiral, whereby final prices have risen by more than the\nincreases in input prices.11 The compression of these markups as supply constraints ease,\ninventories rise, and demand cools could contribute to disinflationary pressures.\nThere are tentative signs that wage growth is moderating. Growth in average\nhourly earnings has softened recently—stepping down to 4.1 percent annualized growth\non a 3-month basis in December from roughly 4.5 percent on a 6-month and 12-month\nbasis. I will be watching to see whether the employment cost index data at the end of this\nmonth show the deceleration from the third quarter continuing into the fourth quarter.\n10 See David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2022), “The Unexpected Compression:\nCompetition at Work in the Low Wage Economy,” lecture delivered at Markus’ Academy, Bendheim\nCenter for Finance, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. (via webcast), December 8,\nhttps://bcf.princeton.edu/events/david-autur-on-the-unexpected-compression-competition-at-work-in-the-\nlow-wage-economy.\n11 Since the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided with large increases in\nretail trade margins in several sectors, increases that have exceeded the contemporaneous increase in wages\npaid to the workers in those sectors. For example, since the end of 2019, retail trade margins for food and\ngrocery retailers increased by about 25 percent, outstripping the growth in average hourly earnings for\nworkers in that sector, which was just under 19 percent. A similar gap exists between margin and wage\nincreases for general merchandise retailers, which were 24 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\n- 6 -\nLet’s now turn to the inflation leg of our dual mandate. Inflation has declined in\nrecent months from very high levels. With the consumer price index and producer price\nindex now available, total PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation in\nDecember is likely to have run at around a 2.3 percent annualized pace on a 3- and 6-\nmonth basis, as compared with 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis. This deceleration\nreflects an easing in war-related energy shocks as well as in core goods inflation: Energy\nand core goods each subtracted nearly three-fourths of 1 percentage point from 3-month\nannualized total PCE inflation. The declines in energy and core goods are a reversal of\nprevious large increases and are expected to moderate.\nCore PCE inflation is running at a 3.1 percent annualized pace on a 3-month\nbasis—below its 3.8 percent reading on a 6-month basis and 4.5 percent on a 12-month\nbasis. Within this, recent declines in core goods inflation reflect a reduction in core\nimport prices, an easing of supply chains, a restocking of inventories, and cooling\ndemand. Core goods prices are likely to flatten out once earlier large gains reverse, in the\nabsence of new shocks, and overall core inflation could move up somewhat for a time as\na result.\nIn that regard, housing services inflation remains stubbornly high at 8.8 percent\non a 3-month basis—compared with 7.7 percent on a 12-month basis. Housing services\nare making an annualized contribution to core PCE that is more than double their\ncontribution before the pandemic. That said, the housing sector is highly interest\nsensitive, and the most recent reading of one national indicator pointed to house prices\n\n- 7 -\nhaving declined 2.5 percent over the five months ending in November.12 Similarly, rents\nbased on new leases are decelerating sharply.13 Although it is currently offset by catch-\nup in renewing leases, the decline in rent on new leases will show through to average rent\nover time, and declines in housing services inflation are expected by the third quarter of\nthis year.14\nIn addition, nonhousing services are running at about 4.4 percent annualized\ninflation on a 3-month basis, similar to their 12-month pace. There are a range of views\non what it will take to bring down this component of inflation to pre-pandemic levels.\nSince wages constitute a significant fraction of costs for most firms in nonhousing\nservices, one possible channel is through a weakening in labor demand. That said, to the\nextent that inputs other than wages may have been responsible in part for important price\nincreases for some nonhousing service sectors, an unwinding of these factors could help\nbring down nonhousing services inflation.\nThere is some recent evidence that the persistent components of inflation in core\ngoods and nonhousing services, particularly transportation, recreation, and food services\nand accommodation, have behaved similarly, peaking around early 2022 and steadily\n12 The CoreLogic Home Price Index peaked in June 2022 and has declined in each month through\nNovember 2022. More information is available at https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/u-s-home-price-\ninsights-january-2023/.\n13 The CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index shows a significant deceleration over the 7 months ending in\nNovember, including negative month over month rent growth in September through November; see\nCoreLogic (2023), “CoreLogic: US Annual Rent Growth Drops for the Seventh Straight Month in\nNovember,” January 17, https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/corelogic-us-annual-rent-growth-drops-\nfor-the-seventh-straight-month-in-november/.\n14 For a recent analysis of the lead–lag relationship between indexes of market rents for new tenants and the\nindexes of average rent for all tenants, see Brian Adams, Lara Loewenstein, Hugh Montag, and Randal J.\nVerbrugge (2022), “Disentangling Rent Index Differences: Data, Methods, and Scope,” Working Paper\nSeries 22-38 (Cleveland: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, December), https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-\nwp-202238.\n\n- 8 -\ndeclining since then.15 To the extent that the persistent components of these nonhousing\nservices and core goods reflect common factors that are fading, such as pass-through\nfrom commodity and supply chain shocks, they are unlikely to be as cyclically persistent,\nas long as inflation expectations are well anchored.16\nOf course, an extended period of high goods and services inflation resulting from\na series of demand and supply shocks associated with the pandemic and the war could\nlead to a rise in inflation expectations, which would make it much more difficult to bring\ninflation down.17 That is why it has been important for monetary policy to take a risk-\nmanagement posture to defend the expectations anchor. And the evidence from market-\nand survey-based measures suggests that longer-term inflation expectations are well\nanchored, while year-ahead measures have recently declined but remain elevated.\nTogether, the price trends in core goods and nonhousing services, the tentative\nindications of some deceleration in wages, the evidence of anchored expectations, and the\nscope for margin compression may provide some reassurance that we are not currently\nexperiencing a 1970s-style wage–price spiral. For these reasons, it remains possible that\na continued moderation in aggregate demand could facilitate continued easing in the\nlabor market and reduction in inflation without a significant loss of employment.18\n15 See Martín Almuzara, Marek Jarocinski, and Argia Sbordone (2023), “The Layers of Inflation\nPersistence,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), January 5,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/01/the-layers-of-inflation-persistence.\n16 And, of course, the reemergence of additional shocks to commodities and intermediate inputs is possible.\n17 For a discussion of supply shocks and monetary policy in the context of recent events, see Lael Brainard\n(2022), “What Can We Learn from the Pandemic and the War about Supply Shocks, Inflation, and\nMonetary Policy?” summary of remarks delivered as part of a panel at the Bank for International\nSettlements Annual Meeting on June 24, Basel, Switzerland,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20221128a.htm.\n18 For a description of one path to such an outcome, see Andrew Figura and Chris Waller (2022), “What\nDoes the Beveridge Curve Tell Us about the Likelihood of a Soft Landing?” FEDS Notes (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 29), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3190.\n\n- 9 -\nNonetheless, substantial uncertainty remains. Further shocks associated with the\nwar and the pandemic are possible. While there has been some improvement in the\noutlook for activity and inflation in Europe, there is uncertainty about the implications of\nChina’s exit from zero COVID for global demand and inflation, especially in\ncommodities.\nTurning to the implications for policy, my colleagues and I are committed to\nrestoring price stability. The FOMC moved policy into restrictive territory at a rapid\npace and subsequently downshifted the pace of increases in the target range at its most\nrecent meeting. This will enable us to assess more data as we move the policy rate closer\nto a sufficiently restrictive level, taking into account the risks around our dual-mandate\ngoals. In parallel, balance sheet runoff is continuing. Even with the recent moderation,\ninflation remains high, and policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for some time to\nmake sure inflation returns to 2 percent on a sustained basis.",

Congress has\nassigned the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve maximum employment\nand price stability. These two goals are what we refer to as our dual mandate. By price\nstability we mean moderate and stable inflation. Specifically, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC)—the group at the Fed responsible for determining monetary\n1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text.

The\nmaximum employment part of our dual mandate is straightforward: The Congress has\ndirected us to achieve the highest level of employment—and thus the lowest level of\nunemployment—that is consistent with price stability.\nWhile the Congress has specified the goals for monetary policy and a set of tools\nor authorities to pursue them, it has allowed the FOMC to determine how to best go about\nachieving those goals.\nReviewing How We Conduct Monetary Policy\nLast year, core inflation was very close to our goal. And the unemployment rate\nis at a 50-year low. We are undertaking our review to ensure we are well positioned to\nmeet our goals for many years to come.\nWe also want to make sure that the way we are setting monetary policy is keeping\nup with the way the economy is changing, which I have been referring to as the “new\nnormal.”3 There are a few key features of that new normal. For example, interest rates\nhave stayed very low in recent years not only in the United States, but also in many other\nadvanced economies. For a variety of reasons, it seems likely that equilibrium interest\nrates will remain low in the future. Low interest rates present a challenge for the\ntraditional ways of conducting monetary policy. That is especially true in recessions\nwhen, in the past, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage\npoints in order to support household spending and business investment. But when\nequilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates and thus less\n3 Lael Brainard, “The \"New Normal\" and What It Means for Monetary Policy,” remarks at the Chicago\nCouncil on Global Affairs, Chicago, Illinois, September 12, 2016.\n\n- 3 -\nroom to buffer the economy using our conventional tool. For example, following the\nmost recent recession in 2008 and 2009, we kept interest rates as low as the Committee\nthought they could go, which was close to zero, for many years.\nAnother big change in the economy is that inflation doesn’t move as much with\neconomic activity and employment as it has in the past. This is what economists mean\nwhen they say the Phillips curve is very flat. In many ways, the flatter Phillips curve has\nadvantages: It means that the labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers\nthat may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in\ninflation, unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s. Similarly, inflation doesn’t fall as\nmuch in recessions.\nBut there is an important risk with today’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack: It\nmakes it more difficult to boost inflation to our objective of 2 percent on a sustainable\nbasis. And, as we know from other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the\ncentral bank’s objective, lower inflation tends to get embedded in people’s expectations.\nExpectations that inflation will remain low in turn can create a self-fulfilling dynamic\nwith actual inflation, making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation.\nAnd because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates, that, in turn, can also reduce\nthe amount of policy space the central bank has available to prevent the economy from\nslipping into recession.\nIn fact, in recent years, central banks around the world have had to use a larger\nvariety of policy tools than they traditionally used to respond to the financial crisis and\nsupport economic expansion.\n\n- 4 -\nSome Issues to Explore\nGiven the new normal of low equilibrium interest rates and low sensitivity of\ninflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here\nand around the world, with a view to identifying the best ways to promote the goals the\nCongress assigned to us. As such, we will be looking widely at our tools and strategies,\nassessing not just the various approaches that were undertaken, but also approaches that\nhave been proposed but not tried.\nOne of those is the idea that the Federal Reserve should explicitly promise to\n“make up” for the fact that interest rates can’t be cut as much as during past recessions.\nThe Federal Reserve could hold interest rates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by\npromising not to raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached\na particular level.\nA related idea is average inflation targeting, meaning the Fed would aim to\nachieve its inflation objective on average over a longer period of time—perhaps over the\nbusiness cycle. So if inflation fell short during a recession, the Federal Reserve would\naim at inflation above target during the recovery and expansion. This approach would\nalso have aspects of a make-up policy, as policy would likely be kept easier—that is,\nmore accommodative—than otherwise during the period where inflation is above target.\nWhile such approaches sound quite appealing on their face, they have not yet\nbeen implemented in practice. There is some skepticism that a central bank would in fact\nprove able to support above-target inflation over a sustained period without becoming\nconcerned that inflation might accelerate and inflation expectations might rise too high.\n\n- 5 -\nAnother idea I would like to hear more about involves targeting the yield on\nspecific securities so that once the short-term interest rates we traditionally target have hit\nzero, we might turn to targeting slightly longer-term interest rates—initially one-year\ninterest rates, for example, and if more stimulus is needed, perhaps moving out the curve\nto two-year rates. Under this policy, the Federal Reserve would stand ready to use its\nbalance sheet to hit the targeted interest rate, but unlike the asset purchases that were\nundertaken in the recent recession, there would be no specific commitments with regard\nto purchases of Treasury securities. Similar to make-up policies, such an approach could\nhelp communicate publicly how long the Federal Reserve is planning to keep rates low.\nI should emphasize that these are just a few ideas; there may be other good ideas,\nand part of the process we are engaged in involves looking around for other ideas. Most,\nif not all, of the ideas have both advantages and disadvantages, and we will have to\nconsider them carefully as our review progresses. Of course, we may find that the\npreferred approach is modest enhancements to the tools that proved their worth during\nthe crisis.\nListening\nNow, how does today’s event fit into all of this? Just as the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Richmond is sponsoring today’s event with representatives of its local community, so\ntoo are other Reserve Banks sponsoring similar events. We are making sure to hear from\npeople across the country. We will also hold a national-level conference in Chicago in\nJune. And, in addition to presentations from prominent outside experts, we made sure to\nadd panels to hear from community organizations, training institutions, and other groups\nthat can give us insights on how monetary policy is affecting Main Street.\n\n- 6 -\nSince I arrived at the Fed, I have put a premium on visiting communities all over\nthe country to get a direct sense of how they are experiencing the economy. In fact, my\nfirst such visit was in this District with community development staff from the Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond. Due to the wisdom of the Fed’s original architects, the\nFederal Reserve System derives tremendous value from interacting with communities\nfrom all around the country. In 2015, we created a Community Advisory Council at the\nFederal Reserve Board, where we hear from a broad variety of community groups and\nothers. And many of the regional Federal Reserve Banks have similar councils, including\nthe Richmond Fed’s Community Investment Council.\nIn our review this year, we are listening broadly and are seeking perspectives at\nthe community level. So today we want to hear from you. How is your community\nexperiencing today’s economy? Is everyone who wants a job able to get one? Can they\nget the necessary training? Are businesses finding it relatively easy to hire the workers\nthey need? What about inflation and pricing power? And what about the availability and\ncost of credit—whether it be to start or expand a small business, buy a car to get to work,\nor invest in owning a home or getting a degree? I look forward to hearing your views on\nthese and other questions.",

These\ncontours represent noteworthy departures from the “old normal” that prevailed in the\ndecades prior to the financial crisis. I would argue that policy today must rely less on the\nold normal as a guidepost and instead be sensitive to the contours that shape today’s\n“new normal.”1\nKey Features of the “New Normal”\nBecause monetary policy is forward looking, policymakers must assess how key\nfeatures of the economic environment are most likely to influence the future path of the\neconomy and shape policy accordingly. At a time when our assessment of the economy\nis evolving, several features of the “new normal”--some of which are interrelated--appear\nparticularly noteworthy for our policy deliberations:\n1. Inflation Has Been Undershooting, and the Phillips Curve Has Flattened\nFirst, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical\nrelationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key\nguidepost for monetary policy. The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack\ndiminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation\nwould result. However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both\nabsolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nconsiderably.2 At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to\n4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3 In\nother words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously.\nWith the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been\nin the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important. On\nexpected similar to realized inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be\nconcerned more about undershooting than overshooting. Although some survey\nmeasures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the\nlower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.4 Meanwhile,\nmarket-based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past\ntwo years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent\nstabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate. Thus, we cannot rule out that the\nsustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary\npressures are weighing on inflation expectations.\nRecognition of these developments is reflected in the evolution of the forecasts of\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) from June 2012 to June 2016. The SEP forecasts have shown repeated\nmark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of\nthe range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently.\n2 See Blanchard (2016), Kiley (2015b), and Brainard (2015a),\n3 The inflation information refers to core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation measured on a\n12-month average basis.\n4 For example, over the past 12 months, median 5-to-10 year-ahead inflation expectations from the\nUniversity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/4 percentage point below the average over the prior\n10 years.\n\n- 3 -\nThe apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation\nexpectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of\ninflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy\ndeliberations. In particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual\ntightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to\ntighten policy preemptively is less compelling.\n2. Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated\nSecond, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment,\nthis improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously\nanticipated. This uncertainty about the true state of the economy suggests we should be\nopen to the possibility of material further progress in the labor market. Indeed, with\npayroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers\nwould have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving\nsideways, as it has done. It is true that today’s unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is only\n0.1 percentage point from the median SEP participant’s estimate of the longer-run level\nof unemployment. However, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary\nover time. Indeed, in the SEP, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run\nnatural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.2 to\n6.0 percent in June 2012 to 4.7 to 5.0 percent in June 2016--a reduction of 1/2 to\n1 percentage point.5 We cannot rule out that estimates of the natural unemployment rate\nmay move even lower.\n5 For information from current and previous SEPs, see\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nIn addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack,\nand other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go. The share of\nemployees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained\nnoticeably above its pre-crisis level. Of particular significance, the prime-age labor force\nparticipation rate, despite improvement this year, remains about 1-1/2 percentage points\nbelow its pre-crisis level, suggesting room for further gains. While it is possible that the\ncurrent low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot\nrule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery\nin job opportunities and wages.6\nThis possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth.\nAlthough wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this\npace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well\nbelow growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.7\nMy main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of\naccelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the\npossibility of making further gains in the labor market.\n6 For analyses of the determinants of labor force participation, see Aaronson and others (2014), Erceg and\nLevin (2014), and Council of Economic Advisers (2016).\n7 Over the 12 months ending in August 2016, average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent. Over the\n12 months ending in June, the employment cost index for private-sector workers also increased 2.4 percent.\nThe more volatile compensation per hour measure for the business sector has increased at an annual rate of\n2.6 percent over the past eight quarters. From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2014, these\nmeasures all increased at an average annual rate of around 2 percent. From the fourth quarter of 2003 to\nthe fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an\naverage annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent. Average hourly earnings for all workers were not available\nfor this period.\n\n- 5 -\n3. Foreign Markets Matter, Especially because Financial Transmission is Strong\nThird, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on\nthe U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks\nhere at home.8 In Europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very\nlow. Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a\nhigher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of\nthe main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro area’s bank-centric\nfinancial system. A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal\nsustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product\n(GDP) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks. Against this backdrop, uncertainty\nabout Britain’s future relationship with the European Union could damp business\nsentiment and investment in Europe.\nJapan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation. Indeed, it is\nstriking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan,\ninflation remains below target levels. The experiences of these economies highlight the\nrisk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations\nenvironment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the\nU.S. economy slipping into such a situation.\n8 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly marked down its forecast of world economic\ngrowth in recent years. From April 2014 to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down 2015\ngrowth from 3.9 percent to 3.1 percent. And from April 2015 to July of this year, the IMF revised down\n2016 growth from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent. See the IMF’s World Economic Outlook at\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29.\n\n- 6 -\nDownside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has\nslowed rapidly in recent years.9 Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging\ntransition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state-\nowned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private\nbusinesses. Because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic\ntrends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow. Given that China has experienced\nvery high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks. Importantly, Chinese\nauthorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance, and capital\noutflows have slowed in recent months. Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty remains,\nand further volatility cannot be ruled out. The importance of Chinese growth and\nstability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies\nthat these risks have global implications.\nHeadwinds from abroad should matter to U.S. policymakers because recent\nexperience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated, such that disturbances\nemanating from Chinese or euro-area financial markets quickly spill over to U.S.\nfinancial markets. The fallout from adverse foreign shocks appears to be more\npowerfully transmitted to the U.S. than previously. Indeed, recent research suggests that\nchanges in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other\nmajor economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger\nthan they were several years ago.10 The fact that many advanced economies are suffering\nfrom deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S.\n9 Emerging market growth, as weighted by a country’s share of U.S. exports, has decreased from an\naverage pace of 5-1/4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2012 to a little over 2\npercent last year.\n10 See Curcuru (forthcoming). The confidence intervals around the estimated effects are quite large.\n\n- 7 -\ndollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a\nparticularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness\nto the U.S. economy.11\nIn turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these\nexchange rate movements. In particular, estimates from the FRB/US model suggest that\nthe nearly 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from June 2014 to January of this year\ncould be having an effect on U.S. economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis\npoint increase in the federal funds rate. Interestingly, it appears that this effect showed\nthrough in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output,\nwhile the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by\ndepressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors.\n4. The Neutral Rate Is Likely to Remain Very Low for Some Time\nFourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that\nthe neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before\nthe crisis. Over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the\nadditional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth has\naveraged a very modest rate upward of 2 percent, and inflation has averaged only\n1-1/2 percent. Ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that\nprevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation\nwould be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy. To reconcile these\ndevelopments, it is difficult not to conclude that the current level of the federal funds rate\nis less accommodative today than it would have been 10 years ago. Put differently, the\n11 See Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2015).\n\n- 8 -\namount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now\nmuch lower than before the crisis.\nIn the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical\nheadwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the\nneutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of 2 percent. But seven\nyears into the expansion and with little sign of a significant acceleration in activity, the\nlow neutral rate looks likely to persist. Indeed, developments over the past year confirm\nthat the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12 Foreign consumption and\ninvestment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated\ndemand for safe assets. Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate\nof nearly 2-1/2 percent from 1950 to 2000, has increased only 1/2 percent on average\nover the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor\nforce.\nRecognition of the reduction in the long-run neutral federal funds rate is perhaps\nthe most consequential change in the SEP forecasts. In the four years between June 2012\nand June 2016, the estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined from\n4.25 percent to 3.0 percent--nearly one-third. Over one-third of that adjustment has\noccurred between December 2015 and June 2016. It is notable that this recent step-down\nin the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a\nstabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes\nin the perceived FOMC policy reaction function.\n12 For a fuller description of the likely contributors to a persistent low neutral rate, see Brainard (2015b)\nand Goodfriend (2016).\n\n- 9 -\nSeveral econometric models and estimates from market participants suggest the\ncurrent real neutral rate is at or close to zero, and any increase is likely to be shallow and\nslow.13 These estimates imply that it may require a relatively more modest adjustment in\nthe policy rate to return to neutral over time than previously anticipated.\n5. Policy Options Are Asymmetric\nThe four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we\nwill continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time: the ability of monetary\npolicy to respond to shocks is asymmetric. With policy rates near the zero lower bound\nand likely to return there more frequently even if the economy only experiences shocks\nsimilar in magnitude to those experienced pre-crisis, due to the low level of the neutral\nrate, there is an asymmetry in the policy tools available to respond to adverse\ndevelopments. Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best\nunderstood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate\ndemand as it can to upside shocks. While there are, of course, other policy options, these\nalternatives have constraints and uncertainties that are not present with conventional\npolicy.14 From a risk-management perspective, therefore, the asymmetry in the\nconventional policy toolkit would lead me to expect policy to be tilted somewhat in favor\nof guarding against downside risks relative to preemptively raising rates to guard against\nupside risks.\n13 See, for example, Laubach and Williams (2015); Del Negro, Giannoni, and Smith (2016); Cúrdia (2015);\nLubik and Matthes (2015); Kiley (2015a); and Johannsen and Mertens (2016) for econometric estimates of\nthe neutral rate, or the closely related concept of the natural rate of interest. See the Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York’s most recent Survey of Market Participants\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey_market_participants.html) and Survey of Primary Dealers\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html) for forecasters’ estimates of\nthe current neutral rate.\n14 See Reifschneider (2016).\n\n- 10 -\nBecause a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional\nmonetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether\nour current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what\nadjustments would be most appropriate. There is a growing literature on such policy\nalternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or\ndeploying negative interest rates.15 These options merit further assessment. However,\nthey are largely untested and would take some time to assess and prepare. For the time\nbeing, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy\nactions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the\nCommittee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent--and not a ceiling--along\nwith maximum employment.\nRecent Developments Suggest Gradual Progress\nAgainst the backdrop of these five features of the new normal that are most salient\nfor conditioning policy, I will briefly summarize my take on recent economic\ndevelopments and their implications for policy. The economy has seen welcome\nprogress on some fronts in recent months, supported by the cautious approach taken by\nthe Committee and a corresponding easing in financial conditions: The labor market has\ncontinued to improve, consumer confidence has remained high, and we have navigated\npast near-term risks from abroad.\nOverall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that\nwe are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely\nwill be, somewhat gradual. This year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below\n15 See Romer (2011), Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), Ball (2014), Haldane (2015), Bernanke\n(2015), and Goodfriend (2016).\n\n- 11 -\nlast year’s pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack. The slowing pace of job\ngains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past\nyear, along with a heartening 1/2 percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force\nparticipation rate. These developments suggest that an improving job market has made\njoining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the\nlabor market has room for further improvement.\nRecent spending data suggest a pickup in third-quarter growth. In particular, real\nconsumer spending increased at nearly a 4 percent annual pace over the three months\nending in July, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising\nhousehold wealth. Nonetheless, spending in other sectors has been disappointing. Weak\nforeign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have\nweighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and\nmanufacturing production. Business investment has declined in each of the past three\nquarters, and the latest data on housing permits suggest that residential investment slowed\nnoticeably in the middle of this year. As a result, economic activity over the past three\nquarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each\naveraging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in 2015.\nLooking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggests that growth\nin these components should move higher over the second half of the year. Indeed,\nexports, which have declined since the end of 2014, moved slightly higher last quarter,\nand the number of oil drilling rigs in operation has begun to edge up after sharp declines\nover the past two years, a positive sign for business investment. In addition, inventory\n\n- 12 -\ninvestment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the\nyear to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales.\nWe have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate. In July, the\n12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.6 percent, higher than a year ago, but still\nnoticeably below our 2 percent target. The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices\nshould lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters. Non-oil import\nprices, which fell steadily from the end of 2014 through the first quarter of this year,\nedged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise\ngoing forward. Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations\nremaining well anchored and not drifting lower. The evidence here is mixed, as I noted\nearlier.\nPolicy Implications\nThe five features of the current economic landscape that I have highlighted lean\nroughly in the same direction: In today’s new normal, the costs to the economy of\ngreater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of\nsignificant unexpected weakness. In the case of unexpected strength, we have well-tried\nand tested tools and ample policy space in which to react. Moreover, because of Phillips\ncurve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial\nresponse of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate,\nand the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of\ninflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a\ncorrespondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the\neconomy. In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is\n\n- 13 -\nmore limited, and thus the risk of being unable to adequately respond to unexpected\nweakness is greater. The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies suggest\nthat prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs\nthat can be considerable.\nThis asymmetry in risk management in today’s new normal counsels prudence in\nthe removal of policy accommodation. I believe this approach has served us well in\nrecent months, helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on\ninflation. I look forward to assessing the evolution of the data in the months ahead for\nsigns of further progress toward our goals, bearing in mind these considerations.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-275, www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/fall-\n2014/fall2014bpea_aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nBall, Laurence (2014). “The Case for a Long-Run Inflation Target of Four Percent,” IMF\nWorking Paper WP/14/92.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EST\nJanuary 17, 2017\nMonetary Policy in a Time of Uncertainty\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 17, 2017\n\nThere are many sources of uncertainty affecting the trajectory of the U.S.\neconomy and, by extension, the appropriate path of monetary policy. In particular, there\nhas been speculation about significant changes to fiscal policy of late, although the\nmagnitude, composition, and timing of any fiscal changes are as yet unknown and will\ndepend on the incoming Administration and the new Congress as well as the vicissitudes\nof the budgeting process. Even once any changes are enacted, uncertainty will remain\nabout their effects on the overall economy. It thus seems possible that monetary policy\ncould be affected for some time by uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy and its effects on\nthe economy.1\nMacroeconomic Outcomes Are Difficult to Predict\nBefore I turn to the possible effects of fiscal policy, it is helpful to remind\nourselves of the immense uncertainty that accompanies any attempt to forecast future\neconomic developments. Many possible surprises could materially affect the future path\nof the U.S. economy, such as shocks to the price of oil, the foreign economic outlook, the\nrate of productivity growth, the sentiment of households and businesses, financial\nstability, and fiscal policy, to name a few. The resulting uncertainty makes it difficult to\npredict the future path of activity, unemployment, and inflation.\nBy statute, the Federal Reserve is mandated to conduct monetary policy to\npromote the long run goals of maximum employment and stable prices. In today’s\nframework, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has defined stable prices to\nmean 2 percent inflation. The FOMC adjusts the stance of policy in light of incoming\neconomic information and its implications for the outlook. Uncertainty about future\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nemployment and inflation naturally translates into uncertainty about the path of future\nmonetary policy.\nOne useful measure of uncertainty is the magnitude of forecast errors, or the\nextent to which macroeconomic outcomes have differed from professional economic\nforecasters’ expectations.2 Over the past 30 years, outside forecasts of the unemployment\nrate four quarters ahead have missed the actual unemployment rate by more than 3/4\npercentage point in either direction one-third of the time. Since notable departures from\nforecast values of unemployment and inflation occur with some frequency, it should not\nbe surprising that the associated forecasts of interest rates have a similar track record.\nOne-third of the time over the past 30 years, outside forecasts of the level of short-term\ninterest rates four quarters ahead have been above or below the actual level by more than\n1-1/4 percentage points.3 Thus, it is important to keep in mind that all macro forecasts\nand projections of monetary policy are subject to considerable uncertainty, as they are\nbased on information at a point in time, and actual developments could well evolve much\ndifferently.\nFiscal Policy Considerations\nAmong the many factors that can affect the aggregate economy and, by extension,\nmonetary policy, a possible shift in fiscal policy has attracted the attention of both\neconomic forecasters and financial markets of late. Among forecasters surveyed by Blue\nChip Economic Indicators, for 2017, 44 percent indicated that they had raised their\nforecast of inflation and 47 percent had raised their forecast of gross domestic product\n2 The analysis of forecast errors presented here uses data from 1986 to 2015 from the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Philadelphia’s November Survey of Professional Forecasters. For more on the construction of forecast\nerrors, see Reifschneider and Tulip (2007) and Board of Governors (2014).\n3 The short-term interest rate used in this analysis is the three-month Treasury bill rate.\n\n- 3 -\n(GDP) growth because of the recent U.S. election results, although on average forecast\nchanges were modest. Markets have also reacted, and many have interpreted these\nchanges as reflecting expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy in the coming years\nthan previously expected.\nIn thinking about fiscal scenarios, forecasters have several historical episodes on\nwhich to draw. For example, following the 1980 elections, tax cuts were enacted, and\ndefense spending rose. Federal fiscal deficits, adjusted for the cyclical state of the\neconomy, increased by roughly 2-1/2 percentage points of GDP from the period before\nthe elections to six years following the elections, federal debt held by the public increased\nfrom about 25 percent of GDP to nearly 40 percent, and the current account deficit\nwidened.4 Following the 2000 elections, similar fiscal changes resulted in an increase in\nthe fiscal deficit of close to 3 percentage points of GDP over the first six years of the new\nAdministration on a cyclically adjusted basis. Of course, there are important differences\nin today’s conditions relative to these historical settings, including the economy’s cyclical\nposition, current and projected levels of indebtedness, the relative position of the global\neconomy, and monetary policy settings.\nAs of today, there is substantial uncertainty about the magnitude, timing, and\ncomposition of any possible change in the stance of fiscal policy. It is instructive to\ncontemplate the important dimensions along which fiscal policy and its effects might\nvary as well as their implications for monetary policy. In addition to the critical size and\n4 Annual data on cyclically adjusted federal deficits can be found in table C-2 of the Congressional Budget\nOffice (2016, p. 126) report The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016 to 2026. The analysis takes a three-\nyear centered moving average of the CBO’s estimates of the cyclically adjusted federal deficit, which can\nbe quite volatile from year to year, and compares this average for the year prior to the new Administration\nto the average in the sixth year of the new Administration.\n\n- 4 -\ntiming issues, there are four key dimensions: (1) the composition of policy changes and\ntheir relative effects on aggregate demand and aggregate supply, (2) the distance of the\neconomy from full employment and 2 percent inflation, (3) the divergence in the cyclical\nposition of the U.S. economy relative to foreign economies, and (4) the amount of fiscal\npolicy space.\nDifferent types of policies can generate very different economic responses and\nhave implications regarding both the amount of aggregate economic stimulus per fiscal\ndollar and also whether the effect is predominantly to raise aggregate demand or also to\nexpand the supply potential of the economy. Generally, fiscal stimulus that expands\nspending and investment directly or is targeted to households and businesses that have\nthe greatest propensity to spend rather than save can be expected to generate the largest\nresponse in aggregate demand.5\nFocusing first on policies that affect only aggregate demand, temporary demand-\nbased fiscal expansions can speed recovery when the economy is some distance from full\nemployment and target inflation, particularly if conventional monetary policy is\nconstrained by the effective lower bound. But when the economy is either close to or at\nfull employment and inflation is converging to or at its target, additional fiscal demand\nwill more likely result in inflationary pressures. Thus, fiscal expansions that affect only\naggregate demand and are enacted when the economy is near full employment and\n2 percent inflation are relatively less likely to sustainably boost economic activity and\nrelatively more likely to be accompanied by increases in interest rates.\n5 For example, see table 3 in the Congressional Budget Office (2015, p. 6) report Estimated Impact of the\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Employment and Economic Output in 2014.\n\n- 5 -\nThe current nominal neutral interest rate--or the level of the federal funds rate that\nis consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and\nstable inflation--is quite low at present.6 Adjusting for inflation, most estimates of the\nneutral rate are currently close to zero, compared with about 2 percent for the quarter-\ncentury prior to the financial crisis.7 A low neutral rate implies that conventional\nmonetary policy has less room to respond when the economy is hit by adverse shocks.\nWith conventional monetary policy constrained in the vicinity of the lower bound, it is\nmore difficult for the economy to recover and for inflation to move back to target.8\nPolicies that persistently raise aggregate demand alone can lift the neutral rate, but\nthat may come at substantial cost. Because these policies do not affect the economy’s\nlong-term growth potential but do result in persistent fiscal deficits, they can lead to\nsubstantial increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The greater space for monetary policy to\nrespond to adverse shocks provided by a higher neutral rate comes at the expense of\nreducing the space for fiscal policy to stabilize the economy in the event of future adverse\nshocks.\nIn this regard, it matters importantly whether increased fiscal deficits\npredominantly raise aggregate demand or also expand the supply potential of the\neconomy more broadly. Changes in fiscal policy that raise the level or growth rate of\nproductivity or that induce greater labor force participation and higher levels of skill and\n6 See Brainard (2015).\n7 See Laubach and Williams (2015). For the most up-to-date Laubach-Williams estimates of the natural\nrate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate, see www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/files/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx. Also see the most recent median estimates of\nthe real neutral rate from the New York Federal Reserve Bank’s Survey of Primary Dealers\n(https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html) and Survey of Market\nParticipants (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey_market_participants.html). For estimates of the\nreal neutral rate based on the Summary of Economic Projections, see Bongard and Johannsen (2016).\n8 For an analysis of macroeconomic behavior near the zero lower bound, see Evans and others (2015).\n\n- 6 -\neducation in the workforce raise the nation’s productive capacity and result in more\nsustainable increases in output and living standards. The higher productivity and\nworkforce levels engendered by these policies would likely increase investment\nopportunities and raise expectations of future income growth, sustainably boosting the\nlevels of investment and consumption and, as a result, the longer-run neutral rate. Such\npolicies are more likely to be sustainable because the boost to GDP that they provide\ncontinues to accumulate over time, limiting increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio and\npreserving fiscal space.\nIn addition, the effects of fiscal policy depend importantly on the relative strength\nof the broader global economy. In recent years, major foreign economies have been\ncontending with a deficiency of domestic demand. At a time when the U.S. economy has\nmade important progress on employment and inflation, in both Europe and Japan output\nor inflation, or both, remain well below desired levels. As a result, forecasters expect\nshort-term yields in these economies to remain near zero for years to come. Moreover,\ngrowth in many emerging market economies, including importantly China, has slowed in\nrecent years, and financial conditions in some emerging economies appear fragile.\nAgainst the backdrop of deficient demand abroad, if more expansionary fiscal policy here\nat home raises expectations of a growing divergence between the United States and other\neconomies, upward pressure on the exchange rate will likely result, as we have seen\nrecently with the renewed increase in the dollar. The result could be cross-border\nspillovers from the increase in U.S. domestic demand, reducing the effect on U.S. real\nactivity and inflation and potentially contributing to external imbalances. In the past few\nyears, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S.\n\n- 7 -\nand foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in\nthe dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the\nUnited States. Net exports subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth\nin both 2014 and 2015, while falling non-oil import prices likely subtracted 1/4\npercentage point from the annual rate of core inflation.10\nFinally, the trajectory of federal government debt relative to GDP and views\nregarding the debt’s sustainability can also influence the effects of fiscal policy.\nResearch suggests that increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio cause long-term interest rates to\nrise.11 All else being equal, higher long-term interest rates reduce spending on interest-\nsensitive goods, possibly damping the direct effect of fiscal expansion on economic\nactivity. The experiences of foreign economies suggest that the relationship between\ndebt and interest rates is complex and likely non-linear, with the influence of greater debt\non interest rates rising as the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches a trajectory at which investors\nhave concerns about its sustainability. In this light, it is notable that the current ratio of\ndebt to GDP is substantially larger than it was preceding the fiscal expansions in the early\n1980s and early 2000s and has already been projected to increase further based on\ndemographic trends.12\nGuideposts for Monetary Policy\nWith any future change in fiscal policy quite uncertain, monetary policy will be\nguided by the current state of the economy, the underlying momentum of economic\n9 See Cucuru (forthcoming).\n10 For estimates of the effect of exchange rate changes on inflation and GDP growth, see Gruber,\nMcCallum, and Vigfusson (2016).\n11 See Laubach (2009) and Engen and Hubbard (2005).\n12 I am referring to the level of federal government debt held by the public.\n\n- 8 -\nactivity and inflation, the level of the neutral rate, and the balance of macroeconomic\nrisks. In recent quarters, the data have painted a consistent picture of a resilient and\ngently improving U.S. economy. Following a year in which the unemployment rate\nremained stable while labor force participation increased, we have seen in the past quarter\na further reduction in the unemployment rate. Overall, I am pleased to see that full\nemployment is within reach and could prove sustainable with the right policy mix.\nPayroll growth has remained sufficiently strong to continue eroding slack, increasingly\nalong margins that had previously seemed stubbornly elevated--including the long-term\nunemployed, those on the margins of the labor force, and most recently those who are\nworking part time but would prefer full-time work. Moreover, wage growth appears to\nbe picking up gradually in a further sign that slack continues to be taken up. While the\nemployment cost index was up only 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September,\nstill well below pre-crisis norms, average hourly earnings have accelerated more\nnoticeably, increasing by 2.9 percent on a 12-month basis in December. Even so, some\nslack may remain: Relative to pre-crisis levels, the prime-age employment-to-population\nratio remains low and the share of employees working part time for economic reasons\nremains elevated.\nFollowing a long period of stubbornly below-target inflation, I have been\nencouraged by recent signs of gradual progress toward our inflation target, as the effects\nof earlier dollar appreciation and oil price declines appear to be waning. Over the\n12-month period ending in November, core personal consumption expenditures prices\nincreased 1.6 percent. This rate is still noticeably below 2 percent, but it is up\n\n- 9 -\n1/4 percentage point from a year earlier.13 In addition, market measures of longer-run\ninflation compensation based on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields have\nimproved about 40 basis points relative to the very depressed levels prevailing through\nmuch of the preceding year, although, even with this increase, inflation compensation\nremains well below historical norms.\nIn sum, the economy continues to make gradual progress toward our goals. How\nquickly remaining slack is utilized and inflation returns to target depends on future\ngrowth in activity. Real GDP appears to have increased by about 2 percent last year, the\nsame pace as the year before. Consumer spending has been relatively robust--rising at\nmore than a 3 percent annual rate in the three months ending in November--but business\nfixed investment has been sluggish--increasing only 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter--\nand has changed little, on net, since the middle of 2014. However, measures of both\nbusiness and consumer sentiment have moved up noticeably recently, potentially\nsignaling a stronger pace of investment and consumer spending in the months ahead.\nMeanwhile, changes in financial conditions have been somewhat offsetting since early\nNovember, with equity prices rising 7 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields are up 50\nbasis points, and the dollar is up 4 percent. Based on recent spending indicators, we\nmight expect progress to continue to be gradual and steady. However, if fiscal policy\nchanges lead to a more rapid elimination of slack, policy adjustment would, all else being\nequal, likely be more rapid than otherwise, with the conditions the FOMC has set for a\n13 Oil is an important input in the production and distribution of many consumer goods and services, such\nas transportation services. As a result, when the price of oil drops, production costs decline, and at least\nsome of these cost reductions are typically passed on to consumers over time in the form of lower prices.\n\n- 10 -\ncessation of reinvestments of principal payments on existing securities holdings being\nmet sooner than they otherwise would have been.\nWhen the economy eventually returns to full employment and 2 percent inflation,\nthe appropriate level of the federal funds rate will depend on the level of the neutral rate,\nwhich is expected to move up only modestly in coming years from its current low level.14\nOn the one hand, if progress on employment and inflation occurs more quickly than I\nanticipate, foreign risks recede, and the fiscal impulse rises, the neutral rate might rise\nmore rapidly. On the other hand, global economic conditions may somewhat offset the\neffect on the neutral rate. With weak domestic demand abroad, further tightening of\nfinancial conditions through the exchange rate could lead to some spillover of demand\nacross borders, weighing on U.S. exports, investment, and manufacturing activity and\npotentially constraining the neutral rate.\nFinally, how strongly monetary policy should react to signs of further progress\ntoward full employment and 2 percent inflation naturally depends on the balance of risks.\nGiven the recent improvement in unemployment and inflation and the possibility of\nincreased fiscal stimulus, risks in the domestic economy are closer to being balanced than\nthey have been for some time. While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy\nand its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to\nfull employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained\nperiod could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward\n14 Of course, the neutral rate is not directly observable, and we will only be able to gauge its level by\nobserving the momentum of economic activity and the extent to which the momentum is putting upward\npressure on resource constraints and inflation. The median FOMC participant’s estimate of the longer-run\nreal neutral rate in the December 2016 Summary of Economic Projections was 1 percent. The median\nprojected level of the real neutral rate at the end of 2019 in the December 2016 New York Federal Reserve\nBank’s Survey of Market Participants was also 1 percent.\n\n- 11 -\nstronger inflation outcomes. But risks outside our borders are still tilted to the downside.\nIn particular, despite recent progress, policy space in Japan and the euro area is perceived\nto be very limited, and the euro-area banking sector remains fragile. Downside risks are\nalso present in emerging market economies such as China, which faces capital outflow\npressures and high and rapidly growing corporate indebtedness. With a low U.S. neutral\nrate, conventional U.S. monetary policy does not have as much room as it did prior to the\nfinancial crisis to counter adverse shocks from abroad.\nConclusion\nSpeculation has increased of late about the possibility of a significant fiscal policy\nshift on the horizon. The effects will depend on the timing, magnitude, and composition\nof the policies, the extent to which the policies boost aggregate supply relative to\naggregate demand, the cyclical position of the economy, and the responses of the dollar\nand longer-term interest rates, given the fragile global economic environment and\nprojections for the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio. Against this uncertain backdrop, monetary\npolicy will continue to be guided by actual and expected progress toward our goals, the\nlevel of the neutral rate, and the balance of risks. A gradual approach will remain\nappropriate as long as inflationary pressures remain muted, the economy remains short of\nour objectives, the neutral rate remains low, and downside risks from abroad remain,\nalthough this will depend on the fiscal trajectory, as it evolves, and its uncertain effects\non the economy and financial markets.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics\n(2014). “Updated Historical Forecast Errors (4/9/2014),” memorandum,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/foia/files/20140409-historical-forecast-errors.pdf.\nBongard, Michelle, and Benjamin K.

Inflation is high, and it will take time and\nresolve to get it back down to 2 percent. We are determined to stay the course.1\nFinancial conditions have tightened considerably over the last year as the Federal\nReserve and foreign central banks have tightened policy. Real yields have risen\nsignificantly across the curve over the past year: 2-year yields on Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities (TIPS) have risen more than 4-1/2 percentage points to 2.1 percent,\nand 10-year TIPS yields have risen more than 2-1/4 percentage points to 1.2 percent.\nShort-term real interest rates have moved into decidedly positive territory.2 Mortgage\nrates have doubled.3\nInflation has been declining over the past several months against a backdrop of\nmoderate growth. Yesterday’s industrial production index points to a significant\nweakening in the manufacturing sector, and the retail sales report points to a further\nmoderation in consumer spending. Looking forward, weaker readings on real income,\nwealth, and sentiment, along with indicators of spending on services, such as the ISM\nservices index, point to subdued growth in 2023.4 Real disposable personal income\ndeclined, on net, at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2022,\n1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis for his assistance on these remarks. These views are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For instance, the expected 3-month T-bill rate is currently 4.7 percent, 1.5 percentage points above the\n3-month 3.2 percent median projection of the 2023:Q1 annualized total PCE (personal consumption\nexpenditures) inflation rate in the January Blue Chip survey.\n3 In addition, over the course of the past year, investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads\nover Treasury securities have widened by roughly 50 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively; broad\nequity prices have declined by 17 percent; and the trade-weighted dollar has appreciated by about 4 percent\non net. The Federal Reserve’s broad trade-weighted dollar index is based on 26 currencies of major U.S.\ntrading partners. It is published in Statistical Release H.10, “Foreign Exchange Rates,” available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/current/default.htm.\n4 The Institute for Supply Management’s services index fell by 6.9 points to contractionary territory at 49.6\nin December, reflecting declines in the subindexes for business activity, new orders, and employment.\n\n- 2 -\nsuggesting that recent consumption has been supported by running down pandemic\nsavings and greater reliance on credit.5 In particular, savings among low-income\nhouseholds appear to be lower and to have declined more rapidly than was previously\nappreciated.6\nThe widespread expectation for U.S. growth to be below potential over 2022 and\n2023 reflects significant tightening in both fiscal and monetary policy in an environment\nof broader global tightening. The expiration of previous fiscal stimulus imposed a\nsubstantial drag on real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2022, whereas\nfiscal policy is expected to make a modest contribution over the next few years, in line\nwith its longer-run average.\nBy contrast, the drag on U.S. growth and employment from monetary policy is\nlikely to increase in 2023 because of transmission lags from the rapid, large swing from\naccommodation to restraint in 2022. From March to December 2022, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) undertook a large cumulative tightening in the stance of\nmonetary policy by raising the policy rate 4-1/4 percentage points and shrinking the\nbalance sheet. Although financial conditions adjust immediately to reflect expected and\nactual changes in monetary policy, the full adjustment of output, employment, and\ninflation occurs with a lag.7 Given the speed and magnitude of the swing in the stance of\n5 Total credit card balances were $1.19 trillion in November, relative to $1.09 trillion in December 2019,\nand the share of borrowers with consumer loans in delinquency has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. For\nmore information on credit card balances, see Statistical Release G.19, “Consumer Credit,” available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm.\n6 For a recent assessment of savings since the onset of the pandemic and a decomposition of excess savings\nacross income quartiles, see Aditya Aladangady, David Cho, Laura Feiveson, and Eugenio Pinto (2022),\n“Excess Savings during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, October 21), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3223.\n7 Romer and Romer (2004) and Gertler and Karadi (2015) find that it takes about 9 and 12 months,\nrespectively, for monetary policy actions to begin to affect inflation and additional time for that effect to\n\n- 3 -\nmonetary policy, the lagged effects of earlier accommodation likely offset some of the\ninitial effects of tightening over the course of 2022, and it is likely that the full effect on\ndemand, employment, and inflation of the cumulative tightening that is in the pipeline\nstill lies ahead. That said, there is uncertainty about the timing and magnitude.\nWith that in mind, let’s turn to the implications for the employment leg of our\ndual mandate. In contrast to the slowing of output growth, labor markets remained tight\nthroughout 2022, with layoffs remaining below pre-pandemic levels and the\nunemployment rate ending the year at 3.5 percent, its historical low. Quit rates and the\nratio of job postings to job seekers also remain elevated, although they are off their peaks\nfrom early in the year.\nRecent declines in average weekly hours, temporary-help services, and monthly\npayrolls growth suggest tentative signs that labor demand is cooling. Employment at\ntemporary-help services firms—a good leading indicator—peaked in July 2022 and has\nbeen declining since then, ending the year only slightly above its December 2019 level.\nSimilarly, average weekly hours have declined: After peaking in early 2021 and\npeak. In contrast, Bauer and Swanson (2022) find that inflation effects from monetary policy occur much\nsooner and peak within the first 10 months. See Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer (2004), “A New\nMeasure of Monetary Shocks: Derivation and Implications,” American Economic Review, vol. 94\n(September), pp. 1055–84; Mark Gertler and Peter Karadi (2015), “Monetary Policy Surprises, Credit\nCosts, and Economic Activity,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 7 (January), pp. 44–\n76; and Michael D. Bauer and Eric T. Swanson (2022), “A Reassessment of Monetary Policy Surprises and\nHigh-Frequency Identification,” in Martin Eichenbaum, Erik Hurst, and Valerie A. Ramey, eds., NBER\nMacroeconomics Annual 2022, vol. 37 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press). In addition, recent\nresearch suggests that there may have been an acceleration in the maximum effect on inflation following\nthe broader use of balance sheet and forward-guidance tools in 2009, bringing the arrival of that maximum\neffect from three years to as little as 12 months, though considerable uncertainty surrounds that estimate.\nSee Taeyoung Doh and Andrew T. Foerster (2022), “Have Lags in Monetary Policy Transmission\nShortened?” Economic Bulletin (Kansas City: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, December),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/have-lags-in-monetary-policy-transmission-\nshortened.\n\n- 4 -\nremaining elevated through May 2022, average weekly hours have declined and now\nstand at the bottom of the range for this metric over the five years before the pandemic.\nThe continued decline in average weekly hours is notable because this margin is among\nthe easiest to adjust by firms facing declining demand, especially those who may be\nreluctant to undertake layoffs following the challenges encountered in restoring\nemployment following the pandemic-induced layoffs. In addition, average payrolls\ngrowth in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ establishment survey fell from 540,000 jobs per\nmonth in the first quarter of 2022 to 250,000 jobs per month in the fourth quarter.\nThat said, labor supply appears likely to remain constrained. On net, the labor\nforce participation rate flattened out over 2022 at a level that is about 1 percentage point\nlower than pre-pandemic, primarily reflecting an estimated 2.5 million in excess\nretirements, as well as some impact from long COVID.8 Immigration has also been low\nin recent years.9\nDespite constrained supply, wages do not appear to be driving inflation in a\n1970s-style wage–price spiral. It is true that wages have grown faster than the pace\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation and productivity growth. It is also true that wages\nhave grown slower than inflation over the past two years, and that aggregate real wages\n8 A discussion of the labor market impact of long COVID can be found in Price (2022) and the references\nwithin.

Price (2022), “Long COVID, Cognitive Impairment, and the Stalled Decline in\nDisability Rates,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nAugust 5), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3189.\n9 By one estimate, the changes in immigration policy since 2016, in combination with the pandemic travel\nrestrictions, reduced the total level of immigration by 3.4 million people over the period from 2016 to 2021.\nAs the authors of this study note, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey,\naround 50 percent of immigrants from 2001 to 2020 joined the labor force within a year of their arrival.\nSee Elior Cohen and Samantha Shampine (2022), “Immigration Shortfall May Be a Headwind for Labor\nSupply,” Economic Bulletin (Kansas City: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/immigration-shortfall-may-be-a-headwind-for-\nlabor-supply.\n\n- 5 -\nhave fallen. It appears that workers in lower-wage sectors who saw high pandemic\nlayoffs initially and benefited from job switching subsequently as businesses scrambled\nto hire have seen wage gains in real terms. However, in the aggregate, the gains among\nlower-wage workers were more than offset by real wage declines among middle- and\nhigher-wage workers in the context of a broader compression in the real wage\ndistribution, as David Autor points out.10 Overall, the labor share of income has declined\nover the past two years and appears to be at or below pre-pandemic levels, while\ncorporate profits as a share of GDP remain near postwar highs.\nRetail markups in a number of sectors have seen material increases in what could\nbe described as a price–price spiral, whereby final prices have risen by more than the\nincreases in input prices.11 The compression of these markups as supply constraints ease,\ninventories rise, and demand cools could contribute to disinflationary pressures.\nThere are tentative signs that wage growth is moderating. Growth in average\nhourly earnings has softened recently—stepping down to 4.1 percent annualized growth\non a 3-month basis in December from roughly 4.5 percent on a 6-month and 12-month\nbasis. I will be watching to see whether the employment cost index data at the end of this\nmonth show the deceleration from the third quarter continuing into the fourth quarter.\n10 See David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2022), “The Unexpected Compression:\nCompetition at Work in the Low Wage Economy,” lecture delivered at Markus’ Academy, Bendheim\nCenter for Finance, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. (via webcast), December 8,\nhttps://bcf.princeton.edu/events/david-autur-on-the-unexpected-compression-competition-at-work-in-the-\nlow-wage-economy.\n11 Since the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided with large increases in\nretail trade margins in several sectors, increases that have exceeded the contemporaneous increase in wages\npaid to the workers in those sectors. For example, since the end of 2019, retail trade margins for food and\ngrocery retailers increased by about 25 percent, outstripping the growth in average hourly earnings for\nworkers in that sector, which was just under 19 percent. A similar gap exists between margin and wage\nincreases for general merchandise retailers, which were 24 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\n- 6 -\nLet’s now turn to the inflation leg of our dual mandate. Inflation has declined in\nrecent months from very high levels. With the consumer price index and producer price\nindex now available, total PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation in\nDecember is likely to have run at around a 2.3 percent annualized pace on a 3- and 6-\nmonth basis, as compared with 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis. This deceleration\nreflects an easing in war-related energy shocks as well as in core goods inflation: Energy\nand core goods each subtracted nearly three-fourths of 1 percentage point from 3-month\nannualized total PCE inflation. The declines in energy and core goods are a reversal of\nprevious large increases and are expected to moderate.\nCore PCE inflation is running at a 3.1 percent annualized pace on a 3-month\nbasis—below its 3.8 percent reading on a 6-month basis and 4.5 percent on a 12-month\nbasis. Within this, recent declines in core goods inflation reflect a reduction in core\nimport prices, an easing of supply chains, a restocking of inventories, and cooling\ndemand. Core goods prices are likely to flatten out once earlier large gains reverse, in the\nabsence of new shocks, and overall core inflation could move up somewhat for a time as\na result.\nIn that regard, housing services inflation remains stubbornly high at 8.8 percent\non a 3-month basis—compared with 7.7 percent on a 12-month basis. Housing services\nare making an annualized contribution to core PCE that is more than double their\ncontribution before the pandemic. That said, the housing sector is highly interest\nsensitive, and the most recent reading of one national indicator pointed to house prices\n\n- 7 -\nhaving declined 2.5 percent over the five months ending in November.12 Similarly, rents\nbased on new leases are decelerating sharply.13 Although it is currently offset by catch-\nup in renewing leases, the decline in rent on new leases will show through to average rent\nover time, and declines in housing services inflation are expected by the third quarter of\nthis year.14\nIn addition, nonhousing services are running at about 4.4 percent annualized\ninflation on a 3-month basis, similar to their 12-month pace. There are a range of views\non what it will take to bring down this component of inflation to pre-pandemic levels.\nSince wages constitute a significant fraction of costs for most firms in nonhousing\nservices, one possible channel is through a weakening in labor demand. That said, to the\nextent that inputs other than wages may have been responsible in part for important price\nincreases for some nonhousing service sectors, an unwinding of these factors could help\nbring down nonhousing services inflation.\nThere is some recent evidence that the persistent components of inflation in core\ngoods and nonhousing services, particularly transportation, recreation, and food services\nand accommodation, have behaved similarly, peaking around early 2022 and steadily\n12 The CoreLogic Home Price Index peaked in June 2022 and has declined in each month through\nNovember 2022. More information is available at https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/u-s-home-price-\ninsights-january-2023/.\n13 The CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index shows a significant deceleration over the 7 months ending in\nNovember, including negative month over month rent growth in September through November; see\nCoreLogic (2023), “CoreLogic: US Annual Rent Growth Drops for the Seventh Straight Month in\nNovember,” January 17, https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/corelogic-us-annual-rent-growth-drops-\nfor-the-seventh-straight-month-in-november/.\n14 For a recent analysis of the lead–lag relationship between indexes of market rents for new tenants and the\nindexes of average rent for all tenants, see Brian Adams, Lara Loewenstein, Hugh Montag, and Randal J.\nVerbrugge (2022), “Disentangling Rent Index Differences: Data, Methods, and Scope,” Working Paper\nSeries 22-38 (Cleveland: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, December), https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-\nwp-202238.\n\n- 8 -\ndeclining since then.15 To the extent that the persistent components of these nonhousing\nservices and core goods reflect common factors that are fading, such as pass-through\nfrom commodity and supply chain shocks, they are unlikely to be as cyclically persistent,\nas long as inflation expectations are well anchored.16\nOf course, an extended period of high goods and services inflation resulting from\na series of demand and supply shocks associated with the pandemic and the war could\nlead to a rise in inflation expectations, which would make it much more difficult to bring\ninflation down.17 That is why it has been important for monetary policy to take a risk-\nmanagement posture to defend the expectations anchor. And the evidence from market-\nand survey-based measures suggests that longer-term inflation expectations are well\nanchored, while year-ahead measures have recently declined but remain elevated.\nTogether, the price trends in core goods and nonhousing services, the tentative\nindications of some deceleration in wages, the evidence of anchored expectations, and the\nscope for margin compression may provide some reassurance that we are not currently\nexperiencing a 1970s-style wage–price spiral. For these reasons, it remains possible that\na continued moderation in aggregate demand could facilitate continued easing in the\nlabor market and reduction in inflation without a significant loss of employment.18\n15 See Martín Almuzara, Marek Jarocinski, and Argia Sbordone (2023), “The Layers of Inflation\nPersistence,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), January 5,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/01/the-layers-of-inflation-persistence.\n16 And, of course, the reemergence of additional shocks to commodities and intermediate inputs is possible.\n17 For a discussion of supply shocks and monetary policy in the context of recent events, see Lael Brainard\n(2022), “What Can We Learn from the Pandemic and the War about Supply Shocks, Inflation, and\nMonetary Policy?” summary of remarks delivered as part of a panel at the Bank for International\nSettlements Annual Meeting on June 24, Basel, Switzerland,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20221128a.htm.\n18 For a description of one path to such an outcome, see Andrew Figura and Chris Waller (2022), “What\nDoes the Beveridge Curve Tell Us about the Likelihood of a Soft Landing?” FEDS Notes (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 29), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3190.\n\n- 9 -\nNonetheless, substantial uncertainty remains. Further shocks associated with the\nwar and the pandemic are possible. While there has been some improvement in the\noutlook for activity and inflation in Europe, there is uncertainty about the implications of\nChina’s exit from zero COVID for global demand and inflation, especially in\ncommodities.\nTurning to the implications for policy, my colleagues and I are committed to\nrestoring price stability. The FOMC moved policy into restrictive territory at a rapid\npace and subsequently downshifted the pace of increases in the target range at its most\nrecent meeting. This will enable us to assess more data as we move the policy rate closer\nto a sufficiently restrictive level, taking into account the risks around our dual-mandate\ngoals. In parallel, balance sheet runoff is continuing. Even with the recent moderation,\ninflation remains high, and policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for some time to\nmake sure inflation returns to 2 percent on a sustained basis.",

This approach adds to what we have\nlearned from earlier papers that have examined the performance of unconventional policy\ntools with respect to individual components of financial conditions—most notably, long-\nterm sovereign yields, but also mortgage rates, equities, exchange rates, and corporate\ndebt spreads.3\nEmpirically assessing the question in the report is not only important, but also\nchallenging, as the report readily acknowledges. There are a host of difficult endogeneity\nand omitted-variable issues, which the authors endeavor to address. The authors\nconclude that unconventional monetary policies worked during the crisis but did not fully\noffset a significant tightening in financial conditions. This finding leads the authors to\nconclude that these policies should be deployed quickly and aggressively in the future\n3 See Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The Financial Market\nEffects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of Central Banking,\nvol. 7 (March), pp. 3–43; Michael E.

This point is very important, so it will\nbe the focus of my discussion.\nLooking back at the international experience, the evidence suggests that forward\nguidance and balance sheet policies were broadly effective in providing accommodation\nfollowing the financial crisis. But they were less effective when there were long delays\nin implementation or apparent inconsistencies among policy tools. It is important to\ndistill key lessons from the past use of these tools in order to make them more effective in\nthe future.4\nFirst, in some cases around the world, unconventional tools were implemented\nonly after long delays and debate, which sapped confidence, tightened financial\nconditions, and weakened recovery. The delays often reflected concerns about the\nputative costs and risks of these policies, such as stoking high inflation and impairing\nmarket functioning. These costs and risks did not materialize or proved manageable, and\nI expect these tools to be deployed more forcefully and readily in the future.5\nSecond, forward guidance proved to be vital during the crisis, but it took some\ntime to recognize the importance of conditioning forward guidance on specific outcomes\nor dates and to align the full set of policy tools. In several cases, the targeted outcomes\n4 For instance, analysis by Ben Bernanke suggests “that a combination of asset purchases and forward\nguidance can add roughly 3 percentage points of policy space.” See Ben S. Bernanke (2020), “The New\nTools of Monetary Policy,” presidential address to the American Economic Association, San Diego, Calif.,\nJanuary 4, p.3, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bernanke_ASSA_lecture.pdf.\n5 This issue was discussed in the July 2019 Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the context of the\nframework review. As noted in the minutes of the meeting (p. 3), “Participants further observed that such\ninflation risks—along with several of the other perceived risks of providing substantial accommodation\nthrough nontraditional policy tools, including possible adverse implications for financial stability—had not\nbeen realized. In particular, a number of participants commented that, as many of the potential costs of the\nCommittee’s asset purchases had failed to materialize, the Federal Reserve might have been able to make\nuse of balance sheet tools even more aggressively over the past decade in providing appropriate levels of\naccommodation.” (Available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20190731.pdf).\n\n- 4 -\nset too low a bar, which in turn diminished market expectations regarding monetary\naccommodation. In some cases, expectations regarding the timing of liftoff and asset\npurchase tapering worked at cross-purposes.\nIn addition, in some cases, it proved difficult to calibrate asset purchase programs\nsmoothly over the course of the recovery. To the extent that the public is uncertain about\nthe conditions that might trigger asset purchases, the scale of purchases, and how long the\npurchases might be sustained, it could undercut the efficacy of the policy. Furthermore,\nthe cessation of asset purchases and subsequent balance sheet normalization can present\nchallenges in communications and implementation.\nFinally, in the fog of war, it was difficult for policymakers to distinguish clearly\nbetween temporary headwinds associated with the crisis and emerging structural features\nof the new normal. In part as a result, it took some time to integrate forward guidance\nand other unconventional policies seamlessly, and it took even longer to recognize that\npolicy settings were unlikely to return to pre-crisis norms.\nLooking Ahead\nThe current generation of central bankers faces a different core challenge than the\nlast generation, with substantially smaller scope for cutting interest rates to buffer the\neconomy and inflation that is low and relatively unresponsive to resource utilization.\nWith trend inflation running below the symmetric 2 percent objective, there is a risk that\ninflation expectations have slipped. With price inflation showing little sensitivity to\nresource utilization, policy may have to remain accommodative for a long time to achieve\n2 percent inflation following a period of undershooting. With the equilibrium interest\nrate very low, the Federal Open Market Committee can cut the federal funds rate by only\n\n- 5 -\nabout half as much as it has done historically to buffer the economy from recession.\nConsequently, the policy rate is likely to be constrained by the lower bound more\nfrequently, likely at times when inflation is below target and unemployment is elevated.\nThe likelihood that the policy rate will be stuck at the lower bound more frequently risks\neroding expected inflation and actual inflation, which could further compress the room to\ncut nominal interest rates in a downward spiral. Japan’s experience illustrates the\nchallenges associated with such a downward spiral.\nToday’s new normal calls not only for a broader set of tools, but also a different\nstrategy.6 We should clarify in advance that we will deploy a broader set of tools\nproactively to provide accommodation when shocks are likely to push the policy rate to\nits lower bound. Equally important, we should adopt a strategy that successfully achieves\nmaximum employment and average inflation outcomes of 2 percent over time.\nThe lessons from the crisis would argue for an approach that commits to maintain\npolicy at the lower bound until full employment and target inflation are achieved. This\nforward guidance could be reinforced by interest rate caps on short-term Treasury\nsecurities over the same horizon. To have the greatest effect, it will be important to\ncommunicate and explain the framework in advance so that the public anticipates the\napproach and takes it into account in their spending and investment decisions.\nForward guidance that commits to refrain from lifting the policy rate from its\nlower bound until full employment and 2 percent inflation are achieved is vital to ensure\n6 See Lael Brainard (2019), “Federal Reserve Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and\nCommunications: Some Preliminary Views,” speech delivered at the presentation of the 2019 William F.\nButler Award, New York Association for Business Economics, New York, November 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20191126a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nachievement of our dual-mandate goals with compressed conventional policy space.7 To\nstrengthen the credibility of the forward guidance, interest rate caps could be\nimplemented in tandem as a commitment mechanism. Based on its assessment of how\nlong it is likely to take to achieve full employment and target inflation, the Committee\nwould commit to capping rates out the yield curve for a period consistent with its\nexpectation for the duration of the outcome-based forward guidance. Of course, if the\noutlook shifted materially, the Committee could reassess how long it will take to reach its\ngoals and adjust policy accordingly.\nOne important benefit is that this approach would smoothly move to capping\ninterest rates on the short-to-medium segment of the yield curve once the policy rate\nmoves to the lower bound and avoid the risk of delays or uncertainty that could be\nassociated with asset purchases regarding the scale and timeframe. The interest rate caps\nwould transmit additional accommodation through the longer rates that are relevant for\nhouseholds and businesses in a manner that is more akin to conventional policy and more\ncontinuous than quantitative asset purchases.\nAnother important benefit is that the forward guidance and the yield curve caps\nwould reinforce each other. Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce\nforward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps\nand thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment. Once\n7 See Ben S. Bernanke, Michael T. Kiley, and John M.

This approach should avoid\nsome of the tantrum dynamics that have led to premature steepening of the yield curve in\nseveral jurisdictions.8\nToday’s low-inflation, low interest rate environment requires not only new\nrecession-fighting tools but also a new strategy to address the persistent undershooting of\nthe inflation target—and the risk to inflation expectations—well before a downturn.\nVarious strategies have been proposed that seek to make up for past inflation deviations\nfrom target.9 To be successful, formal makeup strategies, such as an average-inflation-\ntargeting rule, require that market participants, households, and businesses understand the\npolicy in advance and find it credible. While formal average-inflation-targeting rules\nhave some attractive properties in theory, they could be difficult to communicate and\nimplement in practice due to time-inconsistency problems as well as uncertainty about\nunderlying economic parameters.10\nI prefer flexible inflation ave raging that would aim to achieve inflation outcomes\nthat average 2 percent over time. Flexible inflation averaging would imply supporting\n8 For unusually severe recessions, such as the financial crisis, such an approach could be augmented with\npurchases of 10-year Treasury securities to provide further accommodation at the long end of the yield\ncurve. The requisite scale of such purchases—when combined with medium-term yield curve ceilings and\nforward guidance on the policy rate—should be relatively smaller than if the longer-term asset purchases\nwere used alone.\n9 See, for example, Lars E.O. Svensson (2020), “Monetary Policy Strategies for the Federal Reserve,”\nNBER Working Paper Series 26657 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, January).\n10 See the discussion of formal makeup strategies in the minutes of the September 2019 Federal Open\nMarket Committee meeting (pp. 2–3), available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20190918.pdf.

Flexible inflation\naveraging would bring some of the benefits of a formal average-inflation-targeting rule,\nbut it could be more robust and simpler to communicate and implement. Following\nseveral years when inflation has remained in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, the\nCommittee could target inflation outcomes in a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for a period to\nachieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent, on average, overall.\nBy committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the\nCommittee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than offset\nmodest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of\nopportunistic reflation.11 This approach will help move inflation expectations back to our\n2 percent objective, which is critical to preserve conventional policy space.\nIt is important to emphasize that for monetary policy to be effective, it will be key\nfor policymakers to communicate their strategy clearly in advance to the public, to act\nearly and decisively, and to commit to providing the requisite accommodation until full\nemployment and target inflation are sustainably achieved. This was one of the important\nconclusions of this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum report.\nFiscal Policy\nEven with a revamped monetary policy strategy and expanded tools, there are\nrisks. As the authors note, persistent very low levels of long-run rates could hamper the\n11 See Janice C. Eberly, James H. Stock, and Jonathan H.

The reduced conventional monetary policy buffer\nmakes the importance of fiscal support during a downturn even greater than it has been in\nthe past, and the case for fiscal support is especially compelling in the context of very\nlow long-term interest rates. Not only is fiscal policy more vital when monetary policy is\nconstrained by the lower bound, but research suggests it is also more powerful.14\nWhereas monetary policy is powerful but blunt, fiscal policy can be more targeted\nin its effects. This is especially important today, when a large share of American\nhouseholds have low liquid savings and are particularly vulnerable to periods of\nunemployment or underemployment.\nThe appropriate design of a more automatic, faster-acting countercyclical fiscal\napproach requires study and development. Just as monetary policymakers are actively\n12 See, for example, the minutes of the October 2019 Federal Open Market Committee meeting (p. 4): “In\naddition, some participants noted that the effectiveness of these tools might be diminished in the future, as\nlonger-term interest rates have declined to very low levels and would likely be even lower following an\nadverse shock that could lead to the resumption of large-scale asset purchases; as a result, there might be\nlimited scope for balance sheet tools to provide accommodation.” (Available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20191030.pdf).\n13 See, for instance, Michael T. Kiley (2019), “The Global Equilibrium Real Interest Rate: Concepts,\nEstimates, and Challenges,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2019-076 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, October), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.076.\n14 See Paul R. Krugman (1998), “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 2, p. 137–87; and Olivier J. Blanchard and Daniel Leigh (2013),\n“Growth Forecast Errors and Fiscal Multipliers,” American Economic Review, vol. 103 (May, Papers and\nProceedings), pp. 117–20.\n\n- 10 -\nreviewing their tools and strategies, now is the time to undertake a review of fiscal tools\nand strategies to ensure they are ready and effective.\nFinancial Stability\nFinancial stability is central to the achievement of our dual-mandate goals. The\nnew normal of low interest rates and inflation also has implications for the interplay\nbetween financial stability and monetary policy. In the decades when the Phillips curve\nwas steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, which would prompt the\nCommittee to raise interest rates to restrictive levels. These interest rate increases would\nhave the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly, thereby naturally\ndamping financial imbalances as the expansion extends.\nWith trend inflation persistently below target and a flat Phillips curve, not only is\nthe policy rate expected be low for long due to the decline in the neutral rate, but the\npolicy rate may also remain below the neutral rate for longer in order to move inflation\nback to target sustainably. The expectation of a long period of accommodative monetary\npolicy and low rates, during a period with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is\nconducive to risk-taking, providing incentives to reach for yield and take on additional\ndebt.\nTo the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and\nlow underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to\nthe business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the\nfinancial cycle. In today’s new normal, a combination of strengthened structural\nsafeguards along with countercyclical macroprudential tools is important to enable\nmonetary policy to stay focused on achieving maximum employment and target\n\n- 11 -\ninflation.15 The countercyclical capital buffer, which was not available before the crisis,\nis particularly well designed to address financial imbalances over the cycle.\nConclusion\nWith the policy rate more likely to be constrained by the lower bound, the core\nchallenge facing the current generation of central bankers is different than the last\ngeneration. The authors of the report emphasize the importance of deploying an\nexpanded toolkit proactively, avoiding costly delays, and communicating clearly to the\npublic. To be fully effective, proactive use of an expanded toolkit needs to be coupled\nwith a new strategy that achieves average inflation outcomes of 2 percent along with\nmaximum employment over time.\n15 See, for example, the minutes of the January 2020 Federal Open Market Committee meeting (p. 9),\navailable on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20200129.pdf.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nMay 30, 2017\nNavigating the Different Signals from Inflation and Unemployment\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, New York\nMay 30, 2017\n\nFor the first time in many years, we are seeing signs of synchronized economic\nexpansions at home and abroad, and the balance of risks globally has become more\npositive. Recent data suggest that the underlying momentum of the domestic expansion\nremains solid. While U.S. consumption was weak in the first quarter of 2017, the data so\nfar are consistent with a rebound in the current quarter. Moreover, financial conditions\nremain supportive of continued economic expansion despite some recent volatility.1\nThe ongoing progress in bringing Americans back into productive employment is\nespecially heartening. With continued strength in the labor market, economic activity\nregaining momentum, and a brighter outlook abroad, it would be appropriate soon to see\nthe federal funds rate moving closer to its neutral level. If the economy evolves in line\nwith the March Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) median path, normalization of\nthe federal funds rate is likely to be well underway before too long, setting the stage for a\ngradual and predictable running off of the balance sheet.\nEven so, I see some tension between signs that the economy is in the\nneighborhood of full employment and indications that the tentative progress we had seen\non inflation may be slowing. If the tension between the progress on employment and the\nlack of progress on inflation persists, it may lead me to reassess the expected path of the\nfederal funds rate in the future, although it is premature to make that call today.\nDifferent Signals from the Labor Market and Inflation\nLet me start by reviewing the conflicting readings we are getting from the labor\nmarket and from inflation.\nI am grateful to Jim Clouse and John Roberts for their assistance in preparing this text.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe labor market has continued to strengthen. Payroll growth has averaged\n175,000 over the past three months, more than sufficient to absorb new entrants into the\nlabor market. Although earlier in the recovery, it appeared that the U-3 unemployment\nrate was running ahead of broader indicators of slack, more recently, it has been\nencouraging to see other margins of slack being drawn down. The labor force\nparticipation rate has held stable, against what many believe to be a downward trend\nbased on demographics, and the employment-to-population ratio has reached a new post-\nrecession high. Moreover, the share of employees who work part time for economic\nreasons has recently moved down close to its pre-crisis level, after a long period of\nremaining at elevated levels.\nThe most commonly used U-3 measure of the unemployment rate moved down to\n4.4 percent in April. This happens to be the cyclical low reached in 2006-07, although\nunemployment was at or below this level much of the time from the middle of 1998 to\nthe middle of 2001. Relative to recent decades, the unemployment rate is now quite low.\nIn fact, some have voiced concerns that the economy has proven unable to sustain its\nexpansion when the unemployment rate has fallen below these levels. With that in mind,\nit is worth asking whether we should be worried that history will inevitably repeat itself.\nThe truth is, we cannot know for sure. Although rising inflation often heralded\nthe death knell of economic expansions in earlier decades, inflation expectations have\nbeen well anchored and rising inflation has presented less of a risk in the most recent\nbusiness cycles.2 From 1998 to 2001, for instance, core personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation never exceeded 2 percent on a four-quarter basis. Core PCE\n2 In the period from 1950 to 2000, inflation often rose late in the business cycle. In response, the Federal\nReserve raised interest rates, which in turn led to a weaker economy.\n\n- 3 -\ninflation did reach as high as 2.4 percent in the period from 2006 to 2007, but, at the time,\nthis higher inflation was viewed as reflecting the pass-through of a significant run-up in\nenergy and non-energy import prices.3\nToday, there is little indication of an outbreak of inflation--rather, the latest data\non inflation have been lower than expected. If anything, the puzzle today is why inflation\nappears to be slowing at a time when most forecasters place the economy at or near full\nemployment.\nEven wage inflation, which is most tightly connected to labor market slack, shows\nlittle sign of heating up by most measures. Overall, wages are increasing a bit more\nrapidly than they were a few years ago, but the latest data on wages do not show much\nprogress over the past year. Average hourly earnings rose only 2-1/2 percent in the\n12 months through April, the same as a year earlier. Similarly, the employment cost\nindex was up only 2-1/4 percent in the 12 months through March. While that is up from\na year earlier, it is lower than two years ago. The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker\ntells a similar story: Upward movement in wage gains was observed until about a year or\nso ago, but there has been little acceleration recently.\nTurning to overall inflation, earlier this year, reports indicated that the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s (FOMC) preferred measure of inflation--the headline measure\nof consumer price inflation on a national accounts basis--had, on a 12-month change\nbasis, risen close to the FOMC’s objective, but the latest figures have edged down\nsomewhat as the rebound in energy prices has abated. I tend to place greater weight on\n3 For example, the FOMC minutes for March 2007 expressed “concern” about the rate of inflation but\nnoted that increases in energy and non-energy imports could explain some of the upward pressure on core\nprices (see Board of Governors, 2007, paragraph 23). The outlook was for a gradual decline in core\ninflation.\n\n- 4 -\nthe core measure of inflation, which abstracts from the transitory movements in energy\nprices and is a better predictor of future inflation. In the April report, the core measure--\nthat is, excluding food and energy prices--had increased only 1.5 percent on a 12-month\nchange basis. That reading marks a considerable shortfall from the Committee’s\n2 percent objective. And there does not seem to have been any progress over the past\nyear or so: Core PCE inflation is about the same over the past 12 months as over the\npreceding period. Although the past two monthly readings of core inflation have been\nheld down in part by idiosyncratic factors, including upgrades to cell-phone plans, the\napparent lack of progress in moving core inflation back to 2 percent is a source of\nconcern.\nTraditionally, economists assessed that as labor market slack diminished and the\neconomy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation would result, in the\nstatistical relationship known as the Phillips curve. But I am not confident we can count\non the Phillips curve to restore inflation to target in today’s economy. Since 2012,\ninflation has tended to change relatively little--both absolutely and relative to earlier\ndecades--as the unemployment rate has fallen considerably.4 At a time when the\nunemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.4 percent, core inflation has\nundershot our 2 percent target for 58 straight months.5 In other words, the Phillips curve\nappears to be flatter today than it was previously. This is also true in a number of\nadvanced foreign economies, where declines in unemployment rates to low levels have\nfailed to generate significant upward pressures on inflation.\n4 See Blanchard (2016), Kiley (2015), and Brainard (2015a). Similarly, inflation did not fall very much as\nthe unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent during the Great Recession.\n5 The inflation information refers to core PCE inflation measured on a 12-month average basis.\n\n- 5 -\nWith the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been\nin the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important.\nHere, recent developments are mixed. The May reading of the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers’ measure of longer-term inflation expectations remained near its\nall-time low, while the New York Fed’s measure of three-year inflation expectations\nedged up in its latest reading to the highest level in more than a year. And although\nmarket-based measures of inflation compensation have improved relative to their lows in\nthe middle of last year, they are still below the average level in the period from 2010 to\n2014.\nAttaining the Committee’s symmetric target for inflation on a sustainable basis is\nespecially important in the current environment, with the neutral real interest rate at\nhistorically lower levels, in order to ensure conventional policy has room to respond to\nunexpected adverse developments. Underlying fundamentals, such as import prices and\ndiminishing slack, should lead inflation to resume moving closer to its goal. Nonetheless,\ncurrently I see more signs that progress on inflation is slowing than of a breakout of\ninflation to the upside, as might be the case with a nonlinearity in the relationship\nbetween inflation and unemployment when unemployment is very low.6\nBut as noted earlier, a breakout in inflation also was not a primary concern\nfollowing the past two times the unemployment rate dropped as low as it is now, in 1998\nand 2006, when recessions followed within two or three years. One notable feature of\nboth episodes was that they were preceded by sharply elevated financial imbalances. In\nthe late 1990s, equity prices had reached very high levels, according to common\n6 See Nalewaik (2016).\n\n- 6 -\nmeasures of stock market valuations. And the period from 2006 to 2007 coincided with a\nhouse price bubble, along with extreme leverage at a number of large financial\ninstitutions and widespread use of exotic financial products.\nBroadly speaking, financial conditions today appear to be more balanced: In most\nmarkets, house prices seem fairly well aligned with rents. Large banks are much better\ncapitalized than before the crisis and appear to be managing their risk exposures and\nliquidity much more carefully. While today’s equity market valuations appear somewhat\nelevated, they do not seem to be near the dizzying heights reached in 1999 and\n2000. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, importantly including critical financial reforms\nas well as changes in risk appetite, leverage and maturity transformation are at much\nlower levels than they were before the crisis.\nOne area that merits ongoing vigilance is corporate indebtedness, which remains\nat a high level and where investor appetite still seems strong. Another area of concern is\nauto lending--particularly in the subprime segment--where underwriting appears to have\nbecome quite lax last year and, consequently, delinquency rates indicate more borrowers\nstruggling to keep up with their payments. Eight years into the recovery, it is important\nto recognize that financial conditions can change rapidly and bear special vigilance.\nNonetheless, risks to the U.S. financial system do not appear to be flashing red in the way\nthey did in the run-up to previous downturns.\nIt is also possible that the natural rate of unemployment has moved lower or that\nthe unemployment rate still may be overstating the strength of the labor market. While it\nis encouraging that the share of employees who work part time for economic reasons has\ncontinued to move down, there may well be slack remaining along this margin. And\n\n- 7 -\nanother key measure--the prime-age employment-to-population ratio--remains more than\n1 percentage point below pre-crisis levels, and further improvement there would be\nwelcome.\nThe Outlook\nLooking at economic activity more broadly, although first-quarter gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) was soft, the data so far suggest a rebound in the second quarter. The\nweak Q1 reading follows a recurring pattern in recent years, with the first quarter of the\nyear often weaker than subsequent quarters. Moreover, below the top-line number, there\nwere some encouraging signs of strength: Residential construction posted a double-digit\nincrease and contributed 1/2 percentage point to first-quarter GDP growth. Drilling for\noil and natural gas is rebounding sharply, and nonresidential construction contributed\n3/4 percentage point to first-quarter GDP growth. Business spending on equipment and\nintangibles, which fell slightly in 2016, rebounded to a 7 percent annualized increase in\nthe first quarter and contributed another 3/4 percentage point to the overall increase.\nA key reason overall GDP was so weak last quarter was consumer spending,\nwhich rose only 0.6 percent at an annual rate. Nonetheless, there are good reasons to\nthink that the first-quarter weakness in consumer spending will not persist. Household\nincomes should continue rising with the continued strengthening in employment and\nwages, home prices should be contributing through improved household balance sheets,\nand consumer sentiment remains upbeat.\nRecent changes in financial conditions have, overall, been supportive of further\ngains in the real economy. The S&P 500 index is up almost 8 percent since the start of\nthe year. At the same time, a broad measure of the exchange value of the dollar is down\n\n- 8 -\nabout 4 percent so far this year, which should help boost net exports. After moving up\nsharply late last year, long-term interest rates have moved down somewhat so far this\nyear.\nIn addition, the balance of risks has shifted over the past two quarters, with a\nnumber of downside risks receding and some upside risks emerging. In particular, the\nlatest international economic data have suggested waning downside risks from abroad,\nwhile continued labor market strength and the prospect for fiscal stimulus in the United\nStates present a possible upside risk to domestic demand.\nImportantly, we are seeing synchronized global growth for the first time in many\nyears. Growth forecasts for both advanced and emerging market economies are being\nmarked up, breaking a pattern of repeated downward revisions from 2013 to 2016.\nRecent political developments significantly enhanced the prospects for policy continuity\nin the euro area, and there has been continued growth in euro-area employment and\neconomic activity. While Italy continues to face political, economic, and financial risks,\nrecent developments augur well for the resilience of the broader euro area.\nChina’s first-quarter growth came in above 7 percent at an annual rate, although\nthere appears to have been some moderation since then, and capital outflows slowed\nnotably. China’s economy bears watching in the medium term, especially given\nfinancial-sector risks and elevated debt levels. Although Mexico’s growth may moderate\nthis year, both the Mexican equity market and the exchange rate have strengthened, along\nwith confidence, following sharp falls late last year.\nAlong with the favorable shift in foreign risks, recent announcements on fiscal\npolicy suggest some upside risk to U.S. aggregate demand. The Administration has\n\n- 9 -\nproposed deep tax cuts, which, if implemented, could amount to about 2 percentage\npoints of GDP in the first few years according to independent estimates. Most estimates\nsuggest that the supply-side effects of these policies would be fairly small, so, if enacted,\nthe net effect could well be a boost to U.S. aggregate demand at a time when the\neconomy could be at full employment. Nonetheless, there is considerable uncertainty\nabout the magnitude and timing of any policy changes. There is also important\nuncertainty about the deliberations over the debt limit, which are likely to garner\nincreasing attention in the early fall and will factor into my considerations of risks to the\noutlook.\nThe Path of Policy\nOn balance, when assessing economic activity and its likely evolution, it would be\nreasonable to conclude that further removal of accommodation will likely be appropriate\nsoon. As I noted earlier, the unemployment rate is now at 4.4 percent, and we are seeing\nimprovement in other measures of labor market slack, such as participation and the share\nof those working part time for economic reasons. There are good reasons to believe that\nthe improvement in real economic activity will continue: Financial conditions remain\nsupportive. Indicators of sentiment remain positive. The balance of risks at home has\nshifted favorably, downside risks from abroad are lower than they have been in several\nyears, and we are seeing synchronous global growth.\nThe time for a change in balance sheet policy is coming into clearer view as\nnormalization of the federal funds rate approaches the range that can be considered “well\nunder way.” If the outlook and the expected federal funds rate path evolve in line with\n\n- 10 -\nthe median projection of FOMC participants reported in the March SEP, the federal funds\nrate will soon approach midway to its expected long-run equilibrium value.\nI shared my framework for thinking about the change in balance sheet policy in\nearly March, and today I will elaborate on the approach that seems most appropriate to\nachievement of our goals.7 Consideration that normalization of the federal funds rate is\nwell underway was the criterion the Committee adopted in its December 2015 decision to\ncontinue to reinvest principal payments. In my view, that “well under way” standard has\nserved an important purpose.8 With asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary\npolicy to respond to shocks, maintaining reinvestments provided an important benefit by\nenabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would have been possible with a\nshrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for reductions if conditions\ndeteriorate. This approach has ensured that our most proven tool, the federal funds rate,\nwill have reached a level at which it can be cut if needed to buffer adverse shocks, thus\nhelping to guard against the asymmetric risks associated with the effective lower bound.\nWith the federal funds rate projected to be in the range that is midway to the Committee’s\nprojection of the long-run value of the federal funds rate later this year, I would consider\nit reasonable to assess that this threshold will have been attained before too long.\nAs we shrink the size of our balance sheet, the public’s holdings of Treasury\nsecurities will rise, and that will tend to boost longer-term interest rates. In particular,\nmost studies conclude that increases in central bank holdings of longer-maturity assets\nchiefly affect interest rates by reducing the quantity of longer-term securities held by the\npublic and putting downward pressure on the term premium--that is, the difference\n7 See Brainard (2017).\n8\nThis rationale is in Brainard (2015b).\n\n- 11 -\nbetween the yields on longer-dated assets and the path of expected short-term interest\nrates over the holding period. By some estimates, the effect is modestly above 90 basis\npoints currently.9 Thus, balance sheet normalization should be associated with higher\nterm premiums, which in turn, other things held equal, should be associated with higher\nlong-term Treasury yields. Most studies find that higher Treasury yields also affect\nyields and prices of other securities: increasing interest rates faced by private-sector\nborrowers, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive, which tends to boost the\nexchange value of the dollar, and making fixed-income assets more attractive relative to\nstocks, tending to depress share prices. Together, these channels contribute to a\ntightening in financial conditions.10\nThese effects are, of course, in many respects, similar to the effects of increases in\nshort-term interest rates. 11 Thus, away from the zero lower bound, the two tools are, to a\nlarge extent, substitutes for one another. As a result, the FOMC will be in the unfamiliar\nposture of having two tools available for adjusting monetary policy. It is, therefore,\nimportant to clarify how they will be used in relation to each other. While, under most\ncircumstances, the two tools are largely substitutes for one another in terms of their\neffects on the economy the federal funds rate is the tool with which we have the most\n9 Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei (2017) estimate that the cumulative effect of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases\nresults in a reduction in the 10-year Treasury yield term premium moderately in excess of 90 basis points\ncurrently.\n10 It seems likely that many investors have developed an expectation of the likely path of the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet once the process of normalization is well underway, and these expectations are\nalready priced into asset prices. See, for instance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York May 2017\nResponses to Survey of Primary Dealers, https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey\n/2017/may-2017-spd-results-public-release.pdf?la=en and Responses to Survey of Market Participants,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey/2017/may-2017-smp-results-public-\nrelease.pdf?la=en .\n11 There may be differences in the specific ways changes in short-term rates and the balance sheet transmit\nto different asset prices and the exchange rate, although estimates are limited and lack precision.\n\n- 12 -\nexperience. And using two tools at once could easily foster confusion. Thus, in my\nview, predictability, precision, and clarity of communications all argue in favor of\nfocusing policy on the federal funds rate as the single active tool. In this framework, the\nbalance sheet essentially would remain subordinate to the federal funds rate.\nUnder the subordinated balance sheet approach, once the change in reinvestment\npolicy is triggered, the balance sheet would essentially be set on autopilot to shrink\npassively until it reaches a neutral level, expanding in line with the demand for currency\nthereafter. I favor an approach that would gradually and predictably increase the\nmaximum amount of securities the market will be required to absorb each month, while\navoiding spikes. Thus, in an abundance of caution, I prefer to cap monthly redemptions\nat a pace that gradually increases over a fixed period. In addition, I would be inclined to\nfollow a similar approach in managing the reduction of the holdings of Treasury\nsecurities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), calibrated according to their particular\ncharacteristics.\nThe Committee’s policy normalization principles have made clear that the Federal\nReserve “will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement\nmonetary policy efficiently and effectively.”12 Over time, the gradual reduction in our\nbalance sheet should result in a gradual decline in reserves to a longer-run level that is\nwell below today’s level but likely somewhat higher than in the pre-crisis regime. It is\ndifficult to know in advance with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop.\nThat minimum level will depend on the structural demand for reserves and the short-term\nvariability in the demand for and supply of reserves. During the process of balance sheet\n12 See the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nnormalization, I favor an approach of monitoring money markets carefully to gauge the\nappropriate longer-run level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy\nimplementation.\nFinally, while subordination of the balance sheet to the federal funds rate should\nbe our baseline policy, in my view, there may be circumstances when we may need to\nrely on the balance sheet more actively. During the period when the balance sheet is\nrunning down, if the economy encounters significant adverse shocks, it may be\nappropriate to commence the reinvestment of principal payments again in order to\npreserve conventional policy space.\nConclusion\nIn recent quarters, the balance of risks has become more favorable, the global\noutlook has brightened, and financial conditions have eased on net. With the labor\nmarket continuing to strengthen, and GDP growth expected to rebound in the second\nquarter, it likely will be appropriate soon to adjust the federal funds rate. And if the\neconomy evolves in line with the SEP median path, the federal funds rate will likely\napproach the point at which normalization can be considered well under way before too\nlong, when it will be appropriate to adjust balance sheet policy. I support an approach\nthat retains the federal funds rate as the primary tool for adjusting monetary policy, sets\nthe balance sheet to shrink in a gradual and predictable way for both Treasury securities\nand MBS, and avoids spikes in redemptions.\nWhile that remains my baseline expectation, I will be watching carefully for any\nsigns that progress toward our inflation objective is slowing. With a low neutral real rate,\nachieving our symmetric inflation target is more important than ever in order to preserve\n\n- 14 -\nsome room for conventional policy to buffer adverse developments in the economy. If\nthe soft inflation data persist, that would be concerning and, ultimately, could lead me to\nreassess the appropriate path of policy.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nBlanchard, Olivier (2016). “The U.S. Phillips Curve: Back to the 60s?” Policy Brief\nPB16-1.

Together with our\npartners, we will be ready to launch the FedNow Service between May and July of 2023,\nbringing this innovative core instant payment infrastructure to financial institutions of\nevery size across America. We have been working hard to deliver on time, but ultimately\nthe number of American businesses and households that are able to access instant\npayments will depend on financial services providers making the necessary investments\nto upgrade our payments infrastructure. Together, we can ensure that all Americans have\naccess to a modern and reliable instant payment system.\nThe payment system is a critical part of America’s infrastructure that touches\neveryone. Americans rely on the payment system all day every day to make purchases,\npay bills, and get paid—without ever needing to consider the complex infrastructure that\nis operating under the hood. American households and businesses want and deserve\npayment transactions that work seamlessly, reliably, and efficiently.\nFostering a safe, efficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure has been\na central part of the Fed’s mission since the very beginning. The Federal Reserve Banks\nall around the country have provided payment and settlement services alongside the\nprivate sector for more than 100 years. Over that period, we have repeatedly innovated\nand invested in collaboration with the private sector to transform the payment system,\n1 I am grateful to Kirstin Wells of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing this text. The\nviews expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nusing the latest technology to better meet the needs of businesses and households.2 Now,\nafter extensive industry engagement and planning, the Federal Reserve is on track to\ndeliver the FedNow Service by May to July of 2023.\nThe FedNow Service will transform the way everyday payments are made\nthroughout the economy, bringing substantial gains to households and businesses through\nthe ability to send instant payments at any time on any day, and the funds being\nimmediately available to recipients to make other payments or manage cash flow\nefficiently. Immediate availability of funds could be especially important for households\nmanaging their finances paycheck to paycheck or small businesses with cash flow\nconstraints. Having the capacity to manage money in real time could help households\navoid costly late payment fees or free up working capital for small businesses to finance\ngrowth. Indeed, during the pandemic, we witnessed how essential rapid access to funds\ncan be, as many households started spending emergency relief payments on the day they\nwere received.3\nTo deliver on the promise of a payment system for the future, the Federal Reserve\nhas made a substantial commitment to the FedNow platform, which has benefited from\nthe innovative technologies and approaches proven by global technology companies that\nare vital for today’s always on digital economy. Our cloud-first design, unique among\ncentral bank instant payment services, positions us for the future by enabling not only the\n2 Lael Brainard, “Supporting Fast Payments for All” (remarks at the Fed Payments Improvement\nCommunity Forum, Chicago, October 3, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20181003a.htm; Esther George, “From Then to\nFedNow: Payments Innovation and the Federal Reserve,” Policy Perspectives (Kansas City: Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, December 18, 2020),\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/Research/documents/7574/policy_perspectives_12_1_20_v5.pdf.\n3 Lael Brainard, “The Future of Retail Payments in the United States” (remarks at the FedNow Service\nWebinar, Washington, D.C., via webcast, August 6, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200806a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nthroughput and scalability required for high-volume retail transactions but also broad\ngeographic points of resiliency to ensure continuous service.

And our development processes are agile, allowing us to\ndeliver new features faster to financial institutions of all sizes as they are ready to adopt\nthem based on their priorities.\nWe have also invested heavily in stakeholder engagement to ensure readiness for\nservice adoption through efforts like the pilot program, the FedNow Explorer resource,\nthe FedNow Community, the service provider showcase, and the FedNow Early Adopter\nWorkshop.4 To advance the goal of nationwide reach for instant payments, we have\nworked closely with the private-sector RTP instant payment service on message\nspecifications to ensure alignment in support of routing interoperability.\nJust as the Federal Reserve has made a substantial commitment to our new instant\npayment infrastructure, we are calling on industry stakeholders to do the same. The shift\nto real-time payment infrastructure requires a focused effort, but the shift is inevitable.\nThe time is now for all key stakeholders—financial institutions, core service providers,\nsoftware companies, and application developers—to devote the resources necessary to\nsupport instant payments. This means upgrading back-office processes, evaluating\naccounting procedures to accommodate a seven-business-day week, arranging liquidity\nproviders, deploying a new customer-facing application, and promoting instant payments\nfor key use cases to customers. As the service providers featured at this event will\n4 Information about FedNow Service stakeholder outreach and other resources can be found at this link:\nhttps://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow.\n\n- 4 -\ndemonstrate in the coming days, parts of the industry have already seized on the\nopportunity to build new services and capabilities that support instant payments.

The input that you have\nprovided has been instrumental for our team as they have designed and built the service,\nand the time and energy that you have committed to this effort is important for a\nsuccessful launch. I want to call on additional banks and core service providers to join\nyour commitment to prepare for adoption of the FedNow Service. This time next year, I\nhope we can all have a great sense of accomplishment in our shared effort to transform\nAmerica’s payment system for the digital era.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EST\nMarch 7, 2016\nAn Update on the Outlook, Liquidity, and Resilience\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nInstitute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 7, 2016\n\nThis is a fitting moment to take stock of economic and financial developments,\nfollowing a volatile start to the year. I will begin by reviewing the outlook, then provide\na brief recap of how financial market liquidity has fared, and finish by commenting on\nthe resilience and resolvability of the large interconnected banks.1\nOutlook for the United States\nI am heartened by the continued strong progress on employment and the resilience\nof American consumers, which stand out against a considerably more challenging global\nbackdrop. I am pleased with the continued strength in the U.S. labor market, which is\ndrawing people back into the labor force. In February, the unemployment rate was 4.9\npercent--a level that is one-half its peak during the depths of the recession in 2009. Last\nFriday, we learned that employment growth has averaged 223,000 per month over the\npast 12 months. And there likely is some room to go: The prime-age employment-to-\npopulation ratio remains 1-3/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to the\nfinancial crisis, while a relatively large share of employees who are working part time\nwould prefer to work full time. In addition, wage growth remains relatively slow.\nDomestic activity continues to grow at a moderate pace. The pace of consumer\nspending, after slowing some at the end of last year, looks to have picked up in January,\nand auto sales remained strong in February. Over the past two years, consumption has\nincreased at about a 3 percent pace, on average, and I expect to see growth to continue at\nclose to this pace based on solid job and income growth--together with elevated readings\non consumer confidence and the boost to household purchasing power from persistent\ndeclines in energy prices.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe housing sector has also contributed steadily to growth over the past year.\nWith housing activity well below pre-recession norms, it appears there is still scope for\ncontinued growth in construction activity.\nIn contrast, sectors of the economy that are sensitive to energy prices or\ninternational demand have been a drag. In response to the plunge in oil prices,\ninvestment in drilling and mining structures fell 50 percent last year, and continued\nreductions in the number of drilling rigs this year suggest that further declines are likely.2\nAt the same time, firms and workers in the energy sector have experienced extreme\nfinancial difficulties and severe job losses.\nAlthough the euro area and Japan are recovering, their demand growth remains\nvery low, despite extraordinary monetary accommodation. In emerging market\neconomies growth last year came in at only one-half the average rate from 2009 to 2013.\nBecause China has accounted for one-third of the growth in world Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) and trade, the recent slippage in Chinese economic growth is having an\nimportant effect globally. Even if Chinese growth does not slide further, the changing\ncomposition of its growth toward consumption and services and away from resource-\nintensive manufacturing and investment will pose important challenges to commodity\nexporters and other emerging economies, especially since China had previously\naccounted for upwards of one-half of global imports of many base metals.\nWeak foreign demand relative to the United States has pushed down net exports\nand contributed to a nearly 20 percent strengthening of the real trade-weighted dollar\nsince mid-2014. As a result, net exports subtracted a little more than 1/2 percentage point\n2 Despite the drop-off in drilling investment, oil production has been surprisingly resilient, as producers\nhave increased the productivity of established wells.\n\n- 3 -\nfrom GDP growth in 2014 and 2015, and econometric models suggest that past\nappreciation will lead to close to another 1 percentage point subtraction this year.3\nThese effects are especially prominent in the U.S. manufacturing sector, where\noutput is sluggish, and the agricultural sector has also been hit hard by the rise in the\nvalue of the dollar. In addition, with profits at many firms adversely affected by the rise\nin the dollar and weak demand abroad, business fixed investment increased only 1-1/2\npercent last year after contributing significantly to growth earlier in the recovery.\nOn balance, in recent months, financial conditions have tightened somewhat with\nequity prices moving lower and corporate risk spreads widening, although conditions\nhave improved in recent weeks. In addition, progress on inflation has been slow. Prices\nfor personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have increased 1.3 percent over the 12\nmonths through January, well below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2\npercent target. Reductions in energy prices are, in part, responsible for this low rate, and\nif energy prices stabilize, top-line inflation should move higher. Still, a stabilization in\nenergy prices is not assured. Market participants have been repeatedly surprised by the\ndepth and persistence of oil price declines: Both spot and far futures oil prices, for\nexample, have fallen in five out of the past six quarters since mid-2014.\nBut even after discounting the influence of energy prices, core PCE inflation has\nbeen stubbornly stuck in the vicinity of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since 2012. 4 Most\n3 See Gruber, McCallum, and Vigfusson (2016).\n4 Core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been 1/2 percentage point higher than core PCE inflation\nover the 12 months through January. Over the past 15 years, core CPI inflation has averaged about\n1/4 percentage point more than core PCE inflation. Much of the recent larger gap is due to differences in\nthe coverage of health-care services and to differences in the weight accorded to housing services and\nhealth-care services. The CPI only covers out-of-pocket expenditures for health-care services, while the\nPCE index covers a much broader range of spending. Expenditures on housing are a larger share of the\nCPI than of the PCE index, and prices for housing services have increased at an above-average pace\nrecently.\n\n- 4 -\nrecently, the dollar has played an important role in holding down non-oil import prices,\nwhich fell 3-1/2 percent last year and subtracted an estimated 1/2 percentage point from\ncore inflation.5 Should the dollar stabilize, the downward influence on inflation should\ndissipate. But, as with oil prices, the movement in the value of the dollar has been more\npersistent than markets and many observers expected, with increases in every quarter\nsince mid-2014.\nIf the labor market continues to improve, higher resource utilization should also\nput some upward pressure on inflation going forward. However, the effect of resource\nutilization on inflation is estimated to be much lower today than in past decades.6\nAn important concern about persistently low inflation is that it can lead to a fall in\nlonger-term inflation expectations, making it much more difficult to achieve our inflation\ntarget. For the most part, longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained\nreasonably stable, though there are some concerning signs. Longer-term inflation\nexpectations of professional forecasters and primary dealers have held quite steady in\nrecent years at levels consistent with the FOMC’s target. However, households’ inflation\nexpectations appear to have moved down somewhat recently. Five-to-10-year inflation\nexpectations in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers have edged lower over\nthe past year or two with the level in February nearly 1/2 percentage point below the 10-\nyear average. Three-year inflation expectations in the New York Federal Reserve’s\nSurvey of Consumer Expectations have also moved steadily lower over the past two\nyears, though the recent decline in energy prices may explain much of this drift.\n5 See pp. 8-9 of the February 2016 Monetary Policy Report (Board of Governors, 2016).\n6 See Blanchard (2016); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Kiley (2015b).\n\n- 5 -\nNotably, market-based measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury\nInflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasury yields are at historically low\nlevels. At the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, inflation compensation is 1 percentage\npoint lower than mid-2014 levels. Declines in swap-based measures of inflation\ncompensation have been similar. However, these declines appear correlated with oil\nprices, and it is not clear to what extent these declines reflect a change in inflation\nexpectations, changes in investor demand for TIPS versus nominal Treasury securities, or\nan improvement in the risk characteristics of nominal Treasury securities versus other\nassets.\nOver the next couple of years, there are reasons to expect energy prices and the\ndollar to eventually stabilize, output to increase at around the moderate pace it has\naveraged over the recovery thus far, foreign growth to recover somewhat, the U.S. labor\nmarket to improve further, and inflation to move toward our 2 percent target. However,\nthere are risks around this baseline forecast, the most prominent of which lie to the\ndownside. For example, China faces risks as it navigates a sharp slowing in its goods\nsector, a large buildup in corporate debt, and an apparent surge in demand for foreign\nassets, although China possesses resources to deal with these challenges. More broadly,\nsources of robust demand around the globe are few, and sources of weakness relatively\ngreater, as evidenced by persistently below target inflation in all of the major advanced\neconomies.\nMonetary Policy\nIn today’s circumstances, policy could usefully follow two simple guidelines.\nFirst, we should not take the strength in the U.S. labor market and consumption for\n\n- 6 -\ngranted. Given weak and decelerating foreign demand, it is critical to carefully protect\nand preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the\npolicy path. Tighter financial conditions and softer inflation expectations may pose risks\nto the downside for inflation and domestic activity. From a risk-management\nperspective, this argues for patience as the outlook becomes clearer.7\nSecond, we should put a high premium on clear evidence that inflation is moving\ntoward our 2 percent target. Inflation has persistently underperformed relative to our\ntarget. Moreover, measures of inflation compensation and some survey-based measures\nof inflation expectations suggest that inflation expectations may have edged lower.\nGiven the currently weak relationship between economic slack and inflation and the\npersistent, depressing effects of energy price declines and exchange rate increases, we\nshould be cautious in assessing that a tightening labor market will soon move inflation\nback to 2 percent. We should verify that this is, in fact, taking place. In this regard, core\nPCE inflation increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in January, a noticeable\nstep-up from an increase of 1.3 percent over the preceding 12 months.8\nLiquidity\nIn addition to raising uncertainty around the outlook, the recent financial market\nvolatility has underscored the importance of ongoing attention to the resilience of market\nliquidity. Although it is fair to say that the recent uptick in volatility has in part reduced\n7 To the extent that the neutral rate of interest--the rate that keeps output at its potential level and inflation\nat its target--has fallen in the United States and is low around the world, this may weigh on the policy path.\nSee Laubach and Williams (2015), Hamilton and others (2015), Kiley (2015a), Johannsen and Mertens\n(2016), Del Negro and others (2015), Brainard (2015), and chapter 3 of World Economic Outlook\n(International Monetary Fund, 2014).\n8 Because the most recent 12-month change in core PCE prices includes several relatively large monthly\nincreases in core PCE prices in the first part of 2015, it is possible that 12-month core PCE inflation will\nmove lower in coming months as these relatively large monthly increases drop out of the 12-month\nwindow.\n\n- 7 -\nearlier concerns about prolonged low volatility and associated reach-for-yield behavior, it\nhas placed added focus on the resilience of liquidity, particularly in markets, such as the\nmarket for corporate bonds, that may be prone to gapping between liquidity demand and\nsupply in stressed conditions.\nThe Federal Reserve’s surveillance of liquidity conditions in financial markets has\nbroadened and deepened considerably since the “taper tantrum” in mid-2013 and the\nevents of October 2014 in the Treasury market. The analysis so far suggests a few\npreliminary observations. While it does not appear that day-to-day liquidity has declined\nnotably, some characteristics of liquidity provision are changing. Broadly, traditional\nprice-based measures of liquidity such as bid-asked spreads and the price effect of a\ngiven trade size generally remain in line with pre-crisis norms in most markets. In\ncontrast, both anecdotes from market participants and the declining size of trades in some\nmarkets suggest it may have become more expensive to conduct, and may take more time\nto implement, large trades.9\nMoreover, there may be some deterioration in the resilience of liquidity at times\nof stress, along with a greater incidence of outsized intraday price movements. Relatedly,\nliquidity appears to be more segmented based on the characteristics of the securities\nbeing traded and the underlying structure of the markets in which they are traded. Based\non granular disaggregation of the traded securities, liquidity appears little changed in\nsecondary markets that have traditionally been highly liquid, such as on-the-run Treasury\nbonds and highly rated corporate bonds. By contrast, there has been some reduction in\nliquidity in the segments of these markets that have historically been less liquid.10\n9 See Adrian, Fleming, Shachar, and Vogt (2015); and Adrian, Fleming, Vogt, and Wojtowicz (2016b).\n10 See Adrian, Fleming, Vogt, and Wojtowicz (2016a); and Fleming (2016).\n\n- 8 -\nThe move toward somewhat greater segmentation of liquidity, in conjunction with\nongoing electronification and acceleration of trade execution, might be contributing to\nincreased linkages across markets. Anecdotally, it appears market participants may be\nusing relatively more liquid instruments to hedge exposures in other less liquid market\nsegments, perhaps unintentionally contributing to increased correlation across markets.11\nFrom a broader financial stability perspective, the possible deterioration in the\nresilience of liquidity suggests a special focus on segments where price gaps are most\nlikely to arise at times of stress between holders of relatively illiquid or thinly traded\nsecurities that want to sell and dealers with an apparently reduced willingness to take the\nother side of the trade, as indicated, for example, by leaner dealer inventory holdings.12\nMutual funds holding relatively less liquid assets is one area of focus. Despite having\nshare prices that move with market prices, these funds can give rise to first-mover\nadvantages for redeeming shareholders and create the potential for destabilizing waves of\nredemptions and asset fire sales if liquidity buffers and other tools to manage liquidity\nrisk prove insufficient.13 In this regard, our surveillance has been closely monitoring for\nany signs of liquidity strains associated with the recent increases in spreads for high-yield\ncorporate bonds, as well as for idiosyncratic events affecting particular funds in this\nsegment, such as the events surrounding the abrupt closing of Third Avenue\nManagement’s Focused Credit Fund last December.\n11 See Dobrev and Schaumburg (2016).\n12 See Bank for International Settlements (2016).\n13 In particular, research has suggested that corporate bond funds exhibit herding behavior--that is, a\ntendency for waves of sales or purchases of common securities across funds. This herding appears more\nsignificant for less liquid bonds, which could exacerbate the concerns noted above. See Cai and others\n(2015). Also, see Cetorelli, Duarte, and Eisenbach (2016) for estimates of the effects of asset fire sales.\n\n- 9 -\nMore broadly, the regulatory agencies in the United States and the Financial\nStability Board internationally have work under way focusing on possible fire-sale risk\nassociated with the growing share of less liquid bonds held in asset management\nportfolios on behalf of investors who may be counting on same-day redemption when\nvaluations fall. The recent proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nto ensure mutual funds have ample liquidity buffers under stressed scenarios and\nundertake measures to address the risk of heavy redemptions and fire sales is notable in\nthis regard. Our surveillance will continue to undertake more granular analysis of\nliquidity resilience and associated risks.\nAcross financial markets, it is difficult to disentangle the effects on liquidity of\nchanges in technology and market structure and changes in broker-dealer risk-\nmanagement practices in the wake of the crisis on the one hand and enhanced regulation\non the other. While the leverage ratio and other Dodd-Frank Act requirements likely are\nencouraging broker-dealers to be more rigorous about risk management in allocating\nbalance sheet capacity to certain trading activities, the growing presence of proprietary\nfirms using algorithmic trading in many of these markets, which predated the crisis, is\nalso influencing trading dynamics in important ways.14 The Request for Information\nissued by the U.S. Treasury and the recent proposals from the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission and the SEC will be important in deepening our understanding.\nWhile acknowledging the role of regulation as a possible contributor, it is important to\nrecognize that this regulation was designed to reduce the concentration of liquidity risk\n14 See Adrian, Fleming, Stackman, and Vogt (2015).\n\n- 10 -\non the balance sheets of the large, interconnected banking organizations that proved to be\na major amplifier of financial instability at the height of the crisis.\nResilience and Resolvability\nThis brings me to the last item on my agenda: an update on efforts to strengthen\nthe resilience and resolvability of these systemic banking organizations. With recent and\nupcoming proposals, much of the new regulatory architecture will be in the process of\nimplementation or in train. Even so, I would expect the rules and their application to\ncontinue to be strengthened and modified as financial risks evolve, just as I would expect\nthese rules to be increasingly tailored over time to better reflect risk profiles.\nAs a result of the capital and liquidity regulations already in place as well as the\nassociated stress tests, the eight most systemic U.S. banking organizations are now\nholding $800 billion more in high-quality liquid assets than they were in 2011 and $500\nbillion more in common equity capital than they were in 2008. These liquidity and\ncapital buffers are designed to strengthen the going-concern resilience of systemic\nbanking organizations during periods of market volatility and financial stress. In\naddition, we recently released our proposed framework for determining the application of\nan additional countercyclical buffer to our large banking firms and made the first\ndetermination under the rule.\nOn top of this, the capital surcharge we have proposed, which is designed to\nensure the largest, most systemic banking organizations internalize the risk they pose to\nthe system, is estimated to range from 1.0 to 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, based on\n2013 data, over and above the 7 percent minimum and capital conservation buffers under\n\n- 11 -\nBasel III. Indeed, it appears that some institutions may have already reduced their\nsystemic footprint in anticipation of these additional charges.\nOf course, the crisis starkly illustrated that what seem like thick capital cushions\nin good times can become uncomfortably thin in the face of financial stress. Our\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress-testing framework is\narguably our most powerful tool for ensuring that these capital buffers remain robust to a\nvariety of possible shocks to the trading and banking book exposures of the large,\ninterconnected banking organizations. Therefore, as we work to fine-tune and strengthen\nthis framework, I would hope to see the capital surcharge for systemic banking\norganizations integrated into CCAR to ensure robustness, even as adjustments might be\nmade on other parameters of the framework.\nAlthough today’s greatly enhanced common equity capital requirements should\nmaterially reduce the probability that a large bank might fail in response to a severe\neconomic downturn or financial stress, it is not enough to reduce the risks of failure. In\nparallel, our supervisory and regulatory efforts are raising the bar on ensuring that the\nlarge, interconnected banking organizations have in place credible plans and preparations\nas well as properly calibrated and positioned liquidity and loss absorbing capacity to\nensure failure can take place in an orderly manner.\nTo that end, we have proposed a Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity rule that contains\na long-term debt requirement that is critical to the feasibility of bankruptcy for the\nsystemic banking organizations. It is a necessary counterpart to the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequirement that large banking organizations have credible resolution plans and\nundertake preparations to make those plans operationally feasible. In particular it\n\n- 12 -\nrequires the top-tier holding companies of systemic banking organizations to maintain a\nsufficiently large buffer of long-term debt that can be converted into equity and used to\nfully recapitalize their important operating subsidiaries in the event of bankruptcy. The\nproposed levels of long-term debt are calibrated to the specific riskiness and scale of each\ninstitution’s activities, taking into account the likely shrinkage of the operations of their\nsubsidiaries in resolution.\nThe requirement is designed to mitigate contagion, fire-sale, and run risks by\nproviding comfort to depositors, short-term debt holders, and counterparties of the\noperating subsidiaries of the firm, since the long-term unsecured debt issued by the top-\ntier holding company would be structurally subordinated to the claims on the operating\nsubsidiaries. The presence of long-term debt holders that will be bailed in ensures that\ntaxpayer resources will not be used and should provide incentives to preserve the firm’s\nvalue as it approaches insolvency, thus aligning the firm’s interests with the public’s\nbroader interest in financial stability.\nThe Board has received many detailed comments on the proposed long-term debt\nrule. Some have commented on the existing stock of outstanding long-term debt with\nacceleration clauses that might not qualify under the rule’s criteria and have proposed\ngrandfathering as a possible solution. Others have raised questions about whether the\nleverage ratio or the risk-based capital framework provides the more appropriate\ncalibration benchmark for the minimum long-term debt requirement. Comments from\nforeign banks have also addressed our proposal to impose internal long-term debt\nrequirements on the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banks and have\nasked, among other things, whether the proposed requirement should vary more\n\n- 13 -\ndepending on the resolution strategy of the parent foreign bank. We are currently\ncarefully reviewing these comments. One thing is clear: the long-term debt requirement\nis a critical component in ending too big to fail.\nThe long-term debt requirement together with rigorous resolution plans and\noperational preparedness, the capital surcharges along with the capital stress tests, and the\navailability of sufficient amounts of high-quality liquidity where it is most likely to be\nneeded will all substantially decrease the risk that a large financial institution’s distress\ncould pose to the broader financial system and help ensure that no banking institution is\ntoo large and too complex to fail. They will move us closer to our goal of a safer, more\nresponsible, and more resilient financial system.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Michael Fleming, Or Shachar, and Erik Vogt (2015). “Has U.S.\nCorporate Bond Market Liquidity Deteriorated?” Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, Liberty Street Economics (blog), October 5,\nhttp://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/10/has-us-corporate-bond-\nmarket-liquidity-deteriorated.html#.VthyIOY-WXE.\nAdrian, Tobias, Michael Fleming, Daniel Stackman, and Erik Vogt (2015). “What’s\nDriving Dealer Balance Sheet Stagnation?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York,\nLiberty Street Economics (blog), August 21,\nhttp://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/08/whats-driving-dealer-\nbalance-sheet-stagnation.html#.Vthd5-Y-WXE.\nAdrian, Tobias, Michael Fleming, Erik Vogt, and Zachary Wojtowicz (2016a),\n“Corporate Bond Market Liquidity Redux: More Price-Based Evidence,” Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), February 9,\nhttp://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/02/corporate-bond-market-\nliquidity-redux-more-price-based-evidence.html#.VthxFeY-WXE.\n--------- (2016b), “Further Analysis of Corporate Bond Market Liquidity,” Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), February 10,\nhttp://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/02/further-analysis-of-\ncorporate-bond-market-liquidity.html#.Vthw5eY-WXE.\nBank for International Settlements, Committee on the Global Financial System (2016).\n“Fixed Income Market Liquidity,” CGFS Papers, no. 55.

The powerful new fintech tools represent the convergence of numerous\nadvances in research and technology--ranging from new insights into consumer decisionmaking\nto a revolution in available data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). They operate\nby guiding consumers through complex decisions by offering new ways of looking at a\nconsumer’s overall financial picture or simplifying choices, for example with behavioral nudges.\nAs consumers start to rely on financial autopilots, however, it is important that they\nremain in the driver’s seat and have a good handle on what is happening under the hood.\nConsumers need to know and decide who they are contracting with, what data of theirs is being\nused by whom and for what purpose, how to revoke data access and delete stored data, and how\nto seek relief if things go wrong. In short, consumers should remain in control of the data they\nprovide. In addition, consumers should receive clear disclosure of the factors that are reflected in\nthe recommendations they receive. If these issues can be appropriately addressed, the new\nfintech capabilities have enormous potential to deliver analytically grounded financial services\nand simplified choices, tailored to the consumers’ needs and preferences, and accessible via their\nsmartphones.2\n1 I am grateful to Kelvin Chen for his assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my own views, which\ndo not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Lael Brainard, “The Opportunities and Challenges of Fintech,” (speech at the Conference on Financial\nInnovation, Washington, D.C., December 2, 2016),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20161202a.pdf\n\n- 2 -\nConsumers Face Complex Financial Choices\nWhen the first major “credit card,” the Diner’s Club Card, was introduced in 1949,\nconsumers could only use the cardboard card at restaurants and, importantly, only if they paid\nthe entire amount due each month.3 Today, the average cardholder has about four credit cards,\nand the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that American consumers collectively\ncarry $785 billion in credit card debt.4\nWhen signing up for a credit card, consumers face a bewildering array of choices. Half\nof consumers report that they select new cards based on reward programs, weighing “cash back”\noffers against “points” with their credit card provider that may convert into airline or hotel\n“miles,” which may have varying values depending on how they are redeemed.5 In some cases,\nrewards may apply to specific spending categories that rotate by quarter and require that\nconsumers re-register each term, and the rewards may expire or be forfeited under complicated\nterms.6\nIn some cases, the choices may be confusing. Let’s take the example of zero percent\ninterest credit card promotions. A consumer may choose a zero percent interest credit card\npromotion and expect to pay no interest on balances during a promotional period, after which\nany balances are assessed at a higher rate of interest going forward. But if a consumer instead\n3 See, e.g., Damaris Olaechea, “Who Issued the First Credit Card?” Nerd Wallet (February 12, 2014),\nwww.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/issued-first-credit-card/.\n4 See, e.g., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, The Consumer Credit Card Market, Executive Summary\nDecember 2015, http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201512_cfpb_report-the-consumer-credit-card-market.pdf and\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, August 2017,\nwww.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2017Q2.pdf.\n5 See J.D.

For instance, one recent study of the credit card market found that the\naverage length of agreements for products offered to subprime consumers was 70 percent longer\nthan agreements for other products.8\nThe complexity multiplies when we go beyond credit cards and consider other\ndimensions of consumers’ financial lives.9 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has\nfound that nearly a quarter of the Americans that don’t maintain bank accounts are concerned\nthat bank fees are too unpredictable.10 Even though mortgage debt is over two-thirds of\nhousehold debt, nearly half of consumers don’t comparison shop before taking out a mortgage.11\nStudent loans now make up 11 percent of total household debt, more than twice its share in\n7 See, e.g., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, The Consumer Credit Card Market, section 6, December 2015,\nhttp://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201512_cfpb_report-the-consumer-credit-card-market.pdf.\n8 Id at section 5.1.2.\n9 In 2007 researchers at Carnegie Mellon estimated that it would take the average consumer 244 hours a year just to\nread the privacy policies of the websites that he viewed that year.

In the Federal Reserve Board’s annual Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking (SHED), more than half of respondents reported that their spending exceeded\ntheir income in the prior year.15 Indeed, 44 percent of SHED respondents reported that they\ncould not cover an emergency expense costing $400 without selling something or borrowing\nmoney.16\nNew Tools to Help Consumers Manage Their Finances\nGiven the complexity and importance of these decisions, it is encouraging to see the fast-\ngrowing development of advanced, technology-enabled tools to help consumers navigate the\n12 See, e.g., Michael Corkery and Stacy Cowley, “Household Debt Makes a Comeback in the U.S.,” New York\nTimes, May 17, 2017, www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/business/dealbook/household-debt-united-states.html.\n(“Student borrowers today owe $1.3 trillion, more than double the $611 billion owed nearly nine years ago.

These tools build on important advances in our\nunderstanding of consumer financial behavior and the applications, or “app,” ecosystem.\nResearchers have invested decades of work exploring how consumers actually make\ndecisions. We all tend to use shortcuts to simplify financial decisions, and it turns out many of\nthese can prove faulty, particularly when dealing with complex problems.17 For example,\nempirical evidence consistently shows that consumers overvalue the present and undervalue the\nfuture.18 Researchers have documented that consumers make better savings decisions when they\nare presented with fewer options.19 They have shown the importance of “anchoring” bias--the\ntendency to place disproportionate weight on the first piece of information presented. This bias\ncan lead consumers either to make poor financial choices or instead to tip the scales in favor of\nbeneficial choices, as with automatic savings defaults.20 Similarly, “nudges” can help consumers\n17 See, e.g., Krista Tippett, On Being, radio interview with Daniel Kahneman, October 5, 2017,\nhttps://onbeing.org/programs/daniel-kahneman-why-we-contradict-ourselves-and-confound-each-other-oct2017/.\n(“…[It] is actually completely not possible for a finite human mind to be rational or to obey the axioms of\nrationality.

The 2016 Federal Reserve Survey of\nConsumer and Mobile Financial Services (SCMF) found that 87 percent of the U.S. adult\npopulation had a mobile phone, the vast majority of which were smartphones. 23 Smartphone use\nis prevalent even among the unbanked and underbanked populations.

First of all, the\nsmartphone platform has become a launch pad for a whole ecosystem of apps created by outside\ndevelopers for a wide variety of services, including helping consumers manage their financial\nlives.\nSecond, the smartphone ecosystem puts the enormous computing power of the cloud at\nthe fingertips of consumers. Interfacing with smartphone platforms and other apps, outside\ndevelopers can tap the computing power of the leading cloud computing providers in building\ntheir apps. Importantly, cloud computing offers not only the power to process and store data, but\nalso powerful algorithms to make sense of it. Due to early commitment to open-source\nprinciples, app developers have open access to many of the same machine-learning and artificial\nintelligence tools that power the world’s largest internet companies.27 Further, the major cloud\ncomputing providers have now taken these free building blocks and created different machine-\nlearning and artificial intelligence stacks on their cloud platforms. A developer that wants to\nincorporate artificial intelligence into their financial management app can access off-the-shelf\n25 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201603.pdf.\n26 Id.\n27 See, e.g., Blair Hanley Frank, “Meet Google’s Cool New Natural Language Tool, Parsey McParseface,”\nComputerworld, May 12, 2016, www.computerworld.com/article/3070059/artificial-intelligence/meet-googles-cool-\nnew-natural-language-tool-parsey-mcparseface.html.

Consumer financial data are increasingly\navailable to developers via a new breed of business-to-business suppliers, called data\naggregators.28 These companies enable outside developers to access consumer account and\ntransactional information typically stored by banks. But aggregators do more than just provide\naccess to raw data. They facilitate its use by developers, by cleaning the data, standardizing it\nacross institutions, and offering their own application programming interfaces for easy\nintegration. Further, similar to cloud computing providers, data aggregators are also beginning\nto provide off-the-shelf product stacks on their own platforms.29 This means that developers can\nquickly and easily incorporate product features, such as predicting creditworthiness, determining\nhow much a consumer can save each month, or creating alerts for potential overdraft charges.\nResearchers have documented the benefits of tailored one-on-one financial coaching.30\nUntil recently, though, it has been hard to deliver that kind of service affordably and at scale, due\nto differences in consumers’ circumstances. Let’s again consider the example of deferred\ninterest credit cards. It turns out only a small minority of consumers miss the deadlines for\nrepaying promotional balances and are charged retroactive interest payments, and they typically\n28 See, e.g., Lael Brainard, “Where Do Banks Fit in the Fintech Stack,” (speech at Northwestern Kellogg Public–\nPrivate Interface Conference on New Developments in Consumer Finance: Research and Practice),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20170428a.pdf.\n29 See, e.g., Envestnet Yodlee, “Envestnet Yodlee Unveils Personal Financial Wellness Solution Powered by Data\nIntelligence,” news release, June 12, 2017, www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/envestnet--yodlee-unveils-\npersonal-financial-wellness-solution-powered-by-data-intelligence-300472018.html.\n30 See, e.g., Brett Theodos, et al., An Evaluation of the Impacts and Implementation Approach of Financial\nCoaching Programs (Washington: Urban Institute, October 2015), www.urban.org/research/publication/evaluation-\nimpacts-and-implementation-approaches-financial-coaching-programs.\n\n- 9 -\nhave deep subprime scores.31 Similarly, for consumers that opt into overdraft products on their\nchecking accounts, 8 percent of consumers pay 75 percent of the fees.32 Up until now, it has\nbeen hard for consumers to understand those odds and objectively assess whether they are likely\nto be in the group of customers that will face challenges with a particular financial product. The\nconvergence of smartphone ubiquity, cloud computing, data aggregation, and off-the-shelf AI\nproducts offer the potential to make tailored financial advice scalable. For instance, a fintech\ndeveloper could pair historical data about how different types of consumers fare with a specific\nproduct, on the one hand, with a consumer’s particular financial profile, on the other hand, to\nmake a prediction about how that consumer is likely to fare with the product.\nThe Evolution of Financial Autopilots\nSince the early days of internet commerce, developers have tried to move beyond simple\nprice comparison tools to offer tailored “agents” for consumers that can recommend products\nbased on analyses of individual behavior and preferences.33 Today, a new generation of personal\nfinancial management tools seems poised to make that leap. When a consumer wishes to select a\nnew financial product, he or she can now solicit options from a number of websites and mobile\napps. These new comparison sites can walk the consumer through a wide array of financial\nproducts, offering to compare features like rewards, fees, and rates, or tailoring to a consumer’s\nstated goals. Some fintech advisors ask consumers to provide access to their bank accounts,\n31 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, The Consumer Credit Card Market (Washington: CFPB, December\n2015), http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201512_cfpb_report-the-consumer-credit-card-market.pdf.\n32 Trevor Bakker, Nicole Kelly, Jesse Leary, and Eva Nagypal, Data Point: Checking Account Overdraft, Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau report (Washington: CFPB, July 2014),\nhttp://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201407_cfpb_report_data-point_overdrafts.pdf.

For instance, a\nfintech advisor may help a consumer automate savings “rules,” like rounding up charges and\nputting the difference into savings, enabling these small balances to accumulate over time or\nsetting a small amount of money aside every time a consumer spends money on little splurges.\nThe early stages of innovation inevitably feature a lot of learning from trial and error.\nFortunately, as the fintech ecosystem advances, there are useful experiences and good practices\nto draw upon from the evolution of the commercial internet. To begin with, one internet adage is\nthat if a product is free, “you are the product.”34 In this vein, fintech advisors frequently offer\nfree services to consumers and earn their revenue from the credit cards and other financial\nproducts that they recommend through lead generation.\nOf course, many fintech advisors are not lead generators. Some companies offer fee-for-\nservice models, with consumers paying a monthly fee for the product. Other companies are paid\nby employers, who then provide the products free of charge to their employees as an employee\nbenefit. In these cases, they likely have quite different business models.\n34 See, e.g., John Lanchester, “You Are the Product,” London Review of Books, vol. 39, no. 16-17, August 17, 2017,\nwww.lrb.co.uk/v39/n16/john-lanchester/you-are-the-product. Cf., Monica Anderson, “Key Takeaways on Mobile\nApps and Privacy,” Pew Research Center FactTank, November 10, 2015, www.pewresearch.org/fact-\ntank/2015/11/10/key-takeaways-mobile-apps/.\n\n- 11 -\nBut for those services that do act as lead generators, there are important considerations\nabout whether and how best to communicate information to the consumer about the nature of the\nrecommendations being made. For instance, according to some reports, fintech advisors can\nmake between $100 and $700 in lead generation fees for every customer that signs up for a credit\ncard they recommend.35\nIn many cases, a fintech advisor may describe their service as providing tailored advice\nor making recommendations as they would to friends and family. In such cases, a consumer\nmight not know whether the order in which products are presented by a fintech assistant is based\non the product’s alignment with his or her needs or different considerations. Different fintech\nadvisors may order the lists they show consumers using different criteria. A product may be at\nthe top of the advisor’s recommendations because the sponsoring company has paid the advisor\nto list it at the top, or the sponsoring company may pay the fintech assistant a high fee,\ncontingent upon the consumer signing up for the product. Alternatively, a fintech advisor may\nchange the order of the loan offers or credit cards based on the likelihood that the consumer will\nbe approved. Moreover, in some cases, the absence of lead generation fees for a particular\nproduct may impact whether that product is on the list shown to consumers at all.\nThere appears to be a wide variety of practices regarding the prominence and placement\nof advertising and other disclosures relative to the advice and recommendations such firms\n35 See, e.g., Nathaniel Popper, “Automated Assistants Will Soon Make a Bid for Your Finances,” New York Times,\nDecember 7, 2016, www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/business/dealbook/automated-assistants-will-soon-make-a-bid-\nfor-your-finances.html.\n\n- 12 -\nprovide. Overall, fintech assistants have increasingly improved the disclosures that explain to\nconsumers how they get paid, but this is still a work in progress.\nThe good news is that these challenges are not new. The experience with internet search\nengines outside of financial products, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, as well as with other\nproduct comparison sites, such as Travelocity and Yelp, may provide useful guidance. As\nconsumers and businesses have adapted to the internet, we have, collectively, adopted norms and\nstandards for how we can expect search and recommendation engines to operate. In particular,\nwe generally expect that search results will be included and ranked based on what’s organically\nmost responsive to the search--unless it is clearly labeled otherwise.36 Accordingly, when we\nsearch for a product, we now know to look for visual cues that identify paid search results,\nusually in the form of a text label like “Sponsored” or “Ad”, different formatting, and\nvisually separating advertising from natural search results.37 Even when an endorsement is made\nin a brief Twitter update, we now expect disclosures to be clear and conspicuous.38\nAs fintech advisors evolve to engage consumers in new ways, disclosure methodologies\nwill no doubt be expected to adapt as well. For instance, some personal financial management\n36 Cf., Federal Trade Commission, “Mary Engle Letter to Search Engine Providers,” n.4, June 24, 2013,\nwww.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-consumer-protection-staff-updates-agencys-guidance-\nsearch-engine-industryon-need-distinguish/130625searchenginegeneralletter.pdf; Federal Trade Commission, “FTC\nConsumer Protection Staff Update Agency’s Guidance to Search Engine Industry on the Need to Distinguish\nBetween Advertisements and Search Results,” press release, June 25, 2013, www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-\nreleases/2013/06/ftc-consumer-protection-staff-updates-agencys-guidance-search; Federal Trade Commission,\n“Commercial Alert Response Letter,” June 27, 2002, www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/closing-\nletters/commercial-alert-response-letter.\n37 Cf., Federal Trade Commission, “Mary Engle Letter to Search Engine Providers,” n.4, June 24, 2013,\nwww.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-consumer-protection-staff-updates-agencys-guidance-\nsearch-engine-industryon-need-distinguish/130625searchenginegeneralletter.pdf.\n38 Cf., Federal Trade Commission, “The FTC’s Endorsement Guides: What People Are Asking,” September 2017,\nwww.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking; Federal Trade\nCommission, “.com Disclosures: How to Make Effective Disclosures in Digital Advertising,” March 2013,\nwww.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-\nguidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\ntools now interact with consumers via text message. If consumers move to a world in which\nmost of their interactions with their advisors occur via text-messaging “chatbots”--or voice\ncommunication--I am hopeful that industry, regulators, consumers, and other stakeholders will\nwork together to adapt the norms to distinguish between advice and sponsored recommendations.\nThe Data Relationship\nWhile the lead generation revenue model presents some familiar issues that are readily\napparent, under the hood, fintech relationships raise even more complex issues for consumers in\nknowing who they are providing their data to, how their data will be used, for how long, and\nwhat to expect in the case of a breach or fraud. Let me briefly touch on each issue in turn.\nOften, when a consumer signs up with a fintech advisor or other fintech app, they are\nasked to log into their bank account in order to link the fintech app with their bank account data.\nIn reviewing apps’ enrollment processes, it appears that consumers are often shown log-in\nscreens featuring bank logos and branding, prompting consumers to enter their online banking\nlogins and passwords. In many cases, the apps note that they do not store the consumers’\nbanking credentials.\nWhen the consumer logs on, he or she is often not interfacing with a banks’ computer\nsystems, but rather, providing the bank account login and password to a data aggregator that\nprovides services to the fintech app. In many cases, the data aggregator may store the password\nand login and then use those credentials to periodically log into the consumer’s bank account and\ncopy available data, ranging from transaction data, to account numbers, to personally identifiable\ninformation. In other cases, things work differently under the hood. Some banks and data\naggregators have agreed to work together to facilitate the ability to share data with outside\n\n- 14 -\ndevelopers in authorized ways. These agreements may delineate what types of data will be\nshared, and authorization credentials may be tokenized so that passwords are never stored by the\naggregator.39\nIt is often hard for the consumer to know what is actually happening under the hood of\nthe financial app they are accessing. In most cases, the log in process does not do much to\neducate the consumer on the precise nature of the data relationship. Screen scraping usually\ninvokes the bank’s logo and branding but infrequently shows the logo or name of the data\naggregator. In reviewing many apps, it appears that the name of the data aggregator is frequently\nnot disclosed in the fintech app’s terms and conditions, and a consumer generally would not\neasily see what data is held by a data aggregator or how it is used. The apps, websites, and terms\nand conditions of fintech advisors and data aggregators often do not explain how frequently data\naggregators will access a consumer’s data or how long they will store that data.40\nRecognizing this is a relatively young field, but one that is growing fast, there are a\nmyriad of questions about the consumer’s ability to opt out and control over data that will need\nto be addressed appropriately. In examining the terms and conditions for a number of fintech\napps, it appears that consumers are rarely provided information explaining how they can\n39 See, e.g., Finicity, “Finicity and Wells Fargo Ink Data Exchange Deal,” press release, April 4, 2017,\nwww.finicity.com/press-release-finicity-wells-fargo-ink-data-exchange-deal/; Wells Fargo & Co., “Intuit Signs New\nData-Exchange Agreement with Wells Fargo,” press release, February 3, 2017,\nwww.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2017/intuit-agreement_0203/; Intuit, “Chase, Intuit to Give Customers Greater\nControl of Their Information,” press release, January 25, 2017, www.intuit.com/company/press-room/press-\nreleases/2017/Chase-Intuit-to-Give-Customers-Greater-Control-of-Their-Information/; Wells Fargo & Co., “Wells\nFargo, Xero Agree on New Data-Exchange Method,” press release, June 7, 2016,\nwww.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/new-dataexchange-method_0607/; Silicon Valley Bank, “Xero and Silicon\nValley Bank Partner to Offer Innovative Companies Next-Generation Financial Management,” press release, July\n16, 2014, www.svb.com/News/Company-News/Xero-and-Silicon-Valley-Bank-Partner-to-Offer-Innovative-\nCompanies-Next-Generation-Financial-Management/.\n40 See, e.g., Penny Crosman, “Data-Sharing Debate Grows Contentious as Fintechs Vent Grievances,” American\nBanker, August 15, 2017, www.americanbanker.com/news/data-sharing-debate-grows-contentious-as-fintechs-vent-\ngrievances.\n\n- 15 -\nterminate the collection and storage of their data. For instance, when a consumer deletes a\nfintech app from his or her phone, it is not clear this would guarantee that a data aggregator\nwould delete the consumer’s bank login and password, nor discontinue accessing transaction\ninformation. If a consumer severs the data access, for instance by changing banks or bank\naccount passwords, it is also not clear how he or she can instruct the data aggregator to delete the\ninformation that has already been collected. Given that data aggregators often don’t have\nconsumer interfaces, consumers may be left to find an email address for the data aggregator,\nsend in a deletion request, and hope for the best.\nIf things go wrong, consumers may have limited remedies. In reviewing terms, it appears\nthat many fintech advisors include contractual waivers that purport to limit consumers’ ability to\nseek redress from the advisor or an underlying data aggregator. In some cases, the terms and\nconditions assert that the fintech developer and its third-party service providers will not be liable\nto consumers for the performance of or inability to use the services. It is not uncommon to see\nterms and conditions that limit the fintech adviser’s liability to the consumer to $100.\nTraditionally, under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation\nE, consumers have had protections to mitigate their losses in the event of erroneous or fraudulent\ntransactions that would otherwise impact their credit and debit cards, such as data breaches.\nThose protections are not absolute, however.41 In particular, if a consumer gives another person\nan “access device” to their account and grants them authority to make transfers, then the\nconsumer is “fully liable” for transfers made by that person, even if that person exceeds his or\n41 See 12 CFR section 1005.2(m) (1). (Excluding from the definition of “unauthorized electronic fund transfer” any\n“electronic fund transfer initiated… [by] a person who was furnished the access device to the consumer’s account by\nthe consumer…..”)\n\n- 16 -\nher authority, until the consumer notifies the bank.42 As the industry matures, the various\nstakeholders will need to develop a shared understanding of who bears responsibility in the event\nof a breach.43\nShared Responsibility and Shared Benefit Moving Forward\nSo what can be done to make sure consumers have the requisite information and control\nto remain squarely in the driver’s seat? Establishing and implementing new norms is in the\nshared interest of all of the participants in the fintech stack. For instance, in the case of credit\ncards, mortgages, and many other products, it is often banks or parties closely affiliated with\nbanks that pay fees to fintech advisors to generate leads for their products, pursuant to a contract.\nThrough these contractual relationships with fintech advisors, banks have considerable influence\nin the lead generation relationship, including through provisions describing how a sponsored\nproduct should be described or displayed. Banks have a stake in ensuring that their vendors and\nthird-party service providers act appropriately, that consumers are protected and treated fairly,\nand that the banks’ reputations aren’t exposed to unnecessary risk.44 Likewise, some of the\nleading speech-only financial products are currently credit card and bank products.45\n42 Comment 2(m)-2 clarifies that if “a consumer furnishes an access device and grants authority to make transfers to\na person . . . who exceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the transfers unless the consumer has\nnotified the financial institution that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.”\n43 See Kaitlin Asrow and Beth Brockland, Liability, Transparency and Consumer Control in Data Sharing\n(Washington: Center for Financial Services Innovation, September 18, 2017),\nhttp://cfsinnovation.org/research/liability-transparency-consumer-control-in-data-sharing/.

And while there are some difficult issues in this space, other issues seem relatively\nstraightforward. It shouldn’t be hard for a consumer to be informed who they are providing their\ncredentials to. Consumers should have relatively simple means of being able to consent to what\ndata are being shared and at what frequency. And consumers should be able to stop data sharing\nand request the deletion of data that have been stored.\nResponsibility for establishing appropriate norms in the data aggregation space should be\nshared, with banks, data aggregators, fintech developers, consumers, and regulators all having a\nrole.47 Banks and data aggregators are negotiating new relationships to determine how they can\nwork together to provide consumers access to their data, while also ensuring that the process is\nSkill,” Fortune, May 11, 2017, http://fortune.com/2017/05/11/american-express-alexa-skill/; Capital One,\n“CapitalOne is on Amazon Echo” (last visited October 18, 2017), www.capitalone.com/applications/alexa/.\n46 See, e.g., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Consumer Protection Principles: Consumer-Authorized\nFinancial Data Sharing and Aggregation,” October 18, 2017,\nhttp://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-protection-principles_data-aggregation.pdf; Kaitlin\nAsrow and Beth Brockland, Liability, Transparency and Consumer Control in Data Sharing, Center for Financial\nServices Innovation, September 18, 2017, http://cfsinnovation.org/research/liability-transparency-consumer-control-\nin-data-sharing/.\n47 Cf.

Since 2008, we have seen several\nepisodes of extreme financial conditions in major economies. In many countries,\nmonetary policy has shouldered a large share of the policy response. Debt-deleveraging\ndynamics and disinflationary pressures have confronted policymakers in several\neconomies with the classic challenge of providing accommodation when constrained by\nthe zero lower bound. In contrast to the Great Depression, a number of central banks\nhave found the “courage to act,” which has led to important policy innovation. While it\nwill take many years for rigorous research to distill the lessons from this period, I will\noffer a few preliminary observations.1\nThe Effectiveness of Unconventional Monetary Policy\nFor much of the period since 2008, many economies, including the United States,\nthe United Kingdom, Switzerland, the euro area, and Japan, have been at or near the zero\nlower bound. Many economies have experienced depressed aggregate demand and large\nand persistent gaps between output and potential, which have led to significant reductions\nin the level of policy rates in order to achieve full employment and target inflation.\nMoreover, the neutral level of short-term risk-free rates looks to be much lower now in\nmany countries than it had been previously. A lower neutral rate raises the likelihood\nthat the requisite monetary accommodation when using conventional tools alone implies\nsetting the nominal policy rate below zero. With constraints on moving nominal interest\nrates significantly below zero, central banks have looked to unconventional policy, such\nas asset purchases.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe evidence suggests that unconventional monetary policy can be effective at\novercoming the limitations on policy at the zero lower bound by operating through\nchannels broadly similar to conventional monetary policy. A number of studies have\nsuggested that the forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases conducted by the\nFederal Reserve boosted the levels of employment and inflation at a time when the level\nof short-term interest rates was constrained by the zero lower bound. For example,\nEngen, Laubach, and Reifschneider estimate that the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance\nand asset purchase programs may have lowered the unemployment rate by as much as\n1-1/4 percentage points and increased the level of inflation by 50 basis points.2\nWhile conventional policy operates directly on the current and expected future\npath of overnight interest rates, and thereby indirectly influences longer-term interest\nrates, asset purchases are directly targeted at lowering yields on longer-term securities,\nwhich continue to have positive interest rates. In the so-called portfolio balance effect,\nthe asset purchases reduce the supply of long-term Treasury and agency securities\navailable in the market, which leads investors to bid up the price of remaining securities,\nthus lowering yields across a range of financial assets. Despite this difference, the\nchannels through which asset purchases affect the economy appear similar to those of\nconventional monetary policy. The resulting reduction in interest rates spurs investment\nand purchases of consumer durables, lowers the exchange rate, and increases the prices of\nrisky assets, such as equities.\n2 See Eric M. Engen, Thomas T. Laubach, and David Reifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects\nof the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary Policies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2015-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System),\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.\n\n- 3 -\nIn addition, many have also emphasized an indirect effect through a “signaling\nchannel.” By helping to shape expectations about the expected future path of the federal\nfunds rate, asset purchases help reinforce forward guidance. Thus, asset purchases can\naffect longer-run interest rates by lowering the expected path of short-term rates as well\nas by reducing the term premium of long-duration securities.3\nSpillovers from Unconventional Monetary Policy\nTurning to the cross-border effects, just as unconventional policy appears similar\nto conventional policy in its domestic effects, the analysis so far suggests that spillovers\nfrom unconventional monetary policy work through the same three channels as\nconventional monetary policy does.4 First, when monetary policy in one country\nresponds to a negative economic shock by easing, this action helps support domestic\ndemand, which in turn will likely lead to greater demand for the exports of foreign\ncountries. Second, monetary policy easing can also lead to a depreciation of the\ncountry’s foreign exchange rate, which switches domestic expenditures away from\nforeign exports. Finally, it eases conditions across financial markets in that country,\n3 A number of observers have suggested that the market and macroeconomic effects of the initial asset\npurchase programs announced at the most intense period of the financial crisis may have been larger than\nthe programs announced later in the recovery. The initial programs were important in bolstering\nconfidence broadly and supporting liquidity in financial markets. The later asset purchase programs,\nparticularly the flow-based program whose duration was tied to a substantial improvement in the outlook\nfor the labor market, were important in signaling that the Federal Reserve was committed to taking all\nactions necessary to achieve its mandated objectives.\n4 For example, see David Bowman, Juan M. Londono, and Horacio Sapriza (2014), “U.S. Unconventional\nMonetary Policy and Transmission to Emerging Market Economies,” International Finance Discussion\nPapers 1109 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2014/1109/ifdp1109.pdf; John H. Rogers, Chiara Scotti, and Jonathan\nH. Wright (2014), “Evaluating Asset-Market Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy: A Cross-\nCountry Comparison,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1101 (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, March), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2014/1101/ifdp1101.pdf; Joshua\nHausman and Jon Wongswan (2011), “Global Asset Prices and FOMC Announcements,” Journal of\nInternational Money and Finance, vol. 30 (April), pp. 547-71; and Reuven Glick and Sylvain Leduc\n(2013), “The Effects of Unconventional and Conventional U.S. Monetary Policy on the Dollar,” Working\nPaper Series 2013-11 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, May),\nwww.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2013-11.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nwhich can lead to financial easing in foreign markets when global financial markets are\ntightly integrated.\nThe spillovers are likely to be more positive the greater the expansion of domestic\ndemand relative to the expenditure switching effect through the exchange rate and the\ngreater is the easing of financial conditions. The magnitude of the relative cross-border\neffects from each of these three channels will depend on the size of the country that is\neasing monetary policy as well as its relative weight in international financial markets.\nSince 2008, changes in the stance of monetary policy in major economies have\noften elicited strong reactions in other economies. Whether the global spillovers from\nchanges in monetary policy were viewed as benign or challenging depends on the relative\nstrength of the three transmission effects described earlier, the relative divergence of\nconditions in foreign economies, and the flexibility of their monetary policy tools to\noffset divergent spillovers.\nTo illustrate this point, let’s start with a case where the effect of easing through\nunconventional means was broadly welcomed. From 2008 through 2009, the Federal\nReserve eased policy through cuts in its policy rate and through large-scale asset\npurchases. That easing came in the context of a widespread global slump and severe\nstrains in global financial markets, and in these circumstances it had significant positive\ninternational spillovers. The boost to domestic demand likely outweighed any effect via\nthe exchange rate and contributed to an easing of U.S. and global financial conditions.\nThose positive spillovers were reinforced by widespread easing of conventional monetary\npolicies by central banks across the globe in response to the depressed state of their\neconomies.\n\n- 5 -\nIn contrast, in 2010 and 2011, when the Federal Reserve undertook its second\nround of large-scale asset purchases, the global reaction was mixed. By that time, several\nemerging market economies were experiencing economic conditions close to full\nemployment and strong credit growth. For many of the countries with divergent\neconomic conditions, the combination of a market-based exchange rate and a firmly\nanchored monetary policy framework oriented around domestic objectives was sufficient\nto offset spillovers.\nOthers, however, saw the increased capital inflows associated with the divergence\nof conditions as presenting problems for the management of their own economies. One\ncountry in this category was China, which was experiencing an investment-led expansion\naccompanied by credit expansion.\nSeparately, several emerging market economies with relatively flexible exchange\nrates, particularly those experiencing expansions because of strong commodity prices,\nsaw risks from the combination of capital inflows and upward pressure on exchange\nrates. Elevated inflows of foreign capital can present challenges in circumstances where\nprudential oversight and control of financial markets are not fully developed. Thus,\ncountries such as Brazil worried that heavy capital inflows could lead to an undesirable\nloosening of credit conditions and leave the economy vulnerable to rapid reversals.\nIn the past two years, we have seen these concerns play out in reverse. During the\n“taper tantrum” in 2013 and again in recent months, an increase in expectations of policy\ndivergence in the United States confronted economic policymakers in emerging markets\nwith capital outflows and financial tightening against a backdrop of weakening economic\ngrowth and financial imbalances. For these economies, while exchange rate depreciation\n\n- 6 -\ncan help offset weaker demand for exports and tighter financial conditions, it also puts\nupward pressure on inflation and may create problems for corporations with considerable\nforeign-currency denominated debt. In the case of China, a previously set course of tying\nthe renminbi to the U.S. dollar led to an appreciation of the currency from mid-2014 to\nmid-2015 in an economy that was already slowing. Attempts to offset the effects of this\nundesired appreciation have had mixed results.\nDiscontinuity around the Zero Lower Bound\nIf the research is correct in concluding that the channels for spillovers do not\ndiffer, these episodes should have played out little differently for conventional policy\nchanges than they did for unconventional policy. That raises the question of why\nannouncements of new policy actions around the zero lower bound have elicited such\nintense reactions. The launch of the Federal Reserve’s second asset purchase program in\nNovember 2010, for instance, sparked a blistering response from several foreign\npolicymakers. One foreign finance ministry official was famously quoted as denouncing\nit as “clueless,” while others dubbed it the start of a “currency war.” Officials from\nemerging markets with managed exchange rates argued that the United States “has not\nfully taken into consideration the shock of excessive capital flows to the financial\nstability of emerging markets.”5\nThe reaction was just as striking--albeit in the opposite direction--when the\nFederal Reserve first announced its intention to taper asset purchases in 2013. The taper\n5 See, for instance, Steven Hill (2010), “Germany Speaks Out,” Op-Ed, New York Times, November 13,\nwww.nytimes.com/2010/11/13/opinion/13iht-edhill.html?_r=0; Jonathan Wheatley and Peter Garnham\n(2010), “Brazil in ‘Currency War’ Alert,” Financial Times, September 15; and Newsmax Finance (2010),\n“China: Fed Easing May Flood World Economy With ‘Hot Money’,” Newsmax Media, November 8,\nwww.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/China-Fed-Easing-Flood/2010/11/08/id/376288.\n\n- 7 -\ntalk coincided with a broad reassessment of prospects in several large emerging markets\nin which some combination of financial, fiscal, and external imbalances had been\nbuilding for some time. Spillovers through financial channels were immediate despite\nthe fact that the anticipated reduction in asset purchases in the United States was expected\nto take place gradually sometime in the future.\nMy conjecture is that the widespread perception that unconventional monetary\npolicy has large and disruptive spillovers may be a reflection of the discontinuity\nassociated with discrete policy changes at the zero lower bound, along with greater\nuncertainty about the policy reaction function, rather than differences in the underlying\nchannels of transmission. When policy rates are in a range comfortably above the lower\nbound, most of the major central banks confront a relatively narrow range of options in a\nrelatively familiar framework of decisionmaking and communications. By contrast, over\nthe past six years, decisions by major central banks to initiate asset purchases have\nneither been seen nor communicated as incremental adjustments, but instead as bold new\ninitiatives whose cumulative intended scale, duration, or objective were announced at the\noutset, often against the backdrop of a public debate about the efficacy and\nappropriateness of various policy options.\nFor example, in its first two asset purchase programs the Federal Reserve\ncommitted to buying $1.7 trillion and $600 billion of assets, respectively, while in the\nsubsequent flows-based program it committed to continuing monthly asset purchases\nuntil the outlook for the labor market had met a target for substantial improvement.\nCumulative asset purchases averaged a little over $1 trillion per program, which\neconometric estimates suggest contributed to sizable reductions in term premiums\n\n- 8 -\nembedded in long-term yields and a downward shift in the expected path of the federal\nfunds rate. Similarly, in 2013, the Bank of Japan announced asset purchases at an annual\npace of about 50 trillion yen and committed to continuing these purchases until inflation\nhad moved up to 2 percent. The European Central Bank, at the beginning of this year,\ncommitted to buying 60 billion euros of assets each month at least through September of\nnext year, or until inflation is on a path to get to close to 2 percent. In all of these cases,\nthe policy actions themselves were large and designed to generate a significant easing in\noverall financial conditions, and the announcement effect likely was amplified because\nthe policy reaction function around the zero lower bound was not well known and hence\nwas difficult to anticipate.\nInternational Coordination of Unconventional Monetary Policy\nThe intense debates over cross-border spillovers of unconventional monetary\npolicy during the crisis naturally elicited calls for global coordination of monetary policy\nto avoid beggar-thy-neighbor actions that could undermine growth globally. Recognizing\nthe practical limitations of such proposals, in 2013, the Group of Seven (G-7) instead\nadopted a more circumscribed but achievable set of commitments. Each member\ncommitted that its monetary policy settings--unconventional as well as conventional--\nwould be oriented to meeting its “respective domestic objectives using domestic\ninstruments,” and “not target[ing] exchange rates.”6 This agreement ensured that actions\nin the major advanced economies would be designed to provide accommodation targeted\nto supporting domestic demand, which would in turn support global demand--in contrast\n6 HM Treasury (2013), “Statement by the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,”\nFebruary 12, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-by-the-g7-finance-ministers-and-central-\nbank-governors.\n\n- 9 -\nto classical demand-sapping beggar-thy-neighbor policies designed to shift demand by\nweakening the exchange rate. The agreement to use domestic policy instruments to\nsupport domestic output and inflation objectives is likely, on net, to be an important\nconstraint against beggar-thy-neighbor policies, especially in the less charted territory of\nunconventional policy.\nImplications for the United States\nFinally, it is worth considering what this implies for the United States. While\ntraditionally the United States is viewed more as a source than a recipient of cross-border\nspillovers, recent events have demonstrated that U.S. economic and financial conditions\ncan be sensitive to spillovers from advanced economies as well as from major emerging\nmarket economies. Over the past two years, we have seen divergences emerge among\nmajor economies in domestic growth prospects and the expected direction of monetary\npolicy. Earlier in this period, the focus was on heightened deflationary risks in Japan and\nthe euro area. The policy response to these pressures and the anticipated divergence\nbetween the policy trajectories in these economies and the United States contributed to a\n10 percent real appreciation in the dollar against a basket of currencies through the spring\nof this year.\nMore recently, growth projections have been marked down for emerging market\neconomies, which previously had been an important source of global growth. Increased\nrecognition of the risks to the outlook for major emerging market economies pushed the\ndollar up further to 15 percent above its level last summer and contributed to a more\ngeneral tightening of financial conditions over the summer. Much of the focus of\ninvestors and policymakers around the world has been on China, where the buildup of\n\n- 10 -\npast property bubbles, and more-recent stock market, bubbles, together with a steep run-\nup in business debt levels and questions about the policy framework, have raised\nconcerns. In turn, growth has slowed both in many commodity-exporting countries\nwhose exports are sensitive to Chinese demand as well as many non-commodity-\nproducing East Asian economies that are tied to China through trade and investment and\nare important destinations for U.S. exports.\nThe feedback loop between market expectations of divergence between the\nUnited States and our major trade partners and financial tightening in the United States\nmeans that material restraint to U.S. conditions is already in place. Looking ahead, a\nfurther weakening of foreign growth could pose downside risks to the U.S. outlook.\nUnder normal circumstances, policy in the United States could adjust to signs that\nspillovers from developments abroad were affecting activity in the United States. But\nwith policy rates in the United States at the lower bound, the ability to offset spillovers\nfrom adverse developments in foreign economies with conventional policy is constrained,\nsuggesting greater caution than normal.\nIn conclusion, the Great Recession has sparked innovative actions in a number of\ncountries that have helped monetary policy escape the constraints of the zero lower\nbound. Just as it appears that unconventional monetary policy can provide\naccommodation domestically similar to conventional monetary policy, so too it appears\nthat cross-borders spillovers work through the same channels. Nonetheless, the\ndiscontinuity of discrete policy changes around the zero lower bound can amplify the\neffects. In response to heightened sensitivity around these spillovers, countries that have\ndeployed unconventional policy have committed to do so in a way that targets domestic\n\n- 11 -\nobjectives using domestic instruments, thereby helping to ensure their actions would\nsupport rather than sap global demand.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:00 p.m. EST\nMarch 6, 2018\nNavigating Monetary Policy as Headwinds Shift to Tailwinds\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMoney Marketeers of New York University\nNew York, New York\nMarch 6, 2018\n\nI appreciate the invitation from the Money Marketeers to discuss the path ahead for\nour economy and monetary policy.1\nMany of the forces that acted as headwinds to U.S. growth and weighed on policy\nin previous years are generating tailwinds currently. Today many economies around the\nworld are experiencing synchronized growth, in contrast to the 2015–16 period when\nimportant foreign economies experienced adverse shocks and anemic demand. The\nInternational Monetary Fund revised up its outlook for the world economy in January,\ncontinuing a recent pattern of upward revisions, in contrast to a string of downward\nrevisions in 2015 and 2016.2 Stronger economies abroad should increase demand for\nAmerica’s exports and boost the foreign earnings of U.S. companies.\nThe upward revisions to the foreign economic outlook are also pulling forward\nexpectations of monetary policy tightening abroad and contributing to an appreciation of\nforeign currencies and increases in U.S. import prices. By contrast, foreign currencies\nweakened in the earlier period, pushing the dollar higher and U.S. import prices lower.\nSince the end of 2016, a broad index of the exchange value of the dollar has depreciated\nnearly 8 percent, whereas it appreciated by 25 percent from mid-2014 to 2016.\nIn recent quarters, the combination of higher oil prices and robust global demand\nhas been providing strong support to business investment--in contrast to the sharp pullback\nfrom 2015 to 2016. Business spending on fixed investment rose at more than a 6 percent\n1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See various issues of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook\n(www.imf.org/en/publications/weo) and World Economic Outlook (WEO) Updates\n(www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=231).\n\n- 2 -\npace in 2017. This rise followed two years of weak growth, dragged down by declines in\nthe drilling and mining sector.\nFinancial conditions are currently supportive of economic growth despite the recent\nchoppiness in financial markets and some tightening since the beginning of the year.\nVarious measures of equity valuations remain elevated relative to historical norms even\nafter recent movements, and corporate bond spreads remain quite compressed.3 This\ncompares with the period from mid-2014 through the second half of 2016, when equity\nprices were flat and the dollar rose steeply. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s\nNational Financial Conditions Index provides a useful summary statistic.4 According to\nthis measure, financial conditions tightened significantly from the middle of 2014 to early\n2016. By comparison, financial conditions today remain near the accommodative end of\nthe range since the financial crisis, even with the recent tightening in conditions.\nThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from\nrestraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment. In the earlier\nperiod, the economy had just weathered a challenging adjustment to a sharp withdrawal of\nfiscal support. Today, from a position near full employment, the economy is poised to\nabsorb $1-1/2 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in\nfederal spending. Estimates suggest December’s tax legislation could boost the growth rate\nof real gross domestic product (GDP) as much as 1/2 percentage point this year and next.5\n3 See Board of Governors (2018b).\n4 The National Financial Conditions Index is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s website at\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/nfci/index. Other indexes of financial conditions, such as the\nindexes published by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and St. Louis, tell a similar story.\n5 For example, the IMF 2018 WEO Updates (see note 2) estimates that the tax cut legislation will raise the\nlevel of U.S. GDP 1-1/4 percent by 2020.\n\n- 3 -\nOn top of that, the recently agreed-to budget deal is likely to raise federal spending by\naround 0.4 percent of GDP in each of the next two years.6\nAchieving Our Inflation Objective and Sustaining Full Employment\nAlthough the economy is currently around full employment and has been expanding\nat an above-trend pace, inflation has remained subdued for quite some time. Over the past\nyear, overall PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 1.7 percent, and core\nPCE inflation was 1.5 percent--not very different from the average level of core inflation\nover the past five years.\nThe persistence of subdued inflation, despite an unemployment rate that has moved\nbelow most estimates of its natural rate, suggests some risk that underlying inflation may\nhave softened. While transitory factors no doubt played a role in last year’s step-down in\ncore PCE inflation, various empirical analyses conclude that persistent factors are at play in\nthe stubbornly low level of core inflation. According to a variety of measures, underlying\ninflation--the slow-moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and price setting--may be\nrunning below levels that are consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective.7 For example, some survey measures of longer-run\ninflation expectations are currently lower than they were before the financial crisis, as are\nmost estimates based on statistical filters. Inflation compensation has moved up recently,\nbut is still running somewhat below levels that prevailed before the crisis.\n6 The Congressional Budget Office (2018) estimates that increased spending caps will allow additional\nspending worth about 3/4 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2019.\n7 See Brainard (2017).\n\n- 4 -\nThus, it is important for monetary policy to ensure that underlying inflation is re-\nanchored firmly at 2 percent. At the same time, it is important for monetary policy to\nsustain full employment.\nIt is difficult to know with precision how much slack remains in the labor market.\nIf the unemployment rate were to continue to fall in the coming year at the same pace as in\nthe past couple of years, it would reach levels not seen since the late 1960s. On the other\nhand, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains more than\n1 percentage point below its pre-crisis level. If substantially more workers could be drawn\ninto the labor force, it would be possible for the labor market to firm notably further\nwithout generating imbalances. But it is an open question as to what portion of the prime-\nage Americans who are out of the labor force may prove responsive to tight labor market\nconditions because declining labor force participation among prime-age workers predates\nthe crisis, especially for men. In one encouraging development, the strong labor market has\npulled some discouraged workers back into the labor force and into productive employment\nover the past few years. Also encouraging, our Beige Book and workforce surveys indicate\nthat employers are casting a wider net to find job candidates and investing more in on-the-\njob training.\nNavigating Monetary Policy\nAlthough last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in\nthe labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full\nemployment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With\ngreater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the\nfederal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\n\n- 5 -\nAlthough experience in other countries suggests it can prove difficult to raise an\nunderlying inflation trend that has been running below policymakers’ target for several\nyears, stronger tailwinds may help re-anchor inflation expectations at the symmetric\n2 percent objective. Of course, it is conceivable we could see a mild, temporary overshoot\nof the inflation target over the medium term. If such a mild, temporary overshoot were to\noccur, it would likely be consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and could\nhelp nudge underlying inflation back to our target.8 Recent research has highlighted the\ndownside risks to inflation and to longer-run inflation expectations that are posed by the\neffective lower bound on nominal interest rates, and it suggests the importance of ensuring\nunderlying inflation does not slip below target in today’s new normal.9\nWe also seek to sustain full employment, and we will want to be attentive to\nimbalances that could jeopardize this goal. If the unemployment rate continues to decline\non the current trajectory, it could fall to levels that have been rarely seen over the past five\ndecades. Historically, such episodes have tended to see elevated risks of imbalances,\nwhether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent\ndecades. One of the striking features of the current recovery has been the absence of an\nacceleration in inflation as the unemployment rate has declined, a development that is\nconsistent with a flat Phillips curve.10 Although wage gains have seen some recent\nimprovements, they continue to fall short of the pace seen before the financial crisis.11\n8 See Board of Governors (2018a).\n9 See, for example, Kiley and Roberts (2017), Nakata and Schmidt (2016), and Brainard (2015, 2016).\n10 See Blanchard (2016) and Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013).\n11 Over the 12 months through January, average hourly earnings were up 2.9 percent relative to a year earlier,\nthe highest 12-month change in almost nine years. The employment cost index rose 2.6 percent last year.\n\n- 6 -\nHowever, we do not have extensive experience with an economy at very low\nunemployment rates and cannot be sure how it might evolve. In particular, we will want to\nremain attentive to the risk of financial imbalances. While asset valuations appear to be\nelevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household\nborrowing is moderate, risks associated with liquidity and maturity transformation have\ndeclined, and, importantly, the banking system appears to be well capitalized.12 History\nsuggests, however, that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards,\nand the attendant excessive borrowing can complicate the task of monetary policy. We will\nneed to be vigilant.\nConclusion\nWhat do these considerations imply for the path of monetary policy? Continued\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to remain appropriate to ensure\ninflation rises sustainably to our target and to sustain full employment, keeping in mind that\ninterest rate normalization is well under way and balance sheet runoff is set to reach its\nsteady-state pace later this year.13 Of course, we should be ready to adjust the path of\npolicy in either direction if developments turn out differently than expected.\nIn many respects, the macro environment today is the mirror image of the\nenvironment we confronted a couple of years ago. In the earlier period, strong headwinds\nsapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy. Today, with\nheadwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.\n12 See Board of Governors (2018b).\n13 As laid out in Board of Governors (2017), the caps determining the degree of reinvestment of maturing\nsecurities in the System Open Market Account are increasing gradually. The caps on the monthly runoff in\nthe portfolio are expected to reach their maximum levels of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $20 billion\nfor agency debt and mortgage-backed securities later this year. The actual pace of runoff will vary, however,\ndepending on the volume of securities maturing in any given month.\n\n- 7 -\nReferences\nBlanchard, Olivier (2016). “The U.S. Phillips Curve: Back to the ’60s?” Policy Brief\nPB16-1.

Smartphones have\nushered in an age when different companies can easily work with each other’s products to\nseamlessly provide services to consumers. Today I want to reflect on what we might learn from\nthat model about the increasingly interconnected world of financial services.\nOn the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, a Wired.com article revealed that even Steve Jobs\nhadn’t predicted the smartphone’s potential as a platform.1 Apple was just trying to design an\niPod that made phone calls. Today, the average American spends five hours a day on their\nphone, unlocking it an average of 80 times daily.2 Even the Supreme Court has noted that\nsmartphones are now “such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor\nfrom Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy.”3\nOf course, we aren’t using these appendages primarily to make phone calls. Instead, we\nmainly use our smartphones to access applications (apps).4 In June of last year, Apple\nannounced that over 2 million apps were available on its App Store.5 For the most part, these\nI am grateful to Kelvin Chen for his assistance in preparing this text.\n1 David Pierce, “Even Steve Jobs Didn’t Predict the iPhone Decade,” Wired, January 9, 2017,\nwww.wired.com/2017/01/apple-iphone-10th-anniversary/.\n2 Mary Meeker, Internet Trends 2016—Code Conference, June 1, 2016, www.slideshare.net/kleinerperkins/2016-\ninternet-trends-report/109-KPCB_INTERNET_TRENDS_2016_PAGE109Average (slide 109); and Ben Bajarin,\n“Apple’s Penchant for Consumer Security,” TechOpinions, April 18, 2016, https://techpinions.com/apples-\npenchant-for-consumer-security/45122.\n3 See Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct.2473, 2484 (2014), www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-132_8l9c.pdf.\n4 For instance, the average American now spends nearly an hour a day on Facebook’s mobile platforms alone. See,\ne.g., James B. Stewart, “Facebook Has 50 Minutes of Your Time Each Day. It Wants More,” New York Times, May\n5, 2016, www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-\nadvantage.html. This count includes Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram, but not WhatsApp.\n5 See, e.g., Jordan Golson, “Apple’s App Store Now Has over 2 Million Apps,” The Verge, June 13, 2016,\nwww.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11922926/apple-apps-2-million-wwdc-2016.\n\n- 2 -\napps were not created or even envisaged by Apple. These apps have been downloaded 130\nbillion times, generating over $50 billion in revenue for third-party developers.6\nThe iPhone is a key platform on which that app ecosystem operates. How did that\nhappen? Apple essentially made the smartphone a toolkit for third-party developers to\nexperiment, innovate, build, and scale new apps. It did so by investing heavily in developing\nopen application programming interfaces (APIs) that provided third-party developers clear\ninstructions and open access to the iPhone platform. This strategy enabled those outside\ndevelopers to build new applications that delivered Apple’s customers additional value by taking\nadvantage of the existing functionality of the iPhone. Specifically, this open architecture makes\navailable to outside developers clear instructions that enable them to use the iPhone’s various\nsensors, processors, displays, and other interfaces in combination with their own code to develop\nnew products.\nOn top of that, a robust secondary layer of developers use the APIs of other developers in\ntheir technology stacks to quickly assemble new business models. Take ride-sharing services,\nfor instance. They have built multibillion-dollar businesses that are, in large part, dependent on\ncombinations of APIs from different companies. They may use Google Maps’ APIs for location\nservices, Stripe or Braintree’s APIs for payments, Twilio’s APIs for text messaging, and Amazon\nWeb Services’ or IBM’s APIs for computing power. All of these products, and more, work\nseamlessly together in real time to provide products that are so ubiquitous that we now use them\nas verbs for how we navigate the world. We “Uber” to the store or “Snapchat” a friend.\n6 See, e.g., Sarah Perez, “Apple’s App Store hits 2M apps, 130B downloads, $50B paid to developers,” TechCrunch\nJune 13, 2016, https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/13/apples-app-store-hits-2m-apps-130b-downloads-50b-paid-to-\ndevelopers/. On August 3, 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted on Twitter that the $50 billion figure had been\nsurpassed. Tim Cook, Twitter, Aug. 3, 2016, https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/760929629226041345 (last\naccessed April 4, 2017).\n\n- 3 -\nRisks and Opportunities in an Increasingly Interconnected World\nThere is every reason to expect financial services to make a similar transition to an\nincreasingly interconnected digital world. By now, we’ve all heard estimates of the thousands of\nfintech companies that have launched in the past few years and the billions of investment dollars\nthat are flooding into this sector.7 But for all of the talk of “disruption,” I want to underscore an\nimportant point: More often than not, there is a banking organization somewhere in the fintech\nstack. Just as third-party app developers rely on smartphone sensors, processors, and interfaces,\nfintech developers need banks somewhere in the stack for such things as: (a) access to consumer\ndeposits or related account data, (b) access to payment systems, (c) credit origination, or\n(d) compliance management.8 For instance, account comparison services rely on access to data\nfrom consumers’ bank accounts. Savings and investment apps analyze transactions data from\nbank accounts to understand how to optimize performance and manage the funds consumers hold\nin those accounts.

Much of the work so far has been\nfocused on the technical challenges, which are notable. Most banks’ core systems are amalgams\nof computing mainframes built decades ago before the Internet or cloud computing were widely\navailable and, in many cases, stitched together over the course of mergers and consolidations.10\nIt takes a lot of investment to securely convert that infrastructure to platforms that can operate in\nreal-time with ready access for Internet-native third-party developers.\nBut important policy, regulatory, and legal questions also demand attention. And that is\nwhere the smartphone analogy loses its power. On balance, bank activities are much more\nhighly regulated than smartphones. Those regulations enable consumers to trust their banks to\nsecure their funds and maintain the integrity of their transactions. While “run fast and break\nthings” may be a popular mantra in the technology field, it is ill suited to an arena where a\nserious breach could undermine confidence in the payments system. Indeed, some of the key\nunderpinnings of consumer protection and safety and soundness in the banking world--that\nconsumers should be exceptionally careful in granting account access, that in certain conditions\nbanks could be presumed to bear liability for unauthorized charges, and that banks can be held\nresponsible for ensuring that service providers and vendors do right by their customers--sit\n9 While Bitcoin is a notable exception, many consumers still rely on connecting their bank accounts with Bitcoin\nexchanges to convert their fiat currency to virtual currency and vice-versa.\n10 See, e.g., Bryan Yurcan, “Is a Turning Point Near for Core Systems?” American Banker, April 20, 2016,\nwww.americanbanker.com/news/is-a-turning-point-near-for-core-systems (noting survey findings that 70 percent of\nU.S. bankers do not feel that their current processes can quickly adapt to market changes, and that 53 percent of\nsurvey respondents identified new products/innovation as the top benefit of investing in new core systems); Tom\nGroenfeldt, “Updating, Replacing, Surrounding Core Banking System,” Forbes, July 21, 2015,\nwww.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2015/07/21/updating-replacing-surrounding-core-banking-\nsystem/#2e019cd61282.\n\n- 5 -\nuneasily alongside the requisites of openness, connectivity, and data access that enable today’s\napp ecosystem.11 For instance, before entering an outsourcing arrangement, a bank is expected\nto consider whether the service provider’s internal processes or systems (or even human error at\nthe outside party) could expose the bank and its customers to potential losses or expose the\nbank’s customers to fraud and the bank to litigation; whether the service provider complies with\napplicable laws and regulation; and whether poor performance by that outside party could\nmaterially harm the bank’s public reputation.\nThe smartphone app ecosystem developed without the regulations or associated\nguardrails pertaining to institutions that people trust to hold their life savings. For instance,\nwhen Pokémon Go was first launched, its creator, Niantic, used an outdated Google API to\nverify consumer identities. This created confusion about whether millions of consumers had\nunwittingly granted Niantic full access to their e-mails, contact lists, and calendars.12 However,\nit did not stand in the way of Pokémon Go subsequently being downloaded a half billion times.13\nIn contrast, these kinds of mistakes in the banking sector could raise grave concerns about\nconsumer data privacy and security and the integrity of consumer transactions data. That’s why\nbanks are expected to conduct extensive risk assessments and due diligence of their service\n11 See, e.g., 12 CFR §1005.1(b); appendix C to 12 CFR part 1005, comment 2(m)-2 (“If a consumer furnishes an\naccess device and grants authority to make transfers to a person (such as a family member or co-worker) who\nexceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the transfers unless the consumer has notified the\nfinancial institution that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.”); Division of Banking Supervision and\nRegulation and Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n“Guidance on Managing Outsourcing Risk,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1319a1.pdf,\nDecember 5, 2013.\n12 See, e.g., Olivia Solon, “Have You Given Pokémon Go Full Access to Everything in Your Google Account?”\nGuardian, July 12, 2016, www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/11/pokemon-go-privacy-security-full-access-\ngoogle-account.

In fact, both Google and Niantic Labs, say that ‘full access’ counterintuitively means\nnothing of the sort, a claim backed up by independent security researchers.

There are a few alternative\napproaches in operation today, with various advantages and drawbacks.\nA number of large banks have developed or are in the process of developing interfaces to\nallow outside developers access to their platforms under controlled conditions. Similar to Apple\nopening the APIs of its phones and operating systems, these financial companies are working to\nprovide APIs to outside developers, who can then build new products on the banks’ platforms.15\nIt is worth highlighting that platform APIs generally vary in their degree of openness, even in the\n14 See, e.g., Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation and Division of Consumer and Community Affairs,\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidance on Managing Outsourcing Risk,”\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1319a1.pdf, December 5, 2013.\n15 See, e.g., Citigroup, “Citi Launches Global API Developer Hub to Enable Open Banking,” press release,\nNovember 10, 2016, www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2016/161110b.htm; BBVA, “BBVA API Market, the Platform\nfor Financial Innovators,” press release, May 4, 2016, www.bbva.com/en/news/general/bbva-api-market-platform-\nfinancial-innovators/; Mark Boyd, “Capital One Launches First True Open Banking Platform in U.S., Programmable\nWeb,” March 11, 2016, www.programmableweb.com/news/capital-one-launches-first-true-open-banking-platform-\nus/2016/03/11; Penny Crosman, “Fintech Glasnost: Why U.S. Banks are Opening Up APIs to Outsiders,” American\nBanker, July 8, 2015, www.americanbanker.com/news/fintech-glasnost-why-us-banks-are-opening-up-apis-to-\noutsiders; see also Pymnts.com, “Mastercard Turns Up the API Volume,” September 28, 2016,\nwww.pymnts.com/mastercard/2016/mastercard-turns-up-the-api-volume/; Visa Inc., “Visa Opens its Global\nNetwork with Launch of Visa Developer,” press release, February 4, 2016,\nwww.businesswire.com/news/home/20160204006175/en/Visa-Opens-Global-Network-Launch-Visa-Developer.\nIndeed, over five years ago, French bank Credit Agricole used open APIs to launch an app store of its own. The\nbank even connects its customers with developers, using message boards so that customers (or even other banks) can\npost ideas for developers to build. See, e.g., Karen Epper Hoffman, “Open API for Bank Apps: Can Credit\nAgricole’s Model Work Here?” American Banker, July 29, 2013; CA Store, www.creditagricolestore.fr/catalogue-d-\napplications.html (last visited April 4, 2017) (as of April 2017, the site features 47 apps and 62 ideas); Mary\nWisniewski, “Will Banks Become App Stores?

If a developer wants to use a Google Maps API to embed a map in her\napplication, she first must create a developer account with Google, agreeing to Google’s terms\nand conditions. This means she will have entered a contract with the owner of the API, and the\nterms and conditions may differ depending on how sensitive the particular API is. Google may\nrequire only a minimum amount of information for a developer that wants to use an API to\ndisplay a map. Google may, however, require more information about a developer that wants to\nuse a different API to monitor the history of a consumer’s physical locations over the previous\nweek. And in some cases, the competitive interests of Google and a third-party app developer\nmay diverge over time, such that the original terms of access are no longer acceptable.16\nThe fact that it is possible and indeed relatively common for the API provider--the\nplatform--to require specific controls and protections over the use of that API raises complicated\nissues when imported to the banking world. As banks have considered how to facilitate\nconnectivity, the considerations include not only technical issues and the associated investment,\nbut also the important legal questions associated with operating in a highly regulated sector. The\nbanks’ terms of access may be determined in third-party service provider agreements that may\noffer different degrees of access. These may affect not only what types of protections and\nvetting are appropriate for different types of access over consumers’ funds and data held at a\nbank in order to enable the bank to fulfill its obligations for data security and other consumer\nprotections, but also the competitive position of the bank relative to third-party developers.\nThere is a second broad type of approach in which many banks have entered into\nagreements with specialized companies that essentially act as middlemen, frequently described\n16 The Financial Times reported that Uber will invest half a billion dollars into developing its own mapping software\nas it continues its push into driverless cars, thereby reducing its reliance on Google Maps. Leslie Hook, “Uber to\nPour $500m into Global Mapping Project,” Financial Times, July 31, 2016, www.ft.com/cms/s/0%2Fe0dfa45e-\n5522-11e6-befd-2fc0c26b3c60.html?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true#axzz4G0M5oyu8.\n\n- 8 -\nas “data aggregators.” These banks may lack the budgets and expertise to create their own open\nAPIs or may not see that as a key element in their business strategies. Data aggregators collect\nconsumer financial account data from banks, on the one hand, and then provide access to that\ndata to fintech developers, on the other hand.17 Data aggregators organize the data they collect\nfrom banks and other data sources and then offer their own suite of open APIs to outside\ndevelopers. By partnering with data aggregators, banks can open their systems to thousands of\ndevelopers, without having to invest in creating and maintaining their own open APIs. This also\nallows fintech developers to build their products around the APIs of two or three data\naggregators, rather than 15,000 different banks and other data sources. And, if agreements\nbetween data aggregators and banks are structured as data aggregators performing outsourced\nservices to banks, the bank should be able to conduct the appropriate due diligence of its\nvendors, whose services to those banks may be subject to examination by safety and soundness\nregulators.18\nSome banks have opted for a more “closed” approach to fintech developers by entering\ninto individual agreements with specific technology providers or data aggregators.19 These\n17 For example, one major data aggregator reports that about 70 percent of the data it collects from over 15,000\nsources is collected via “structured feeds” under contractual agreements with financial institutions. See Envestnet,\nInc., 2016 Annual Report, at 28, March 24, 2016.\n18 See, e.g., 12 USC §§ 1861-67; Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation and Division of Consumer and\nCommunity Affairs Federal Reserve System, Guidance on Managing Outsourcing Risk,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1319a1.pdf, December 5, 2013; Steven Boms, “Yodlee Response to\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau Request for Information Regarding Consumer Access to Financial Records,”\nDocket No. CFPB 2016-0048, February 21, 2017, www.regulations.gov/document?D=CFPB-2016-0048-0033.\n(“Yodlee . . . has complied with hundreds of bank audits and with examinations by the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency throughout its history.”)\n19 See, e.g., “Finicity and Wells Fargo Ink Data Exchange Deal,” press release, April 4, 2017,\nwww.finicity.com/press-release-finicity-wells-fargo-ink-data-exchange-deal/; Wells Fargo & Co., “Intuit Signs New\nData-Exchange Agreement with Wells Fargo,” press release, February 3, 2017,\nwww.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2017/intuit-agreement_0203/; Intuit, “Chase, Intuit to Give Customers Greater\nControl of Their Information,” press release, January 25, 2017, www.intuit.com/company/press-room/press-\nreleases/2017/Chase-Intuit-to-Give-Customers-Greater-Control-of-Their-Information/; Wells Fargo & Co., “Wells\nFargo, Xero Agree on New Data-Exchange Method,” press release, June 7, 2016,\nwww.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/new-dataexchange-method_0607/; Silicon Valley Bank, “Xero and Silicon\nValley Bank Partner to Offer Innovative Companies Next-Generation Financial Management,” press release, July\n\n- 9 -\nagreements often impose specific requirements rather than simply facilitating structured data\nfeeds. These banks negotiate for greater control over their systems by limiting who is accessing\ntheir data--often to a specific third party’s suite of products. Likewise, many banks use these\nagreements to limit what types of data will be shared. For instance, banks may share information\nabout the balances in consumers’ accounts but decline to share information about fees or other\npricing. While recognizing the legitimate need for vetting of third parties for purposes of the\nbanks fulfilling their responsibilities, including for data privacy and security, some consumer\ngroups have suggested that the standards for vetting should be commonly agreed to and\ntransparent to ensure that banks do not restrict access for competitive reasons and that consumers\nshould be able to decide what data to make available to third-party fintech applications.20\nA third set of banks may be unable or unwilling to provide permissioned access, for\nreasons ranging from fears about increased competition to concerns about the cost and\ncomplexity of ensuring compliance with underlying laws and regulations. At the very least,\nbanks may have reasonable concerns about being able to see, if not control, which third-party\ndevelopers will have access to the banking data that is provided by the data aggregators.\nAccordingly, even banks that have previously provided structured data feeds to data aggregators\nmay decide to limit or block access.21 In such cases, however, data aggregators can still move\n16, 2014, www.svb.com/News/Company-News/Xero-and-Silicon-Valley-Bank-Partner-to-Offer-Innovative-\nCompanies-Next-Generation-Financial-Management/.\n20 See, e.g., Center for Financial Services Innovation, “Consumer Data Sharing Principles: A Brief on the\nFramework for Industry-Wide Collaboration,” October 20, 2016, http://cfsinnovation.org/research/consumer-data-\nsharing-principles-a-brief-on-the-framework-for-industry-wide-collaboration/. Indeed, many of the developers that\nmake use of the bank data obtained by data aggregators are actually other banks.

(“[O]ne or more of our current customers could\ndecide to limit or block our access to the data feeds we currently have in place with these customers due to factors\noutside of our control such as more burdensome regulation of our or our customers’ industry, increased compliance\nrequirements or changes in business strategy.

Instead, data aggregators and fintech developers\ndirectly ask consumers to give them their online banking logins and passwords. Then, in a\nprocess commonly called “screen scraping,” data aggregators log onto banks’ online consumer\nwebsites, as if they were the actual consumers, and extract information. Some banks report that\nas much as 20 to 40 percent of online banking logins is attributable to data aggregators. They\neven assert that they have trouble distinguishing whether a computer system that is logging in\nmultiple times a day is a consumer, a data aggregator, or a cyber attack.\nFor community banks with limited resources, the necessary investments in API\ntechnology and in negotiating and overseeing data-sharing agreements with data aggregators and\nthird-party providers may be beyond their reach, especially as they usually rely on service\nproviders for their core technology. Some fintech firms argue that screen scraping--which has\ndrawn the most complaints about data security--may be the most effective tool for the customers\nof small community banks to access the financial apps they prefer--and thereby necessary to\nremain competitive until more effective broader industry solutions are developed.\nClearly, getting these connectivity questions right, including the need to manage the\nconsumer protection risks, is critically important. It could make the difference between a world\nin which the fintech wave helps community banks become the platforms of the future, on the one\nhand, or, on the other hand, a world in which fintech instead further widens the gulf between\ncommunity banks and the largest banks.\nour solutions limit or restrict our ability to access or use such information, we may be required to attempt to obtain\nthe information, if at all, through end user-permissioned data scraping or other means that could be more costly and\ntime-consuming, and less effective or efficient. . . . The legal environment surrounding data scraping and similar\nmeans of obtaining access to information on third-party websites is not completely clear and is evolving, and one or\nmore third parties could assert claims against us seeking damages or to prevent us from accessing information in that\nmanner.”)\n\n- 11 -\nTradeoffs\nThe different approaches to integrating banks into the fintech stack represent different\nrisks and tradeoffs. Connectivity solutions that require intermediaries such as data aggregators\nand rely on screen scraping potentially create repositories of consumer credentials for hackers to\ntarget. Banks argue that if such a repository is breached, thousands of banks could be\nimpacted.22 Further complicating things, because screen scrapers operate without contractual\nrelationships with the banks from which they pull information, banks have little leverage or\nability to vet the security of the screen scrapers’ systems and methods or their overall risk. In\nthese circumstances, some commentators have noted that if a data aggregator or third-party\ndeveloper is breached, it may not be clear who would bear responsibility for any losses--the\nbank, the data aggregator, the fintech developer, or the consumer. Some third-party developers\nhave included terms and conditions that specifically limit their liability to consumers.23 It is not\nclear the extent to which many consumers understand the risks involved with sharing their\nbanking credentials, the more limited liability accepted by many third-party developers relative\nto their bank or credit card issuer, and the fact that the third-party developers may in turn provide\nthose credentials to others in some instances.\n22 According to one banking trade organization, “[t]his is a rich reward for a single hack, either of an aggregated\ndatabase of personally identifiable information or of a single consumer’s multiple accounts, makes data aggregators\nan attractive target for criminals. [Hackers would] obtain the key not to just a single room, but the key ring with\nkeys to all the rooms.” The Clearing House, “Comment Letter to Bureau-2016-0048 Request for Information\nRegarding Consumer Access to Financial Records,” February 21, 2017,\nhttp://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/112016_cfpb_Request_for_Information_Regarding_Consumer_Acces\ns_to_Financial_Records.pdf.\n23 See, e.g, “Personal Capital Terms of Use” (last updated February 22, 2017),\nwww.personalcapital.com/content/terms-of-use/ (last visited April 16, 2017). (“TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIABILITY OF PERSONAL CAPITAL, ITS AFFILIATES,\nLICENSORS AND AGENTS TO YOU SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100).”)\nFurther, Personal Capital requires that consumers submit to pre-dispute arbitration agreements and waive any rights\nto pursue relief in a class action proceeding as part of its terms of use. This would mean that if a data breach were to\noccur, each affected consumer would have to seek relief on his own, with a maximum possible recovery of $100. In\naddition, Personal Capital’s terms and conditions specify that the arbitrator can require that the consumer pay\nPersonal Capital’s legal fees, if Personal Capital is to prevail.\n\n- 12 -\nOn the other side of the debate, fintech companies are concerned that banks could use\ntheir control over consumer data access in the context of bilateral contracts with data aggregators\nto leverage their position in order to impede competition elsewhere in the stack. This argument\nabout access and competition echoes similar concerns in the smartphone arena.24\nFurther, third-party developers argue that open standards for data access can help banks\nmeet consumers’ expectations for mobile banking by providing access to the fintech apps that\nbest serve their needs. The relatively open architecture of the iPhone platform means that Apple\nprofits from outside developers’ products without having to design or invest in them directly.\nFor instance, Apple didn’t include a home-grown mapping app during the first few years of the\niPhone.25 Instead, it relied on Google to provide that important function for its smartphones\nbefore trying to build its own mapping tool--a process that took a number of iterations before\ngetting it right. Open platform strategies may mean that banks can essentially outsource product\ndevelopment to fintech firms.26 This could be a boon--particularly for small community banks\n24 When the iPhone first launched, for instance, one phone provider paid a premium for exclusive access to the\nsmartphone. This meant that, for several years, consumers that wanted the iPhone also had to enter relationships\nwith the only Internet service provider platform that offered the phone. See, e.g., Saul Hansell, “Why AT&T Wants\nto Keep the iPhone Away from Verizon,” New York Times, April 22, 2009,\nhttps://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/why-att-wants-to-keep-the-iphone-away-from-verizon/ (“AT&T is paying\nApple an unusually high subsidy on top of the $199 and $299 paid by iPhone buyers. But it appears to be getting\nquite a return on that investment.”) At the same time, Apple has used its own iPhone platform to affect the\ndevelopment of products further up the stack. While much of the iPhone is an open platform for third-party\ndevelopers, developers do not have access to the iPhone’s secure element and Near Field Communication (NFC)\nantenna--key components of digital wallet technologies. This means that Apple Pay is the only “tap-to-pay” NFC\ndigital wallet available for iPhones--and that Apple Pay competitors, like Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are unable\nto access 40 percent of the smartphones in the United States. See, e.g., Philip Elmer-DeWitt, “About Apple’s 40%\nShare of the U.S. Smartphone Market,” Fortune, February 11, 2016, http://fortune.com/2016/02/11/apple-iphone-\nios-share/. When a group of Australia’s largest banks recently petitioned the country’s antitrust authority to allow\nthem to band together to require Apple to unlock access to the NFC antenna, for use by their digital wallets, their\nrequest was denied. See, e.g., Simon Sharwood, “Banking Group Denied Access to iPhones’ NFC Chips for\nalt.Apple.Pay,” Register, April 3, 2017,\nwww.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/03/banking_group_denied_access_to_iphones_nfc_chips_for_altapplepay/\n25 See, e.g., Chance Miller, Apple Maps Now Used 3x as Often as Google Maps on iOS, Serving 5B Requests per\nWeek, 9to5Mac, December 7, 2015, https://9to5mac.com/2015/12/07/apple-maps-usage-numbers/.\n26 For example, small business lender Kabbage, Inc. has entered agreements with large banks, where Kabbage\nlicenses its data analysis-heavy customer acquisition platform to banking partners who then go on to originate, fund,\nand service the underlying loans.

The bank would only have to worry about getting the connections to\nan open API right and then reap the benefits of the innovation by third parties.\nRegulatory Developments\nAs regulators, we have a responsibility to ensure that the institutions subject to our\nsupervision are operated safely and soundly and that they comply with applicable statutes and\nregulations. More broadly, we have a strong interest in permitting socially beneficial\ninnovations to flourish, while ensuring the risks that they may present are appropriately\nmanaged, consistent with the legal requirements. We do not want to unnecessarily restrict\ninnovations that can benefit consumers and small businesses through expanded access to\nfinancial services or greater efficiency, convenience, and reduced transaction costs. Nor do we\nwant to drive these activities away from regulated banks and toward less governed spaces in the\nfinancial system.\nRegulators in the United Kingdom and continental Europe have recently outlined new\napproaches to facilitate connectivity in financial services, while attempting to mitigate the\nassociated risks. In August 2016, the UK Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) released a\npackage of mandates aimed at increasing competition for consumer and small business current\naccounts (akin to U.S. checking accounts).27 This year nine of the country’s largest banks were\nGrowth,” press release, April 3, 2016, www.kabbage.com/blog/kabbage-santander-uk-partner-accelerate-smb-\ngrowth/.\n27 UK Competition & Markets Authority, “CMA Paves the Way for Open Banking Revolution,” press release,\nAugust 9, 2016, www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-paves-the-way-for-open-banking-revolution.

Before March 2018, the CMA is scheduled to enforce a\nbroader package of reforms, including mandating that the nine banks create APIs that allow\nthird-party banks and nonbanks to access consumer accounts for reading transaction data and\npayment initiation.\nIn the European Union, beginning in 2018, member states will be required to start\nimplementing the European Parliament’s revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).29 Among\nother elements, PSD2 created licensing regimes for third parties that access bank accounts for\npurposes of initiating payment orders or consolidating information with consumers’ consent.30\nThe directive mandates that banks allow these licensed third parties to access their consumer\naccounts (with consumer permission) without premising such access on contractual agreements\nwith the banks. Indeed, PSD2 requires that credit institutions not block or hinder access to\npayment accounts and that licensed third parties have access to credit institutions’ payment\naccounts services in an objective, nondiscriminatory, and proportionate manner. When credit\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57ac9667e5274a0f6c00007a/retail-banking-market-investigation-full-\nfinal-report.pdf.\n28 The nine banks include the five largest banks in Great Britain (Lloyd’s Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland,\nHSBC Group, Barclays, and Santander UK plc); three leading banks in Northern Ireland (Allied Irish Bank, Bank of\nIreland, and Danske Bank) and the largest UK building society, Nationwide Building Society.\n29 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council, November 25, 2015, http://eur-\nlex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L2366 (last visited Feb. 1, 2017).\n30 Specifically, Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) initiate payment orders at the request of a user with\nrespect to funds held in another entity’s bank account; Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) are online\nservices that consolidate information, with consumers’ consent, from those consumers’ accounts at other entities.\n\n- 15 -\ninstitutions do reject access, they are required to provide the relevant authorities detailed\nreasoning for the rejection.\nThe directive attempts to mitigate the attendant data-security and consumer-protection\nrisks with a number of measures that, by and large, are not readily available policy options in the\nUnited States. Importantly, third parties that access bank accounts will be subject to licensing\nand registration requirements, as well as associated capital and insurance requirements.\nMoreover, the directive envisions that electronic payments will be authorized by two-factor\nauthentication--for example “something you know” and “something you are.”31\nThe United States is likely to address these issues in a different way, at least initially,\ngiven that regulatory authorities are more broadly distributed, and the relevant statutory language\npredates these technological developments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\nissued a Request for Information last fall to explore issues surrounding consumers’ granting\naccess to account information to third parties.32 Of course, safety and soundness regulation--and\nwith it, concerns about data security, cyber security, and vendor risk management--is distributed\namong a number of regulators. For instance, there may be value to examining the vendor risk\nmanagement guidance so that it facilitates banks connecting more securely and efficiently with\nthe fintech apps that consumers prefer.33 Similarly, it could be useful to periodically assess\nwhether and how authority under the Bank Service Company Act might pertain to developments\n31 With limited exceptions, such as for de minimis transactions.\n32 Richard Cordray, “Prepared Remarks of CFPB Director Richard Cordray” at the Lendit USA Conference, March\n6, 2017, www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-cfpb-director-richard-cordray-lendit-usa-\nconference/; Richard Cordray, “Prepared Remarks of CFPB Director Richard Cordray” at Money 20/20, October 23,\n2016, www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-cfpb-director-richard-cordray-money-\n2020/; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Request for Information Regarding Consumer Access to Financial\nRecords,” Federal Register, November 22, 2016, www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-\n28086/request-for-information-regarding-consumer-access-to-financial-records.\n33 See, e.g., Lael Brainard, “The Opportunities and Challenges of Fintech” at the Conference on Financial\nInnovation at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 2, 2016,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20161202a.htm.\n\n- 16 -\nin the fast evolving fintech sector. In addition, the private sector is continuing to actively\nexperiment with a variety of different approaches to the connectivity question and may itself\nmove toward one or more widely accepted standards. Accordingly, efforts to craft approaches\nthat enhance connectivity while mitigating the associated risks will likely benefit from the\nengagement of multiple agencies, along with input from the private sector and other\nstakeholders.\nSeparately, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is responsible\nfor administering national bank charters, has announced that it is exploring offering “special\npurpose national bank charters” to fintech companies.34 As envisioned by the OCC, obtaining a\nspecial purpose charter would have the practical effect of allowing certain fintech companies\n(companies that make loans, make payments, or accept deposits) to potentially bypass the need\nfor connecting to a bank for certain purposes in favor of becoming licensed as banks themselves.\nThe OCC’s proposal raises interpretive and policy issues for the Federal Reserve regarding\nwhether charter recipients would become Federal Reserve members or have access to Federal\nReserve accounts and services, such as direct access to payment systems. If the OCC proposal is\nfinalized, the Federal Reserve would have to closely analyze these issues with respect to any\nfintech firms that express an interest in moving forward with an application.\nWhen Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, who could have predicted that it would net\nbillions from a game like Pokémon Go, which involved no investment, development, or\nadvertising on Apple’s part beyond opening its platform to developers?

We need only look back a decade to see the dramatic\ndamage from financial vulnerabilities that increase unchecked: Millions of Americans\nlost their livelihoods and their homes, business losses and failures rose, and the\ngovernment had to provide extraordinary support to the system. Since then, financial\nsector resilience has strengthened, and household balance sheets have been repaired over\nthe course of a lengthy recovery. Today employment is strong, inflation is around target,\nand incomes are growing.1\nIf we learned anything from this experience, it is that we must be especially\nvigilant to safeguard the resilience of our financial system in good times when\nvulnerabilities may be building. That is why the Federal Reserve actively monitors the\npotential vulnerabilities to the financial system. Last week, for the first time, we released\nour assessment in the Financial Stability Report.2 Today I will offer a brief summary of\nthe outlook, highlight areas where I see financial imbalances building, and touch on the\nimplications for policy.\nSustaining the Expansion\nDomestic economic momentum has been strong, as evidenced by the labor\nmarket. With the November data, monthly payroll gains have averaged 170,000 over the\npast 3 months, well above the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force.\nThe share of the prime-age population (people ages 25 to 54) that is working is closing in\non its pre-crisis level. By most measures, wages have accelerated over the past year and\n1 I am grateful to Michael Kiley and Namirembe Mukasa for their assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Board of Governors (2018).\n\n- 2 -\nare now growing around 3 percent, the highest level since the crisis. These are welcome\ndevelopments.\nWhile the most recent reading on core personal consumption expenditures, or\nPCE, inflation ticked down, indicators of underlying trend inflation remain encouraging\noverall, providing little signal of an outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand,\nand reassurance that underlying trend inflation may be close to our target of 2 percent, on\nthe other (figure 1).\nThe economy has grown 3 percent over the past year, and there are good reasons\nto expect growth to remain solid next year, supported by the strong underlying\nmomentum in domestic demand. Consumer spending looks to be robust going into the\nfourth quarter, and ongoing gains in income and employment provide positive\nfundamentals. In addition, business investment should be solid, even with recent declines\nin oil prices. Sizable fiscal stimulus has provided an important boost to demand this year\nand will likely contribute somewhat further next year, given the usual lags in outlays and\nin the effects of tax cuts on business and household spending.\nThe most likely path for the economy is positive, although some tailwinds that\nhave provided a boost are fading, and we may face some crosscurrents. The global\ngrowth that provided a strong tailwind going into this year has moderated. The earlier\nstrong growth in Europe and Japan appears to be softening toward trend. China is\nshifting to an accommodative policy stance to contend with a challenging trade\nenvironment and lagged effects from its earlier tightening. Here at home, the impetus to\ngrowth from fiscal policy is likely to fade going into 2020. And after being exceptionally\naccommodative, financial conditions have tightened in recent months. Financial\n\n- 3 -\nconditions are still supportive of growth by many measures (figure 2), but less so than\nlast year.\nThere are risks on both sides of the economy’s likely path. In Europe, there are\nrisks associated with deliberations over Italy’s fiscal and debt trajectory and the United\nKingdom’s deliberations on the Brexit deal. Here at home, we hear from businesses that\nthe uncertainty associated with trade policy and the implications for supply chains may\nweigh on business capital spending. Although it is reasonable to expect fiscal spending\nto be extended around current levels in real terms after the Bipartisan Budget Act expires,\nwe cannot rule out that fiscal policy could become a headwind in 2020.\nThe risks are two-sided. Business contacts report difficulties finding qualified\nworkers and increased costs associated with inputs, tariffs, and transportation, along with\nsomewhat greater ability to pass through those increases to consumer prices. Despite\nthis, however, inflation remains muted overall. At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is\nat its lowest level in 49 years, and payrolls have been growing well above the pace that is\nconsistent with labor market stabilization. Historically, the few periods when resource\nutilization has been similarly tight have seen elevated risks of either accelerating inflation\nor financial imbalances.\nOur goal now is to sustain the expansion by maintaining the economy around full\nemployment and inflation around target. The gradual path of increases in the federal\nfunds rate has served us well by giving us time to assess the effects of policy as we have\nproceeded. That approach remains appropriate in the near term, although the policy path\nincreasingly will depend on how the outlook evolves.\n\n- 4 -\nAssessing Vulnerabilities over the Cycle\nThe last several times resource utilization approached levels similar to today,\nsigns of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in accelerating\ninflation. In contrast to the past, the Federal Reserve now has a systematic forward-\nlooking approach to identifying increases in financial vulnerabilities. This monitoring is\nthe focus of regular Federal Reserve Board and Federal Open Market Committee\ndiscussions. Last week, the Board released its first Financial Stability Report to help\ninform the public and promote transparency and accountability as we carry out our\nfinancial stability responsibilities.\nWhile there has been substantial progress on reducing household debt burdens\nand increasing the resilience of the banking system, the Federal Reserve’s assessment\nsuggests that financial vulnerabilities associated with corporate debt are building against\na backdrop of elevated risk appetite. Let me briefly review these developments in turn.\nIn contrast to the years preceding the crisis, when household borrowing was\ngrowing at a pace far above that of gross domestic product (GDP), it has since come\ndown and is now growing more slowly than the economy overall (figure 3). Moreover,\nwhile much of the increase before the crisis reflected borrowing that proved\nunsustainable, more recent borrowing has been concentrated among households with\nstrong credit profiles.\nThe regulated financial sector is also more resilient, owing to far-reaching reforms\nas well as favorable conditions. Large banks have increased both the size and quality of\ntheir capital buffers: The ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets at large banks\nhas increased by half relative to the pre-crisis average. It is now close to levels seen at\n\n- 5 -\nsmaller banks, although the risk-weighted capital ratio at large banks has moved down\nsomewhat over the past year (figure 4). In addition, insurers appear generally well\ncapitalized; broker-dealers, including those not affiliated with large bank holding\ncompanies, have reduced their leverage; and the outstanding values of funding vehicles\nthat embed significant leverage, such as certain securitized products, are much lower. In\ncontrast, there has been some evidence of rising use of leverage by hedge funds over the\npast year and a half.\nFinancial reform has reduced funding risks associated with banks and money\nmarket funds. Large banks subject to liquidity regulation rely less on unstable short-term\nwholesale funding and have thicker liquidity buffers. As a result of money market\nreforms, investors have migrated toward government-only funds, which pose low run\nrisk, and away from prime institutional funds, which proved highly susceptible to runs\nduring the crisis and required extraordinary government support (figure 5).\nIn contrast, we are seeing elevated vulnerabilities in the nonfinancial business\nsector.3 Business borrowing has risen more rapidly than GDP for much of the current\nexpansion and now sits near its historical peak (figure 6). The run-up in corporate debt\nhas brought the ratio of debt to assets close to its highest level in two decades on an\noverall basis, and this is also true for speculative-grade and unrated firms (figure 7). And\nwhereas previously, mostly high-earning firms with relatively low leverage were taking\non additional debt, analysis of detailed balance sheet information indicates that, over the\npast year, firms with high leverage, high interest expense ratios, and low earnings and\n3 In addition to the discussion of vulnerabilities presented in the Board’s Financial Stability Report, the\nincrease in risks associated with nonfinancial corporate borrowing is highlighted in the fall 2018 report\nSemiannual Risk Perspective, produced by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. See Office of the\nComptroller (2018).\n\n- 6 -\ncash holdings have been increasing their debt loads the most. Historically, high leverage\nhas been linked to elevated financial distress and retrenchment by businesses in economic\ndownturns.\nRegarding corporate bonds outstanding, recent years have witnessed little change\nin the relative shares of investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds. Credit quality has\ndeteriorated within the investment-grade segment, where the share of bonds rated at the\nlowest investment-grade level has reached near-record levels. As of mid-2018, around 35\npercent of corporate bonds outstanding were at the lowest end of the investment-grade\nsegment, which amounts to about $2-1/4 trillion. In comparison, the share of high-yield\nbonds outstanding that are rated “deep junk” has stayed flat at about one-third from 2015\nto 2018, well below the financial crisis peak of 45 percent.\nIn an economic downturn, widespread downgrades of these low-rated investment-\ngrade bonds to speculative-grade ratings could induce some investors to sell them\nrapidly--for instance, because lower-rated bonds have higher regulatory capital\nrequirements or because bond funds have limits on the share of non-investment-grade\nbonds they hold. This concern may be higher now than in the past, since total assets\nunder management in bond mutual funds have more than doubled in the past decade to\nabout $2.3 trillion this year. These funds now hold about one-tenth of the corporate bond\nmarket, and the redemption behavior of investors in these funds during a market\ncorrection is unclear. Bond sales could lead to large changes in bond prices and overall\nfinancial conditions if technological, market, or regulatory factors contribute to strains on\nmarket liquidity--a possibility that has been relatively untested over the course of the\nexpansion.\n\n- 7 -\nFurther down the credit quality ladder, there has been sizable growth in leveraged\nlending, accompanied by a notable deterioration in underwriting standards. Net issuance\nof debt to risky borrowers, which had stopped growing in late 2016, rebounded over the\npast year. Leveraged loans outstanding rose about 12 percent over the past 12 months\nand now stand around $1 trillion overall.4\nWhile leveraged loans have traditionally had important investor protections, loan\ncovenants for new leveraged loans have weakened dramatically. Covenant-lite, or cov-\nlite, transactions now represent roughly 80 percent of the entire leveraged lending\nmarket--up from less than 30 percent a decade ago, when they were associated primarily\nwith stronger borrowers. Deals increasingly involve features that increase opacity and\nrisk, such as less subordinated debt; “EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation, and amortization) add backs,” which could inflate the projected capacity of\nthe borrowers to repay their loans; and “incremental facilities,” which allow additional\nborrowing that is of equal seniority with the existing bank loan.5 The share of newly\nissued large loans to corporations with high leverage (debt to EBITDA ratios above 6)\nnow exceeds previous peak levels observed in 2007 and 2014 (figure 8). Previously,\nmuch of this deterioration in underwriting appeared to be concentrated among nonbank\nlenders, but this year has witnessed a deterioration in underwriting at the largest banks.\n4 Estimates vary. The estimate of about $1 trillion in the Board’s Financial Stability Report excludes\nlending to financial companies and generally excludes loan commitments by banks. The S&P Global\nLeveraged Loan Index is around $1.3 trillion. The estimate of $2.2 trillion in the Bank of England’s\nFinancial Stability Report is for the global market, including bank loans.\n5 An “add back” is an unusual, discretionary, or nonrecurring expense that is added back to earnings with\nthe intent of normalizing EBITDA. Examples include legal expenses, insurance costs, or owner-related\nexpenses.\n\n- 8 -\nThe widening adoption of practices that make risk harder to measure suggests a\nheightened focus on industry risk-management practices is warranted.6\nA substantial share of the leveraged loans are packaged in collateralized loan\nobligations (CLOs). Gross issuance of CLOs hit $71 billion in the first half of 2018.\nThis pace represents an increase of about one-third compared with the same period in the\nprevious year.7\nMany large banks are engaged in the origination of leveraged loans with an intent\nto distribute, often to CLOs. The originate-to-distribute model exposes banks to pipeline\nrisk--the risk that some originated loans may be difficult to distribute if market conditions\ndeteriorate. Although banks have improved pipeline management over the past decade,\nrisk-management practices may have weakened somewhat recently in the face of strong\ninvestor demand. The direct exposures of the banking system, in the form of loan\nportfolios and warehousing exposures, can be tracked. But there are also indirect\nexposures, including through bank investments in CLOs on the order of $90 billion, that\nbear vigilance. More broadly, bank lines to the nonbank financial sector have increased\nnotably (figure 9).\nLoan funds have also become increasingly important in the leveraged loan market\nand are estimated to purchase about one-fifth of newly originated leveraged loans. If\nprices were to move sharply lower, a rush to redeem shares by open-ended mutual fund\ninvestors could lead to large sales of their relatively illiquid holdings, further\nexacerbating price declines and run incentives.\n6 For a recent discussion of developments informed by the Federal Reserve’s supervisory work, particularly\nthrough its review of the Shared National Credit program, see Vermilyea (2018).\n7 For a recent comparison of the subprime mortgage market and the global market for leveraged loans, see\nBank of England (2018).\n\n- 9 -\nTo date, the default rate on leveraged loans has been at the low end of its\nhistorical range, and corporate credit conditions have been favorable, with low interest\nexpenses and low expected default rates. However, if spreads rise sharply or economic\nconditions deteriorate significantly, we could see downgrades, refinancing challenges,\nrising delinquencies and defaults, and losses to investors.\nIt is thus particularly notable that the run-up in business debt occurred against a\nbackdrop of generally elevated valuations (figure 10). Even with the recent volatility in\nequity markets and the recent widening of corporate bond spreads, a range of asset prices\nremain high relative to historical benchmarks. In particular, yields on high-yield\ncorporate bonds relative to Treasury securities remain somewhat narrow on a historical\nbasis despite recent increases. Similarly, although they have moved up in recent months,\nspreads on leveraged loans remain in the low end of their range since the financial crisis,\nwhich is notable given the evidence of weakening protections. Finally, capitalization\nrates on commercial real estate properties, which measure annual income relative to\nprices for recently transacted properties, have been low relative to Treasury yields.\nThe generally high appetite for risk that we saw over the past two years makes the\nequity, corporate debt, and other asset markets more vulnerable to swings in market\nsentiment. In addition to generating losses for investors, declines in valuations could\nmake it more challenging for firms to obtain or extend financing--especially among risky,\nindebted firms--which in turn could be amplified by the high levels of risky corporate\ndebt.\n\n- 10 -\nCalibrating Policy over the Cycle\nThe assessment of financial vulnerabilities that I have outlined naturally raises the\nfollowing question for policymakers: What is the appropriate risk tolerance? It goes\nwithout saying we must take all appropriate steps to prevent another Great Financial\nCrisis from causing the greatest contraction in global economic activity since the Great\nDepression. But it is also worth remembering that financial imbalances played a key role\nin each of the past three U.S. downturns--the risky investments and maturity mismatches\nassociated with the savings and loan crisis and junk bond collapse; the tech boom and\nbust; and, most dramatically, the subprime crisis. This suggests policy might seek to\nmoderate financial vulnerabilities when they are likely to materially exacerbate an\neconomic downturn, leading to deeper declines in output and higher levels of\nunemployment.\nEach of the past three U.S. recessions featured important financial imbalances,\nalthough they differed in important ways. Both economic theory and econometric\nevidence point to the risk that excesses in corporate debt markets could similarly amplify\nadverse shocks and contribute to job losses.8 The economics are straightforward. Over-\nindebted businesses may face payment strains when earnings fall unexpectedly, and they\nmay respond by pulling back on employment and investment. The slowdown in activity\nlowers investor demand for risky assets, thereby raising spreads and depressing\nvaluations. In turn, business losses accumulate, and delinquencies and defaults rise,\nreducing the willingness or the ability of banks to lend. This dynamic feeds on itself,\n8 For example, López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek (2017) present empirical evidence linking corporate debt\nexcesses to contractions in U.S. economic activity and review related research.\n\n- 11 -\npotentially amplifying moderate adverse shocks into more serious financial strains or a\nrecession.9\nGiven the risks to the financial system and economy from this potential adverse\nfeedback loop, a strong case can be made that the financial system’s buffers should be\nfortified when the economy is strong. Reinforcing capital buffers during the strong part\nof the cycle means that banks will have a cushion to absorb losses and remain sound\nduring a subsequent downturn. Thicker capital buffers help bolster the confidence of\nmarket participants when conditions deteriorate, helping prevent the downward spiral\nfrom a loss of confidence. And during the downturn, that extra buffer can be released to\nenable banks to continue lending and help mitigate its severity. History suggests that we\nshould not expect the market to provide incentives for banks to build the necessary\nbuffers when times are good; the essence of the cycle is that market sentiment become\noverconfident precisely when risk is actually highest. One of the roles for independent\nregulatory bodies such as the Federal Reserve is to serve as a counterweight. Moreover,\nas we saw in the last crisis, it is much costlier to rebuild capital in a downturn when\nearnings and risk appetite are low than to build buffers in an expansion when earnings are\nstrong.\nAt the Federal Reserve, the two important tools that can respond somewhat to\nrising vulnerabilities are the design of stress-test scenarios and the countercyclical capital\nbuffer (CCyB). The annual supervisory stress test examines the resilience of large bank\nholding companies to a severely adverse scenario, which includes salient risks that can be\n9 The broad contours of this dynamic are laid out theoretically in the literature on the financial accelerator.\nThe classic reference is Bernanke and Gertler (1989).\n\n- 12 -\nadjusted over time. In recent years, the scenarios have been designed to explore severe\ndislocations in corporate credit markets as a salient risk.\nNonetheless, the stress tests have limitations as a countercyclical tool during\nbuoyant periods. For instance, while the severity of the stresses can be varied from year\nto year to address emerging risks to some degree, it is difficult to introduce entirely new\nscenarios each year to target specific sectoral risks without introducing excessive\ncomplexity.10 And while the stress tests and proposed stress capital buffer are designed\nto calibrate capital buffers for the riskiness of an institution’s particular assets and\nexposures, the capital buffer does not vary systematically to counter the cyclicality that\narises through elevated asset valuations and other channels.11 The limited ability of the\nstress tests to increase loss-absorbing capacity during buoyant economic times is\nillustrated in the results from recent years, where scenarios have involved increasingly\nsevere recessions and strains in corporate debt markets but generally lower declines in\ncapital ratios. More broadly, capital ratios at the largest banks have been flat and, more\nrecently, modestly lower.\nIn contrast, the first goal of the CCyB is to directly build resilience at large bank\nholding companies when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often\nfollow periods of credit growth or rapid asset price appreciation. The second goal of the\nCCyB is to promote a more sustainable supply of credit over the economic cycle. The\nCCyB is expected to be reduced as credit growth slows in order to support credit supply\nat times when it might otherwise contract. As a rough rule of thumb, the criteria for\n10 For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s framework for designing scenarios, see Board of Governors\n(2013).\n11 See Brainard (2014).\n\n- 13 -\nimplementing the CCyB described in the Board’s framework of September 2016 are\ncalibrated so that the CCyB will be above its minimum value of zero about one-third of\nthe time--when financial vulnerabilities are assessed to be in the upper one-third of their\nhistorical distribution.12\nThere are several potential advantages to building additional resilience through\nthe CCyB. First, countercyclical capital requirements are intended to lean against rising\nrisks at a time when the degree of monetary tightening needed to achieve the same goal\ncould be inconsistent with sustaining the expansion. And countercyclical capital\nrequirements build resilience, unlike monetary policy. Second, the banks that are subject\nto the CCyB could achieve a modest buffer simply by safeguarding the capital they have\nbuilt up or by reducing payouts moderately. Third, the CCyB is a simple, predictable,\nand slow-moving tool that applies equally across all large banks. It does not single out\nshortfalls in particular banks or result in hard-to-predict volatility in individual banks’\nstressed capital requirements. Finally and critically, the additional capital implied by the\nCCyB across the system can be released when conditions deteriorate to ensure the ability\nof large banks to lend into a downturn. A number of countries have raised their CCyB\nsetting above zero, and we can learn from their experiences, which have generally been\npositive.13\nConclusion\nOur job now is to sustain the expansion by maintaining the economy around full\nemployment and inflation near target. Recent history suggests that the business cycle and\n12 See Board of Governors (2016) and Brainard (2018a and 2018b).\n13 Basel Committee (2018) reports the setting of the CCyB across countries.\n\n- 14 -\nthe financial cycle are increasingly intertwined. If history is any guide, as resource\nutilization continues to tighten, there is some risk that financial imbalances could grow.\nThe U.S. financial system is much more resilient than before the crisis, owing\nimportantly to strong financial reforms. Even so, the banking system’s core capital and\nliquidity buffers have yet to be tested through a full cycle. At the same time, the appetite\nfor risk among financial market participants rose notably over 2017 and much of 2018,\nand corporate borrowing has reached new heights amid rapid growth and deteriorating\nunderwriting standards in riskier segments, such as leveraged lending. The mutual funds\nthat have built up exposure to some of this risky debt have liquidity mismatches that\ncould contribute to market dislocations in stressed conditions. This constellation of\nvulnerabilities could amplify adverse shocks that might materialize. At a time when\ncyclical pressures have been building and bank profitability has been strong, it might be\nprudent to ask large banking organizations to fortify their capital buffers, which could\nsubsequently be released if conditions warrant.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nBank of England (2018).

After several decades in which supply was\nhighly elastic and inflation was low and relatively stable, a series of supply shocks associated\nwith the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine have contributed to high inflation, in\ncombination with a very rapid recovery in demand. The experience with the pandemic and the\nwar highlights the challenges for monetary policy in responding to a protracted series of adverse\nsupply shocks. In addition, to the extent that the lower elasticity of supply we have seen recently\ncould become more common due to challenges such as demographics, deglobalization, and\nclimate change, it could herald a shift to an environment characterized by more volatile inflation\ncompared with the preceding few decades.1\nInflation in the United States and many countries around the world is very high (figure 1).\nWhile both demand and supply are contributing to high inflation, it is the relative inelasticity of\nsupply in key sectors that most clearly distinguishes the pandemic- and war-affected period of\nthe past three years from the preceding 30 years of the Great Moderation.2 Interestingly,\n1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text and to Kenneth\nEva for preparing the figures. This text updates the views that I discussed as part of a panel at the BIS Annual\nMeeting on June 24, 2022. These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Research has generated a range of estimates on the contributions from supply and demand factors. For example,\nShapiro (2022) finds that demand factors are responsible for about one-third of the surge in inflation above the pre-\npandemic trend, while di Giovanni and others (2022) find a number closer to two-thirds. See Adam Shapiro (2022),\n“How Much Do Supply and Demand Drive Inflation?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2022-15 (San Francisco: Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco, June), https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2022/june/how-much-do-supply-and-demand-drive-inflation; and Julian di Giovanni, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan,\nAlvaro Silva, and Muhammed Yildirim (2022), “Global Supply Chain Pressures, International Trade, and Inflation,”\npaper presented at the ECB Forum on Central Banking 2022, Sintra, Portugal, June 27–29,\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/conferences/ecbforum/shared/pdf/2022/Kalemli-Oezcan_paper.pdf.\n\ninflation is broadly higher throughout much of the global economy, and even jurisdictions that\nbegan raising rates forcefully in 2021 have not stemmed the global inflationary tide.3\nIn the United States, as a result of significant fiscal and monetary support, the level of\nprivate domestic final purchases recovered extremely rapidly in 2020 and 2021 to levels\nconsistent with the pre-pandemic trend before moving below trend in 2022 (figure 2). Although\ndemand came in near the pre-pandemic trend on an aggregate level, the pandemic induced a shift\nin composition that concentrated large increases in demand in certain sectors where the supply\nresponse was constrained. The shift in consumption from services to goods was so pronounced\nthat—despite plunging at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020—real spending on goods had\nalready risen nearly 4 percent above its pre-pandemic trend by June of that year. While a very\nslow rotation back toward pre-pandemic patterns of consumption has been under way for over a\nyear, it remains incomplete more than two and a half years after the initial shutdown: In the\nmost recent data, the level of goods spending remains 6 percent above the level implied by its\npre-pandemic trend, while services spending remains a little more than 2 percent below its pre-\npandemic trend (figure 3).\nThe supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities have been accompanied by\nunusually high volatility in monthly inflation readings since the beginning of the pandemic.\nSince March 2020, the standard deviation of month-over-month core inflation has been 0.22\npercentage point—a level of variation not seen in a 31-month period since the 1970s and more\nthan double the standard deviation in monthly core inflation from 1990 to 2019. The initial\n3 The median year-to-date total policy rate hike within the group of Brazil, Hungary, New Zealand, Norway, Peru,\nPoland, and South Korea is 6 percentage points. All of these countries began forceful rate hikes in 2021, and the\ncumulative hikes have taken policy rates in some of these countries above 10 percent. Despite this, through\nSeptember 2022 core inflation in these countries was 9.5 percent year-over-year, rising 3.5 percentage points since\nMarch. See Economist (2022), “Even Super-Tight Policy Is Not Bringing Down Inflation,” October 28,\nhttps://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/23/even-super-tight-policy-is-not-bringing-down-\ninflation.\n\ndrivers of this high variation in monthly core inflation readings were a sharp drop in prices and\nsubsequent bounceback in the first months of the pandemic, followed by a couple of bursts\nlasting three to four months each. The first burst occurred around reopening in the spring of\n2021, and the second occurred amid the effects of the Delta and Omicron COVID-19 variants in\nthe autumn of 2021 (figure 4).4\nThe evidence suggests that high concentrations of demand in sectors such as appliances,\nhousing, and motor vehicles—where supply was constrained by the effects of the pandemic—\nplayed an important role initially in generating inflationary pressures. Acute constraints on\nshipping and on the supply of nonsubstitutable intermediate inputs like semiconductors were\ncompounded by acute constraints on labor supply associated with the effects of the Delta and\nOmicron variants and later compounded further by sharp commodities supply shocks associated\nwith Russia’s war on Ukraine.\nThe standard monetary policy prescription is to “look through” supply shocks, such as\ncommodities price shocks or shutdowns of ports or semiconductor plants, that are not assessed to\nleave a lasting imprint on potential output.5 In contrast, if supply shocks durably lower potential\noutput such that the economy is operating above potential, monetary policy tightening is\nnecessary to bring demand into alignment with the economy’s reduced productive capacity.\n4 Pandemic fiscal measures played an important role in boosting demand, but the rapid deceleration of inflation over\nthe summer of 2021 and subsequent rebound in inflation from October through the end of the year do not line up\nwell with the fiscal demand impulse projected by most forecasters. For example, the Brookings Institution projected\na smooth demand impulse from the American Rescue Plan that peaked at the end of last year. See Wendy Edelberg\nand Louise Sheiner (2021), “The Macroeconomic Implications of Biden’s $1.9 Trillion Fiscal Package,” Brookings\nInstitution, Up Front (blog), January 28, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/01/28/the-macroeconomic-\nimplications-of-bidens-1-9-trillion-fiscal-package.\n5 See, for instance, Martin Bodenstein, Christopher J. Erceg, and Luca Guerrieri (2008), “Optimal Monetary Policy\nwith Distinct Core and Headline Inflation Rates,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 55 (October), pp. S18–33.\n\nImportantly, and separately from the implications for potential output, monetary policy should\nrespond strongly if supply shocks risk de-anchoring inflation expectations.6\nAlthough these tenets of monetary policy sound relatively straightforward in theory, they\nare challenging to assess and implement in practice. It is difficult to assess potential output and\nthe output gap in real time, as has been extensively documented by research.7 This is especially\ntrue in an environment of high uncertainty. The level of uncertainty around the output gap varies\nconsiderably over time, and research suggests that more muted policy reactions are warranted\nwhen uncertainty about the output gap is high.8 The unexpectedly long-lasting global pandemic\nand the sharp disruptions to commodities associated with Russia’s war against Ukraine have\ncontributed to substantial uncertainty (figure 5).\nEven so, the drawn-out sequence of shocks to the supply of labor, commodities, and key\nintermediate inputs, such as semiconductors, blurred the lines about what constitutes a temporary\nshock as opposed to a persistent shock to potential output. Even when each individual supply\nshock fades over time and behaves like a temporary shock on its own, a drawn-out sequence of\nadverse supply shocks that has the cumulative effect of constraining potential output for an\nextended period is likely to call for monetary policy tightening to restore balance between\ndemand and supply.\n6 Ricardo Reis makes the case that both these factors would have prescribed tighter policy in the current\nenvironment. See Ricardo Reis (2022), “The Burst of High Inflation in 2021–22: How and Why Did We Get\nHere?” CEPR Discussion Paper Series DP17514 (London: Centre for Economic Policy Research, July),\nhttps://cepr.org/publications/dp17514.\n7 See Athanasios Orphanides and Simon van Norden (2002), “The Unreliability of Output-Gap Estimates in Real\nTime,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 84 (November), pp. 569–83.\n8 For discussions of the time-varying nature of output gap uncertainty, see Travis J. Berge (2020), “Time-Varying\nUncertainty of the Federal Reserve’s Output Gap Estimate,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-012\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February; revised April 2021),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.012r1; and Rochelle M. Edge and Jeremy B. Rudd (2016), “Real-Time\nProperties of the Federal Reserve’s Output Gap,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 98 (October), pp. 785–91.\nFor a discussion of tempering the policy response to the output gap in response to increased uncertainty, see\nAthanasios Orphanides (2003), “Monetary Policy Evaluation with Noisy Information,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics, vol. 50 (April), pp. 605–31.\n\nIn addition, a protracted series of supply shocks associated with an extended period of\nhigh inflation—as with the pandemic and the war—risks pushing the inflation expectations of\nhouseholds and businesses above levels consistent with the central bank’s long-run inflation\nobjective.9 It is vital for monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored, because\ninflation expectations shape the behavior of households, businesses, and workers and enter\ndirectly into the inflation process. In the presence of a protracted series of supply shocks and\nhigh inflation, it is important for monetary policy to take a risk-management posture to avoid the\nrisk of inflation expectations drifting above target. Even in the presence of pandemics and wars,\ncentral bankers have the responsibility to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly\nanchored at levels consistent with our target.\nIn monitoring inflation expectations for purposes of risk management, not only the\nmedian but also the distribution of inflation expectations can provide important information\nabout how inflation expectations may be changing.10 Survey measures suggest that the median\nof longer-term inflation has remained within pre-pandemic ranges consistent with 2 percent\ninflation (figure 6). However, starting in 2021, there has been a greater dispersion than usual of\nviews about future inflation in survey responses, as shown in figure 6. Although initially the\nincreased dispersion reflected a rise in expectations for significantly above-target inflation, more\n9 For two recent examples of assessing longer-term inflation expectations, see Michael T. Kiley (2022), “Anchored\nor Not: How Much Information Does 21st Century Data Contain on Inflation Dynamics?” Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2022-016 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2022.016; and Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, Francesca Loria, and David López-Salido\n(2022), “Is Trend Inflation at Risk of Becoming Unanchored? The Role of Inflation Expectations,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 31), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-\n7172.3043.\n10 See, for example, Ricardo Reis (2021), “Losing the Inflation Anchor,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 307–61, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15985-BPEA-BPEA-\nFA21_WEB_Reis.pdf. The Board’s staff recently updated the Index of Common Inflation Expectations to include\nthe 25th and 75th percentiles of inflation expectations over the next 12 months from the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers.\n\nrecently, following substantial cumulative monetary policy tightening, the increased dispersion\nhas also reflected increased expectations of no inflation or even disinflation. About one-fourth\nof respondents to the most recent University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers anticipate that\nprices are likely to be the same or below their current level 5 to 10 years in the future—roughly\nthree times the average fraction that reported such expectations before the pandemic.\nFinally, it is important to explore whether any features of the inelastic supply response\nassociated with the pandemic and the war may have implications for potential growth and\nmacroeconomic stability in the future.11 In particular, despite the unprecedented pandemic\npolicy support for businesses of all sizes that was directed at preserving the supply side of the\neconomy, key sectors struggled to ramp up activity after reopening. The supply response was\nparticularly impaired in sectors where supply chains are geographically fragmented and recurring\nforeign COVID-19 lockdowns have reduced the reliability of foreign supplies. While conditions\nhave improved dramatically from some of the worst periods in 2021, measures like the Global\nSupply Chain Pressure Index from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate that total\nsupply chain pressures still are elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels (figure 7).\nThe supply disruptions in key goods and commodities sectors associated with the\npandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine have highlighted the fragility of global supply chains\nand the risks of inelastic supply at moments of stress. Conditions have improved dramatically\nover the past year, judging by the return of the ISM Supplier Deliveries index to its pre-\npandemic range of values (figure 8). That said, ongoing discussions about moving from “just in\ntime” to “just in case” inventory management and from offshoring to “nearshoring” are raising\n11 See, for example, Agustín Carstens (2022), “The Return of Inflation,” speech delivered at the International Center\nfor Monetary and Banking Studies, Geneva, April 5, https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp220405.htm.\n\nimportant questions about the extent to which businesses are likely to reconfigure global supply\nchains based on a reassessment of the tradeoff between cost efficiency and supply resilience.\nSimilarly, some have conjectured that the slow and incomplete recovery of the workforce\nover the course of the pandemic may be the beginning of a longer-term change in labor supply\ndynamics (figure 9).12 In addition, the potential for more frequent and severe climate events, as\nwe are already seeing, and for frictions in the energy transition could also lead to greater\nvolatility of supply. Together, a combination of forces—the deglobalization of supply chains,\nthe higher frequency and severity of climate disruptions, and demographic shifts—could lead to\na period of lower supply elasticity and greater inflation volatility.\nTo conclude, the experience with the pandemic and the war highlights challenges for\nmonetary policy in responding to supply shocks. A protracted series of adverse supply shocks\ncould persistently weigh on potential output or could risk pushing inflation expectations above\ntarget in ways that call for monetary policy to tighten for risk-management reasons. More\nspeculatively, it is possible that longer-term changes—such as those associated with labor\nsupply, deglobalization, and climate change—could reduce the elasticity of supply and increase\ninflation volatility into the future.\n12 See, for example, Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan (2020), The Great Demographic Reversal: Ageing\nSocieties, Waning Inequality, and an Inflation Revival (Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan).\n\nFigure 1.

The economy continues to make\nwelcome progress, but the Delta variant has been more disruptive than initially expected.\nThe headwinds from Delta are a reminder that the virus continues to pose downside risks\nto the outlook. Delta highlights the importance of being attentive to economic outcomes\nand not getting too attached to an outlook that may get buffeted by evolving virus\nconditions.\nIndeed, Delta disrupted both demand and supply. Many forecasters have\ndowngraded consumer spending in the second half of the year, as Delta has limited the\nacceleration in services spending that had been anticipated to help offset the drag on\nactivity from fiscal support shifting from being a tailwind to a headwind. Although the\nretail sales print for August was stronger than expected, the level of spending in August\nwas not much changed from June. High-frequency data indicate that consumption of\ndiscretionary services, such as restaurants and travel, stalled or may have even moved\nlower in some categories since July. This development doesn’t appear to be sensitive to\nregional variations in vaccinations, perhaps reflecting the high transmissibility of Delta.\nFor example, the consumption of food services has declined recently even in states with\nrelatively high vaccination rates and low case counts.2\n1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nviews are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n2 Reflecting these trends, consumer confidence declined in the Michigan and Conference Board surveys in\nAugust. For more information on the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, see\nhttps://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/survey-info.php. For more information on the Conference Board Consumer\nConfidence Survey, see https://conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm.\n\n- 2 -\nDelta has also prolonged supply bottlenecks. Single-family home construction\npermits declined again in August for the third consecutive month despite very strong\nhousing demand, as builders faced shortages of materials. Auto production was paused at\na number of North American plants in early September following COVID-induced\nshutdowns of semiconductor production in Malaysia and Vietnam. Industry contacts\nhave highlighted the unusually low elasticity of global shipping such that COVID-\ninduced port closures in China ripple through the interdependencies in shipping supply\nchains and magnify backlogs.\nAll told, private sector forecasters have revised down growth projections for 2021\nover recent months by slightly more than 1 percentage point on average.3 Even with this\nDelta downgrade, I anticipate that growth this year and next will be sufficient such that\nby the end of next year, average annual growth since the onset of the crisis should exceed\npre-crisis trend growth.4 The strength of the recovery despite the unprecedented\nchallenges associated with COVID reflects powerful fiscal and monetary support and the\nresilience of American workers, businesses, and households.\nDelta has also slowed progress on employment. Payroll gains in leisure and\nhospitality unexpectedly fell to zero in August following average monthly gains of\n3 For example, between the June and September publications of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey,\nthe consensus estimate for real GDP growth in 2021 fell from 6.7 percent to 5.9 percent.

Delta-induced spending declines for travel,\nrecreation, and other discretionary services likely reduced the intensity with which\nemployers in these industries sought new hires. The data reported by “Indeed” show job\nopenings moving sideways from July through August before edging up again in early\nSeptember. Similarly, the number of households reporting in the Current Population\nSurvey that they were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business due\nto COVID ticked up in August after falling significantly through July.\nAs of the end of August, payroll employment remains over 5 million below pre-\nCOVID levels and nearly 8½ million below where it would have been in the absence of\nCOVID. Roughly one-third of the gap to pre-COVID employment levels is concentrated\nin the frontline leisure and hospitality sector.\nWhile the headline unemployment rate declined to 5.2 percent in August, the\nunemployment rate adjusted for COVID-related nonparticipation remained elevated at\n7.5 percent.5 The employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio for prime-age workers stood\nat 78 percent in August—2.4 percentage points below its pre-COVID level.6\nSo overall, the labor market is making progress, although at a slower pace than\nearlier in the year.7 Relative to December, payrolls have closed nearly 50 percent of their\n5 This alternative measure adjusts for the misclassification of some unemployed workers as employed but\nnot at work (as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and for diminished labor force participation\ninduced by the pandemic (as estimated by the Federal Reserve Board staff). Like the U-3 unemployment\nrate provided by the BLS, the adjusted rate is also at a post-pandemic low. This broader measure of labor\nmarket slack encompasses 12.8 million individuals in July 2021, as compared with the official 8.7 million\nunemployed workers reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n6 While the EPOP ratio has shown little net progress since April for white prime-age individuals, the EPOP\nratios for prime-age Black and Hispanic workers have remained well below that of white individuals but\nhave seen more consistent improvement in recent months, including a strong 0.7 percentage point\nimprovement for Black individuals in August.\n7 See Lael Brainard (2021), “Assessing Progress as the Economy Moves from Reopening to Recovery,”\nspeech delivered at “Rebuilding the Post-Pandemic Economy,” 2021 Annual Meeting of the Aspen\nEconomic Strategy Group, Aspen, Colo., July 30,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210730a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\ngap to pre-COVID levels and the prime-age EPOP ratio has closed around 40 percent of\nthe gap to pre-COVID conditions.8\nIn contrast, the labor force participation rate of 61.7 percent in August has shown\nlittle progress so far. Some observers argue that labor force participation has moved\npermanently lower, and the labor market is already tight, such that we should not expect a\nreturn to pre-COVID employment conditions. But the decline in labor force participation\nappears to reflect COVID-related constraints that have been prolonged by Delta rather\nthan permanent structural changes in the economy. For instance, the number of\nrespondents to the Census Household Pulse Survey indicating they were not working due\nto either being sick with COVID or caring for someone sick with COVID more than\ndoubled between late July and early September, returning to levels seen early this year.9\nWhile I am hopeful for improvements in the September employment report with\nthe return to in-person education, the effects of Delta have likely prolonged caregiving\nconstraints. For example, through last week there had been just over 2,000 school\nclosures for COVID across nearly 470 school districts in 39 states.10* While the\n8 The gap of payroll employment to pre-COVID trends is the gap between the current level of payroll\nemployment and the level that would have occurred had total nonfarm payrolls grown at a constant rate of\n168,000 per month (the average growth rate in 2019) beginning in March 2020. The references in this\nparagraph to percentages of gaps closed describe the fraction that remains in the current data of the\ndifference between pre-COVID conditions and the conditions that existed in December 2020. For example,\nthe unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February 2020 and 6.7 percent in December 2020, a gap of\n3.2 percentage points. In August, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, implying a gap to pre-COVID\nconditions in this metric of 1.7 percentage points, meaning that a little under 50 percent of the\n3.2 percentage point gap that existed in December 2020 had been closed by August 2021.\n9 The Census Bureau estimates that the number of non-employed individuals citing one of these factors as\ntheir main reason for not working rose from 2.0 million in wave 34 of the Household Pulse Survey\n(reflecting data collected from July 21 to August 2) to 4.7 million in wave 37 (reflecting September 1 to\nSeptember 13).

Some cite this ratio of job openings to job\nseekers as indicating we are close to full employment. But virus conditions may be\ndriving an important wedge between labor supply in the near term relative to the medium\nterm.\nIt is instructive to consider the period 2017 to 2019 when the V/U ratio remained\nin a tight range around a value of 1.2, similar to its July value. Although prime-age\nunemployment declined by less than half a percentage point over this period, that modest\n11 See, for example, Claire Cain Miller (2021), “‘Can’t Compete’: Why Hiring for Child Care Is a Huge\nStruggle,” New York Times, September 21, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/upshot/child-care.html.\n12 Recent research found that women with very young children, who accounted for 10 percent of the pre-\npandemic workforce, accounted for almost one-fourth of the unanticipated decline in employment during\nthe pandemic. See M. Melinda Pitts (2021), “Where Are They Now? Workers with Young Children\nduring COVID-19,” Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Policy Hub, No. 2021-10,\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/policy-hub/2021/09/01/10--where-are-\nthey-now--workers-with-young-children-during-covid-19.pdf. Previous research also indicates that\nparticipation for mothers in households with an annual income below $50,000 per year declined nearly\n9 percent relative to pre-pandemic levels, while participation for mothers in households with incomes\nabove $100,000 fell a little under 2 percent. For more information, see Olivia Lofton, Nicolas Petrosky-\nNadeau, and Lily Seitelman (2021), “Parents in a Pandemic Labor Market,” Working Paper Series 2021-04\n(San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, February), https://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/working-papers/2021/04.\n\n- 6 -\ndecline was accompanied by a 2 million increase in the prime-age labor force, which\nraised the prime-age EPOP ratio about 1½ percentage points.\nSo, the headline V/U ratio may not be as informative when there are substantial\nlags in the recovery of labor force participation. Lagging participation is likely to be\nparticularly important currently, in the presence of COVID constraints such as fears of\ncontracting the virus and caregiving responsibilities. While these constraints have been\nprolonged by the Delta variant, they are not permanent or structural. Therefore, it is more\ninformative to rely on a V/U ratio that adjusts the unemployment rate for pandemic-\nrelated nonparticipation and misclassification. After adjusting for pandemic-related\nnonparticipation, the ratio of job openings to job seekers was about 0.85 in July—nearly\none-third below the headline ratio—and similar to levels last seen between 2014 and\n2016—suggesting there is ample room for a full recovery in employment.13\nThe assertion that labor force participation has moved permanently lower as a\nresult of a downturn is not new. Indeed, it has been a regular feature of the early stages\nof recent recoveries. Research demonstrates that the labor force participation rate cycle\nlags that of the unemployment rate by years. So, it is important to consider indicators\nbeyond the headline unemployment rate when assessing progress toward maximum\nemployment, as participation gains might come late in the recovery for some groups.14\n13 The number of unemployed in this alternative V/U ratio adjusts for the misclassification of some\nunemployed workers as employed but not at work (as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and for\ndiminished labor force participation induced by the pandemic (as estimated by the Federal Reserve Board\nstaff). See footnote 5.\n14 See Tomaz Cajner, John Coglianese, and Joshua Montes (2021), “The Long-Lived Cyclicality of the\nLabor Force Participation Rate,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2021-047 (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2021.047.

Inflation is currently elevated. This is creating\nchallenges for consumers and businesses alike. But the high inflation readings from the\nspring and early summer were disproportionately driven by a few sectors experiencing\nspecific supply bottlenecks. In May and June, new and used vehicle prices accounted for\nhalf of the outsized monthly increases in core consumer price index (CPI) inflation.\nThese categories were lesser contributors in July, and in the August CPI their joint\ncontribution declined to essentially zero, as prices finally began to retreat for used cars,\noffsetting increases in new car prices.\nI am closely monitoring incoming data for any indications that the breadth of\ninflation pressures is rising. Twenty-four-month core personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation provides one approach to smoothing through the distortions from the\npandemic: It is estimated to have been 2.5 percent in August, above the 2 percent target,\nbut well below the 12-month measure. The Dallas trimmed mean inflation measure\nprovides another indicator of the breadth of inflation pressures: It came in at 2.0 percent\nin July—well below the 12-month measure of core PCE inflation.15\nThe currently elevated level of inflation is driven by COVID-related disruptions.\nAs these COVID-related disruptions subside, most forecasters expect inflation to move\nback down toward the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent long-run objective on its own. That is\nthe sense in which currently high inflation is likely to be transitory. In that regard, the\n15 The August 12-month weighted median CPI was 2.4 percent—less than half of the 12-month CPI reading\nin August of 5¼ percent—suggesting significant skew in the distribution of price changes in the CPI\nbasket. For more information on the weighted median CPI, see https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-\nresearch/indicators-and-data/median-cpi/background-and-resources.aspx.\n\n- 8 -\nAugust monthly CPI reading was the first month with a notable retrenchment among\nCOVID-sensitive categories like hotels, used cars, and rental cars.\nSo, I expect inflation to decelerate, and pre-COVID inflation dynamics to return\nwhen COVID disruptions dissipate. But with Delta disrupting the rotation from goods to\nservices and prolonging supply bottlenecks, it is uncertain just how fast and how much\ninflation will decelerate over the remainder of the year and into next year. Therefore, I\nam monitoring a few upside risks closely. First, while rent and owners’ equivalent rent\nboth rose a moderate 0.3 percent in the August CPI data, if housing services inflation\nmoved up substantially more than expected, it could provide durable upward pressure on\ninflation. Second, there is a risk that goods prices may not decelerate and return to pre-\nCOVID trends as is widely expected, for instance, if excess savings or disruptions to\nservices result in persistently elevated goods demand. Third, I will be watching for any\nsigns that wage gains are feeding into higher inflation more broadly, but the evidence so\nfar suggests that wage gains are broadly in line with productivity growth, and the labor\nshare of income remains low relative to historical levels. To date, high markups and non-\nwage input costs appear to be more notable contributors to inflation than wage pressures.\nFinally, I am vigilant for any signs that the current high level of inflation might\npush longer-term inflation expectations above levels consistent with our 2 percent\ninflation objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation suggest inflation\nexpectations remain well anchored. For instance, the five-year, five-year-forward CPI\ninflation compensation measure based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities has\n\n- 9 -\nremained range bound around 2.2 percent since declining about 0.2 percentage point in\nJune—consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent objective for PCE inflation.16\nSurvey-based measures also suggest longer-run expectations remain well\nanchored. Recent analysis of the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) concludes that\n“in August 2021 consumers’ five-year ahead inflation expectations were as well anchored\nas they were two years ago, before the start of the pandemic.”17 Longer-term inflation\nexpectations in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers have moved mostly\nsideways in the past four to five months, and the current reading of the Federal Reserve\nBoard index of common inflation expectations remains well within the range that\nprevailed before 2014. While one-year ahead measures in the SCE and the Michigan\nsurvey have seen large increases, these short-term measures tend to move with\nconsumers’ experience of contemporaneous inflation.\nSo what do these developments imply for the path ahead? One clear lesson is that\nwe need to be humble about our ability to correctly anticipate future economic conditions\ngiven the unpredictability of the virus. We had expected a smooth rotation from goods\nspending to services spending during a complete reopening this fall, but Delta has slowed\nthis process. Partly as a result, employment gains flatlined in August in the leisure and\nhospitality sector, where many of the job losses have occurred. As a result of Delta, the\nSeptember labor report may be weaker and less informative of underlying economic\nmomentum than I had hoped.\n16 The TIPS measure is based on CPI inflation, which generally runs a bit above PCE inflation.\n17 Olivier Armantier, Fatima Boumahdi, Leo Goldman, Gizem Koşar, Jessica Lu, Giorgio Topa, and\nWilbert van der Klaauw (2021), “Have Consumers’ Long-Run Inflation Expectations Become Un-\nAnchored?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics, September 24,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/09/have-consumers-long-run-inflation-expectations-\nbecome-un-anchored.\n\n- 10 -\nPayroll employment is now between 5 and 8½ million short of where it would be\nin the absence of the pandemic. The unemployment rate adjusted for pandemic-related\nnonparticipation is 7.5 percent. Employment is still a bit short of the mark on what I\nconsider to be substantial further progress. But if progress continues as I hope, it may\nsoon meet the mark.\nWhile inflation has been well above target for the past six months, affecting\nconsumers and businesses alike, it previously spent roughly a quarter century below 2\npercent. There are good reasons to expect a return to pre-COVID inflation dynamics due\nto the underlying structural features of a relatively flat Phillips curve, low equilibrium\ninterest rates, and low underlying trend inflation. While the playbook for guiding\ninflation back down to target following a moderate overshoot is well tested and effective,\nexperience suggests it is difficult to guide inflation up to target from below.\nOnce COVID constraints recede, I see no reason the labor market should not be as\nstrong or stronger than it was pre-pandemic. The forward guidance on maximum\nemployment and average inflation sets a much higher bar for the liftoff of the policy rate\nthan for slowing the pace of asset purchases. I would emphasize that no signal about the\ntiming of liftoff should be taken from any decision to announce a slowing of asset\npurchases. We have learned this summer that it is important to remain highly attentive to\nthe data and to avoid placing too much weight on an outlook that remains highly\nuncertain. In implementing policy step by step, we must remain faithful to our new\nframework and attentive to changing conditions in order to ensure sufficient momentum\nas fiscal tailwinds shift to headwinds to achieve our maximum employment and inflation\ngoals.",

We’re seeing a steady\nstream of announcements of new startups and partnerships, and consumers are\ndownloading fintech apps at an even faster pace.\nFinancial products, services, and transactions lend themselves to successive\nwaves of technological disruption because they can readily be represented as streams of\nnumerical information ripe for digitization. However, as technological tools used by the\nindustry change over time, it is important to keep sight of their impact on the public,\nwhether it be on families seeking to own their own home, seniors seeking financial\nsecurity, young adults seeking to invest in education and training, or small businesses\nattempting to smooth through volatile revenues and expenses.\nCurrent developments in the digitization of finance are important and deserving of\nserious and sustained engagement on the part of policymakers and regulators. The\nFederal Reserve Board has established a multi-disciplinary working group that is engaged\nin a 360-degree analysis of fintech innovation. We are bringing together the best\nthinking across the Federal Reserve System, spanning key areas of responsibility, from\nsupervision to community development, from financial stability to payments. As\npolicymakers, we want to facilitate innovation where it has the potential to yield public\nbenefit, while ensuring that risks are thoroughly understood and managed. That\norientation may have different implications in the arena of consumer and small business\nfinance, for instance, as compared with payment, clearing, and settlement in the\nwholesale financial markets.\n\n- 2 -\nTechnological and Organizational Changes in Payment, Clearing, and Settlement\nToday, I will focus on newly emerging distributed ledger technologies and related\nprotocols, which were inspired originally by Bitcoin, and their potentially important\napplications to payment, clearing, and settlement in the wholesale markets.\nSuccessive waves of technological advance have swept through payment,\nclearing, and settlement over the past two centuries. In the 19th century, railroads and the\ntelegraph helped improve speed and logistics. In the second half of the 20th century,\ncomputers were introduced to deal with the clearing of overwhelming volumes of paper\nchecks and stock certificates stimulated by post-war growth. Starting at about the same\ntime and continuing through today, new electronic networks have been established to\nallow high-speed computerized financial communication. As automation has evolved,\npayment, clearing, and settlement systems have been developed for conducting and\nprocessing transactions within and between firms. However, many of these systems have\nhistorically operated in silos, which can be hard to streamline or replace. In some areas,\nbusiness processes may still rely heavily on manual or semi-automated procedures.\nOver time, banks and other firms have organized various types of clearinghouses\nto coordinate clearing and settlement activities in order to reduce costs and risks. The\nadoption of multilateral clearing in the United States was a key organizational innovation\nthat began with the founding of the New York Clearing House in the 1850s. This led to\nnotable efficiencies and risk reduction in the clearing of checks. Multilateral clearing\nwas also used early on to improve clearing in the securities and derivatives markets. By\nthe 1970s, the United States turned to technologies based on the centralized custody and\nclearing of book-entry securities in order to respond to the paperwork crisis in the\n\n- 3 -\nequities markets. Following the recent financial crisis, the United States--along with\nmany other countries--expanded the scope of central clearing to help address problems in\nthe bilateral clearing of derivatives contracts.\nToday, the possible development and application of distributed ledger technology\nhas raised questions about potentially far reaching changes to multilateral clearinghouses\nand the roles of financial institutions as intermediaries in trading, clearing, and settlement\nfor their clients. In the extreme, distributed ledger technologies are seen as enabling a\nmuch larger universe of financial actors to transact directly with other financial actors\nand to exchange assets versus funds (that is, to “clear” and settle the underlying\ntransactions) virtually instantaneously without the help of intermediaries both within and\nacross borders. This dramatic reduction in frictions would be facilitated by distributed\nledgers shared across various networks of financial actors that would keep a complete\nand accurate record of all transactions, and meet appropriate goals for transparency,\nprivacy, and security.\nAt this stage, such a sea-change may sound like a remote possibility, particularly\nfor the high volume and highly regulated clearing and settlement functions of the\nwholesale financial markets. But profound disruptions are not unprecedented in this\narena. In the early 1960s, the use of computerized book-entry securities systems to\nstreamline custody, clearing, and settlement in the securities markets may have seemed\nlike a technologist’s pipe dream. But these technologies became an important part of\nindustry-wide changes in the 1970s. Today we rely on these types of systems for the\ndaily operation of the markets.\n\n- 4 -\nGiven this backdrop, it is important to give promising technologies the serious\nconsideration they merit, seek to understand their opportunities and risks, and actively\nengage in dialogue about their potential uses and evolution. At the Federal Reserve, we\napproach these issues from the perspective of policymakers safeguarding the public\ninterest in safe and sound core banking institutions, financial stability, particularly as it\npertains to the wholesale financial markets, and the security and efficiency of the\npayment system.\nDistributed ledger technology was introduced for the transfer and record-keeping\nof Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The essential advantage of the technology is that\nit provides a credible way to transfer an asset without the need for trust in intermediaries\nor counterparties, much like a physical cash transaction. To do that, a transfer process\nmust be able to credibly confirm that a sender of an asset is the owner and has enough of\nthe asset to make the transfer to the receiver. This requires a secure system or protocol to\ntransfer assets (the rails), protection against assets being transferred twice (the so-called\ndouble spend problem), and an immutable record of asset ownership that can be\nautomatically and securely updated (the ledger). The tokenization of digital assets can\nfacilitate the transfer process.\nThe genuinely innovative aspect of the technology combines a number of\ndifferent core elements that support the transfer process and recordkeeping:\nPeer-to-peer networking and distributed data storage provide multiple copies\no\nof a single ledger across participants in the system so that all participants have\na shared history of all transactions in the system.\n\n- 5 -\nCryptography, in the form of hashes and digital signatures, provides a secure\no\nway to initiate a transaction that helps verify ownership and the availability of\nthe asset for transfer.\nConsensus algorithms provide a process for transactions to be confirmed and\no\nadded to the single ledger.\nWhile Bitcoin was originally associated with the concept of a universally available,\npublicly shared digital ledger technology without any central authority, many of the use\ncases that are currently under development and discussion rely on “permissioned” ledgers\nin which only permitted, known participants can validate transactions. These in turn can\nbe either public or private in terms of access to the ledger.\nThe resulting Internet of Value holds out the promise of addressing important\nfrictions and reducing intermediation steps in the clearing and settlement process. For\nexample, in cross-border payments, faster processing and reduced costs relative to current\ncorrespondent banking are cited as specific potential benefits. Reducing intermediation\nsteps in cross-border payments may help reduce costs and counterparty risks and may\nadditionally improve financial transparency.\nIn securities clearing and settlement, the potential shift to one master record\nshared among participants has some appeal. Having one immutable record may have the\npotential to reduce or even eliminate the need for reconciliation by avoiding duplicative\nrecords that have different details related to a transaction that is being cleared and settled.\nThis also can lead to greater transparency, reduced costs, and faster securities settlement.\nLikewise, digital ledgers may improve collateral management by improving the tracking\nof ownership and transactions.\n\n- 6 -\nFor derivatives, there is interest in the potential for digital ledger protocols to\nenable self-execution and possibly self-enforcement of contractual clauses, in the context\nof “smart contracts.”\nAs we engage with industry and stakeholders to assess the potential applications\nof digital ledger and related technologies in the payment, clearing, and settlement arena,\nwe will be guided by the principles of efficiency, safety and integrity, and financial\nstability.\nEfficiency\nMany are excited about the potential for these new technologies to reduce costs\nand frictions, such as those associated with collateral management and custodial services,\nreduce settlement risk, enhance security, increase transparency, and offer new services.\nBut there are also concerns about the costs and risks from the early adoption of rapidly\nevolving and uncertain technologies and technological hurdles in integrating new\ntechnologies into legacy systems and achieving interoperability across different ledgers\nand networks. There are questions about the need for substantial new investments to\nobtain capabilities like real-time processing where these capabilities already exist at some\nof the industry’s core infrastructures. There are also cautions that realizing the full\npotential of distributed ledger technologies could take many years.\nMuch of the case for adopting distributed ledger technologies revolves around\nachieving greater efficiency and reducing time and risks to post-trade clearing and\nsettlement. But first, important technological challenges will need to be addressed to\npermit widespread adoption and migration away from legacy systems and networks.\nThese include the need for standardization, the development of protocols that will permit\n\n- 7 -\ninteroperability between other ledgers and networks, and the reduction of computational\nintensity and costs.\nMoreover, distributed ledgers will have to compete with other options and\npriorities of financial firms and clearinghouses in a highly regulated financial ecosystem.\nThus, a major threshold question for the adoption of distributed ledger technology within\nand between groups of firms engaging in particular types of transactions is whether the\nadvantages outweigh the costs of replacing legacy systems.\nIn some cases, where distributed ledger technology can be employed internally\nwithin a firm to automate and speed up business processes, traditional business case\nanalysis would presumably lead to efficient technology choices. By contrast, where\ncoordinated industry-level decisions would be needed to develop distributed ledgers\nshared by multiple firms, the case must be compelling for entire networks of market\nparticipants that will need to make the investments, as well as for the broader public\ninterest.\nThis set of competing considerations suggests there are likely to be a spectrum of\ncases. At one end are the high-volume, heavily regulated markets that have made large\ninvestments in central clearing to provide safe and efficient clearing and settlement for\nthe industry and the public. These markets must always actively consider technological\nand other enhancements to strengthen efficiency and safety. But as a practical matter, the\nlarge-scale adoption of wholly new clearing technologies to replace existing legacy\ntechnologies for major markets may face a significant hurdle initially, such that\nincremental change or delayed adoption until the technology has achieved greater\nmaturity and standardization may be more likely.\n\n- 8 -\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there appear to be some markets or segments\nwhere clearing practices are relatively cumbersome and outmoded, and the network\nhurdles to the adoption of new technologies are lower. Improvements in smaller markets\nwould also provide an opportunity for market participants to gain operational and\nbusiness experience with distributed ledger technologies that could help inform and\nstrengthen the case for broader applications over time.\nA middle case would involve the application of distributed ledger technologies to\nbilateral clearing even where improvements have already been made since the financial\ncrisis. A threshold issue will be the design and safety of new technologies and whether\nfirms will want to share a distributed ledger to manage transactions with their different\ncounterparties and customers. No doubt much will depend not only on cost but also on a\nhost of business, technical, security, and other issues. Even so, change might hold\npromise for improving bilateral clearing, and might also help us think about the long-run\ntrade-offs between bilateral and central clearing.\nAn assessment of the longer-term potential for deployment of distributed ledger\ntechnology naturally raises questions about whether it might ultimately impact the\norganizational structure for clearing and settlement. As multilateral clearing\norganizations have strengthened and spread across many of the major asset classes traded\nin the markets, they have enabled coordinated action on governance, rules, technology,\nand risk management. It is possible that new technologies could substantially change the\nway these functions are pursued, but it would be surprising if they would obviate the need\nfor multilateral clearing in the major markets. Governance, in particular, is a core\nfunction that is inescapably necessary if multilateral activity, even activity dealing with\n\n- 9 -\ndistributed ledgers, is to operate effectively. Indeed, if new technologies could lower the\ncosts of multilateral clearing relative to bilateral clearing in new market segments,\nmultilateral clearing could even grow.\nToday’s clearing houses will likely continue to play a central role in highly\nregulated markets and be well positioned to evaluate and implement new clearing\ntechnologies, while continuing to provide core governance functions in the market.\nNonetheless, it is also possible that if distributed ledgers ultimately cross asset classes\nand even industries, traditional clearinghouses serving specific market segments might\nhave to evolve or new organizations might develop to provide an optimal approach to\nimplementation. Moreover, in principle, the use of distributed ledgers in new market\nsegments may call for new clearing arrangements more in tune with new technologies.\nSimilarly, organizations that can provide governance or other coordinating functions in\nbilaterally cleared markets may also require organizational structures somewhat different\nfrom traditional clearinghouses. We will be following these issues with interest.\nSafety, Integrity, and Financial Stability\nSafety and integrity in clearing and settlement is a critical, long-standing public\npolicy objective of the Federal Reserve, and is critical for broader financial stability.\nRegardless of the technologies employed, if risks to clearing and settlement are not\nidentified and addressed, then banks, dealers, and other firms will not be able to manage\ntheir obligations and market functioning may be impaired. This is a key reason why\nmajor clearing and settlement systems are highly regulated. Hence, the fundamental\nthreshold test for new technologies will be whether they can be deployed and operated\nsafely, with the requisite high degree of operational and financial integrity, security, and\n\n- 10 -\nresilience across a wide range of adverse scenarios. Regulators and the public need to\nknow that if adverse scenarios do occur, there will be robust management and governance\nto respond effectively.\nDigital ledger technologies will need to be able to address the range of issues\nrevolving around the confidentiality and security of firm and client records and data on\nthe one hand, as well as law enforcement requirements and issues on the other. New\ntechnologies must be robust in practice, not just in theory, to attacks on security, and\nmust be able to maintain appropriate confidentiality for records and data.\nIn addition, it will be important that digital ledger technologies can meet the\nrequirements of law enforcement and other regulators to address money laundering,\nterrorist financing, and other key law enforcement concerns. Indeed, there is some\npotential that the new technologies could enable improved authorized access to certain\ndata records in a much more efficient and comprehensive manner than has previously\nbeen possible, thereby potentially reducing costs associated with complying with the\nBank Secrecy Act.\nOverall we should be optimistic that a range of new technologies hold the promise\nof providing more robust security, resilience, and information. We cannot afford to\nassume that change necessarily equals greater risk. Of course, much will depend on the\ntechnology itself, its scalability, its level of maturity, the controls and environment\nsurrounding it, the standardization and accessibility of transactions data, the quality of\nmanagement and governance, and the policy environment in which it is deployed.\n\n- 11 -\nKey Challenges Going Forward\nToday, many industry participants are experimenting with distributed ledger\ntechnology in controlled, permissioned environments. If some of these experiments bear\nfruit, it will be important to address the challenge of how they would scale and achieve\ndiffusion. In addition, determining exactly how the different distributed ledger\ntechnologies interoperate with each other, and legacy systems, will be critical. New and\nhighly fragmented “shared systems” may create unintended consequences even as they\naim to address problems created by today’s siloed operations. Since distributed ledgers\noften involve shared databases, it will also be important to effectively manage access\nrights as information flows back and forth through shared systems. There may well be a\ntradeoff between the privacy of trading partners and competitors on the one hand, and the\nability to leverage shared transactions records for faster and cheaper settlement on the\nother hand. And of course, development of sound risk-management, resiliency, and\nrecovery procedures will be necessary to address operational risks. The Federal Reserve\nwill continue to engage actively with the industry, stakeholders, and our regulatory\ncolleagues as the industry works through these challenges and the technology evolves.\nI want to close by remembering a simple point that central bankers and markets\nhave learned through hard lessons over many years. The daily operation of markets and\ntheir clearing and settlement functions are built on trust and confidence. Market\nparticipants trust that clearing and settlement functions and institutions will work\nproperly every day. Confidence has built over time that when market participants trade,\naccurate and timely clearing and settlement will follow. Any disruption to this\nconfidence comes at great cost to market integrity and financial stability. This is a matter\n\n- 12 -\nof fundamental public interest. In safeguarding the public interest, the first line of inquiry\nand protection will always rest with those closest to the technology innovations and to the\norganizations that consider adopting the technology. But regulators also should seek to\nanalyze the implications of technology developments through constructive and timely\nengagement. We should be attentive to the potential benefits of these new technologies,\nand prepared to make the necessary regulatory adjustments if their safety and integrity is\nproven and their potential benefits found to be in the public interest.",

We toured\nthe major housing, small business, and community development mixed-use project,\nwhich was under construction. Despite the importance of the Thunder Valley project to\nthe community, banks were not among the funders listed for this important project. Their\nabsence underscores the broader challenge underserved communities such as the Pine\nRidge Reservation face when they are included in only one bank’s CRA assessment\narea. I thought about this challenge frequently as we worked on the Board’s proposal to\nreform CRA.\nWe recognize the importance of engaging with Indian Country to inform research\nand policymaking at the Federal Reserve. The Center for Indian Country Development\n(CICD) at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is a key resource across the Federal\nReserve System in fulfilling our responsibility to Indian Country.3 The CICD is led by\n1 I am grateful to Amanda Roberts and Matthew Lambert of the Federal Reserve Board and Casey Lozar of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis for their assistance in preparing this text. These remarks\nrepresent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n2 See http://www.ncai.org/about-ncai.\n3 See https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry.\n\n- 2 -\nCasey Lozar, who is an enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes,\nand the CICD’s Native staff have deep expertise in community and economic\ndevelopment in Indian Country. I greatly value the research and thought leadership of\nthe CICD, as well as their input on policy decisions regarding Indian Country and work\nto deepen our engagement with tribal communities.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is bringing hardship to all our communities, and the\nhealth of tribal communities is suffering disproportionately. Hospitalization rates for\nNative Americans are 4.3 times the rate for Whites, adjusting for age, according to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.4 We are thinking about those in Indian\nCountry who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling with the virus.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is also causing significant economic hardship in Indian\nCountry, affecting the many small businesses that are the backbone of tribal economies.5\nIndian Country faces significant challenges associated with “various data collection and\nreporting issues, such as small sample size or large margins of error,” which are\nsometimes referred to by the term Asterisk Nation.6 This lack of data makes it\nchallenging to evaluate how economic developments are impacting Indian Country.

September 8, 2020. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n6 “American Indians and Alaska Natives may be described as the ‘Asterisk Nation’ because an asterisk,\ninstead of data point, is often used in data displays when reporting racial and ethnic data,” according to the\nNCAI Policy Research Center (2020), “The Asterisk Nation,” 2020, https://www.ncai.org/policy-research-\ncenter/research-data/data.\n\n- 3 -\nexperience in the COVID-19 conversation, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\nconducted a series of pulse surveys with tribal governments, tribally owned enterprises,\nand tribal member businesses, as well as hosted meetings with tribal leaders and national\norganizations.7 The surveys found that two-thirds of businesses in Indian Country saw a\nrevenue reduction of at least 20 percent, and one in six businesses reported losing all of\ntheir revenue due to the pandemic.8 Tribal governments have experienced similar\nrevenue declines, with over half of tribal government respondents anticipating continued\ndeclines of more than 20 percent over the next six months. Despite this, over 60 percent\nof tribal small businesses reported they had not laid off or furloughed workers.9\nMaintaining these employee/employer relationships will be critical for Indian Country\neconomic recovery, but cash-strapped small businesses are finding it increasingly\nchallenging to maintain payrolls as the pandemic continues. Only 20 percent of tribal\nsmall businesses reported they had enough cash on hand to maintain operations beyond a\nthree-month period.10\nEmergency lending programs aimed at providing pandemic relief, such as the\nPaycheck Protection Program (PPP) and our Main Street Lending Program, provide\ncritical support to small businesses, so it was extremely important to make sure they were\n7 See Donna Feir, Chris James, Casey Lozar, and Ryan Nunn, “Indian Country Small Businesses Face\nStrong Headwinds in COVID-19 Recovery,” September 8, 2020,\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/indian-country-small-businesses-face-strong-headwinds-in-\ncovid-19-recovery; Casey Lozar, Donna Feir, and James Robert Columbe, “COVID-19: A Deep Economic\nCrisis in Indian Country,” May 13, 2020, https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/covid-19-a-deep-\neconomic-crisis-in-indian-country; and Casey Lozar, Donna Feir, and James Robert Columbe, “COVID-19\nand Indian Country: Early Snapshot Reveals Disproportionate Economic Exposure and Uncertainty,” April\n10, 2020, https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/covid-19-and-indian-country-early-snapshot-\nreveals-disproportionate-economic-exposure-and-uncertainty.\n8 Feir, “Indian Country Small Businesses Face Strong Headwinds.”\n9 Feir, “Indian Country Small Businesses Face Strong Headwinds.”\n10 Feir, “Indian Country Small Businesses Face Strong Headwinds.”\n\n- 4 -\naccessible to tribal enterprises. Valuable feedback from tribal leaders and lending\ninstitutions led us to change requirements in the Main Street program to allow tribally\nowned enterprises to participate in Main Street lending while still continuing to provide\ndistributions back to their tribal governments. Similarly, we expanded the PPP Liquidity\nFacility to include non-depository community development financial institutions (CDFIs)\nbecause of their ability to reach minority small business owners, including those in Indian\nCountry.\nFinancial Access\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated an already challenging landscape for\nfinancial access in Indian Country, where Native minority depository institutions (MDIs),\ncredit unions, and CDFIs are making exceptional efforts to serve Native Americans on\nand off tribal lands.11 In 2018, the Board worked with the CICD to convene Native\nAmerican financial institutions on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana and\ndiscuss how best to collaborate to maximize the impact for their communities. We\nremain committed to helping these vital financial institutions provide critical financial\nservices in their communities.\nDespite the significant efforts of Native banks, CDFIs, and credit unions, for\nmany Native Americans, banking and credit access remain challenging. Over 16 percent\nof American Indians and Alaska Natives were unbanked in 2019, and survey research\nfinds that only one in three Native American respondents have a strong or very strong\n11 The Minneapolis Federal Reserve’s Center for Indian Country Development website has an interactive\nmap of banks and credit unions owned by, and CDFIs primarily serving, American Indian, Alaska Native,\nand Native Hawaiian individuals and communities at\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/resources/mapping-native-banks.\n\n- 5 -\nrelationship with lenders.12 One reason for these low levels of banking relationships is a\nlack of proximate bank branches. Majority-Native American counties, on average, have\nonly 3 bank branches, which is below the 9-branch average in nonmetro counties, and\nwell below the 26-branch overall average for all counties.13 This is exacerbated by low\nrates of broadband and cellular access in Indian Country, where it is reported that 28\npercent of tribal lands and 48 percent of rural tribal lands are not covered by broadband.14\nNative small businesses struggle to access bank capital even during normal\neconomic times. Native-owned small businesses also struggle to access CRA-motivated\nloans. From 2014 to 2018, the total dollar amount of CRA small business and small farm\nlending per capita in majority-Native American or Alaska Native census tracts was less\nthan half of what it was in majority-non-Hispanic White areas.15 These data make it clear\nthat we still have a long way to go in improving access to banking services and capital in\nIndian Country.\nCRA Reform\nLet me spend a few minutes talking about how CRA reform might help address\nthese systemic economic inequities in Indian Country. Over 45 percent of the American\nIndian and Alaskan Native population live in low- and moderate-income (LMI) or\n12 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), “How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and\nFinancial Services,” 2019 FDIC Survey (Washington: FDIC, October 2020),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2019report.pdf; and Feir, “Indian Country Small\nBusinesses Face Strong Headwinds.”\n13 Information calculated using Summary of Deposits (SoD) 2020. Note that not all counties, especially\nsome with high Native American populations, do not exist in the SoD dataset.\n14 Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 2020 Broadband Deployment Report (Washington: FCC,\nApril 24, 2020), https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-50A1.pdf.\n15 Federal Reserve Board staff analyzed annually reported CRA Small Business and Small Farm loan data\nsubmitted by banks at the tract level and combined it with demographic data from the American\nCommunity Survey 2018 5-Year Survey.\n\n- 6 -\ndistressed or underserved census tracts.16 Yet, feedback from stakeholders like\nyourselves indicates that many of these locations fall outside of where banks currently\nserve.\nIn September, the Federal Reserve Board unanimously voted to approve an\nAdvance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on the CRA. The ANPR proposes\nreforming CRA regulations based on ideas advanced by a broad set of stakeholders,\nincluding the NCAI. I hope you will continue to engage throughout the rest of this\nprocess. It has been 25 years since the banking agencies last substantially reformed\nCRA, so it is important that we get it done right.\nThe Board’s ANPR seeks to advance the law’s core purpose of addressing\nunequal access to credit for LMI and minority communities and disinvestment in\nunderserved communities. A modernized CRA should improve credit access and the\navailability of community development financing. This includes strengthening the\nregulations to ensure that a wide range of banking needs are being met.\nAnother key objective the Federal Reserve has focused on in the ANPR is\nproviding greater certainty, tailoring regulations based on bank size and business model\nand local conditions, and minimizing burden. For example, the ANPR proposes using a\n16 Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Online Census Data System 2018 and U.S. Census\nBureau American Community Survey 2014-2018. A tract is designated as distressed if it is a\nnonmetropolitan middle-income tract that meets one or more of the following triggers: (1) an\nunemployment rate of at least 1.5 times the national average; (2) a poverty rate of 20 percent or more; or\n(3) a population loss of 10 percent or more between the previous and most recent decennial census or a net\nmigration loss of 5 percent or more over the five-year period preceding the most recent census. A tract is\ndesignated as underserved if it is a nonmetropolitan middle-income tract that meets criteria for population\nsize, density, and dispersion that indicate the area's population is sufficiently small, thin, and distant from a\npopulation center that the tract is likely to have difficulty financing the fixed costs of meeting essential\ncommunity needs. A nonmetropolitan middle-income tract is defined as a tract with median family income\nof more than 80 percent or less than or equal to 120 percent compared to a statewide nonmetropolitan area\nmedian family income.\n\n- 7 -\ncomplementary set of metrics to separately evaluate retail-lending activity (like mortgage\nlending) and community development financing activity (like investing in affordable\nrental housing). Looking at these activities separately helps to ensure that we are\ncomprehensively evaluating bank activity and that we are taking both retail and\ncommunity development activity into consideration.\nThird, we also hope the ANPR will provide a foundation for a consistent approach\nthat has broad support among stakeholders. Stakeholders have expressed strong support\nfor the agencies to work together to modernize CRA. By reflecting stakeholders’ views\nand providing a long public comment period, we believe the ANPR provides the basis for\nthe agencies to establish a consistent approach that has broad support.\nAs we embark on CRA reform to strengthen the law’s core purpose, we have a\nunique opportunity to design a regulation that better addresses the needs of individuals\nand communities in Indian Country. There are several proposals in the ANPR that I\nwould like to highlight that advance that goal.\nFirst, we have specific proposals in the ANPR that would allow banks to receive\ncredit for eligible CRA activities in Indian Country, even when those activities are\noutside of a bank’s assessment area(s). For instance, the ANPR proposes providing CRA\ncredit for retail lending activity like mortgage lending or small business lending in Indian\nCountry, even when it takes place outside of CRA assessment areas.17 For example,\nunder the ANPR’s proposals, a mortgage, small business, small farm, or consumer loan\nmade by a bank on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana could be qualified as part\n17 Under the approach proposed in the ANPR, the qualitative aspects of a bank’s performance would\ninclude a review of any retail activity conducted in Indian Country, even when outside of a bank’s\nassessment area(s), as long as a bank also satisfies the needs of its own assessment area(s).\n\n- 8 -\nof that bank’s overall rating, even without the loan being within the assessment area of\nany bank.\nIn addition, the ANPR proposes expanding consideration of CRA community\ndevelopment activities to specific areas of need outside of a bank’s assessment area(s),\nwith Indian Country being one of the proposed designations. As a result, the Board’s\nproposal makes clear that a bank in any part of the country could receive credit for\ncommunity development activities in Indian Country. Banks could receive credit for\ninvestments in affordable rental housing, broadband expansion, or building community\nand elder centers in rural areas and other areas of persistent economic distress. We hope\nthat this proposal responds to stakeholders’ feedback emphasizing the critical importance\nof community development in banking deserts, and we look forward to feedback on this\nduring the comment period.\nThe Board understands that broadening eligibility of CRA activities in Indian\nCountry beyond assessment areas is only part of what is required to address structural\neconomic inequities. We are particularly mindful of the importance of community voice\non community development projects, especially in Indian Country. Given this, the\nANPR seeks feedback on how best to incorporate government or tribal planning in\nqualifying community development consideration for revitalization and stabilization\nprojects. This is critically important to increase banks’ certainty that they will receive\nCRA credit when they make impactful investments that have the support of tribal\ngovernments and leaders, and to increase certainty about how these activities qualify for\nCRA credit.\n\n- 9 -\nSecond, the ANPR proposes to encourage and reward banks for activities that are\nresponsive to community needs, particularly in harder to serve areas. The ANPR\nproposes the use of impact scores for community development activities as a way to\nensure that performance evaluations adequately reflect the relative importance of loans\nand investments within communities. Under the proposed approach, examinations would\nassess the impact of a bank’s community development activities, including those in\nIndian Country. We hope that this approach will encourage banks to extend additional\nCRA activities to areas with unmet needs, such as in Indian Country. The ANPR also\nproposes clear steps to ensure that eligible activities taking place outside of assessment\nareas are adequately reflected in a bank’s CRA ratings.\nThird, the ANPR contains several proposals that better support mission-focused\npartners, including those working in Indian Country, to address challenges in credit\naccess and wealth building. Although a significant portion of household wealth is held\nthrough homeownership for the U.S. overall, buying a home on trust land can be a\ncomplicated transaction.18 Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program loans\nfrom the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are designed to\nhelp Native Americans purchase homes, but the required application process can require\nspecial expertise.19 Many Native MDIs have developed the requisite Section 184\nexpertise and are experienced in working with Native Americans across the country to\npurchase homes on and off tribal lands. For example, the Chickasaw Community Bank\n18 Joshua H. Gallin, Raven Molloy, Eric Nielsen, Paul Smith, and Kamila Sommer (2018). “Measuring\nAggregate Housing Wealth: New Insights from Machine Learning,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2018-064 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 26, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018064r1pap.pdf.\n19 For more on the Section 184 Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, see\nhttps://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/ih/homeownership/184.\n\n- 10 -\nin Oklahoma, which is both an MDI and a CDFI, has a mission of helping Native\nAmericans around the country achieve homeownership and is one of the nation’s largest\nHUD Section 184 lenders.20\nThe ANPR includes several provisions to support MDIs like Chickasaw\nCommunity Bank. Activities with MDIs can receive credit nationwide even when they\ntake place outside of assessment areas, and the ANPR asks for feedback on whether these\nactivities with MDIs should be a potential pathway to an outstanding rating. In an effort\nto support mutually beneficial partnerships between MDIs, the ANPR also would provide\ncredit for MDIs and women-owned financial institutions investing in other MDIs,\nwomen-owned financial institutions, and low-income credit unions, as well as in their\nown institutions. We believe these and other ideas to support MDIs can help provide\nincentives for majority-owned institutions to capitalize and to partner with these\ninstitutions, which will ultimately support more equitable financial access to low-income\nand minority consumers and communities.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has consistently heard that bank partnerships with\nexperienced CDFIs can play an important role in helping banks more effectively make\nIndian Country loans and investments. During the pandemic, Native CDFIs have played\nan outsized role in supporting tribal businesses and homeowners, providing financial\ncounseling, or extending loan terms for borrowers. For example, Lakota Funds in South\nDakota, led by Tawney Brunsch, helped 37 businesses access more than $100,000 in\nCOVID-19 emergency relief funds and provided more than $120,000 in small grants to\n20 See https://www.ccb.bank/indian-country/home-loans.\n\n- 11 -\nNative ranchers, businesses, and homeowners.21 Despite their valuable work, Native\nCDFIs face substantial funding gaps.22\nTo encourage bank partnerships that advance financial inclusion and address\nunmet credit needs, the ANPR seeks feedback on extending to CDFIs the status that is\nextended to MDIs, women-owned financial institutions, and low-income credit unions.\nThis approach would effectively give banks CRA consideration for loans, investments, or\nservices in conjunction with a CDFI anywhere in the country. We look forward to\nfeedback on this potential approach, including the role this could play in Indian Country.\nIn short, we recognize the challenges you face are great and we want to ensure\nCRA reform helps you to improve credit access and financial inclusion in tribal\ncommunities. I am hopeful that the changes the Federal Reserve is considering will help\nspur new partnerships and encourage greater bank investment for tribal communities that\nhave had inequitable access to financial services for too long. We need your input on\nthese proposals and we are ready to listen. Over the next three months, the Federal\nReserve System will host CRA ANPR outreach meetings and listening sessions around\nthe country, including in Indian Country. We encourage your feedback as part of these\nevents, in addition to submitting written comments by the deadline of February 16, 2021.\nWe thank you for your engagement thus far and look forward to hearing more from you\nand your members through the rulemaking process.\n21 Lakota Funds data and conversations with Lakota Funds leadership.\n22 Michou Kokodoko, “Findings from the 2017 Native CDFI Survey: Industry Opportunities and\nLimitations,” Center for Indian Country Development Working Paper 2017-04, November 28, 2017,\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/cicd-working-paper-series/findings-from-the-2017-native-cdfi-\nsurvey-industry-opportunities-and-limitations.",

Prudence counsels a period of\nwatchful waiting--especially with no signs that inflation is picking up. With balance\nsheet normalization now well advanced, it will be appropriate to wind down asset\nredemptions later in the year.1\nThe Modal Outlook\nLet me start by discussing prospects for the U.S. economy. Policymakers tend to\ndistinguish the most likely path, which I will refer to as the “modal” outlook, from risks\naround that path--events that are not the most likely to happen, but that have some\nprobability of happening and that, if they do materialize, would have a one-sided effect.\nBoth the modal outlook and the risks around it have important implications for monetary\npolicy, but in somewhat different ways.\nLet me first discuss the modal outlook. While the economy performed very well\nlast year, I have revised down my modal outlook for this year, in part reflecting some\nsoftening in the recent spending and sentiment data. This softening could be a harbinger\nof some slowing in the underlying momentum of domestic demand. In the initial\nestimate released last week, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a 2.6 percent\nannual rate in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, the latest report on retail sales\nshowed a sharp decline. Analysts note that there is some reason to be skeptical of that\nreport; it is subject to revision, and other data sources suggest a more muted\nmovement. Although the magnitude of the drop may be revised smaller, coming in the\n1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nlast month of the quarter, that decline suggests that growth in consumer spending may be\nheld down in the first quarter of this year.\nSurveys of consumer sentiment, which may provide some additional insight into\nthe strength of spending in the first quarter, fell on net between November and January\nand rebounded partially in February. The lengthy government shutdown likely\ncontributed to the January decline. And although recent readings are below those that\nprevailed for much of 2018, they are still in a range consistent with ongoing spending\ngrowth.\nOther spending indicators have also shown some slowing. Residential\nconstruction data have been soft for some time, reflecting in part earlier increases in\ninterest rates, and homebuilders report that supply constraints on available lots, shortages\nof skilled workers, and tariffs on inputs are also contributing to the slowdown.\nBusiness investment registered strong gains last year, including in the latest\nquarter, but there are some indications of softening there as well. The latest data on\ncapital goods orders, for example, suggest some softening in equipment spending gains.\nSurveys of businesses, such as the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing\nmanagers index and similar regional indexes, have generally moved lower over the past\nsix months, reversing much of the run-up seen in 2017 and late 2016. The National\nFederation of Independent Business’s Small Business Optimism Index is also lower than\nits mid-2018 peak, although it remains well above the levels of 2015 and much of 2016.\nThe weaker foreign outlook also acts as a crosscurrent to the modal outlook.\nWhile strong foreign growth provided tailwinds early last year, foreign growth\n\n- 3 -\nprojections have been revised down repeatedly more recently.2 The slowdown of foreign\ngrowth now appears to be more persistent than initially assumed, with growth likely\nrunning below potential for most of last year.\nEconomic activity slowed noticeably in the second half of 2018 in China, where\npolicymakers have been trying to achieve a balance between restraining very elevated\nlevels of domestic debt, on the one hand, and maintaining strong aggregate growth, on\nthe other. The protracted trade conflict with the United States has further complicated\nthat challenge.\nConcerns about China’s slowdown are reverberating globally, as was true in\n2015-16, although the incidence is somewhat different. While Germany had appeared to\nbe weighed down primarily by transitory factors late last year, some of the weakness in\nindustrial production now appears likely to be more persistent, in part reflecting\nspillovers from China. The euro area is also seeing slowing in some other large member\neconomies. Global weakness in trade and manufacturing has also weighed on Japan.\nThe slowdown in foreign demand spills over into the United States through a\nvariety of channels. Although the dollar has weakened somewhat lately, its earlier\nappreciation and slowing foreign growth contributed to a decline in exports and a fall in\nimport prices over the second half of last year. In contrast, the recent step-down in long-\nterm rates and easing in the dollar have lessened pressures on yields in emerging markets\nand provided more policy space in some cases.\n2 See International Monetary Fund (2019) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(2019).\n\n- 4 -\nIn the United States, financial markets saw substantial volatility late last year,\nwhich may still be affecting sentiment. From September to December of last year,\nfinancial conditions tightened considerably, with the stock market falling as much as 20\npercent, and corporate bond premiums rising. This year, much of that tightening has\nreversed: The S&P 500 has made up more than half of its earlier losses, and corporate\nrisk spreads have reversed much of their earlier tightening. Long-term Treasury yields\nrose from September through November and have since more than retraced, returning to\nthe levels of early 2018. While the dollar has edged down from the peaks reached in the\nfall, it is about 7 percent higher than the lows seen early last year.\nOverall, the softer spending data in the U.S. and the slowdown abroad, along with\nearlier financial volatility, are likely weighing on the modal outlook and might in turn\nwarrant a softening in the modal path for policy.\nRisks to the Outlook\nLet me turn now to the second category of crosscurrents facing the U.S. economy:\nthe risks around the modal outlook. Policy uncertainty has been elevated recently and\nhas been cited as an important factor in the financial volatility late last year. Although\nsome of the risks have been anticipated for some time, recent events have brought them\ninto heightened focus, and the accumulation of these risks could lead to some erosion in\nsentiment that could in turn feed into activity.\nTrade dispute escalation remains a risk. The tariffs and trade disruptions that\nhave occurred so far are estimated to have had relatively modest effects on aggregate\ngrowth and inflation, although damaging disruptions have been concentrated in some\nsectors, such as soybeans. While recent reports suggest some progress, the prospect of\n\n- 5 -\nadditional tariffs in the trade conflict with China or on automobiles have been cited\nfrequently as a risk in earnings reports and reports from business contacts.\nThe recent longest-ever government shutdown created hardship for many families\nand has increased attention on upcoming fiscal negotiations. On current estimates, the\ndebt ceiling will need to be raised around the fall. The Bipartisan Budget Act, which is\nestimated to boost GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point, on average, per year in 2018 and\n2019, is scheduled to expire in 2020. If agreement is not reached, spending levels could\nfall back to the sequester caps, which would amount to a significant headwind.\nThere are also important downside risks abroad. Most immediately, a “no-deal\nBrexit” would have adverse consequences for Britain, and potentially more broadly,\ngiven London’s role as a financial center. Within the euro area, countries such as Italy\nand France face domestic challenges. And a hard landing in China would have spillovers\nthrough financial and trade channels.\nEmployment, Inflation, and Policy\nIn contrast to the softening in spending indicators, job gains have remained strong\nso far. Job gains have averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months--more\nthan twice the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force. The January\nunemployment rate of 4 percent is near a multidecade low. The strong labor market has\ndrawn many Americans into productive work, and the overall employment-to-population\nratio for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is now within 1/2 percentage point of its\npre-crisis peak. Many of the main measures of wages have been increasing at rates not\nseen on a sustained basis in almost 10 years, although labor’s share of overall income\n\n- 6 -\nremains stubbornly depressed.3 Nonetheless, recent data on claims have shown some\nsoftening, and I will be watching a broad set of labor market indicators carefully,\nincluding the payrolls data for February, which will be released tomorrow.\nJust as the economy is performing well on the maximum-employment goal set by\nthe Congress, it is also close to meeting our price-stability mandate. Following many\nyears of low readings, the core price index for consumer purchases for the 12 months\nthrough December was up 1.9 percent.4 That reading lines up with the median Summary\nof Economic Projections (SEP) forecast from a year ago. So inflation is very close to the\nCommittee’s 2 percent objective and its earlier expectation.\nEven so, we will need to be vigilant to ensure inflation achieves 2 percent on a\nsustained basis. As I have observed for some time, underlying trend inflation may be\nrunning slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Many statistical filtering\nmodels put underlying inflation modestly below 2 percent, and some survey measures of\ninflation expectations are running somewhat below pre-crisis levels. Similarly, the\ndifference between the yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities is\nlower than it was before the crisis, and that difference may provide some insight into\nmarket participants’ views of underlying inflation.5\nThe fact that estimates of underlying trend inflation remain a bit on the soft side\nreinforces the evidence that the Phillips curve is very flat, a key element of the post-crisis\n3 For the share of overall income going to workers, see, for instance, data on the labor share in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector--available from the FRED database on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173--and Bureau of Labor Statistics (2017).\n4 I focus on the core measure because food and energy prices are volatile, and total inflation has generally\nfluctuated around core inflation. The alternative Dallas trimmed mean measure tells a similar story.\n5 Brainard (2017) provides more details on these factors.\n\n- 7 -\nnew normal that I have noted previously.6 The responsiveness of price inflation to\nresource utilization at the national level has been very weak for some time. This raises\nthe possibility that the economy may have room to run. As the unemployment rate has\nfallen to levels not seen in many decades, we have heard concerns that the steeper\nPhillips curve of the past might reassert itself, perhaps in a nonlinear manner.7 But all\navailable evidence suggests inflation expectations remain well anchored to the upside.\nIndeed, the contours of today’s new normal suggest we should be equally\nattentive to a risk of erosion in inflation expectations to the downside. A range of\nevidence suggests that the long-run “neutral” rate of interest--the rate of interest\nconsistent with the economy growing at its potential rate and stable inflation--is very low\nrelative to its historical levels. The low long-run neutral rate limits the amount of space\navailable for cutting the federal funds rate to buffer the economy from adverse\ndevelopments and is likely to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy\nrate is pinned at the lower bound. In turn, more frequent or extended episodes when\ninflation is below target and policy is at the effective lower bound risk pulling down\nprivate-sector inflation expectations in a self-reinforcing downward spiral, which could\nfurther compress the monetary policy buffer to cushion downside shocks.8\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made clear that the 2 percent\ninflation goal is symmetric.9 As the median SEP forecasts have indicated, a number of\nCommittee members have previously projected a policy path consistent with inflation\n6 See Brainard (2015, 2016) for a discussion of this and other elements of what I referred to as the new\nnormal.\n7 See Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi (2019) for a comprehensive discussion of research on the Phillips curve.\n8 This risk is reinforced by the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy over the past five years and the erosion of\nfiscal space.\nSee Kiley and Roberts (2017).\n9 See Board of Governors (2019a).\n\n- 8 -\nrising somewhat above 2 percent for a time, which is in line with the symmetry of the\ntarget.\nThere is a separate discussion of policies that would pre-commit to make up for\npast misses on inflation, such as temporary price-level targeting, which may be important\nin circumstances with a low long-run neutral rate and more frequent effective-lower-\nbound episodes.10 I expect this will be part of our review of monetary policy strategies,\ntools, and communication practices later this year.11\nOur policy goal now is to preserve the progress we have made on maximum\nemployment and target inflation. Core inflation last year came in around target. It is\nheartening to see so many American workers coming back into the jobs market with\nrising wages. Our business contacts note they are currently hiring and investing in\ntraining workers who may not have been considered just a few years ago.\nWith regard to policy, modest downward revisions to the baseline outlook for\noutput and employment would call for modest downward revisions to the path for our\nconventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, helping to offset some of the weakness\nthat would otherwise weigh on the economy. Moreover, basic principles of risk\nmanagement would suggest that the increase in downside risks warrants a modest\ndownward revision to the modal path for policy. These downside risks, if realized, could\nweigh on economic activity.12 So heightened downside risks to output and employment\nwould argue for a softer federal funds rate path even if the modal outlook for the\neconomy were unchanged.\n10 See, for instance, Bernanke (2017) and Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019).\n11 See Board of Governors (2019b).\n12 The limited amount of conventional policy space reinforces the importance of guarding against the\nmaterialization of downside risks.\n\n- 9 -\nAt a time when the modal outlook appears to have softened a bit, and risks appear\nmore weighted to the downside than the upside, the best way to safeguard the gains we\nhave made on jobs and inflation is to navigate cautiously on rates. Risk management in\nan environment of a low long-run neutral rate and an attenuated relationship between\nresource utilization and overall inflation supports this approach. Watchful waiting will\nallow us to gather more information about domestic momentum and foreign growth as\nwell as some of the policy risks weighing on sentiment.\nBalance Sheet Normalization\nLet me turn now to the second tool used by the Federal Reserve in recent years--\nasset purchases. Recall that, after reducing the federal funds rate to its effective lower\nbound of zero in the 2008-09 recession, the FOMC sought a mechanism for providing\nadditional stimulus in order to achieve maximum employment and target inflation.13 The\nFederal Reserve purchased longer-term Treasury securities in an effort to push down\nlonger-term interest rates to support economic activity, an approach sometimes referred\nto as quantitative easing. It also purchased agency mortgage-backed securities for the\nsame reason, as well as to provide support to the housing sector, which was at the heart of\nthe crisis. Although the empirical estimates vary, most conclude that the asset purchase\nprograms were successful in supporting the recovery.14\nOnce recoveries become well established, the Federal Reserve moves its policy\nsettings to more normal levels. Our current extended recovery is no exception: The\nFederal Reserve first started moving the federal funds rate to more normal values once\n13 Some foreign central banks have reduced their short-term policy rates below zero. See Ball and others\n(2016) for a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of such a policy.\n14 See the evidence cited in Ball and others (2016).\n\n- 10 -\nthe expansion was well established, and then it started normalizing the balance sheet once\nnormalization of the federal funds rate was well under way.\nOf course, the benchmark for normalization has changed since before the\nfinancial crisis. Demand has grown for the Fed’s liabilities from a variety of sources.\nThe demand for U.S. currency has grown notably relative to nominal GDP, the Treasury\nDepartment now holds large balances in its account at the Fed as an important part of its\ncash management, and foreign central banks hold larger deposits than in the past. In\naddition, the demand from commercial banks for deposits at the Fed--that is, “reserves”--\nappears to have increased substantially. Spurred by new liquidity regulations and their\nown internal liquidity management practices, the largest banks hold substantial amounts\nof so-called high-quality liquid assets to protect against the risk of a sudden “run” on\ntheir uninsured short-run liabilities, as occurred during the financial crisis.\nSo it appears that the new normal size of the balance sheet is likely to remain\ngreater relative to the size of the economy than it was before the financial crisis. How\nmuch larger is still an open question. For the past decade, the Federal Reserve has\noperated a regime with reserves that are very abundant relative to banks’ demand for\nreserves. The current framework relies on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate on reserves\nto control the federal funds rate, in the context of the provision of ample reserves. In\ncontrast, the pre-crisis framework featured a scarce supply of reserves, which the Federal\nReserve would vary on a daily basis to control the federal funds rate by closely matching\nthe demand for reserves.\n\n- 11 -\nThe FOMC recently affirmed that it would continue to operate the current\nframework.15 This approach makes sense for a variety of reasons. The current\nframework has been effective in providing good control of the policy rate and ensuring\neffective transmission to other money markets and the financial system. Not only is the\ndemand for reserves likely to remain much higher than it was before the crisis, but it is\nalso likely that there will be fluctuations in reserves, along with other elements of the\nFed’s liabilities, such as the deposits the Treasury holds with the Fed. Accommodating\nthose swings with scarce reserves would require much larger daily open market\noperations than was the case before the crisis.\nBy remaining in a regime with ample reserves, the Fed is able to control short-\nterm interest rates without the need to conduct daily open market operations. Because\nthere are ample reserves, the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates are\ndetermined along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve. As a result, the system\ncan absorb swings in the demand and supply of reserves with limited need for open\nmarket operations. The alternative of pushing reserves close to the transition point\nbetween the flat and steep parts of the demand curve would likely lead to active\nintervention as an ongoing feature, along with volatility in rates.\nGiven that the Committee is now operating with two instruments, it is important\nto note that the Committee clarified that it would seek to use only one tool actively at a\ntime, and that the preferred active tool would be the federal funds rate when it is above\nthe effective lower bound. I want to make it clear that we would not want our two tools\nto be working at cross-purposes. For instance, we would not want the balance sheet to be\n15 See Board of Governors (2019c).\n\n- 12 -\nshrinking at a time when the FOMC thought it was appropriate to cut the federal funds\nrate.\nAfter holding the size of the balance sheet roughly flat since mid-2014, once the\nnormalization of the federal funds rate was deemed well under way in October 2017, the\nCommittee started to allow the size of the balance sheet to shrink in line with the pledge\nto “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and\neffectively.”16 We have made substantial progress, as demonstrated by the level of\nreserves. Reserves are already down by 40 percent since their peak and are likely to be\ndown by more than half this summer. In my view, asset redemptions should come to an\nend later in the year, which would provide a sufficient buffer of reserves to meet demand\nand avoid volatility. We have gathered information from market contacts and have\nsurveyed banks to assess their demand for reserves.17 I would want to see a healthy\ncushion on top of that to avoid unnecessary volatility and ensure that the federal funds\nrate will be largely insulated from daily swings in factors affecting reserves.\nWith regard to the composition of the balance sheet, I favor moving eventually to\na portfolio of only Treasury securities--that is, without any agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities remaining. It is important to do so in a way that continues to avoid market\n16 As described in Board of Governors (2017), the reduction in reinvestment was implemented through a\nseries of gradually rising caps on repayments of principal.\nQuoted text is from the penultimate bullet point in Board of Governors (2014).\n17 The Senior Financial Officer Survey, which was undertaken in September 2018 and is being undertaken\nagain, gathered views systematically from a number of banks concerning their reserve balance management\nstrategies and practices. The survey is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sfos/sfos-release-dates.htm.\n\n- 13 -\ndisruptions. That shift will be under way naturally, albeit slowly, as these securities\nmature and are replaced by Treasury securities.18\nFor the portion of our portfolio in Treasury securities, the Federal Reserve\ncurrently holds no Treasury bills, and our portfolio has a much longer weighted-average\nmaturity than the current stock of Treasury securities outstanding in the market or than\nour pre-crisis portfolio, which was more heavily weighted toward short-dated securities\nthan the holdings of the public. When the Federal Reserve System begins once again\npurchasing Treasury securities, we will need to decide what maturities to purchase.\nGiven how far out of step the System’s current portfolio is from common benchmarks,\nhowever, it might make sense to weight those purchases more heavily toward Treasury\nbills and other shorter-dated Treasury securities for a time. Further into the future, there\nmay be good reasons to shift toward greater holdings of shorter-term securities to provide\ngreater flexibility. However, I want to emphasize that I do not expect this issue to be\naddressed for some time.\nConclusion\nThe most likely path for the economy appears to have softened against a backdrop\nof greater downside risks. Our goal now is to safeguard the progress we have made on\nfull employment and target inflation. Prudence counsels a period of watchful waiting.\nAnd with balance sheet normalization now well advanced, it will soon be time to wind\ndown our asset redemptions.\n18 The Committee has indicated it may choose to sell agency mortgage-backed securities at some point to\nhelp accomplish the Treasury-securities-only goal. In this eventuality, there would be considerable\nadvance notice, with an aim to minimizing any market disruptions.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nBall, Laurence, Joseph Gagnon, Patrick Honohan, and Signe Krogstrup (2016).

Let me start by\nnoting that these are my own views and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.1\nClimate change is already imposing substantial economic costs and is projected to\nhave a profound effect on the economy at home and abroad.2 Future financial and\neconomic effects will depend on the severity of the physical effects of climate change and\nthe nature and speed of the transition to a sustainable economy.3 Financial market\nparticipants that do not put in place frameworks to assess and address climate-related\nrisks could face significant losses on climate-sensitive assets caused by environmental\nshifts, by a disorderly transition, or both. Conversely, robust risk management; scenario\nanalysis; consistent, comparable disclosures; and forward plans can help ensure the\nfinancial system is resilient to climate-related risks and well positioned to support the\ntransition to a sustainable economy.4\n1 I am grateful to Elizabeth Kiser of the Federal Reserve for her assistance in preparing this text.\n2 See David R.

So a second core pillar of our framework seeks\nto address the macrofinancial risks of climate change. To complement the work of the\nSCC, the Federal Reserve Board is establishing a Financial Stability Climate Committee\n(FSCC) to identify, assess, and address climate-related risks to financial stability. The\nFSCC will approach this work from a macroprudential perspective—that is, one that\nconsiders the potential for complex interactions across the financial system.\nFrom a microprudential perspective, the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and\nRegulation Report discusses how the effects of climate change can manifest in the\nfinancial system via traditional channels like credit, market, operational, legal, and\nreputational risks that affect the safety and soundness of individual firms.8 From a\nmacroprudential perspective, our Financial Stability Report outlines how climate change\ncould increase financial shocks and financial system vulnerabilities that could further\namplify shocks.9\nMicroprudential and macroprudential objectives are often aligned. For example,\nconsistent disclosures are important not only to enable individual financial firms to\nmeasure and manage their exposure to climate-related financial risks, but also to support\nfinancial stability more broadly by helping the market to accurately price that risk. Given\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), Supervision and Regulation Report\n(Washington: Board of Governors, November), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202011-\nsupervision-and-regulation-report.pdf.\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), Financial Stability Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, November), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-\nreport-20201109.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nthe importance of consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures to financial stability\nand prudential objectives, mandatory disclosures are ultimately likely to be important.10\nThere are situations, however, where microprudential and macroprudential goals\ndo not fully align so that it is important to take into account the implications both for\nindividual firms’ safety and soundness and also for the broader financial system. For\nexample, the use of climate-related risk mitigants such as insurance or financial\nderivatives may shift risk away from a particular financial institution but may not reduce\nor eliminate risk from the system as a whole. In developing a framework to address\nclimate-related financial risks, we need to be mindful of this cascade of effects and the\nimplications across the Federal Reserve’s range of responsibilities.\nFinancial System Shocks and Vulnerabilities Arising from Climate Change\nOur macroprudential work program is focused on assessing not only potential\nclimate shocks, but also whether climate change might make the financial system more\nvulnerable in ways that could amplify these shocks and cause broader knock-on effects\nthat could harm households, businesses, and communities. In some respects, climate\nchange can be seen as similar to other financial stability shocks emanating from outside\nthe financial system, such as COVID-19, which are difficult to predict with precision and\ncan lead to an abrupt reassessment of a broad array of economic and financial outcomes,\nprices, and incentives. However, climate change shocks differ in a few important ways.\nUnlike episodic or transitory shocks, climate change is an ongoing, cumulative\nprocess, which is expected to produce a series of shocks. Over time, these shocks can\n10 See Allison Herren Lee (2021), “Public Input Welcomed on Climate Change Disclosures,” public\nstatement by the Acting Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, March 15,\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures.\n\n- 5 -\nchange the statistical time-series properties of economic variables, making forecasting\nbased on historical experience more difficult and less reliable. The physical properties of\nthe earth’s atmosphere shown by scientific climate records and climatological forecasts\ninclude the risk of irreversible climate “tipping points,” which can cause as yet unseen\ndisruptions in weather systems, regional water supplies, and the habitability of large land\nmasses—at large magnitudes. Quantifying the risks and implications of potentially\ncatastrophic climate-related tipping points for the economy and financial system is\nextremely difficult.\nSecond, there is substantial uncertainty about the nature and timing of the policy,\nbehavioral, and technological changes that will occur during the transition to a\nsustainable economy. This uncertainty could create significant challenges for financial\nstability.\nIn addition, climate change might be expected to increase financial system\nvulnerabilities.11 Financial system vulnerabilities could arise if intermediaries engage in\nfinancial contracts or take on leverage to shift climate risk in ways that leave the overall\nsystem vulnerable to the amplifying effects of shocks. In addition, even well-informed\ninvestors could underestimate the likelihood of large shocks related to climate change,\nresulting in systematic mispricing of risk. This mispricing could occur if the physical\neffects of climate change arrive sooner or with greater intensity than expected or\ninvestors systematically err in their expectations about the transition. Finally,\n11 See Celso Brunetti, Benjamin Dennis, Dylan Gates, Diana Hancock, David Ignell, Elizabeth K. Kiser,\nGurubala Kotta, Anna Kovner, Richard J. Rosen, and Nicholas K. Tabor (2021), “Climate Change and\nFinancial Stability,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March\n19), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/climate-change-and-financial-stability-\n20210319.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nvulnerabilities could result if climate risks in the aggregate are systematically correlated\nacross participants in the economy and financial system. These correlated aggregate\nexposures could be missed by risk models and difficult or impossible to mitigate fully.\nIt might be useful to consider some examples of climate-related risks that could\nmanifest as shocks or increase financial system vulnerabilities or both.12 One example is\nproperty and casualty insurance, which enables financial firms to engage in financial\ncontracts to hedge climate-related risks. While reinsurance contracts and agreements\namong investors can shift risks across the global financial system, as I noted earlier, some\nlevel of risk is likely to remain.13 A lack of transparency across participants in the\nfinancial sector could cause climate-related risks to build up in hidden pockets,\nembedding vulnerabilities that could result in cascading losses in the event of large-scale\nadverse weather outcomes or other shocks to asset valuations.\nWe can already see examples of how such ripple effects might work. As physical\nrisks manifest, insurers update the availability and pricing of coverage to more accurately\nreflect climate-related risks to real estate, physical facilities, and companies that are\nsubject to these risks through financing arrangements or supply chains. As we have seen\nin California and in Florida, insurance companies can pull back from insuring properties\n12 See Brunetti and others, “Climate Change and Financial Stability,” in note 11; see also Sonia I.\nSeneviratne, Neville Nicholls, David Easterling, Claire M.

The direct\neffects on homeowners and businesses are geographically concentrated and can have\nsevere effects on safety and the usability of properties. As climate risks grow over time,\nthe mortgages on these properties may become riskier, along with financial instruments\ninvolving these mortgages that may embed opaque, concentrated climate-related risks.\nSudden realizations of climate-related risks could cause rapid shifts in investor sentiment\nand shocks to asset prices, including to real estate prices in specific geographic\nlocations.15\nFederal, state, and local authorities are implementing policies to support\ntransparency in climate-related risk associated with real estate to allow property owners,\nlenders, and investors to make better-informed investment decisions. Updated flood\nmaps, coastal resilience programs, and managed retreat from flood-prone areas can\n14 See, for example, Christopher Flavelle (2019), “As Wildfires Get Worse, Insurers Pull Back from\nRiskiest Areas,” New York Times, August 20; and Matt Sheehan (2020), “RenRe Could Pull Back in\nFlorida if Rates Stay Low, Says CEO,” Reinsurance News, February 7.\n15 The Federal Housing Finance Authority recently issued a request for input on natural disaster risk to the\nhousing finance system; see Federal Housing Finance Agency (2021), “FHFA Issues RFI on Climate and\nNatural Disaster Risk Management at the Regulated Entities,” news release, January 19,\nhttps://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Issues-RFI-on-Climate-and-Natural-Disaster-\nRisk-Management-at-the-Regulated-Entities.aspx.\n\n- 8 -\nreduce the extent of hidden climate risks. While such transparency is vital, financial\nsystem vulnerabilities could arise even in transparent markets—for example, through\naggregate common exposures to climate risk.\nFinally, climate-related physical risks are increasing financial burdens on local,\nstate, and federal finances. Increasing physical damage to localities necessitates higher\nexpenditures to repair damage from extreme weather and fire events and to build\nresilience to growing climate threats. Pullbacks in insurance coverage, the need to\nrelocate or bolster infrastructure, and increased provision of service in the wake of\ndisasters increase burdens on state, local, and federal finances. These rising burdens\ncould place strains on municipal financing markets over time, particularly in areas of\ngeographically concentrated climate risks, and create some risk of a cascade effect if a\nshock causes investors to pull back from similar exposures.\nNew Approaches and New Tools\nWe are building the requisite institutional capacity and knowledge to deepen our\nunderstanding of these risks and vulnerabilities. The new FSCC is a Systemwide\ncommittee charged with developing and implementing a program to assess and address\nclimate-related risks to financial stability. The broad goals of the FSCC are to promote\nthe resilience of the financial system to climate-related financial risks, to ensure\ncoordination with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and its member\nagencies, and to increase the Federal Reserve’s international engagement and influence\non this issue. The FSCC will work in close coordination with the SCC—as well as with\nour community development, payments, international coordination, and economic\n\n- 9 -\nresearch and data areas—to build a coordinated approach to integrating climate-related\nrisks where they affect our responsibilities.\nTo support the work of these committees and the broader work throughout the\nFederal Reserve System, we are investing in new research, data, and modeling tools. In\nlight of the high uncertainty inherent in estimating climate-related shocks, scenario\nanalysis may be a helpful tool to assess the effects on the financial system under a wide\nrange of assumptions.16 Climate scenario analysis identifies climate-related physical and\ntransition risk factors facing financial firms, formulates appropriate stresses of those risk\nfactors under different scenarios, and measures their effects on financial intermediaries\nand the financial system. This analytic approach gives us a structured way of uncovering\nthe parts of the financial system where physical, transition, and other risks may have\noutsized effects through potential spillovers. It also helps identify the limits of our\nknowledge.\nFor scenario analysis, we would anticipate long time horizons, substantial\nuncertainty, the use of qualitative elements, and reliance on external data and models. To\ncapture the potential for complex interactions across the financial system, such scenario\nanalysis would consider the effects on bank and nonbank financial intermediaries and\nfinancial markets broadly. We are informing ourselves about the scenario analysis work\nunder way by policymakers in foreign jurisdictions, such as by the European Central\nBank and the Bank of England, as well as the scenarios developed by the Network of\nCentral Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).17\n16 See Brainard, “The Role of Financial Institutions in Tackling the Challenges of Climate Change,” in note\n7.\n17 See Luis de Guindos (2021), “Shining a Light on Climate Risks: The ECB’s Economy-wide Climate\nStress Test,” The ECB Blog, March 18,\n\n- 10 -\nCollaboration across Jurisdictions and Sectors\nClimate change is inherently a cross-border and cross-sectoral challenge, and we\nrecognize the benefit of collaborating with other regulatory agencies, central banks, and\ninternational standard-setting bodies while taking into account the important differences\nacross jurisdictions. In the United States, close coordination with the FSOC member\nagencies will be important. We are also working with member agencies of the U.S.\nGlobal Change Research Program to learn about scientific data, models, and other\ninformation to expand our analysis of the economic and financial effects of weather-\nrelated disasters and climate-related risks.18\nWe participate actively in the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) work on climate\nchange. The FSB’s membership, mandate, and relationship with the Group of Twenty\n(G-20) and the standard-setting bodies position it well to play a coordinating role in\naddressing the interdependencies among different workstreams and supporting the G-\n20—including the G-20 Sustainable Finance Study Group co-chaired by the U.S.\nTreasury. The FSB has been tasked by the G-20 to play a leadership role on data gaps\nand to identify recommendations to support the use of comprehensive, comparable, and\nauditable climate-related disclosure standards. In addition, the Federal Reserve is co-\nchairing one of the workstreams—the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Task\nForce on Climate-Related Financial Risks (TFCR).\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2021/html/ecb.blog210318~3bbc68ffc5.en.html; and Network\nof Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (2020), “NGFS Climate Scenarios for\nCentral Banks and Supervisors” (Paris: NGFS, June),\nhttps://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/medias/documents/820184_ngfs_scenarios_final_version_v6.pdf.\n18 See Reidmiller and others, Fourth National Climate Assessment, vol.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EST\nFebruary 26, 2016\nWhat Happened to the Great Divergence?\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“2016 Monetary Policy Forum”\nAn annual conference sponsored by\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 26, 2016\n\nBeginning in 2014, we saw confident predictions of a coming strong divergence\nin monetary policy among the major economies. To date, there has been less policy\ndivergence in reality than had been predicted. This observation raises the question of\nwhether there may be limits on policy divergence in current circumstances. Such limits\nmight reflect common forces buffeting economies around the world or the powerful\ntransmission of shocks across borders through exchange rate and other financial channels\nthat may have the effect of front-running monetary policy adjustments in the vicinity of\nthe zero lower bound. Put differently, predictions that U.S. monetary policy would chart\na notably divergent path have been tempered by powerful crosscurrents from abroad.1\nHow Different Are Underlying Conditions?\nBefore turning to divergences in policy, it is useful to review briefly the extent of\ndifferences in the underlying economic conditions in the major advanced economies.\nWhile the recovery from the global financial crisis has been frustratingly slow in every\nmajor economy, there nonetheless have been important differences in the pace and extent\nof healing. Speaking loosely, among the advanced economies, the United States and\nUnited Kingdom appear farthest along in closing resource gaps, Japan is next in line, and\nthe euro area has been somewhat slower to recover. In the United States, resource\nutilization has increased substantially over the past five years. The U.S. unemployment\nrate is now under 5 percent, compared with 10 percent at its recent peak. Even so, there\nis evidence that some labor market slack still remains.2 The United Kingdom has\nexperienced a rapid drop in unemployment to 5.1 percent, as low as pre-crisis levels, and\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age individuals, for example, is nearly 2 percentage points\nbelow its 2004-07 average, while part-time work remains elevated and progress on wages has been slow.\n\n- 2 -\nlabor force participation has remained relatively strong. In contrast, unemployment in the\neuro area was 10-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down just 1-3/4 percentage points\nfrom its recent peak and still well above pre-crisis levels. Accordingly, market\nparticipants have expected policy in the United States and the United Kingdom to\nbecome less accommodative, while remaining very accommodative over the medium\nterm in the euro area.3\nIn Japan, expectations of monetary policy divergence have reflected Japan’s long\nperiod of disappointments on its inflation target to a greater extent than its remaining\nresource gap. Japan’s unemployment rate is 3.3 percent, already below the previous\ncyclical trough, and the International Monetary Fund estimates the output gap to have\nbeen the same in Japan and the United States in 2015 at 1-1/2 percent. However, with\ninflation in Japan previously having been near zero for an extended period and inflation\nexpectations under pressure, the Bank of Japan’s commitment to increasing inflation\nexpectations and moving inflation up to its 2 percent target has led market participants to\nexpect extremely accommodative monetary policy to persist for quite a while.\nCurrently, however, there are smaller differences among the major economies on\nmeasures of realized and expected inflation than there are on resource utilization. In\n2015, the 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in\nthe United States was 0.6 percent, while headline inflation in the United Kingdom, euro\narea, and Japan were 0.2 percent. All inflation rates are well below target. Of course, to\nthe extent that the downward pressure on global inflation is due to falling oil prices, this\npressure would be expected to abate if oil prices stabilize.\n3 See p. 24 of the February 2016 Monetary Policy Report (Board of Governors, 2016).\n\n- 3 -\nBut even after removing energy prices, core PCE inflation has come in\nconsistently under the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target here in the United States and\ndoes not look very different from inflation in economies that are expected to maintain\naccommodative monetary policy for some time. Core PCE inflation, or inflation\nexcluding food and energy prices, has remained stubbornly in the vicinity of 1-1/4 to 1-\n1/2 percent over the past three years in the United States, similar to the United Kingdom\nand not very different from the roughly 1 percent core inflation in the euro area and\nJapan.\nWe also see notable similarities in the recent deterioration in market measures of\ninflation expectations. While in the euro area, swaps-based inflation compensation has\nfallen about 3/4 percentage point since the middle of 2014 and is now around 1-1/2\npercent at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, in the United States, swaps-based\ninflation compensation has fallen 1 full percentage point over the same period and is now\nat 1-3/4 percent. Japan has experienced a similar decline over this period, while the\nUnited Kingdom has seen a much more modest decline.\nWith realized and expected future inflation not showing large differences, the\nexpectation of monetary policy divergence between the United States, on the one hand,\nand the United Kingdom and the euro area, on the other, must rest to a large extent on\nremaining differences in resource utilization and expectations that inflation outcomes will\ndiverge as a result of these differences. However, it is important to note that the extent of\ninflation divergence generated by differences in resource utilization across countries is\nlikely much smaller now than it has been in earlier decades. Recent research suggests a\n\n- 4 -\ndramatic flattening of the Phillips curve in recent decades.4 If this finding continues to\nhold true, resource utilization would need to differ more sharply across national\neconomies to produce a noticeable difference in inflation.\nThe persistence of relatively soft core PCE inflation readings in the United States,\ndespite a substantial improvement in employment, suggests we should be cautious in\nrelying on the historical relationship between employment gains and stronger inflation in\ntoday’s economy. Moreover, the softening in market-based measures of inflation\nexpectations and some hints of weakening in survey measures deserve our attention. This\ndeterioration in inflation expectations and a weakened link between labor market\ntightening and inflation--together with the asymmetry of policy in the vicinity of the\nlower bound--lead me to put a high premium on evidence that actual inflation is firming\nsustainably.\nPutting these pieces of evidence together suggests that if core inflation remains\nbelow target in all major advanced economies and inflation expectations remain under\npressure in many, I might expect policy divergence to remain more limited than\npreviously predicted.\nCommon Conditions\nTo the extent that we are observing limited divergence in inflation outcomes and\nless divergence in realized policy paths than many anticipated, this could be attributable\nto common shocks or trends that cause economic conditions to be synchronized across\neconomies. The sharp repeated declines in the price of oil have been a major common\n4 In the United States, for example, Blanchard (2016) estimates that the slope of the Phillips curve has\ndeclined by more than two-thirds since the 1970s. Other recent research includes Blanchard, Cerutti, and\nSummers (2015) and Kiley (2015b).\n\n- 5 -\nfactor depressing headline inflation and are also likely feeding into low core inflation,\nalthough to a lesser extent.5 As noted previously, these price declines have led headline\ninflation across the globe to behave quite similarly over this time period. Even so, most\nobservers expect this source of convergence in inflationary outcomes to eventually fade\nand thereafter not affect monetary policy paths over the medium term.\nIn contrast, a more persistent source of convergence may be found in an apparent\ndecline in the neutral rate of interest. The neutral rate of interest--or the rate of interest\nconsistent with the economy remaining at its potential rate of output and inflation\nremaining at target level--appears to have declined over the past 30 years in the United\nStates and is now at historically low levels.6 Similarly, longer-run interest rates appear\nalso to have fallen across a broad group of advanced and emerging market economies,\nsuggesting that neutral rates are at historically low levels in many countries around the\nworld and near or below zero in the major advanced foreign economies.7 Although the\nreasons for the declines in neutral rates are not perfectly understood and may differ across\ncountries, there are some common drivers, such as slower productivity and labor force\ngrowth and a heightened sensitivity to risk.8\n5 In five of the six quarters since mid-2014, the price of oil has decreased for a cumulative decline of\n70 percent.\n6 See Brainard (2015b), Hamilton and others (2015), Kiley (2015a), Laubach and Williams (2015), and\nJohannsen and Mertens (2016).\n7 See Hamilton and others (2015), Del Negro and others (2015), and chapter 3 of World Economic Outlook\n(International Monetary Fund, 2014).\n8 While the empirical link between potential growth and the neutral rate is not precisely estimated, the\nevidence suggests that slower trend growth is associated with lower interest rates; see Laubach and\nWilliams (2015) and Hamilton and others (2015). U.S. labor force growth has slowed from 1 percent from\n2001 to 2004 to 1/2 percent over the most recent 4 years. Over the same periods, euro-area growth has\nslowed from 1.3 percent to 0.4 percent. In Japan the labor force was essentially flat from 2011 to 2015,\nthough this was a slight improvement from a small rate of decline in the early 2000s. Productivity growth\nover the same periods has slowed from 3.0 percent to 0.5 percent in the United States, from 0.6 percent to\n0.2 percent in the euro area, and 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent in Japan.\n\n- 6 -\nThe very low levels of the shorter run neutral rate reflect in part headwinds from\nthe crisis that are likely to dissipate over time. However, if many of the common forces\nholding down neutral rates prove persistent, then neutral rates may remain low through\nthe medium term, implying a shallower path for policy trajectories.\nThe global economy is also experiencing a downshift in emerging market growth\nmomentum led by China, which may prove somewhat persistent. Whereas earlier in the\nrecovery there was a striking divergence between the relatively buoyant growth in major\nemerging economies and depressed growth in advanced economies, lately the extent of\ndivergence has diminished noticeably.9 China is undergoing a challenging set of\neconomic transitions. Trend growth has slowed substantially and is expected to slow\nfurther, and the composition of growth is shifting away from resource-intensive\nmanufacturing and exports toward a greater share for consumption and services. China’s\ninvestment has slowed sharply recently after accounting for nearly one-third of global\ninvestment over the past three years and about one-half of global consumption in certain\nmetals such as iron ore, aluminum, copper, and nickel. Commodity exporters and close\ntrading partners in Asia will be most affected, but the changes in the composition and rate\nof growth in a country that has accounted for about one-third of the growth in world\noutput and trade will likely ripple through the global economy much more generally.\nRegarding sensitivity to risk, the risk premium for capital investment appears to have increased since\nthe crisis; see Del Negro and others (2015). A higher risk premium requires a lower risk-free rate to\ngenerate an equivalent level of investment.\n9 From the end of 2009 to the end of 2013, growth in important U.S. emerging market trading partners\naveraged 4.7 percent, while growth in advanced economies averaged 1.8 percent. However, in 2014\nemerging country growth slowed to 3.3 percent, compared with 1.6 percent in advanced economies, and for\nthe first three quarters of 2015, annualized growth was 2.5 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.\n\n- 7 -\nAmplified Spillovers\nOf course, policy divergence among major economies could be limited by rapid\nand strong transmission of foreign shocks across borders. In particular, although the U.S.\nreal economy has traditionally been seen as more insulated from foreign trade shocks\nthan many smaller economies, the combination of the highly global role of the dollar and\nU.S. financial markets and the proximity to the zero lower bound may be amplifying\nspillovers from foreign financial conditions. By one rough estimate, accounting for the\nnet effect of exchange rate appreciation and changes in equity valuations and long term\nyields, over the past year and a half, the United States has experienced a tightening of\nfinancial conditions that is the equivalent of an additional increase of over 75 basis points\nin the federal funds rate.10\nThe transmission of divergent economic conditions across borders typically\noccurs though a couple of different channels. First, a decline in demand in one country\nreduces its demand for imports from other countries. Second, the fall in economic\nactivity would be expected to trigger a more accommodative monetary policy, which\nhelps offset the effect of the shock by both supporting domestic demand and weakening\nthe exchange rate. The weaker exchange rate in turn leads domestic consumers to switch\ntheir expenditures away from more expensive foreign imports to cheaper domestic\nproducts while increasing the competitiveness of exports. The extent to which monetary\npolicy offsets the shock by dispersing it to trade partners as opposed to strengthening\n10 These estimates are based on rough rules of thumb regarding the effects on output of changes in long-\nterm interest rates, equity prices, the exchange rate, and the federal funds rate from the FRB/US model and\nassume a highly persistent change in the federal funds rate. Some private-forecaster estimates of financial\ntightening--expressed in terms of the federal funds rate--are larger, which may reflect an assumption of a\nless persistent funds rate change. An alternative estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s\nDSGE model, which explicitly includes a financial sector, suggests the tightening in financial conditions\nsince mid-2015 is equivalent to an increase in the federal funds rate of roughly 100 basis points.\n\n- 8 -\ndomestic demand depends on the responsiveness of domestic demand relative to the\nexchange rate. The exchange rate channel, by raising the price of imports in domestic\ncurrency, also pushes up domestic inflation and exerts downward pressure on foreign\ninflation.\nThe strength of spillovers across countries and the extent to which that affects\npolicy divergence across countries depend on a foreign economy’s openness to these\ndifferent channels. The recent experience of Sweden suggests that for highly open\neconomies, the effect of foreign shocks can be extremely powerful.11 Sweden’s\neconomic growth has been relatively rapid recently, reaching nearly 4 percent over the\nmost recent four quarters. Moreover, the employment gap is estimated to be nearly\nclosed, and there are signs of financial excess in the housing market. In ordinary times,\nthese conditions would be consistent with relatively tight monetary policy. However,\ninflation has run persistently well below the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target.\nGiven the relative openness of Sweden’s economy, moving the inflation rate back up to\ntarget has been greatly complicated by the sensitivity of Sweden’s exchange rate and\nfinancial conditions to developments in the euro area, where domestic economic\nconditions are consistent with much more accommodative policy. As a result, the\nRiksbank has been pursuing extremely accommodative monetary policy, most recently\nlowering the interest rate on deposits to minus 0.5 percent and authorizing the Governor\nand Deputy Governor to intervene in foreign currency markets.\nEven in the much larger United States economy, with imports accounting for a\nlittle over 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), spillovers can be quite strong, in\n11 Imports and exports each account for a little under one-half of Sweden’s GDP.\n\n- 9 -\npart reflecting the international role of U.S. financial markets and the dollar. Since the\nmiddle of 2014, with a reassessment of demand growth in the euro area and subsequently\nin emerging markets and other commodity exporters, the real trade-weighted value of the\ndollar has increased nearly 20 percent. As a result, in 2014 and 2015, net exports\nsubtracted a little over 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth each year, and\neconometric models point to a subtraction of a further 1 percentage point this year.12 In\naddition, the dollar’s appreciation is estimated to have put significant downward pressure\non inflation: Non-oil import prices fell 3-1/2 percent in 2015, subtracting an estimated\n1/2 percentage point from core PCE inflation.13\nFinancial channels can powerfully propagate negative shocks in one market by\ncatalyzing a broader reassessment of risks and increases in risk spreads across many\nfinancial markets. Since the beginning of the year, U.S. financial markets have reacted\nstrongly to adverse news on emerging market growth, even though the news on the U.S.\nlabor market has remained positive. In this regard, although China’s direct imports from\nthe United States are modest, uncertainty about changes to its exchange rate system and\nfinancial imbalances, together with changes in the composition of its growth, have had\nbroader global spillovers that may pose risks to the U.S. outlook.\nRecent events suggest the transmission of foreign shocks can take place extremely\nquickly such that financial markets anticipate and indeed may thereby front-run the\nexpected monetary policy reactions to these developments. It also appears that the\nexchange rate channel may have played a particularly important role recently in\ntransmitting economic and financial developments across national borders. Indeed,\n12 See Gruber, McCallum, and Vigfusson (2016).\n13 See pp. 8-9 of the February 2016 Monetary Policy Report (Board of Governors, 2016).\n\n- 10 -\nrecent research suggests that financial transmission is likely to be amplified in economies\nwith near-zero interest rates, such that anticipated monetary policy adjustments in one\neconomy may contribute more to a shifting of demand across borders than a boost to\noverall demand.14 This finding could explain why the sensitivity of exchange rate\nmovements to economic news and to changes in foreign monetary policy appear to have\nbeen relatively elevated recently.\nFinancial tightening associated with cross-border spillovers may be limiting the\nextent to which U.S. policy diverges from major economies. As policy adjusts to the\nevolution of the data, the combination of heightened spillovers from weaker foreign\neconomies, along with a lower neutral rate, could result in a lower policy path in the\nUnited States relative to what many had predicted.\nPolicy\nIn circumstances where many economies face common negative shocks or where\nnegative shocks in one country are quickly transmitted across borders, it is natural to\nconsider whether coordination can improve outcomes. Under certain conditions--such as\nflexible exchange rates, deep and well-regulated financial markets, and flexible product\nand labor markets--policies designed for the domestic economy can readily offset any\nspillovers from economic conditions abroad, and policies designed to address domestic\nconditions can achieve desirable outcomes both within the national economy and more\nbroadly.15\nIn some circumstances, however, cooperation can be quite helpful. If, for\nexample, economies face a common challenge, coordination can communicate to markets\n14 See Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2015).\n15 See Brainard (2015a).\n\n- 11 -\nthat policymakers recognize the challenge and will work to address it. Reducing\nuncertainty about the direction of policy and addressing concerns about policies working\nat cross-purposes can boost the confidence of businesses and households. With\nintensified transmission effects in the vicinity of the zero lower bound, there is a risk that\nuncoordinated policy on its own could have the effect of shifting demand across borders\nrather than addressing the underlying weakness in global demand. The difficult start to\nthe year should be a prompt for greater policy coherence and clarity. This might be a\ngood time for policymakers to reaffirm their commitment to work toward the common\ngoal of strengthening global demand.\nSimilarly, with anemic global demand and interest rates near zero, in some\neconomies there is scope for monetary policy to be more effective with fiscal policy\nworking in the same direction. With potential growth and nominal borrowing rates both\nlow, public investment that increases potential in the longer run and demand in the\nshorter run could make an important contribution. A joint determination by policymakers\nacross major economies to better deploy policy tools to provide support for global\ndemand could be beneficial.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nBlanchard, Olivier (2016). “The U.S. Phillips Curve: Back to the 60s?” Policy Brief\nPB16-1.

I would argue we are at a pivotal moment when many of the key requirements\nthat apply differentially to the biggest and most complex institutions will be finalized and their\nimpact will become clear.\nIn the immediate wake of the crisis, the central focus was to reduce leverage and build\ncapital across the banking system while also addressing risks in derivatives and short-term\nwholesale funding markets. For instance, considerable effort went into the new Basel III capital\nframework, whose key elements apply across the entire banking system.3 With these important\nfoundations laid, attention turned to the tougher standards for institutions whose size and\ncomplexity are such that their distress could pose risks to the system as a whole.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 This also applies to nonbank financial companies that have been designated as systemically important\n3 With the exception of bank holding companies that have under $1 billion in assets.\n\n- 2 -\nTailoring Standards for Greater Systemic Risk\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the Board to adopt enhanced prudential standards for large\nbanking organizations, as well as for nonbank financial companies that have been designated as\nsystemically important, and to tailor the standards so that their stringency increases in proportion\nto the systemic footprint of the institutions to which they apply. In addition, rigorous planning\nand operational readiness for recovery and resolution are required to ensure that big, complex\ninstitutions are subject to the same market discipline of failure as other normal companies in\nAmerica.4\nWithin this framework, the first line of defense is to require big, complex institutions to\nmaintain a very substantial stack of common equity in order to enhance loss absorbency and to\ninduce the institutions to internalize the associated risks to the system. These requirements are\ndesigned to lower their probability of “material financial distress or failure” in order “to prevent\nor mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States.5\n4 The regulatory and supervisory framework for banking organizations incorporates multiple thresholds. Banking\norganizations with less than $1 billion in assets generally qualify under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy\nStatement and are not subject to holding company risk-based capital requirements. Banking organizations and\ncertain other financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets are subject to the incentive compensation\nprovisions in section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Banking organizations with more than $10 billion in assets are\nsubject to the Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress test requirement, risk committee requirement, and requirement\nfor a separate Volcker rule compliance program. Banking organizations with $50 billion or more in assets are\nsubject to enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements under sections 165 and 166 of the odd-\nFrank Act, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and capital plan rule, and a modified Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio. Banking organizations with either more than $250 billion in total assets or more than $10 billion in\non-balance-sheet foreign exposures are subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements, the full\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio, the Basel III supplementary leverage ratio, and the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement. Global systemically important banking organizations are subject to the enhanced supplementary\nleverage ratio and the supervisory Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR), and would be subject to\nrisk-based capital surcharge requirements under the Board’s outstanding proposal. They may also be subject to a\nlong-term debt requirement.\n5 See Dodd-Frank Act section 165(a)(1); and Daniel K. Tarullo (2013), “Macroprudential Regulation,” speech\ndelivered at the Yale Law School Conference on Challenges in Global Financial Services, New Haven, Connecticut,\nSeptember 20, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20130920a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nThe proposed capital surcharge is the regulatory requirement that is most clearly\ncalibrated to the size and complexity of an institution. Last December, the Board proposed a\nframework of risk-based capital surcharges for the eight U.S. banking organizations identified as\nglobal systemically important banks by the Financial Stability Board. The capital surcharges\nunder the proposal are estimated to range from 1.0 percent to 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets\nbased on 2013 data. The capital surcharge would be required over and above the 7 percent\nminimum and capital conservation buffer required for all banking organizations under Basel III,\nand in addition to any countercyclical capital buffer.\nThe capital surcharge is designed to build additional resilience and lessen the chances of\nan institution’s failure in proportion to the risks posed by the institution to the financial system\nand broader economy. The surcharge is calibrated so that the expected costs to the system from\nthe failure of a systemic banking institution are equal to the expected costs from the failure of a\nsizeable but not-systemic banking organization. In other words, if the failure of a systemic\nbanking institution would have five times the system-wide costs as the failure of a sizeable but\nnot-systemic banking organization, the systemic banking institution would be required to hold\nenough additional capital that the probability of its failure would be one-fifth as high. The capital\nsurcharge should help ensure that the senior management and the boards of the largest, most\ncomplex institutions take into account the risks their activities pose to the system.\nImportantly, the surcharge is calibrated in proportion to how an institution scores on\nspecific metrics that capture the system-wide costs of its failure--risks associated with size,\ninterconnectedness, complexity, cross-border activities, substitutability, and short-term\nwholesale funding. With respect to the last, the logic is that greater reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding increases the risks of creditor runs and asset fire sales that can both erode the\n\n- 4 -\ninstitution’s capital and spark contagion. By calibrating the enhanced capital expectation in\ndirect proportion to a set of measures of size, interconnectedness, and complexity, the proposal\nprovides clear and measurable incentives for institutions to simplify and reduce their systemic\nfootprint.\nSecond, the crisis also provided a stark reminder that what may seem like thick capital\ncushions in good times may prove dangerously thin at moments of stress, when losses soar and\nasset valuations plummet. Therefore, in addition to static capital requirements, large banking\ninstitutions must undergo the forward-looking Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR) and supervisory stress test each year to assess whether the amount of capital they hold is\nsufficient to continue operations through periods of economic stress and market turbulence, and\nwhether their capital planning framework is adequate to their risk profile.\nWhile supervisory stress tests with adverse and severely adverse macroeconomic\nscenarios are required by statute for all bank holding companies with assets over $50 billion, for\nthe eight U.S. systemic banking institutions, the stress tests are tailored to include a counterparty\ndefault scenario, and, for the six systemic institutions with significant trading activities, the stress\ntests also include a global market shock. In significant part as a result of these additional\nrequirements, in 2015, the eight systemic institutions needed to hold common equity worth 4.7\npercent of risk-weighted assets on average above the 7 percent minimum and capital\nconservation buffer in order to meet the CCAR post-stress minimum requirement, given their\nplanned capital distributions. That’s more than twice the average common equity increment\nabove the regulatory capital minimum plus capital conservation buffer required of the next\nlargest group of banks, those with $250 billion or more in assets that are not globally systemic.\n\n- 5 -\nIn addition to the quantitative assessments, CCAR provides a powerful process for\nassessing the quality of each institution’s risk modeling and internal controls on a portfolio by\nportfolio basis. This is particularly important for institutions where the sheer size and complexity\nof their activities make it very challenging for even the highest-quality senior executives to\neffectively monitor and control risk.\nThe CCAR and stress test exercises provide valuable, forward-looking mechanisms to\nensure that large banking institutions can meet their minimum capital ratios through the cycle.\nFor the systemic banking institutions, it will be important to assess incorporating the risk-based\ncapital surcharge in some form into the CCAR post-stress minimum in order to ensure these\ninstitutions remain sufficiently resilient to reduce the expected losses to the system through\nperiods of financial and economic stress. Conceptually, the stress test and the capital surcharge\nshould work to reinforce each other--not to substitute for each other.\nThird, as we learned from the crisis, risk modeling and risk weighting are subject to\nconsiderable uncertainty, and stressed financial markets can make even the most rigorous risk\nassessments look optimistic in hindsight. Thus, the Basel III capital framework includes a\nsimple, non-risk-adjusted ceiling on leverage that is designed not to bind under most\ncircumstances while providing a robust cushion as a backstop. Although all internationally active\nU.S. banking organizations are subject to a 3 percent leverage standard that takes into account\non- and off-balance sheet exposures under Basel III,6 our systemic banking institutions are\nrequired to meet a higher 5 percent leverage standard. The higher leverage standard for the\nsystemic banking institutions is designed as a backstop to the surcharge-enhanced risk-based\n6 All banking organizations with assets over $1 billion.\n\n- 6 -\ncapital standard, reflecting the higher potential losses to the system from the failure of systemic\ninstitutions.\nFourth, in addition to the surcharge, regulatory minimum, and capital conservation\nbuffer, starting in 2016 and phasing in through 2019, the U.S. banking agencies could require the\nlargest, most complex U.S. banking firms to hold a countercyclical capital buffer of up to\n2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets when it is warranted by rising macroprudential risks.\nIn sum, if the tailored capital framework that is under construction had been in place in\n2007, the largest, most complex banking institutions could have been required to hold common\nequity of up to 14 percent of risk-weighted assets on average, which is roughly double the\namount of common equity they held at the time.\nFifth, the crisis shined a harsh light on the severe inadequacies in the banking system not\nonly in capital, but also with respect to liquidity risk management. At key moments of financial\nstress, run-like behavior in the short-term funding markets threatened the solvency of some large,\ncomplex banking organizations and compelled them to engage in asset fire sales. As part of the\nenhanced prudential standards mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III liquidity\nreforms, large banking organizations are now required to maintain substantial buffers of high-\nquality liquid assets calibrated to their funding needs in stressed financial conditions. They are\nalso required to maintain certain amounts of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics\nof their assets.\n\n- 7 -\nAs with assessments of capital, supervisors also evaluate liquidity at the largest firms in\nannual horizontal exercises called the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR).7\nIn part because of these measures, the total amount of high-quality liquid assets held by the eight\nU.S. systemic banking institutions has increased by over 60 percent, or $1 trillion, since 2011 to\n$2.4 trillion currently. And whereas these institutions were materially more reliant on short-term\nwholesale funding than deposits before the crisis, now the reverse is the case.\nFinally, the structure of incentive compensation also came under scrutiny post-crisis with\nthe recognition that the heavy emphasis on stock options and bonuses created skewed incentives\nthat provided substantial rewards for short-term risk taking going into the crisis. The logic of\nimposing tougher standards on large and complex institutions whose activities could pose risks\nto the broader financial system extends to requiring better alignment of the incentives of senior\nexecutives and senior risk managers with the longer-term fortunes of their banking institutions.\nMost simply, this calls for a greater share of compensation to be deferred for several years.\nUnder the proposal issued by the Board and other federal financial regulatory agencies in 2011 to\nimplement section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, at least 50 percent of incentive compensation of\ncertain executive officers at financial institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or\nmore would have to be deferred over a period of at least three years, and the deferred amounts\nwould need to be adjusted for actual losses that are realized during the deferral period.8\nBeyond this, for systemic banking institutions, I would like to see consideration given to\nchanging the structure of deferred compensation so that it better balances the interests of the full\n7 Moreover, the component of the Board’s proposed risk-based capital surcharge linked to short-term wholesale\nfunding is designed to help address the distinct financial stability risks posed by the systemic banking institutions’\nreliance on less stable sources of funding. See www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-\nsupervision.htm for a current list of firms in the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee portfolio.\n8 See 76 Fed. Reg. 21170 (April 14, 2011), www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-04-14/pdf/2011-7937.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nset of the firm’s stakeholders over the longer term. In particular, when evaluating risky\nactivities, senior executives should internalize not only the upside risk faced by stockholders, but\nalso the downside risk borne by bondholders, especially as that better aligns with the public\ninterest in reducing the likelihood of material financial distress or failure at the systemic banking\ninstitutions.9 This set of considerations should help to inform ongoing deliberations regarding\nimplementation the Dodd-Frank Act incentive compensation provisions.\nMaking Failure Safe\nYou can see now why I argue we are reaching a key moment in our efforts to build a\nmore resilient financial system. In combination, these more stringent standards, several of which\nare still in train, should prove powerful in inducing systemic banking institutions to reduce the\nrisks they pose to the system. Beyond this, Congress sought to address too big to fail by\nrequiring systemic institutions to plan and prepare for failure, and by creating a new “orderly\nliquidation authority.” Under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, large bank holding\ncompanies are required to submit credible plans for their rapid and orderly resolution under the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the orderly liquidation authority created under title II of the\nDodd-Frank Act empowers the U.S. government to put a failing systemic banking institution into\na governmental resolution procedure as an alternative to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code.10\nThe resolution planning process provides regulators with an important tool to address too\nbig to fail. And we have set the bar realistically high, reflecting lessons from the crisis in the\n9 See Sally Krawcheck (February 5, 2013), “Top 10 Reasons Paying Banks Exec's in More Stock is a Bad Idea,”\nLinkedIn, https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130205191934-174077701-top-10-reasons-paying-banks-exec-s-in-\nmore-stock-is-a-really-bad-idea?trk=mp-reader-card.\n10 Martin J. Gruenberg (2015), “A Progress Report on the Resolution of Systemically Important Financial\nInstitutions,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., May 12,\nwww.fdic.gov/news/news/speeches/spmay1215.html.\n\n- 9 -\nrequirements that large banking institutions must meet to ensure their plans and preparations are\nnot deemed to be deficient by the regulators.11\nEarlier this month, the eight U.S. systemic banking institutions submitted their most\nrecent resolution plans, which are currently under review. Each of the submissions must provide\ndetailed work plans in several specific areas that have been found to be critical for orderly\nresolution.\nFirst, an orderly resolution requires that the large, complex firms simplify and rationalize\ntheir structures to align their legal entities with business lines and reduce the web of\ninterdependencies among them to ensure separability along business lines. As the crisis made\nclear, the tangled web of thousands of interconnected legal entities that were allowed to\nproliferate in the run up to the crisis stymied orderly wind down and contributed to uncertainty\nand contagion.\nSecond, the largest, most complex banking organizations must demonstrate operational\ncapabilities for resolution preparedness.12 These capabilities include maintaining an ongoing,\ncomprehensive understanding of the obligations and exposures associated with payment,\nclearing, and settlement activities across all the material legal entities and developing strong\nprocesses for managing, identifying, and valuing collateral across all the material legal entities.\nCapabilities for resolution preparedness also include establishing mechanisms to ensure that\nthere would be adequate capital, liquidity, and funding available to each material legal entity\nunder stressed market conditions to facilitate orderly resolution.\n11 Deficient is defined under the Dodd-Frank Act as “not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of the\ncovered company under the Bankruptcy code.”\n12 See Supervision and Regulation Letter 14-1, www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/SR1401.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nThese steps, in turn, hinge on each institution demonstrating the requisite management\ninformation systems capabilities to ensure that key data related to each material legal entity’s\nfinancial condition, financial and operational interconnectedness, and third-party commitments is\nreadily accessible on a real-time basis.\nFourth, the largest, most complex banking organizations are required to develop robust\noperational and legal frameworks to ensure continuity in the provision of shared or outsourced\nservices to maintain critical operations during the resolution process.\nFifth, the largest, most complex banking organizations are in the process of amending\nfinancial contracts to provide for a stay of early termination rights of external counterparties,\nrecognizing that the triggering of cross-default provisions proved to be a major accelerant of\ncontagion at the height of the crisis and greatly impeded cross border cooperation.\nSixth, the largest, most complex banking organizations are required to develop a clean\ntop-tier holding company structure, in which the parent’s obligations are not supported by\nguarantees provided by operating subsidiaries, to support resolvability. This will be critical for\nany institution pursuing the single point of entry strategy.\nIn addition, the publicly disclosed summary of each institution’s plan is required to\ninclude information on the strategy for resolving each material legal entity and what an\ninstitution would look like following resolution in order to bolster public and market confidence\nthat resolution would be orderly.\nWe look forward to assessing the plans submitted earlier this month, which we expect to\ndemonstrate concrete progress on the detailed feedback that was provided by the regulators over\nthe past year. In parallel, Board supervision staff have been engaged in an extensive horizontal\n\n- 11 -\nreview of the operational readiness of the systemic banking institutions on several dimensions of\nthe resolution planning that were detailed in earlier supervisory guidance. Together, the annual\nplan submissions along with the ongoing supervisory examination of operational readiness\nprovide potent, complementary mechanisms in addressing too big to fail.\nFinally, in order to make the firms resolvable, it will be necessary for the largest, most\ncomplex firms to maintain enough long-term debt at the top-tier holding company that could be\nconverted into equity to recapitalize the institution’s critical operating subsidiaries so as to\nprevent contagion. The availability of sufficient capacity at the parent to both absorb losses and\nrecapitalize the critical operating subsidiaries is designed to provide comfort to other creditors of\nthe firm and thereby forestall destructive runs, since the long-term unsecured debt issued by the\nparent holding company would be structurally subordinate to the claims on the operating\nsubsidiaries.13 We are in the process of developing a proposal for a long-term debt requirement\nthat would fully address the estimated capital needs of each institution in a gone-concern\nscenario.\nScale and Scope\nHaving provided a detailed assessment of the measures Congress chose to require in\norder to address too big to fail, it is worth spending a minute reflecting on what Congress chose\nnot to require in the Dodd-Frank Act. In particular, it is noteworthy that Congress did not\nprescribe major changes to scope or scale of systemic institutions in the too-big-to-fail toolkit.14\n13 Notably, the Financial Stability Board’s proposed Total Loss Absorbency Capacity (TLAC) framework would\nalso require global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) to deduct TLAC issued by other G-SIBs from their own\nTLAC exposures. This provision is critical to ensuring that authorities can impose losses on TLAC holders without\ngenerating contagion.\n14 Two partial exceptions are the Volcker rule and the swaps push-out provision. The former prevents banking\norganizations from engaging in most forms of proprietary trading and limits their investments in private funds, while\n\n- 12 -\nOne rationale is that the public sector on its own is unlikely to be the best judge of the\noptimal scope and scale of financial institutions. While the private sector may be in a better\nposition to judge the market benefits associated with economies of scope and scale and business\nmodels associated with particular banking organizations, the public sector is likely to be a better\njudge of the risks that their size, interconnectedness, and complexity pose to the financial system.\nAccordingly, the Dodd-Frank Act assigns regulators the responsibility for calibrating\nrequirements such that investors, senior executives, and board members internalize those risks.\nNotwithstanding the fact that the law does not prescribe broad structural changes, some\nobservers may judge whether reform has gone far enough based on the extent of changes in the\nscope or scale of the U.S. systemic banking institutions relative to the crisis. These eight\nbanking institutions now hold $10.6 trillion in total assets and account for 57 percent of total\nassets in the U.S. banking system today--not materially different from the $9.4 trillion and 60\npercent of total assets in 2009. And while some of the U.S. systemic banking institutions have\nreduced their capital markets activity, they remain the largest dealers in those markets.\nTo be fair, we are entering an important period when the more stringent standards that we\nare putting in place to reduce expected losses to the system should inform the cost-benefit\nanalysis of these institutions’ size and structure. As standards for systemically important firms\ntighten, some institutions may determine that it is in the best interest of their stakeholders to\nreduce their systemic footprint. Indeed, there already have been some notable structural changes\nthe latter prohibits the provision of federal assistance to certain swaps entities. However, these provisions apply to\nbanking organizations broadly and are not limited in their scope to large or more complicated institutions.\nWith regard to size, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a cap on concentration for purposes of mergers and\nacquisitions, and includes size thresholds for some of its provisions, but it does not set precise limits on the size of\nfinancial institutions and imposes no limits on organic growth. Section 622 of the act, for example, says that a\n“financial company may not merge or consolidate with … another company if the total consolidated liabilities of the\nacquiring financial company upon consummation of the transaction would exceed 10 percent of the aggregate\nconsolidated liabilities of all financial institutions,” which limit is currently assessed at approximately $2.16 trillion.\n\n- 13 -\nat a few of the largest institutions over the past few years that are not readily apparent from\nlooking at the aggregate assets across the systemic institutions. But it is also possible that some\nmay judge that the economies of scale and scope are such that it makes sense to maintain their\nsystemic footprint, even at the expense of the greater regulatory burdens necessary to protect the\nsystem relative to those faced by their non-systemic competitors.\nOne thing we can all agree is that we have a more resilient and dynamic financial system\nas a result of having a very large number of banking organizations, in different size classes,\npursuing different business models. Indeed, that diversity is one of the hallmarks of the U.S.\nsystem, which distinguishes it from many other advanced economies. Accordingly, we want to\nmake sure that our regulatory framework supports banks in the middle of the size spectrum, as\nwell as community banks, and the customers they serve. Thus, by the same rationale that argues\nfor the greater stringency of the standards associated with greater systemic risk at the top end of\nthe scale and complexity spectrum, we will carefully examine opportunities to ease burdens at\nthe lower end of the spectrum. And we will want to continue to refine our regulatory standards,\nusing the authorities under Dodd-Frank to make sure they are tailored to be commensurate with\nthe risk to the system.",

As we work to future-proof our financial stability agenda, it is important\nto ensure the regulatory perimeter encompasses crypto finance.\nDistinguishing Responsible Innovation from Regulatory Evasion\nNew technology often holds the promise of increasing competition in the financial\nsystem, reducing transaction costs and settlement times, and channeling investment to\nproductive new uses. But early on, new products and platforms are often fraught with\nrisks, including fraud and manipulation, and it is important and sometimes difficult to\ndistinguish between hype and value. If past innovation cycles are any guide, in order for\ndistributed ledgers, smart contracts, programmability, and digital assets to fulfill their\npotential to bring competition, efficiency, and speed, it will be essential to address the\nbasic risks that beset all forms of finance. These risks include runs, fire sales,\ndeleveraging, interconnectedness, and contagion, along with fraud, manipulation, and\nevasion. In addition, it is important to be on the lookout for the possibility of new forms\nof risks, since many of the technological innovations underpinning the crypto ecosystem\nare relatively novel.\nFar from stifling innovation, strong regulatory guardrails will help enable\ninvestors and developers to build a resilient digital native financial infrastructure. Strong\n1 I am grateful to Joseph Cox and Molly Mahar of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in\npreparing this text. The views expressed here address broad principles from a financial stability\nperspective across the financial system and not specific regulations. These views are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nregulatory guardrails will help banks, payments providers, and financial technology\ncompanies (FinTechs) improve the customer experience, make settlement faster, reduce\ncosts, and allow for rapid product improvement and customization.\nWe are closely monitoring recent events where risks in the system have\ncrystallized and many crypto investors have suffered losses. Despite significant investor\nlosses, the crypto financial system does not yet appear to be so large or so interconnected\nwith the traditional financial system as to pose a systemic risk. So this is the right time to\nensure that like risks are subject to like regulatory outcomes and like disclosure so as to\nhelp investors distinguish between genuine, responsible innovation and the false allure of\nseemingly easy returns that obscures significant risk. This is the right time to establish\nwhich crypto activities are permissible for regulated entities and under what constraints\nso that spillovers to the core financial system remain well contained.\nInsights from Recent Turbulence\nSeveral important insights have emerged from the recent turbulence in the crypto-\nfinance ecosystem. First, volatility in financial markets has provided important\ninformation about crypto’s performance as an asset class. It was already clear that\ncrypto-assets are volatile, and we continue to see wild swings in crypto-asset values. The\nprice of Bitcoin has dropped by as much as 75 percent from its all-time high over the past\nseven months, and it has declined almost 60 percent in the three months from April\nthrough June. Most other prominent crypto-assets have experienced even steeper\ndeclines over the same period. Contrary to claims that crypto-assets are a hedge to\ninflation or an uncorrelated asset class, crypto-assets have plummeted in value and have\n\n- 3 -\nproven to be highly correlated with riskier equities and with risk appetite more\ngenerally.2\nSecond, the Terra crash reminds us how quickly an asset that purports to maintain\na stable value relative to fiat currency can become subject to a run. The collapse of Terra\nand the previous failures of several other unbacked algorithmic stablecoins are\nreminiscent of classic runs throughout history. New technology and financial\nengineering cannot by themselves convert risky assets into safe ones.\nThird, crypto platforms are highly vulnerable to deleveraging, fire sales, and\ncontagion—risks that are well known from traditional finance—as illustrated by the\nfreeze on withdrawals at some crypto lending platforms and exchanges and the\nbankruptcy of a prominent crypto hedge fund. Some retail investors have found their\naccounts frozen and suffered large losses. Large crypto players that used leverage to\nboost returns are scrambling to monetize their holdings, missing margin calls, and facing\npossible insolvency. As their distress intensifies, it has become clear that the crypto\necosystem is tightly interconnected, as many smaller traders, lenders, and DeFi\n(decentralized finance) protocols have concentrated exposures to these big players.\nFinally, we have seen how decentralized lending, which relies on\novercollateralization to substitute for intermediation, can serve as a stress amplifier by\ncreating waves of liquidations as prices fall.3\n2 See, for example, the discussion in section 2 of Financial Stability Board (2022), Assessment of Risks to\nFinancial Stability from Crypto-assets (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, February), https://www.fsb.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/P160222.pdf.\n3 Most decentralized lending protocols require loans to remain overcollateralized, with loans that fall below\nspecific thresholds subject to automatic liquidations. These liquidations can have a persistent effect on\nasset prices, which often triggers further liquidations. See preliminary research in Alfred Lehar and\nChristine A. Parlour (2022), “Systemic Fragility in Decentralized Markets,” unpublished paper, June 13,\nhttps://econ.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/Doc/20220616_LEHAR.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nSame Risk, Same Regulatory Outcome\nThe recent turbulence and losses among retail investors in crypto highlight the\nurgent need to ensure compliance with existing regulations and to fill any gaps where\nregulations or enforcement may need to be tailored—for instance, for decentralized\nprotocols and platforms. As we consider how to address the potential future financial\nstability risks of the evolving crypto financial system, it is important to start with strong\nbasic regulatory foundations. A good macroprudential framework builds on a solid\nfoundation of microprudential regulation. Future financial resilience will be greatly\nenhanced if we ensure the regulatory perimeter encompasses the crypto financial system\nand reflects the principle of same risk, same disclosure, same regulatory outcome. By\nextending the perimeter and applying like regulatory outcomes and like transparency to\nlike risks, it will enable regulators to more effectively address risks within crypto markets\nand potential risks posed by crypto markets to the broader financial system. Strong\nguardrails for safety and soundness, market integrity, and investor and consumer\nprotection will help ensure that new digital finance products, platforms, and activities are\nbased on genuine economic value and not on regulatory evasion, which ultimately leaves\ninvestors more exposed than they may appreciate.\nDue to the cross-sectoral and cross-border scope of crypto platforms, exchanges,\nand activities, it is important that regulators work together domestically and\ninternationally to maintain a stable financial system and address regulatory evasion. The\nsame-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle guides the Financial Stability Board’s work\non stablecoins, crypto-assets, and DeFi; the Basel consultation on the prudential\ntreatment of crypto-assets; the work by the International Organization of Securities\n\n- 5 -\nCommissions’ FinTech network; the work by federal bank regulatory agencies on the\nappropriate treatment of crypto activities at U.S. banks; and a host of other international\nand domestic work.4\nIn implementing a same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle, we should start\nby ensuring basic protections are in place for consumers and investors. Retail users\nshould be protected against exploitation, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and market\nmanipulation—risks to which they are particularly vulnerable, according to a host of\nresearch.5 If investors lack these basic protections, these markets will be vulnerable to\nruns.\nSecond, since trading platforms play a critical role in crypto-asset markets, it is\nimportant to address noncompliance and any gaps that may exist. We have seen crypto-\ntrading platforms and crypto-lending firms not only engage in activities similar to those\nin traditional finance without comparable regulatory compliance, but also combine\n4 See, for example, Financial Stability Board (2022), Assessment of Risks to Financial Stability from\nCrypto-assets (Basel, Switzerland: FSB, February), https://www.fsb.org/2022/02/assessment-of-risks-to-\nfinancial-stability-from-crypto-assets; Financial Stability Board (2020), Regulation, Supervision and\nOversight of “Global Stablecoin” Arrangements: Final Report and High-Level Recommendations (Basel,\nSwitzerland: FSB, October), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-3.pdf; Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision (2022), “Consultative Document: Second Consultation on the Prudential Treatment\nof Cryptoasset Exposures” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, June),\nhttps://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d533.pdf; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2021), “Joint Statement on\nCrypto-Asset Policy Sprint Initiative and Next Steps,” joint press release, November 23,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20211123a1.pdf.\n5 See, for example, Philip Daian, Steven Goldfeder, Tyler Kell, Yunqi Li, Xueyuan Zhao, Iddo Bentov,\nLorenz Breidenbach, and Ari Juels (2019), “Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and\nConsensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges,” unpublished paper, Cornell University, arXiv, April,\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf; Raphael Auer, Jon Frost, and Jose María Vidal Pastor (2022),\n“Miners as Intermediaries: Extractable Value and Market Manipulation in Crypto and DeFi,” BIS\nBulletin 58 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, June),\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull58.pdf; Paul Barnes (2018), “Crypto Currency and Its Susceptibility to\nSpeculative Bubbles Manipulation, Scams and Fraud,” Journal of Advanced Studies in Finance, vol. 9\n(Winter), pp. 60–77; and Felix Eigelshoven, André Ullrich, and Douglas Parry (2021), “Cryptocurrency\nMarket Manipulation—A Systematic Literature Review,” in ICIS 2021 Proceedings on “Building\nSustainability and Resilience with IS: A Call for Action” (Austin, Tex.: International Conference on\nInformation Systems, Dec. 12–15).\n\n- 6 -\nactivities that are required to be separated in traditional financial markets. For example,\nsome platforms combine market infrastructure and client facilitation with risk-taking\nbusinesses like asset creation, proprietary trading, venture capital, and lending.\nThird, all financial institutions, whether in traditional finance or crypto finance,\nmust comply with the rules designed to combat money laundering and financing of\nterrorism and to support economic sanctions. Platforms and exchanges should be\ndesigned in a manner that facilitates and supports compliance with these laws. The\npermissionless exchange of assets and tools that obscure the source of funds not only\nfacilitate evasion, but also increase the risk of theft, hacks, and ransom attacks. These\nrisks are particularly prominent in decentralized exchanges that are designed to avoid the\nuse of intermediaries responsible for know-your-customer identification and that may\nrequire adaptations to ensure compliance at this most foundational layer.6\nFinally, it is important to address any regulatory gaps and to adapt existing\napproaches to novel technologies. While regulatory frameworks clearly apply to DeFi\nactivities no less than to centralized crypto activities and traditional finance, DeFi\nprotocols may present novel challenges that may require adapting existing approaches.7\nThe peer-to-peer nature of these activities, their automated nature, the immutability of\ncode once deployed to the blockchain, the exercise of governance functions through\ntokens in decentralized autonomous organizations, the absence of validated identities, and\n6 The Russian invasion of Ukraine has raised questions about the use of crypto-asset markets for sanctions\nevasion. See, for example, comments by Carol House, the director of cybersecurity for the National\nSecurity Council: “The scale that the Russian state would need to successfully circumvent all U.S. and\npartners’ financial sanctions would almost certainly render cryptocurrency as an ineffective primary tool\nfor the state” (as quoted in Hannah Lang (2022), “U.S. Lawmakers Push Treasury to Ensure Russia Cannot\nUse Cryptocurrency to Avoid Sanctions,” Reuters, March 2, para. 7).\n7 See Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2022), IOSCO Decentralized\nFinance Report: Public Report (Madrid: OICV-IOSCO, March),\nhttps://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD699.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nthe dispersion or obfuscation of control may make it challenging to hold intermediaries\naccountable. It is not yet clear that digital native approaches, such as building in\nautomated incentives for undertaking governance responsibilities, are adequate\nalternatives.\nConnections to the Core Financial Institutions\nThere are two specific areas that merit heightened attention because of heightened\nrisks of spillovers to the core financial system: bank involvement in crypto activities and\nstablecoins. To date, crypto has not become sufficiently interconnected with the core\nfinancial system to pose broad systemic risk. But it is likely regulators will continue to\nface calls for supervised banking institutions to play a role in these markets.\nBank regulators will need to weigh competing considerations in assessing bank\ninvolvement in crypto activities ranging from custody to issuance to customer facilitation.\nBank involvement provides an interface where regulators have strong sightlines and can\nhelp ensure strong protections. Similarly, regulators are drawn to approaches that\neffectively subject the crypto intermediaries that resemble complex bank organizations to\nbank-like regulation. But bringing risks from crypto into the heart of the financial system\nwithout the appropriate guardrails could increase the potential for spillovers and has\nuncertain implications for the stability of the system. It is important for banks to engage\nwith beneficial innovation and upgrade capabilities in digital finance, but until there is a\nstrong regulatory framework for crypto finance, bank involvement might further entrench\na riskier and less compliant ecosystem.\n\n- 8 -\nPrivate Digital Currencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies\nStablecoins represent a second area with a heightened risk of spillovers.\nCurrently, stablecoins are positioned as the digital native asset that bridges from the\ncrypto financial system to fiat. This role is important because fiat currency is referenced\nas the unit of account for the crypto financial system.8 Stablecoins are currently the\nsettlement asset of choice on and across crypto platforms, often serving as collateral for\nlending and trading activity. As highlighted by large recent outflows from the largest\nstablecoin, stablecoins pegged to fiat currency are highly vulnerable to runs. For these\nreasons, it is vital that stablecoins that purport to be redeemable at par in fiat currency on\ndemand are subject to the types of prudential regulation that limit the risk of runs and\npayment system vulnerabilities that such private monies have exhibited historically.\nWell-regulated stablecoins might bring additional competition to payments, but\nthey introduce other risks. There is a risk of fragmentation of stablecoin networks into\nwalled gardens. Conversely, there is a risk that a single dominant stablecoin might\nemerge, given the winner-takes-all dynamics in such activities. Indeed, the market is\ncurrently highly concentrated among three dominant stablecoins, and it risks becoming\neven more concentrated in the future. The top three stablecoins account for almost\n90 percent of transactions, and the top two of these account for 80 percent of market\ncapitalization.9\n8 See Bank for International Settlements (2022), “The Future Monetary System,” in Annual Economic\nReport 2022 (Basel, Switzerland: BIS, June), https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2022e3.htm.\n9 See The Block (2022), “Share of Trade Volume by Pair Denomination,” data as of June from\nCryptoCompare, https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/spot/share-of-trade-volume-by-pair-\ndenomination; Martin Young (2022), “Circle’s USDC Stablecoin Gobbles Tether’s Market Share with 50B\nMilestone,” Cointelegraph, February 1, https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-s-usdc-stablecoin-gobbles-\ntether-s-market-share-with-50b-milestone; and Brian Newar (2022), “USDC’s ‘Real Volume’ Flips Tether\non Ethereum as Total Supply Hits 55.9B,” Cointelegraph, June 22, https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-s-\nreal-volume-flips-tether-on-ethereum-as-total-supply-hits-55-9b.\n\n- 9 -\nGiven the foundational role of fiat currency, there may be an advantage for future\nfinancial stability to having a digital native form of safe central bank money—a central\nbank digital currency. A digital native form of safe central bank money could enhance\nstability by providing the neutral trusted settlement layer in the future crypto financial\nsystem.10 A settlement layer with a digital native central bank money could, for instance,\nfacilitate interoperability among well-regulated stablecoins designed for a variety of use\ncases and enable private-sector provision of decentralized, customized, and automated\nfinancial products. This development would be a natural evolution of the\ncomplementarity between the public and private sectors in payments, ensuring strong\npublic trust in the one-for-one redeemability of commercial bank money and stablecoins\nfor safe central bank money.11\nBuilding in Risk Management and Compliance\nCrypto and fintech have introduced competition and put the focus on how\ninnovation can help increase inclusion and address other vexing problems in finance\ntoday. Slow and costly payments particularly affect lower-income households with\nprecarious cash flows who rely on remittances or miss bills waiting on paychecks. Many\nhard-working individuals cannot obtain credit to start businesses or to respond to an\nemergency.\n10\nSee Lael Brainard (2022), “Digital Assets and the Future of Finance: Examining the Benefits and Risks\nof a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency,” statement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S.\nHouse of Representatives, May 26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/brainard20220526a.htm.\n11 With respect to the United States, no decision has been made about whether or not a central bank digital\ncurrency will be issued.\n\n- 10 -\nBut while innovation and competition can reduce costs in finance, some costs are\nnecessary to keep the system safe.12 Intermediaries earn revenues in exchange for safely\nproviding important services. Someone must bear the costs of evaluating risk,\nmaintaining resources to support those risks through good times and bad, complying with\nlaws that prevent crime and terrorism, and serving less sophisticated customers fairly and\nwithout exploitation. In the current crypto ecosystem, often no one is bearing these costs.\nSo when a service appears cheaper or more efficient, it is important to understand\nwhether this benefit is due to genuine innovation or regulatory noncompliance.\nSo as these activities evolve, it is worth considering whether there are new ways\nto achieve regulatory objectives in the context of new technology. Distributed ledgers,\nsmart contracts, and digital identities may allow new forms of risk management that shift\nthe distribution of costs. Perhaps in a more decentralized financial system, new\napproaches can be designed to make protocol developers and transaction validators\naccountable for ensuring financial products are safe and compliant.\nConclusion\nInnovation has the potential to make financial services faster, cheaper, and more\ninclusive and to do so in ways that are native to the digital ecosystem. Enabling\nresponsible innovation to flourish will require that the regulatory perimeter encompass\nthe crypto financial system according to the principle of like risk, like regulatory\noutcome, and that novel risks associated with the new technologies be appropriately\naddressed. It is important that the foundations for sound regulation of the crypto\n12 See Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar (2022), “Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (DeFi),”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, BPEA Conference Draft, March 24–25,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SP22_BPEA_MakarovSchoar_conf-draft.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nfinancial system be established now before the crypto ecosystem becomes so large or\ninterconnected that it might pose risks to the stability of the broader financial system.",

Today, efforts by global stablecoin networks such\nas Facebook’s Libra to establish the next chapter in the story of money are raising threshold\nquestions about legal and regulatory safeguards, financial stability, and monetary policy.\nBecause of its potential global reach, Facebook’s Libra imparts urgency to the debate over what\nform money can take, who or what can issue it, and how payments can be recorded and settled.2\nReassessing Money\nMoney has traditionally served three functions.3 Money facilitates payments as a\nmedium of exchange, serves as a store of value that can be relied on for future use, and simplifies\ntransactions by providing a common unit of account to compare the value of goods and services.\nA decade ago, Bitcoin was heralded as a new kind of digital money that would address\nfrictions in payments as well as serve as a unit of account and store of value without the need for\ncentralized governance. Bitcoin’s emergence created an entirely new payment instrument and\nasset class exchanged over a set of payment rails supported by distributed ledger technology.\nDistributed ledger technology may allow for a shared, tamper-resistant ledger that can be\nupdated by anyone with sufficient computing power, in contrast to traditional recordkeeping\nsystems built on a single ledger managed by a trusted central entity.4 But Bitcoin and some other\n1 I am grateful to Paul Wong and Jean Flemming of the Federal Reserve Board for assistance in preparing this text.\nThese remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See https://libra.org/en-US/.\n3 In many jurisdictions, the term money is defined narrowly by the law as only sovereign currency.\n4 See, e.g., Lael Brainard, “Distributed Ledger Technology: Implications for Payments, Clearing, and Settlement”\n(speech delivered at the Institute of International Finance Annual Meeting Panel on Blockchain, Washington,\nOctober 7, 2016), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20161007a.htm; “The Use of\n\n- 2 -\nearly iterations of cryptocurrencies have exhibited extreme volatility, limited throughput\ncapacity, unpredictable transaction costs, limited or no governance, and limited transparency,\nwhich have limited their utility as a means of payment and unit of account.5\nStablecoins were designed specifically to overcome the substantial volatility exhibited by\nfirst-generation cryptocurrencies, which limits their reach in payments and their utility as a unit\nof account. As the name implies, stablecoins aim to maintain stable value by tying the digital\ncurrency to an asset or basket of assets, such as commercial bank deposits or government-issued\nbonds. Stablecoins also differ from the initial set of cryptocurrencies in that they may be issued\nby a central entity and rely on third-party institutions for some aspects.\nJust as any currency’s value as a medium of exchange increases with the size of the\nnetwork using it, so too the power of a stablecoin payment system will depend on its ability to\nachieve widespread adoption, due to the associated network externalities. In light of the 2.7\nbillion active monthly users on Facebook’s platforms, the Libra stablecoin project stands out for\nthe speed with which its network could reach global scale in a payment system.6\nTo assess the efforts by stablecoin issuers to provide the three functions of money, it is\nuseful first to consider existing arrangements for the issuance, regulation, and transfer of money.\nCentral bank money and commercial bank money are the foundations of the modern financial\nsystem. Central bank money is composed of physical cash and money held in deposits at a\nDistributed Ledger Technologies in Payment, Clearing, and Settlement” (speech delivered at the Institute of\nInternational Finance Blockchain Roundtable, Washington, April 14, 2016),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20160414a.htm; and Committee on Payments and\nMarket Infrastructures (CPMI), Distributed Ledger Technology in Payment, Clearing, and Settlement, February\n2017, https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d157.pdf.\n5 See, e.g., Lael Brainard, “Cryptocurrencies, Digital Currencies, and Distributed Ledger Technologies: What Are\nWe Learning?” (speech delivered at the Decoding Digital Currency Conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco, San Francisco, May 15, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180515a.htm.\n6 Statistics (October 15, 2019), retrieved from https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/.\n\n- 3 -\ncentral bank. Central bank money is important for payment systems because it represents a safe\nsettlement asset, allowing users to exchange central bank liabilities with confidence in their\nacceptance and reliability. In addition, central banks can play a critical role as providers of\nliquidity by lending central bank money at moments of stress.\nCommercial bank money refers to money held in deposits at commercial banks. It is\nwidely used in part because people are confident that they can convert it on demand to the\nliability of another commercial bank or the central bank, such as physical cash. This confidence\ncomes in no small part because bank deposits are insured, and commercial banks are subject to\nsupervision, regulation, and deposit insurance requirements.7 Consumers and businesses also\nuse this money in transactions because of its convenience and availability, which in turn expand\nwith the size of the network using this money.\nNonbank private money or assets can also facilitate transactions among a network of\nusers. In some cases, such as airline miles, such assets may have value only within the network.\nIn other cases, the issuer of an asset within a network may guarantee convertibility to a sovereign\ncurrency. Consumers trust that the company issuing such money will be able to honor these\nliabilities. Many U.S. consumers have experience with nonbank private money in the form of\ngift cards, loyalty points, and virtual gaming currencies. Although many of these are relatively\nlimited in scale and purpose, some nonbank money networks are sizeable. Starbucks reported\n7 Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, The Role of Central Bank Money in Payment Systems (Basel:\nBank for International Settlements, August 2003), https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d55.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nthat it had $1.6 billion in stored value card liabilities as of September 2018—more than the\ndeposits held at many depository institutions.8\nAs the scale and scope of such private networks grow, so too do the convenience and\nbenefit of transacting within the network in a self-reinforcing dynamic, called network\nexternalities. These network benefits may be augmented by the active use of network data for a\nhost of purposes, from allocating and pricing credit to sharing reviews to prioritizing information\nthat is pushed to users. In China, consumers and businesses participate in two mobile networks,\nAlipay and WeChatPay, which by some accounts handled more than $37 trillion in mobile\npayments last year.9 These networks operate within China based on the renminbi as the unit of\naccount, and balances are transferable in and out of bank or credit card accounts.\nStablecoins with Global Scale and Scope\nStablecoins may resemble private nonbank liabilities depending on their design and claim\nstructure. Stablecoins aspire to achieve the functions of traditional money without relying on\nconfidence in an issuer—such as a central bank—to stand behind the money. Indeed, for some\npotential stablecoins, a close assessment suggests users may have no rights with respect to the\nunderlying assets or the system overall.\nWe have seen the growth of massive payments networks on existing digital platforms,\nsuch as Alibaba and WeChat, and the issuance of stablecoins on a smaller scale, such as Tether,\nGemini, and Paxos. What sets Facebook’s Libra apart is the combination of an active-user\nnetwork representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private\n8 Starbucks, Fiscal 2018 Annual Report, https://s22.q4cdn.com/869488222/files/doc_financials/annual/2018/2018-\nAnnual-Report.pdf.\n9 Frank Tang and Doug Palmer, “U.S.-China Trade War Deal Could Be Too Late for the Likes of Mastercard,\nAmerican Express and Visa,” South China Morning Post, April 2, 2019.\n\n- 5 -\ndigital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies.10 It should be no surprise that\nFacebook’s Libra is attracting a high level of scrutiny from lawmakers and authorities.11\nLibra, and indeed any stablecoin project with global scale and scope, must address a core\nset of legal and regulatory challenges before it can facilitate a first payment. I will emphasize a\nfew issues in particular.\nFirst, compliance with know-your-customer rules and regulations are essential to ensure\nstablecoins are not used for illegal activities and illicit finance. Libra’s business model is\ninherently cross-border, and, as such, each participant in the system deemed to be a financial\ninstitution would need to ensure compliance with each national jurisdictions’ anti-money-\nlaundering laws. Libra’s intended global reach would likely necessitate a consistent global anti-\nmoney-laundering framework in order to reduce the risk of illicit transactions.\nSecond, issuers of stablecoins designed to facilitate consumer payments must clearly\ndemonstrate how consumer protections would be assured. Consumers will need to be educated\non how their rights differ with respect to digital wallets compared to bank accounts. In the\nUnited States, as elsewhere, statutory and regulatory protections have been implemented with\nrespect to bank accounts so that consumers can reasonably expect their deposits to be insured up\nto a limit; fraudulent transactions to be the liability of the bank; transfers to be available within\nspecified periods; and clear, standardized disclosures about account fees and interest payments.\nNot only is it not clear whether comparable protections will be in place with Libra, or what\nrecourse consumers will have, but it is not even clear how much price risk consumers will face\n10 Based on staff calculations using statistics from Statistics (October 15, 2019), retrieved from\nhttps://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/, and U.S. and World Population Clock (October 15, 2019), retrieved from\nhttps://www.census.gov/popclock/.\n11 See Benoît Coeuré, “Digital Challenges to the International Monetary and Financial System,” (speech at the\nFuture of the International Monetary System at the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg-Toulouse School of\nEconomics, Luxembourg, September 17, 2019),\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2019/html/ecb.sp190917~9b63e0ea23.en.html.\n\n- 6 -\nsince they do not appear to have rights to the stablecoin’s underlying assets. Consumers need to\nbe cautioned that stablecoins are likely to be starkly different from sovereign-issued currency in\nlegal terms. It will be important to get clarity on what legal entity can be held responsible for the\nsecurity of personally identifiable information and transaction data and how personal data will be\nstored, accessed, and used. The large number of cyber breaches in the last few years highlight\nthe importance of these issues.\nThird, it will be necessary to define the financial activities that the various players in the\nLibra ecosystem are conducting in order for jurisdictions to assess whether existing regulatory\nand enforcement mechanisms are adequate. As the legal domicile of the Libra Association,\nSwitzerland is of particular interest. Swiss authorities have established three new categories to\nfacilitate their approach of regulating by function: “payment tokens” are cryptocurrencies that\nare meant for use in payments or value transfers; “utility tokens” are blockchain-based\napplications; and “asset tokens” are cryptoassets that are analogous to equities, bonds, and\nderivatives.12 To the extent that some innovations do not fit neatly within a single category,\nthese classifications may not be mutually exclusive.\nIn the United States, regulators are closely examining the specific functions of particular\nstablecoins and cryptocurrencies more broadly to determine whether and where they fit in the\nexisting regulatory structure and whether additional authorities or guidance is necessary. U.S.\nmarket regulators have authorities for products judged to be securities or commodity futures\nunder relevant law. At the state level, the New York State Department of Financial Services has\n12 See Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, “Guidelines for Enquiries Regarding the Regulatory\nFramework for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs),” February 16, 2018,\nhttps://www.finma.ch/en/~/media/finma/dokumente/dokumentencenter/myfinma/1bewilligung/fintech/wegleitung-\nico.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 7 -\nestablished a BitLicense for entities associated with virtual currencies.13 The Federal Reserve\nand the other federal banking agencies have supervisory authority over banks, including, in many\ncases, the ability to regulate and examine companies that provide services to banks. Neither the\nFederal Reserve nor any other regulator has plenary authority over payment systems operating in\nthe United States. Although the Financial Stability Oversight Council does have the authority to\ndesignate systemically important nonbank financial companies; financial market utilities; or\npayment, clearing, and settlement activities based on the facts of the specific situation, it is not\nclear at this time whether any cryptocurrency issuer would meet the statutory requirements for\ndesignation.\nStablecoins, and cryptocurrencies more generally, challenge the long-held premise that\npayments must be recorded in a central ledger managed by a single entity. In fact, banks were\nestablished to perform this central ledger function. Distributed ledger technology allows for the\ndirect peer-to-peer transfer of assets, potentially eliminating the need to transact through\nintermediaries. While distributed ledger technology could offer advantages by enhancing\noperational resilience, increasing transparency, and simplifying recordkeeping, the public and\nimmutable nature of the transactions ledger also introduces risks, such as data privacy concerns\nand legal complexity.\nGlobal stablecoin networks also may pose challenges to bank business models. In the\nextreme, widespread migration to one or more global stablecoin networks could disintermediate\nthe role of banks in payments. If consumers and businesses reduce their deposits at commercial\nbanks in favor of stablecoins held in digital wallets, this could shrink banks’ sources of stable\nfunding, as well as their visibility into transactions data, and thereby hinder banks’ ability to\n13 See https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses.\n\n- 8 -\nprovide credit to businesses and households. That said, many banks are likely to adapt by\noffering alternative methods of peer-to-peer settlement and by incorporating stablecoins into\ntheir business models, whether by partnering with fintech firms who issue stablecoins or by\nissuing their own, as some are already doing.14\nMoreover, widespread adoption of stablecoins could have implications for the role of\ncentral banks and monetary policy. Payments are the economy’s circulatory system. Large-\nscale migration into a new stablecoin network for purposes of payments may prove to be the\nleading edge of a broader migration. If a large share of domestic households and businesses\ncome to rely on a global stablecoin not only as a means of payment but also as a store of value,\nthis could shrink demand for physical cash and affect the size of the central bank’s balance sheet.\nThe central bank’s approach to implementing monetary policy may be complicated to the extent\nthat banks’ participation in short-term funding markets is affected.\nThese effects are likely to be more significant for small, open economies or those with\nweak monetary institutions, where the migration away from the sovereign currency to a global\nstablecoin could weaken the scope for independent monetary policy through a process that is the\ndigital analogue of dollarization.15 Large-scale stablecoin use could also affect larger, advanced\neconomies with extensive connections to the global financial system, including by increasing\nmarket volatility and by transmitting shocks across borders.\nFinally, there are likely to be financial stability risks for a stablecoin network with global\nreach. If not managed effectively, liquidity, credit, market, or operational risks—alone or in\n14 See, e.g., https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments and https://newsroom.wf.com/press-\nrelease/innovation-and-technology/wells-fargo-pilot-internal-settlement-service-using.\n15 See, e.g., Christine Lagarde, “Central Banking and Fintech—A Brave New World?” (speech delivered at the Bank\nof England conference, London, September 29, 2017), https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2017/09/28/sp092917-\ncentral-banking-and-fintech-a-brave-new-world.\n\n- 9 -\ncombination—could trigger a loss of confidence and a classic run. A global stablecoin network\nraises complicated issues associated with many legally independent but interdependent\noperations, and the lack of clarity about the management of reserves and the rights and\nresponsibilities of various market participants in the network. The potential for risks and\nspillovers could be amplified by potential ambiguity surrounding the ability of official authorities\nto provide oversight and backstop liquidity and to collaborate across borders.\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies\nEven before the advent of stablecoins, the rapid migration of payments to digital systems\nprompted interest in the issuance of central bank digital currencies. In some jurisdictions, there\nhas already been a pronounced migration from cash to digital payments, which naturally prompts\nmonetary authorities to explore moving to digital issuance of their own.\nThe potential for global stablecoin systems has intensified the interest in central bank\ndigital currencies. Proponents argue that central bank digital currencies would be a safer\nalternative to privately issued stablecoins because they would be a direct liability of the central\nbank.16 For instance, Markus Brunnermeier, Harold James, and Jean-Pierre Landau provide\nimportant arguments.17\nOf course, the Federal Reserve and other central banks already provide money digitally in\nthe form of central bank deposits in traditional reserve or settlement accounts. However, in the\ncurrent context, central bank digital currency typically refers to a new type of central bank\nliability that could be held directly by households and businesses without the involvement of a\n16 See, e.g., Martin Sandbu, “How Facebook’s Libra Fuelled Push for Central Bank-Run Digital Currencies,”\nFinancial Times, September 23, 2019, https://www.ft.com/content/746808a0-d9f6-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17; and\nDave Michaels and Paul Vigna, “The Coming Currency War: Digital Money vs. the Dollar,” The Wall Street\nJournal, September 22, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coming-currency-war-digital-money-vs-the-dollar-\n11569204540?mod=hp_featst_pos3.\n17 See e.g., Markus K. Brunnermeier, Harold James, and Jean-Pierre Landau, “The Digitalization of Money,”\nWorking Paper, August 2019, https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/02c_digitalmoney.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\ncommercial bank intermediary. Under this definition, central bank digital currency could be a\nflexible form of central bank money that could differ from traditional reserves along three\ndimensions: a much broader set of institutions and individuals could access it, some types of\nbalances might not pay interest, and it might entail greater government visibility into end users’\ntransactions.\nIn the United States, there are compelling advantages to the current system. First,\nphysical cash in circulation for the U.S. dollar continues to rise, suggesting robust demand.18\nSecond, the dollar is an important reserve currency globally, and maintaining public trust in the\nsovereign currency is paramount. Third, we have a robust banking system that meets the needs\nof consumers: our banks are many in number, diverse in size, and geographically dispersed.\nFinally, we have a widely available and expanding variety of digital payment options that build\non the existing institutional framework and the applicable safeguards.\nMoreover, central bank digital currency for general purpose use—that is, for individual\nconsumer use—would raise profound legal, policy, and operational questions.19 Let’s consider\nthe balance between privacy and illicit activity. If it is designed to be financially transparent and\nprovide safeguards against illicit activity, a central bank digital currency for consumer use could\nconceivably require the central bank to keep a running record of all payment data using the\ndigital currency—a stark difference from cash, for instance. A system in which individual\npayments information would be recorded by a government entity would mark a dramatic shift. A\n18 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_data.htm.\n19 See, e.g., CPMI and Markets Committee, Central Bank Digital Currencies, March 2018,\nhttps://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nrelated question is whether the Federal Reserve has the authority to issue currency in digital form\nand, if necessary, to establish digital wallets for the public.\nThere could also be profound monetary policy implications. Some economists have\nargued that a central bank digital currency could address the problems posed by the zero lower\nbound by potentially transmitting monetary policy directly to the public. Executing monetary\npolicy in such a manner would effectively imply the elimination of all physical cash and the\npower to impose a negative rate, or a tax, on households’ holdings of digital money. My own\nstrong preference is to address the effective lower bound by using our existing tools vigorously,\nsince I view the cost-benefit assessment of negative rates as unattractive for the current U.S.\ncontext.\nFinancial stability considerations are also important. The ability to convert commercial\nbank deposits into central bank digital currency with a simple swipe surely has the potential to be\na run accelerant. Here, too, the role of banks in providing financial intermediation services could\nbe fundamentally altered.\nFinally, there could be operational risks to introducing a central bank digital currency.\nFor starters, this might require the Federal Reserve to develop the operating capacity to access or\nmanage individual accounts, which could number in the hundreds of millions. A myriad of other\noperational challenges would need to be addressed, including electronic counterfeiting and cyber\nrisks. It is worth noting that the technologies used currently for private-sector digital currencies\ndo not provide the same level of information technology reliability, integrity, and scalability as\n\n- 12 -\ncentral bank systems in use today. Many of these technologies do not provide for clear,\npredictable, and final settlement, which is a core tenet of payment systems.20\nThat said, some jurisdictions may move in this direction faster than others, based on the\nparticular attributes of their payments and currency systems. At the Federal Reserve, we will\ncontinue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies and look\nforward to learning from other central banks.\nSupporting Payments Innovation\nWhile prudence cautions against rushing into untested approaches to central bank digital\ncurrencies, we are actively investing in our payments infrastructure, so that everyone has access\nto real-time payments. Every day, U.S. payment and securities settlement systems turn over\nroughly $12.5 trillion.21 The Federal Reserve is committed to working closely with the private\nsector to promote a safer and more efficient payments system.22\nThis summer, we announced that the Federal Reserve will launch the first new payment\nservice in more than 40 years to help make real-time payments available to everyone.23 The\nFederal Reserve will develop the FedNowSM Service as a platform for consumers and businesses\nto send and receive payments immediately and securely 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days\na year. This initiative is intended to provide a neutral platform for new private-sector innovation\nin faster payment services. In addition to FedNow, we are exploring enhancements to same-day\n20 Many distributed ledgers in existence today rely on probabilistic settlement, meaning that the more times a\ntransaction is confirmed on the ledger, the less likely it will be revoked, but a non-zero risk of settlement failure\npersists.\n21 Based on staff estimates.\n22 See, e.g., https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/.\n23 Lael Brainard, “Delivering Fast Payments for All” (speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nKansas City, Missouri, August 5, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20190805a.htm; Lael Brainard, “Supporting Fast\nPayments for All,” (speech delivered at the Fed Payments Improvement Community Forum, Chicago, October 3,\n2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20181003a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nsettlement of automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions and expansion of Fedwire® Funds\nService and National Settlement System operating hours. We are working with the industry to\nimprove the security of the payments system by, for example, increasing understanding of\nsynthetic identity fraud and identifying a fraud classification approach to improve information\nsharing.\nAs the public and private sectors work to reduce payment frictions, one of the most\nimportant use cases is for cross-border payments, such as remittances. Intermediation chains for\ncross-border payments are long, slow, cumbersome, and opaque. Technology enables e-\ncommerce to transcend national borders, but current cross-border payments solutions often\nrepresent complicated workarounds rather than seamless end-to-end solutions. Authorities in\ndifferent jurisdictions recognize the importance of cooperating across borders with each other\nand the private sector to address the very real cross-border frictions that exist today.\nConcluding Thoughts\nOur nation has rich and varied experiences to draw on as we assess various proposals for\nprivate money, from the period in our history when the colonial states each issued their own\ncurrencies to the many decades when the circulation of private commercial banknotes stood in\nfor a national currency. The Federal Reserve was created in part to respond to the inability of\nmany of these banks to make good on their obligations for the banknotes they issued and the\npanics and runs that ensued. Those experiences will help inform us as we potentially enter\nanother phase in the evolution of money and payments.\nToday, consumers and businesses have a variety of payment options, including physical\ncash, checks, ACH transfers, debit cards and credit cards, and mobile-based payment solutions,\nto name a few. These tend to have clearly defined legal rights and responsibilities. We will\n\n- 14 -\nlikely see far-reaching innovation in payments in the coming years, with a plethora of new and\nemerging options, including stablecoins.\nThe Federal Reserve remains confident in the power of technology and innovation to\ntransform the financial system and reduce frictions and delays, while preserving consumer\nprotections, data privacy and security, financial stability, and monetary policy transmission and\nguarding against illicit activity and cyber risks. Given the stakes, global stablecoin networks\nshould be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching\noperations. We are monitoring new technologies closely to ensure that the innovations that arise\nfit with our operational responsibilities and broader public policy goals, as reflected in the\nFederal Reserve Act. At the same time, we are upgrading our services to support innovation in\nnew ways. And, we will continue to foster a safe and efficient payments system, including\nwhere money in all its myriad forms—present and future—is concerned, as we have for over a\ncentury.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nMay 31, 2018\nSustaining Full Employment and Inflation around Target\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nForecasters Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nMay 31, 2018\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to join the Forecasters Club to discuss the path ahead\nfor our economy and monetary policy.1 In the months ahead, I expect to see tightening\nresource utilization in the U.S. economy as rising fiscal stimulus reinforces above-trend\ngrowth. Continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be consistent\nwith sustaining strong labor market conditions and inflation around target, with the\nbalance sheet running off gradually and predictably in the background. This outlook\nsuggests a policy path that moves gradually from modestly accommodative today to\nneutral--and, after some time, modestly beyond neutral--against the backdrop of a longer-\nrun neutral rate that is likely to remain low by historical standards. Let me consider each\nelement in turn\nGrowing above Trend\nAlthough indicators of economic activity were on the soft side earlier in the year,\nthe outlook for the remainder of 2018 remains quite positive, supported by sizable fiscal\nstimulus as well as still-accommodative financial conditions.\nIn the latest report, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.2 percent at an\nannual rate in the first quarter of 2018, a slowdown from the 3 percent pace in the final\nthree quarters of 2017. The first-quarter slowdown was especially noticeable in\nconsumer spending, which increased at only a 1 percent pace last quarter, compared with\n2-3/4 percent in 2017. By contrast, business fixed investment increased 9 percent at an\nannual rate last quarter, surpassing its robust 2017 pace.\n1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nI expect real GDP growth to pick up in the next few quarters. In particular, the\nfundamentals for consumer spending are favorable: Income gains have been strong,\nconsumer confidence remains solid, and employment prospects remain bright. And\nbusiness investment should remain solid, with drilling and mining bolstered by increased\noil prices.\nMoreover, the sizable fiscal stimulus that is in train is likely to provide a tailwind\nto growth in the second half of the year and beyond.2 From a position of full\nemployment, the economy will likely receive a substantial boost from $1.5 trillion in\npersonal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in federal spending, with\nestimates suggesting a boost to the growth rate of real GDP of about 3/4 percent this year\nand next.3\nRisks and Uncertainties\nIn short, with a tightening labor market and inflation near target, fiscal stimulus in\nthe pipeline suggests some risk to the upside. By contrast, recent developments abroad\nsuggest some risk to the downside.\nGlobal growth has been synchronized over the past year, but recent developments\npose some risk. Political developments in Italy have reintroduced some risk, and\nfinancial conditions in the euro area have worsened somewhat in response. With some\nuptick in political uncertainty, and inflation still below target in the euro area and Japan,\nmonetary policies among the advanced economies look likely to be divergent for some\ntime. In addition, some emerging markets may find conditions more challenging. An\n2 See Brainard (2018).\n3 For example, the International Monetary Fund (2018) estimates that the tax cut legislation will raise the\nlevel of U.S. GDP 1-1/4 percent by 2020, and the Congressional Budget Office (2018, p. 13) estimates that\nincreased spending caps will boost the level of real GDP by 0.6 percent in 2019.\n\n- 3 -\nenvironment with a strengthening dollar, rising energy prices, and the possibility of rising\nrates raises the risks of capital flow reversals in some emerging markets that have seen\nincreased borrowing from abroad. Although stresses have been contained to a few\nvulnerable countries so far, the risk of a broader pullback bears watching. In addition,\nuncertainty over trade clouds the horizon. An escalation in measures and\ncountermeasures--although an outside risk--could prove disruptive at home and abroad.\nSustaining Full Employment\nHere at home, the labor market is strong. So far this year, payroll gains have\naveraged 200,000 per month, sufficient to put further downward pressure on\nunemployment. Indeed, the unemployment rate moved down to 3.9 percent in April\nfollowing six consecutive months at 4.1 percent. The unemployment rate for African\nAmericans dropped in April to 6.6 percent, which is the lowest level recorded since this\nseries began in 1972 but still high relative to other groups.\nIt is difficult to know how much slack remains. April’s 3.9 percent\nunemployment rate was the lowest reading since December 2000. If the unemployment\nrate falls another couple of tenths--which seems likely, based on recent trends--it will be\nat its lowest level since 1969. Although the late 1960s marked the beginning of what is\nnow called the Great Inflation, it is worth keeping in mind that there have been important\nshifts in the labor market since that time. For example, educational attainment is much\nhigher today than it was in the 1960s, and college degree holders tend to have much\nlower unemployment rates, on average, than those with a high school degree or less.4\n4 The share of the labor force aged 25 or older with a college degree or more is around 40 percent today,\ncompared with 15 percent in the late 1960s, and the share with less than a high school degree has fallen\nfrom around 40 percent to around 7 percent today. The unemployment rates of college-educated adults are\n\n- 4 -\nWhile the unemployment rate is now lower than before the financial crisis, the\nemployment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains about 1 percentage point\nbelow its pre-crisis level. It is an open question what portion of the prime-age Americans\nwho are out of the labor force may prove responsive to tight labor market conditions.\nWhile it is difficult to know with precision how much slack still remains, I am\nseeing more evidence that labor markets are tightening, and wages are accelerating,\nalthough at a measured pace. The 12-month change in the employment cost index (ECI)\nfor private industry workers in the first quarter was 2.8 percent, up from 2.3 percent in\nthe year-earlier period. By way of comparison, in the period from 2005 to 2007, just\nbefore the financial crisis, the ECI rose a bit more than 3 percent at an annual rate, while\ncore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was around 2-1/4 percent. I am\nhearing anecdotes of labor market shortages in particular occupations and sectors,\nechoing a theme in our recent Beige Book. Going forward, I will be looking for\nconfirmation in other measures of wages that labor market tightness is feeding through to\nwage gains.\nSustainably Achieving Our Inflation Objective\nTurning to the second leg of our dual mandate, in the most recent data, the trailing\n12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.8 percent, up from a year earlier, when core\nPCE prices increased only 1.6 percent. Overall PCE prices, which include the volatile\nfood and energy sectors, increased 2.0 percent, largely reflecting the recent run-up in\ncrude oil prices. While the recent core PCE data are somewhat encouraging, we will\ntypically much lower--around 2 percent today--compared with high school noncompleters--currently\naround 6 percent.\n\n- 5 -\nwant to see inflation coming in around target on a sustained basis after seven years of\nbelow-target readings.\nAs I have noted before, the persistence of subdued inflation, despite an\nunemployment rate that has moved below most estimates of its natural rate, suggests\nsome risk that underlying inflation--the slow-moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and\nprice setting--may have softened.5 For example, some survey measures of longer-run\ninflation expectations are currently lower than they were before the financial crisis, as are\nmost estimates based on statistical filters. Inflation compensation has moved up recently\nbut is still running somewhat below levels that prevailed before the crisis.\nRe-anchoring underlying inflation at the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) 2 percent objective is an important goal. Recent research has highlighted the\ndownside risks to inflation and inflation expectations that are posed by the effective\nlower bound on nominal interest rates, and it underscores the importance of ensuring\nunderlying inflation does not slip below target in today’s new normal.6 In that regard, if\nwe were to see a mild, temporary overshoot of the inflation target, this could well be\nconsistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and may help nudge underlying\ninflation back to target.7\nIn short, it is reassuring to see core PCE inflation moving up, along with market-\nbased measures of inflation compensation retracing earlier declines. After seven years of\nbelow-target inflation, it will be important to see inflation coming in around target on a\nsustained basis to be confident that underlying trend inflation is running at 2 percent.\n5 See Brainard (2017, 2018).\n6 See, for example, Kiley and Roberts (2017), Nakata and Schmidt (2016), and Brainard (2015, 2016).\n7 See Board of Governors (2018) and Brainard (2018).\n\n- 6 -\nThe Yield Curve\nEven though longer-term Treasury yields have moved up, on net, since the\nbeginning of the year, there has been growing attention of late to the possibility of an\ninversion of the yield curve--that is, circumstances in which short-term interest rates\nexceed long-term interest rates on Treasury securities. Historically, yield curve\ninversions have had a reliable track record of predicting recessions in the United States.8\nSince 1960, there has only been one case where the 3-month Treasury yield has moved\nabove the 10-year Treasury yield and a recession has not followed--in 1966.9\nThis correlation between yield curve inversions and recessions might arise for a\nvariety of reasons. First, let us take a case where short-term rates rise relative to long-\nterm rates. When the FOMC is undertaking a deliberate tightening in policy, short-term\ninterest rates typically rise, as do expectations of short-term interest rates in the medium\nterm, while interest rates in the distant future may be less affected. For example, if short-\nterm interest rates were raised to stabilize temporary swings in the economy, the logic of\nthe expectations hypothesis would suggest that long rates would not rise as much. And if\ntighter monetary policy were to weaken the economy with a lag, this would lead to long\nrates not rising by as much or at all.\nSecond, let us take a case where long-term rates decline relative to short-term\nrates, perhaps reflecting a flight to safety. If market participants become concerned about\n8 An earlier paper discussing the predictive power of the yield curve is Estrella and Mishkin (1997). In\nmore recent work, Bauer and Mertens (2018) emphasize that the predictive content of the yield curve is still\nlargely intact. Johansson and Meldrum (2018) and Favara and others (2016), however, argue that adding\ninformation about bond risk premiums reduces somewhat the predictive power of the yield spread.\n9 An earlier version of this speech stated that the 3-month Treasury yield did not move above the 10-year\nTreasury yield prior to the 1990 recession. While that statement is true looking at monthly average interest\nrates, there were several days in mid-1989 when the 3-month Treasury yield was higher than the 10-year\nyield.\n\n- 7 -\na future macroeconomic risk that could lead to a weaker economy, this concern would\ntend to lower expected longer-term interest rates, both because monetary policy would be\nexpected to become more accommodative in the future and because market participants\nmay increase their relative holdings of safe assets, such as Treasury securities. In this\ncase, longer-dated Treasury yields may fall, and if short-term interest rates do not adjust\ncommensurately, the yield curve will invert ahead of a weaker economy.\nTurning to current conditions, the spread between the 10-year and 3-month\nTreasury yields has declined from 375 basis points in early 2010 to about 125 basis\npoints in the first quarter of this year. While that represents a considerable flattening, the\ncurrent spread between the 10-year and 3-month yields is only about 20 basis points\nnarrower than the average over the 45 years before the financial crisis.\nAs we try to assess the implications of this flattening of the yield curve, it is\nimportant to take into account the very low level of the current 10-year yield by historical\nstandards. For the 20 years before the crisis, the 10-year Treasury yield averaged about\n6-1/4 percent, compared with recent readings around 3 percent. One reason the 10-year\nTreasury yield may be unusually low is that market expectations of interest rates in the\nlonger run may be unusually low. A second reason may be that the term premium--the\nextra compensation an investor would demand for investing in a 10-year bond rather than\nrolling over a shorter-dated instrument repeatedly over a 10-year period--has fallen to\nlevels that are very low by historical standards. According to one estimate from Federal\nReserve Board staff, the term premium has tended to be slightly negative in recent years.\n\n- 8 -\nBy contrast, when the spread between the 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields was at its\npeak in early 2010, this measure of the term premium was close to 100 basis points.10\nOther things being equal, a smaller term premium will make the yield curve flatter\nby lowering the long end of the curve. With the term premium today very low by\nhistorical standards, this may temper somewhat the conclusions that we can draw from a\npattern that we have seen historically in periods with a higher term premium. With a\nvery low term premium, any given amount of monetary policy tightening will lead to an\ninversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led to an inversion\nin the past could do so today.\nThere are a number of possible explanations of the low level of the term premium.\nThe asset purchases of the Federal Reserve and other central banks may be contributing\nfactors. The goal of these policies was to lower longer-term interest rates--and in many\ncases, expressly by lowering term premiums. A number of studies suggest that these\npolices have indeed been successful in lowering term premiums.11\nA second reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changing\ncorrelation between stock and bond returns, likely caused by changes in expected\ninflation outcomes.12 While in the 1970s and 1980s stock and bond returns tended to be\npositively correlated, more recently the correlation has tended to be negative. With an\ninverse correlation, bonds recently have been a good hedge for stocks, and that\ncorrelation may have contributed to lower bond term premiums by increasing the demand\nfor bonds as an instrument for hedging portfolio risks. This changed correlation between\n10 See Kim and Wright (2005) for technical details; the latest estimates are available on the Board’s website\nat https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2005/200533/200533abs.html.\n11 See, for example, Li and Wei (2013).\n12 See Chen, Engstrom, and Grishchenko (2016).\n\n- 9 -\nstock and bond returns in turn may be related to better anchored inflation expectations\nfollowing a long period of low and stable inflation.\nLooking ahead, it seems likely the term premium will increase somewhat,\nalthough perhaps not to the levels seen historically. On the one hand, a continued gradual\nrunoff of the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and reduced bond buying by other\ncentral banks will tend to put upward pressure on the term premium. On the other hand,\nthe FOMC’s demonstrated commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation makes it\nunlikely that expectations of high inflation will reemerge. Thus, on balance, while term\npremiums may recover somewhat from their recent depressed values, it is unlikely they\nwill return to the high levels of earlier decades.\nThe Path of Policy\nIn the median outlook in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP),\nthe federal funds rate is projected to reach its longer-run value by 2019 and exceed it in\n2020. If the 10-year term premium were to stay very low, that path would likely imply a\nyield curve inversion. But for the reasons I just noted, if the term premium remains low\nby historical standards, there would probably be less adverse signal from any given yield\ncurve spread.\nIt is important to emphasize that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP\nmedian is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and\ninflation around target. So while I will keep a close watch on the yield curve as an\nimportant signal on how tight financial conditions are becoming, I consider it as just one\namong several important indicators. Yield curve movements will need to be interpreted\n\n- 10 -\nwithin the broader context of financial conditions and the outlook and will be one of\nmany considerations informing my assessment of appropriate policy.\nAs suggested by the SEP median path, I believe that the forward-guidance\nlanguage in the Committee statement that was introduced a few years ago that “the\nfederal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to\nprevail in the longer run” is growing stale and may no longer serve its original purpose.\nFor purposes of comparison, in March 2016, the median of SEP projections for the\nfederal funds rate path had the funds rate rising to 3.0 percent and remaining below the\nlonger run value that was projected to be 3.3 percent. A year later, the median projection\nof the longer-run federal funds rate fell. In the March 2018 SEP, the median projection\nof the federal funds rate peaks at 3.4 percent in 2020--1/2 percentage point above the\nmedian projection of its longer-run value of 2.9 percent. It is worth noting that this\nprogression reflects a decrease in the long-run federal funds rate as much as an increase\nin the medium-run federal funds rate.\nConclusion\nIn an environment of tightening resource utilization and above-trend growth, with\nsizable fiscal stimulus likely to provide a boost to demand in the near-to-medium term\nthat should fade somewhat further out, it seems likely that the neutral rate could rise in\nthe medium term above its longer-run value. I expect current tailwinds to boost the\nneutral rate gradually over the medium term but leave little imprint on the long-run\nneutral rate. The short-run level of the neutral rate should rise gradually because the\nforces that are moving the economy from headwinds to tailwinds are likely to play out\ngradually. Although the tax cuts are already in place, their effects may not be fully felt\n\n- 11 -\nfor a few years, and the spend-out from the recent budget agreement may occur with\nsome delay. A gradual pace is also warranted in light of the long period of undershooting\nthe inflation target.\nI would not underestimate the challenge of calibrating monetary policy to sustain\nfull employment and re-anchor trend inflation around 2 percent, while adjusting to\nsizable stimulus at a time when resource constraints are tightening and the economy is\ngrowing above trend. I continue to view gradual increases in the federal funds rate as the\nappropriate path, although I will remain vigilant for the emergence of risks and prepared\nto adjust if conditions change.\n\n- 12 -\nReferences\nBauer, Michael D., and Thomas M.

For\nthe U.S. economy overall, tribes provided over 1.1 million jobs prior to the pandemic.2 Here in\nOklahoma, when looking at how the economic activity of tribes compares with different\nindustries in the state, tribes would rank 9th in output, at over $7 billion, and 11th in job\ncreation—greater than either the construction or utilities industries. By one estimate, tribal\ngovernment activities supported nearly 100,000 jobs in the state and brought nearly $5 billion in\nwages and benefits to Oklahoma workers as of 2017.3 Oklahoma tribes also contributed nearly\n1 I am grateful to Megan Cruz of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Katherine Arnold, Charlene van Dijk,\nand David Kaufmann of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing this text.

As early as April 2020, just a month after the pandemic swept across the U.S.,\ntribal nations were proactively offering COVID-19 testing for the general public. Once vaccines\nbegan to roll out in early 2021, tribal nations distributed them under a prioritized and phased\ntimeline developed in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance.\nThis assistance from tribal nations helped make Oklahoma one of the top 10 states for vaccine\nrollout.5\nBut the pandemic added to sharp economic disparities that are longstanding. Prior to the\npandemic, the median household income for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN)\nhouseholds was about $20,000 lower than for non-Hispanic White households.6 Native\nAmerican women faced particularly large disparities with 18 percent living in poverty before the\npandemic—about 12 percentage points higher than White women.7 About 59 percent of AI/AN\nwomen overall are considered financially fragile.8 Such disparities were only exacerbated by the\npandemic.9 The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis’s Center for Indian Country\nin-oklahoma.pdf.

In recent surveys by the\nCenter for Indian Country Development, many respondents reported large, persistent revenue\nlosses, with only one in five tribal entities indicating they have stable revenues.11 At the same\ntime, they reported facing substantial increases in their operational costs that they expected to\nremain elevated for at least six months.\nIdentifying Barriers to Financial Inclusion\nTo address these disparities, it will be important to understand and make progress on key\nimpediments to financial access. Native communities face impediments to accessing a range of\nfinancial services, including banking, mortgage financing, small business credit, and financial\neducation.\nPerhaps most fundamentally, access to banking services is important to ensure the\nfinancial wellbeing of individuals and the vitality of the communities in which they live.

According to the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, the median homeowner has 40\ntimes the household wealth of a renter.15 While 75 percent of Native households reported a\nstrong desire to own their home, Native American communities face significant impediments.\nFirst, they face a lack of adequate supply.16 Overcrowding and physical housing problems are\n12 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and\nFinancial Services: 2019 FDIC Survey (Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, October 2020),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2019report.pdf.\n13 Information calculated using Summary of Deposits (SoD) 2020.

These activities have a ripple effect as related jobs are\nspread over other sectors of the community, including manufacturing, retail, and business\nservices.21\nNative small businesses also face special challenges in obtaining credit.

Kunesh, “Tribal Leaders Handbook on Homeownership,” Center for Indian Country Development,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2018, https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/resources/tribal-\nleaders-handbook-on-homeownership.

Data from the Survey of Business Owners and Self-\nEmployed Persons show far fewer AI/AN-owned businesses were started by using bank\nfinancing compared with all business owners.24 These differences are supported by anecdotal\nperspective that Native Americans have more difficulty financing their new businesses with\nloans from traditional lenders than non-Natives do.25 In addition, Native business owners\nconsistently reported using credit cards to finance business startups at a greater rate than other\nstartups.26 The CDFI Fund’s Accessing Capital and Credit in Native Communities Report\nconcludes a possible explanation is that Native business owners have more difficulty accessing\nlower-cost standard bank loans than do other entrepreneurs.\nNative small businesses faced much greater challenges as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, and generally received less robust support.27 Small businesses in tribal areas were\n22 See U.S. Small Business Administration, “Small Businesses Generate 44 Percent of U.S. Economic Activity,”\nnews release, January 30, 2019, https://advocacy.sba.gov/2019/01/30/small-businesses-generate-44-percent-of-u-s-\neconomic-activity/.\n23 See “How SBA Helps Native American Small Business Owners Succeed,” U.S. Small Business Administration,\nNovember 10, 2020, https://www.sba.gov/blog/how-sba-helps-native-american-small-business-owners-succeed.\n24 See Jorgensen and Akee, Access to Capital and Credit.\n25 See Jorgensen and Akee, Access to Capital and Credit.\n26 According to the CDFI Fund’s Accessing Capital and Credit in Native Communities Report, AI/AN business\nowners report using credit cards to finance startups at a rate 3-5% higher than the average.\n27 Following the onset of the pandemic, conditions for Native small businesses worsened. The Center for Indian\nCountry Development and National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development surveyed small businesses\nin Indian Country in 2020 and found that about 68 percent of businesses saw at least a 20 percent revenue reduction,\nwhile 1 in 6 businesses reported having lost all revenue (as of mid-July 2020) because of COVID-19. See Feir,\nJames, Lozar, and Nunn, “Indian Country Small Businesses.”\n7\n\nboth less likely to receive Paycheck Protection Program assistance and received less, on average,\nthan businesses in non-tribal areas.28\nFinancial literacy and personal financial management skills are critically important,\nespecially for households with low liquid savings and wealth. While there are limited data about\nfinancial behaviors in Indian Country, available information suggests that Native Americans face\nhigher levels of financial fragility than many other groups. Given these challenges, Native\nAmerican youth may stand to benefit from opportunities to develop personal finance skills and\nfinancial management experience.29\nAddressing Barriers to Inclusion\nAs Native communities tackle these impediments to financial inclusion, collaborative\nefforts across a range of public-sector, private-sector, and nonprofit organizations can be helpful.\nAs part of our mission to build a strong, inclusive economy, the Federal Reserve has a role to\nplay in supporting economic growth and financial inclusion in Native communities.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA) Reform\nThe CRA is one powerful tool in building a more inclusive economy for individuals and\ncommunities. As one of several landmark civil rights laws to address systemic inequities in\ncredit access, the CRA confers an affirmative obligation on banks to help meet the credit needs\nof the local communities in which they do business, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. The CRA prompts banks to be not only more active lenders in LMI areas, but it\n28 See Tyler Boesch, Casey Lozar, and Ryann Nunn, “Paycheck Protection Program leaves some businesses in tribal\nareas behind,” November 19, 2020, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/paycheck-protection-program-leaves-some-businesses-in-tribal-areas-\nbehind.\n29 See Dewees and Mottola, “Race and Financial Capability in America.”\n8\n\nalso encourages activities with minority depository institutions (MDIs) that are especially\nimportant to serving the credit and investment needs of minority communities.\nWe are working with the other banking agencies to propose CRA reforms that should\nimprove financial inclusion and the availability of community development financing in\nunderserved communities.30 As we work together to propose reforms to strengthen the law’s\ncore purpose, we have a unique opportunity to design a regulation that better addresses the credit\nneeds for Native communities and in Indian Country—including increasing banking services,\naccess to credit for households and businesses, and funding for community development.31\nTwo years ago, I had the pleasure of visiting with the Thunder Valley Community\nDevelopment Corporation on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. We toured a major\nhousing, small business, and community development mixed-use project, which was under\nconstruction. Despite the importance of the Thunder Valley project to the community, banks\nwere not among the funders listed for this important project. This illustrates the broader\nchallenge faced by underserved communities where there are few bank branches.\nI want to highlight two of the proposals that the Federal Reserve Board (the Board)\nsought feedback on in the September 2020 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to\nstrengthen CRA regulations. Recognizing that many places in Indian Country have few bank\nbranches and are located outside of branch-based assessment areas, the Board proposed that a\nbank in any part of the country could receive credit for eligible CRA activities in Indian Country,\n30 See Lael Brainard, “Strengthening the CRA to Meet the Challenges of Our Time” (speech at the Urban Institute,\nWashington, D.C., September 21, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20200921a.htm; see also “Federal Reserve Board\nstatement on the Community Reinvestment Act,” press release, July 20, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210720b.htm.\n31 See Lael Brainard, “Modernizing and Strengthening CRA Regulations: A Conversation with the National\nCongress of American Indians” (speech at the National Congress of American Indians 77th Annual Convention &\nMarketplace, November 10, 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20201110a.htm.\n9\n\neven when there is not a branch nearby. Banks need to be confident about receiving CRA credit\nto seek out activities and investments in these areas.\nThe Board has also sought feedback on ways to encourage and reward banks for activities\nthat are responsive to community needs, particularly in harder-to-serve areas. One approach is\nthe use of impact scores for community development activities to ensure that performance\nevaluations adequately reflect the relative importance of loans and investments within\ncommunities. As we work toward a set of interagency proposals on how to strengthen CRA\nregulations, we will continue to focus on and seek feedback on how to best encourage impactful\nCRA activities in Indian Country, including for building climate resilience where needed.32\nSupporting Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and MDIs\nIn addition to traditional banks and credit unions, a robust CDFI ecosystem can also be a\nlifeline to support credit access in underserved communities. Between 2001 and 2021, the\nnumber of Native CDFIs increased fivefold from just 14 to 71 in the U.S.33 While Native CDFI\nloans tend to be small—the average loan size was just $16,000 in 2017—they fill a critical gap,\nespecially for those who have thin credit profiles or have poor credit profiles.34 Moreover,\nCDFIs can help improve clients’ credit and boost their financial access.\nNative CDFIs in Oklahoma have been highly successful in providing financial access to\nNative Americans, supporting mortgage lending, small business growth, and economic activity\nmore broadly. Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, Native CDFIs across the\ncountry avoided the increases in delinquencies and charge offs that were anticipated early on,\n32 See “Pathfinders: Climate-Smart Solutions from Rural America and Native Nations,” The Aspen Institute,\nhttps://www.aspeninstitute.org/events/roadsclimate/.\n33 See Jorgensen and Akee, Access to Capital and Credit and “List of Certified Community Development Financial\nInstitution (CDFIs) with Contact Information as of September 14, 2021,” Community Development Financial\nDevelopment Institutions Fund, https://www.cdfifund.gov/sites/cdfi/files/2021-09/CDFI_Cert_List_09142021.xlsx.\n34 See “Native CDFI Industry Profile 2017,” Oweesta, https://www.oweesta.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2017-\nNative-CDFI-Industry-Profile_web.pdf.\n10\n\nand only a few have had to restructure their organization’s corporate debt as a result of COVID-\n19 so far, highlighting the quality of Native CDFI investments.35\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (FRB Kansas City) Community Development\ndepartment supports Native CDFIs and Native MDIs in a number of ways with a focus on\nconvening, facilitation, and resource development.36 For example, staff support state-wide CDFI\nworking groups in Oklahoma and New Mexico, which both have significant representation of\nNative CDFIs. Further, through its flagship program, Investment Connection, FRB Kansas City\nlinks banks with CRA-eligible activities. Since its creation in 2011, Investment Connection has\nenabled $50 million in loans and grants to be connected with community organizations.37 These\nfunds have supported work in affordable housing, small business development, and workforce\ndevelopment, among other areas. Several organizations working in Indian Country have been\nable to make successful, CRA-eligible connections through FRB Kansas City’s Investment\nConnection, including an Oklahoma based Native American CDFI. The Federal Reserve System\nwill continue to be a resource to provide information and best practices for CDFIs as more tribes\nseek information about establishing their own financial institution.\nEconomic Education\nThe Economic Education team at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis with support\nfrom the Atlanta and Kansas City Reserve Banks has been committed to providing tribal nations\nand Native communities in Oklahoma and across the country with personal finance and\neconomic education programming.

This work, led by Megan\nCruz, a citizen of the Osage Nation, who is here today, brings financial education to tribal\nprograms spanning all ages—including early childhood learning, youth programs, housing,\nreservation schools, higher education, workforce development, children and family services, and\nelder programs.38\nCenter for Indian Country Development\nA pervasive lack of data makes it difficult to evaluate how economic developments are\nimpacting Indian Country. The limitations of the data available on Indian Country are due to\ndata collection and reporting issues, such as small sample size or large margins of error.39 At the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the Center for Indian Country Development collects data\nand conducts economic research and analysis to help resolve the critical need for accurate and\ntimely data. One of the steps they have taken includes publishing a labor market data tool, which\npresents estimates of the labor force participation rate, employment-to-population ratio, and\nunemployment rate for the AI/AN population in the U.S.40\nThe Center for Indian Country Development also focuses on applied research and\nengagement in Indian Country to support long term economic prosperity and inclusion. Recent\nresearch has centered on the role tribal enterprises play in economic opportunity and how tax\nrevenues in Indian Country can help improve the economic infrastructure and financial inclusion\nfor tribal communities. Through policy webinars and its upcoming inaugural research summit,\n38 See “An Economic Education Partnership with Indian Country,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, November\n19, 2020, https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/november/economic-education-partnership-indian-country.\n39 See “Data Disaggregation: The Asterisk Nation,” National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) Policy\nResearch Center, https://www.ncai.org/policy-research-center/research-data/data.\n40 See Center for Indian Country Development, “Native American Labor Market Dashboard,” Federal Reserve Bank\nof Minneapolis, https://www.minneapolisfed.org/indiancountry/resources/native-american-labor-market-dashboard.\n12\n\nthe Center is working alongside tribal leaders to leverage data and research to improve the\neconomic well-being of Indian Country.\nThe Reserve Banks play a unique and important role in increasing our understanding of\nlocal needs and regional issues, and in the Federal Reserve Districts with large Native American\npopulations and stakeholders, our Banks are very engaged with Indian Country activities. We\nwelcome the diverse perspectives of Native Americans, from serving on our boards and advisory\ncouncils to joining us as full-time employees, to better inform our decisionmaking. Tawney\nBrunsch, the CEO of Lakota Funds, a Native CDFI, is the current Vice Chair of the Board’s\nCommunity Advisory Council, which offers diverse perspectives on the financial services needs\nof communities, with a focus on lower- to moderate-income neighborhoods.41\nEarlier today, the Federal Reserve announced we had joined the Central Bank Network\nfor Indigenous Inclusion (Network) alongside the Reserve Bank of New Zealand/Te Pūtea\nMatua, the Bank of Canada, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. The mission of the Network is\nto foster ongoing dialogue and raise awareness of Indigenous economic and financial issues,\nshare knowledge and best practices, and promote engagement and education on Indigenous\neconomy and history, in partnership with Indigenous Peoples. It is a welcome opportunity for us\nto better understand how each central bank is working to improve financial inclusion for and\nwith Indigenous Peoples. We look forward to learning from our Indigenous partners and central\nbank members in the Network.\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to affirm that it is important to us at the Federal Reserve to deepen our\nunderstanding of tribal nations and strengthen our relationships with Native communities.

Less than a hundred miles\nfrom here, families have lost their homes and businesses, and entire communities have\nbeen devastated by the Kincade fire. Some have described PG&E’s bankruptcy as the\nfirst climate change bankruptcy.3 Some insurers have discontinued policies in fire-prone\nareas, which, in turn, is changing the costs of homeownership and the risk profiles of\npreviously underwritten mortgages.4 Yet we can also see not far from here the promise\nof green innovation.5\n1 I am grateful to Brigitte Roth Tran of the Federal Reserve Board for assistance in preparing this text.\nThese remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Glenn D.

To support\na strong economy and a stable financial system, the Federal Reserve needs to analyze and\nadapt to important changes to the economy and financial system. This is no less true for\nclimate change than it was for globalization or the information technology revolution.\nClimate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme\nweather events, raise average temperatures, and cause sea levels to rise. Climate risks are\nprojected to have profound effects on the U.S. economy and financial system.6 To fulfill\nour core responsibilities, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to study the\nimplications of climate change for the economy and the financial system and to adapt our\nwork accordingly. Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve specific responsibilities in\nmonetary policy, financial stability, financial regulation and supervision, community and\nconsumer affairs, and payments. Climate risks may touch each of these.\nClimate Change and Monetary Policy\nLet’s start with monetary policy. Increasingly, it will be important for the Federal\nReserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in\nsetting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price\nstability. Monetary policy seeks to buffer the economy from unexpected adverse\ndisruptions, or “shocks.” It is generally more challenging for monetary policy to insulate\nthe economy from shocks to the supply side of the economy than to the demand side. So\nit is vital for monetary policymakers to understand the nature of climate disturbances to\n6 See U.S. Global Change Research Program (2018), Fourth National Climate Assessment: Volume II:\nImpacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States (Washington: USGCRP),\nhttps://nca2018.globalchange.gov.\n\n- 3 -\nthe economy, as well as their likely persistence and breadth, in order to respond\neffectively.\nFor instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as\nhurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business\nspending, output, and prices.7 In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or, instead, to\n“look through” such shocks, policymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the\neffects and how widespread they are. Because there is considerable uncertainty about the\npersistence, breadth, and magnitude of climate-related shocks to the economy, it could be\nchallenging to assess what adjustments to monetary policy are likely to be most effective\nat keeping the economy operating at potential with maximum employment and price\nstability.8 We need only look back to the oil price shocks of the 1970s and 1980s to see\nhow difficult it was for monetary policymakers to assess accurately the likely persistence\nof the effects on inflation and output and the appropriate response.\nTo the extent that climate change and the associated policy responses affect\nproductivity and long-run economic growth, there may be implications for the long-run\nneutral level of the real interest rate, which is a key consideration in monetary policy. As\nthe frequency of heat waves increases, research indicates there could be important effects\n7 See Ariel R. Belasen and Solomon W. Polachek (2009), “How Disasters Affect Local Labor\nMarkets: The Effects of Hurricanes in Florida,” Journal of Human Resources, vol. 44 (Winter), pp. 251–\n76; and Solomon M. Hsiang and Amir S. Jina (2014), “The Causal Effect of Environmental Catastrophe on\nLong-Run Economic Growth: Evidence from 6,700 Cyclones,” NBER Working Paper Series 20352\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, July), http://www.nber.org/papers/w20352.\n8 Warwick McKibbin, Adele Morris, Augustus J.

Just on its own, the large amount of uncertainty regarding climate-related events\nand policies could hold back investment and economic activity.10\nClimate Change and Financial Stability\nSecond, the Federal Reserve will need to assess the financial system for\nvulnerabilities to important climate risks. The Federal Reserve has important\nresponsibilities for safeguarding the stability of our financial system so that it can\ncontinue to meet household and business needs for financial services when hit by\nnegative shocks. Similar to other significant risks, such as cyberattacks, we want our\nfinancial system to be resilient to the effects of climate change.11\nAlthough there is substantial uncertainty surrounding how or when shifts in asset\nvaluations might occur, we can begin to identify the factors that could propagate losses\n9 Riccardo Colacito, Bridget Hoffman, and Toan Phan (2018), “Temperature and Growth: A Panel\nAnalysis of the United States.” Working Paper 18-09 (Richmond, VA: Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond, March), https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/working_papers/2018/wp_18-09.\n10 William Blyth, Richard Bradley, Derek Bunn, Charlie Clarke, Tom Wilson, and Ming Yang (2007),\n“Investment Risks under Uncertain Climate Change Policy,” Energy Policy, vol. 35 (November), pp. 5766–\n73; Mathias S.

As was the case with mortgages before the financial crisis, correlated\nrisks from these kinds of trends could have an effect that reaches beyond individual banks\nand borrowers to the broader financial system and economy. As with other financial\nstability vulnerabilities arising from macroeconomic risks, feedback loops could develop\nbetween the effects on the real economy and those on financial markets. For example, if\nprices of properties do not accurately reflect climate-related risks, a sudden correction\ncould result in losses to financial institutions, which could in turn reduce lending in the\neconomy. The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic\nactivity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets. Beyond these\nphysical risks, policymakers in some jurisdictions are assessing the resilience of the\nfinancial system to so-called transition risks: the risks associated with the transition to a\npolicy framework that curtails emissions.\nThe private sector is focused on climate risks. Private-sector businesses—\nincluding insurance companies, ratings agencies, data companies, and actuaries—are\nactively working to understand climate-related risks and make this information accessible\nto investors, policymakers, and financial institutions. Although this work is at an early\nstage, thousands of companies around the world are now reporting climate-related\nfinancial exposures to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) under the guidelines of the\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD).12 Based on these disclosures, the CDP estimates that the 500 largest companies\n12 Nicolette Bartlett and Tom Coleman (2019), Major Risk or Rosy Opportunity: Are Companies Ready for\nClimate Change?

A majority of the reporting companies integrate\nclimate risk into their business strategies and their broader risk-management frameworks.\nAn essential element of our bank supervision and regulation duties is assessing\nbanks’ risk-management systems. We expect banks to have systems in place that\nappropriately identify, measure, control, and monitor all of their material risks.13 These\nrisks may include severe weather events that can disrupt standard clearing and settlement\nactivity and increase the demand for cash. Banks also need to manage risks surrounding\npotential loan losses resulting from business interruptions and bankruptcies associated\nwith natural disasters, including risks associated with loans to properties that are likely to\nbecome uninsurable or activities that are highly exposed to climate risks.\nClimate Change and Community Reinvestment\nThe Federal Reserve also has important responsibilities in community\nreinvestment, which increasingly encompass recovering from and building resilience\nagainst natural disasters and severe weather events. Under the Community Reinvestment\nAct (CRA), banks have an affirmative obligation to meet the needs of their local\ncommunities, including low- and moderate-income communities. In recent years, the\nbanking agencies have issued a number of statements to clarify that disaster recovery\n13 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation\n(1995), “Rating the Adequacy of Risk Management Processes and Internal Controls at State Member Banks\nand Bank Holding Companies,” Supervision and Regulation Letter SR 95-51 (November 14),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/1995/sr9551.htm; Board of Governors, BS&R (2016),\n“Supervisory Guidance for Assessing Risk Management at Supervised Institutions with Total Consolidated\nAssets Less than $50 Billion,” Supervision and Regulation Letter SR 16-11 (June 8),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1611.htm; and Board of Governors, BS&R\n(2017), “Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness,” Compliance Guideline\n12 CFR 208 D-1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/reghcg.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nefforts are CRA-eligible activities.14 Our Community Advisory Council has urged more\nresearch on the effect of climate change on low- to moderate-income communities in\norder to help inform more effective responses.15 Working with local communities, the\nFederal Reserve staff have highlighted the ways in which lower-income households and\nunderserved areas tend to be particularly vulnerable to natural disasters.16 With low\nlevels of liquid savings to meet emergency expenditures, these households tend to be less\nresilient to the temporary loss of income, property damage, and health outcomes they\nface from disasters.17 In our community development work, we seek to encourage\nlenders and their local communities to rebuild in ways that will increase their resilience to\nfuture risks.\nAdvancing Our Understanding\nThe staff across the Federal Reserve System are researching a wide range of\ntopics related to climate risks, including how weather and natural disasters affect\neconomic and financial outcomes and the economic implications of climate policies,\nincluding for the energy sector.18 We currently assess the effects of severe weather\n14 Kevin Dancy (2018), “Weathering the Storm: A Framework for Meeting CRA Obligations,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Dallas, Community Development Publications (Dallas: FRB Dallas, August),\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/cd/pubs/storm.aspx.\n15 Community Advisory Council and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), Record of\nMeeting (Washington: Board of Governors, May 26),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/cac-20170526.pdf.\n16 Jesse M.

And we are in discussions about how we might\nparticipate in the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial\nSystem in order to learn from our international colleagues’ approaches to measuring and\nmanaging climate risks in the financial system.\nWe also have a lot to learn from the broader research community about the\neconomic and financial effects of climate change. As we have seen today, researchers are\nmaking progress on addressing questions regarding how climate change relates to labor\nmarkets, trade policy, and monetary policy. By participating more actively in climate-\nrelated research and practice, the Federal Reserve can be more effective in supporting a\nstrong economy and a stable financial system.",

Some of these effects could occur gradually, while others\ncould occur relatively quickly in the presence of “tipping points.” Policy, technology,\nand behavioral responses could similarly have material financial consequences. Against\nthis backdrop, the Federal Reserve is carefully considering the potential implications of\nclimate-related risks for financial institutions and the financial system, with scenario\nanalysis emerging as a potential key analytical tool for that purpose.\nClimate change is projected to have profound effects on the economy and the\nfinancial system, and it is already inflicting damage. The Sixth Assessment Report by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes that “if global warming\nincreases, some compound extreme events with low likelihood in [the] past and current\nclimate will become more frequent, and there will be a higher likelihood that events with\nincreased intensities, durations and/or spatial extents unprecedented in the observational\nrecord will occur.”2\n1 I am grateful to Luca Guerrieri and Cindy Vojtech as well as Kevin Stiroh of the Federal Reserve Board\nfor their assistance in preparing this text.

The total cost of U.S. weather and climate\ndisasters over the last 5 full years exceeds $630 billion, which is a record.3 During this\nperiod, massive flooding in the Midwest has caused billions of dollars in damages to\nfarms, homes, and businesses.4 The California Department of Insurance has documented\ngrowing problems with the availability of fire insurance for homeowners, and the state\nlegislature provided new protections for wildfire survivors.5 Last year was the sixth\nconsecutive year that the United States experienced ten or more billion-dollar weather\nand climate disasters.6 And this summer, Hurricane Ida alone is estimated to have caused\nmore than $30 billion in insurance losses.7\nThe pandemic is a stark reminder that extreme events can materialize with little\nwarning and trigger severe financial losses and market disruptions, and the IPCC Sixth\nAssessment Report is a reminder of the high uncertainty and potential costs associated\nwith climate-related risks. It will be important to systematically assess the resilience of\n3 Damage estimate uses events listed in years 2016 through 2020 in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration’s Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database, available on the agency’s website\nat https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events.\n4 See Donnelle Eller (2021), “Climate Change-Driven ‘Midwest Water Hose’ Caused Massive 2019\nFlooding in Iowa, Elsewhere, UI Researchers Find,” Des Moines Register, March 2,\nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2021/03/02/ui-study-climate-change-midwest-\nwater-hose-dumping-rain-university-iowa/6884486002.\n5 See California Department of Insurance (2018), “Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones Releases Report\nAddressing Fire Insurance Availability Issues,” press release, January 4,\nhttp://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2018/release002-18.cfm; and\nCalifornia Department of Insurance (2021), “Wildfire Survivors Now Covered by New Insurance\nProtections,” press release, July 27, http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-\nreleases/2021/release078-2021.cfm.\n6 See the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate\nDisasters database, in note 3.\n7 See Leslie Scism (2021), “Ida Storm Damage Expected to Cost Insurers at Least $31 Billion,” Wall Street\nJournal, September 22.\n\n- 3 -\nlarge financial institutions and the broader financial system to climate-related risk\nscenarios.\nClimate Scenario Analysis\nAs we are learning from the pandemic, risks emanating from outside the economy\ncan have devastating financial consequences. As part of our prudential and financial\nstability responsibilities, we are developing scenario analysis to model the possible\nfinancial risks associated with climate change and assess the resilience of individual\nfinancial institutions and the financial system to these risks. The future financial and\neconomic consequences of climate change will depend on the severity of the physical\neffects and the nature and speed of the transition to a sustainable economy. So it is\nimportant to model the transition risks arising from changes in policies, technology, and\nconsumer and investor behavior and the physical risks of damages caused by an increase\nin the frequency and severity of climate-related events as well as chronic changes, such\nas rising temperatures and sea levels.\nFrom the IPCC’s work, we know that the physical risks related to climate change\nwill grow over time, while the transition risks will depend in part on how abruptly policy,\ntechnology, and behavioral changes take place. Since financial markets are forward\nlooking, a change in expectations regarding climate-related risks could lead to a sharp\nrepricing of assets at any time. Acute hazards, such as damaging hurricanes, or climate-\nrelated policy changes could quickly alter perceptions of future risk or reveal new\ninformation about the value of assets. Sudden asset price changes can lead to financial\n\n- 4 -\ninstability when they interact with other vulnerabilities, such as high leverage or\ncorrelated exposures.8\nScenario analysis is a useful tool in assessing the links between climate-related\nrisks and economic outcomes because it requires assessing the implications for financial\nstability and individual financial institutions in a systematic way. The interactions across\ninstitutions and market segments must be traced out, and missing data must be identified,\nacquired, and analyzed, leading to a clearer picture of the transmission of risks. Scenario\nanalysis should ultimately facilitate estimating the possible effects on individual financial\ninstitutions as well as on financial markets more broadly. By systematically modeling the\neffects of climate-related risks across the financial system, scenario analysis can help\ninform risk management at the level of individual financial institutions and more broadly.\nGiven that this conference is about stress testing, it is worth revisiting some\nlessons from the first generation of bank stress tests.9 Bank stress tests were developed at\nthe height of the 2007–09 financial crisis to provide a more systematic way to assess the\neffects of complex and interrelated exposures within the financial system. The first test,\nknown as the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), used simplified models\nwith limited data inputs. Despite substantial uncertainty about the economy’s path, the\nSCAP was broadly viewed as successful. It provided a solid foundation for building out\n8 See the box “The Implications of Climate Change for Financial Stability” in Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2020), Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of Governors, November),\npp. 58–59, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20201109.pdf.\n9 Several of the conference papers apply lessons from stress testing to the analysis of climate-related risks.\nSee Paulo Issler, Richard Stanton, Carles Vergara-Alert, and Nancy Wallace (2021), “Mortgage Markets\nwith Climate-Change Risk: Evidence from Wildfires in California”; Hyeyoon Jung, Robert Engle, and\nRichard Berner (2021), “Climate Stress Testing”; and Henk Jan Reinders, Dirk Schoenmaker, and Mathijs\nvan Dijk (2021), “A Finance Approach to Climate Stress Testing.” These three papers can be downloaded\nfrom the conference website, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n(https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/events/federal-reserve-stress-testing-research-\nconference/2021.aspx).\n\n- 5 -\nthe stress-testing program over the subsequent decade. The stress test infrastructure and\ngranular models and data that are currently available bear little resemblance to that first\nstress test. In parallel, banks have improved their risk-management operations, and large\nbanks now routinely use their own stress tests to assess and manage their risks.\nSo what are the lessons for scenario analysis? Starting down the path of climate\nscenario analysis, even with a rudimentary first attempt, will help with risk identification\nand suggest useful lessons to inform subsequent improvements in modeling, data, and\nfinancial disclosures. Although we should be humble about what the first generation of\nclimate scenario analysis is likely to deliver, the challenges we face should not deter us\nfrom building the foundations now.\nLearning from Climate Scenario Analysis in Other Countries\nThere is a growing international consensus that climate scenario analysis is a vital\ntool for assessing the effects of climate-related risks on financial institutions and the\nfinancial system. Since 2017, a group of regulators from across the world has been\nsharing best practices regarding climate-related risk management within the Network of\nCentral Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The Federal\nReserve joined this international collaboration late last year.\nSeveral countries have already made substantial progress on climate scenario\nanalysis. The scenarios produced by the NGFS, with appropriate tailoring to local\nconditions, have been incorporated in climate change analysis by the European Central\nBank (ECB) as well as by financial regulators in Canada, France, and the United\nKingdom. For instance, the ECB published results from its analysis of climate-related\nrisks in September 2021, and the Bank of England published scenarios in June 2021 with\n\n- 6 -\nresults expected in the middle of 2022.10 The Federal Reserve is actively learning from\nthese early adopters.\nOvercoming Challenges in Implementing Climate Scenario Analysis\nThere are challenges to quantifying the effects of climate-related risks on the\neconomy and the financial system. Climate scenario analysis faces the challenge of\nhaving to consider plausible but novel combinations of risks that are associated with\nsubstantial uncertainty. For traditional financial risk scenarios, modelers can draw on the\nhistorical record to help gauge the plausible repercussions for different asset classes as\nwell as the economic consequences at the national level. Even in the case of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, modelers could draw useful lessons from previous pandemics, such as the\n1918 influenza.11 By contrast, there may not be analogous historical precedents to draw\non in the formulation of appropriate climate scenarios and the quantification of their\neffects on different asset classes, regions, and sectors.\nIn addition, climate scenario analysis may need to consider interdependencies\nacross the financial system. Banks and other financial institutions often rely on insurance\nand other hedging strategies to reduce potential losses. With climate risk raising\ninsurance premiums charged to property owners or reducing the availability of insurance\nin certain geographies and on certain asset classes, it may be important to assess the\n10 For the European Central Bank, see ECB (2021), “Firms and Banks to Benefit from Early Adoption of\nGreen Policies, ECB’s Economy-wide Climate Stress Test Shows,” press release, September 22,\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr210922~59ade4710b.en.html; and Luis de\nGuindos (2021), “Shining a Light on Climate Risks: The ECB’s Economy-wide Climate Stress Test,” ECB\nBlog, March 18,\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2021/html/ecb.blog210318~3bbc68ffc5.en.html.

Stress could be transmitted through a sudden repricing of\ninsurance contracts or by a withdrawal of coverage, as we are already seeing in the case\nof wildfires and flooding in certain areas. While reinsurance contracts and agreements\namong investors can transfer risk across the financial system, some level of risk is likely\nto remain. Climate-related risks could build up in hidden ways that could result in\ncascading losses.\nUsing Established Economic Foundations for Transition Risks\nThe costs and timing of the transition to a low-carbon economy will depend on\nhard-to-predict policy, technology, and behavioral changes.12 While an orderly and\nsteady transition to a sustainable economy may have manageable economic\nconsequences, more costly changes would likely accompany an abrupt transition. A\ndisorderly scenario could generate sizable economic consequences that vary substantially\nacross geographies, sectors, and assets. Some of these effects could manifest in the near\nterm if investment sentiment were to change suddenly. That said, the long tradition\nwithin economics of estimating the effects of policy changes can be applied to the\nmodeling of transition risks, even disorderly scenarios.13\nMapping the Economic Consequences of Physical Risks\nWhereas existing economic tools can be applied to transition risks, the building\nblocks for assessing the economic consequences of physical risks in the presence of\n12 See International Energy Agency (2021), Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector\n(Paris: IEA, May), https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050.\n13 See Robert Vermeulen, Edo Schets, Melanie Lohuis, Barbara Kölbl, David-Jan Jansen, and Willem\nHeeringa (2018), “An Energy Transition Risk Stress Test for the Financial System of the Netherlands,”\nOccasional Studies, vol. 16-7 (Amsterdam: De Nederlandsche Bank, October), available at\nhttps://www.dnb.nl/en/publications/research-publications/occasional-studies/nr-7-2018-an-energy-\ntransition-risk-stress-test-for-the-financial-system-of-the-netherlands.\n\n- 8 -\nsubstantial uncertainty are still in development. The literature on the economic\nconsequences of physical risk is growing, but there are still some challenges in linking\nthis literature to the formulation of scenarios.14 For instance, extrapolating from the\nhistorical experience of sporadic extreme weather events may turn out to be misleading.\nEconomic activity has tended to rebound quickly after sporadic extreme weather events\nin recent experience, often supported by significant reconstruction. In contrast, climate\nchange is an ongoing, cumulative process that could significantly increase the prevalence\nand severity of extreme events as well as contribute to chronic changes. These\ncumulative and chronic changes could have economic effects that differ substantively\nfrom the historic experience, for example, if they contribute to shifts in the location of\neconomic activity or the sectoral composition within a region.\nThe physical manifestations of climate change could increase the volatility of\neconomic activity and slow economic growth.15 The cumulative effects associated with\nclimate change could lead to irreversible “tipping points” that introduce new climate\nshocks and change the relationships between climate-related shocks and economic\nvariables. Tipping points, such as melting ice sheets and loss of permafrost or forests,\nhave the potential to create large disruptions in weather systems, regional water supplies,\nand the habitability of large land masses. The potential cumulative effects of climate-\n14 For instance, see Melissa Dell, Benjamin F. Jones, and Benjamin A. Olken (2012), “Temperature Shocks\nand Economic Growth: Evidence from the Last Half Century,” American Economic Journal:\nMacroeconomics, vol. 4 (July), pp. 66–95; Solomon Hsiang, Robert Kopp, Amir Jina, James Rising,\nMichael Delgado, Shashank Mohan, D.J.

Regional and sectoral differentiation has important implications for scenario\nanalysis.17 Climate-related risks can be expected to have direct effects not only on the\nvaluation of assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, but also on revenues\nand costs. While standard models for projecting the net revenues of financial institutions\nare typically driven by national-level proxies of aggregate demand, such as growth and\nunemployment levels, additional sectoral and regional granularity will be necessary for\nclimate scenario analysis. And while standard models for projecting losses on assets\naccount for regional and sectoral characteristics, climate scenario analysis will require\ncapturing the potential intensification of climate-related risks.\nClosing Data Gaps\nThese efforts to systematically assess climate-related risks will require substantial\nwork to address current data gaps. Financial institutions are collecting data and\ndeveloping scenario analysis to understand the potential effect of climate-related risks.\nSimilarly, the Federal Reserve is gathering key data resources, such as acquiring external\n16 See, for instance, Simon Dietz, James Rising, Thomas Stoerk, and Gernot Wagner (2021), “Economic\nImpacts of Tipping Points in the Climate System,” PNAS, vol. 118 (August),\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/118/34/e2103081118.\n17 See, for instance, ECB (2021), “Firms and Banks to Benefit from Early Adoption of Green Policies,\nECB’s Economy-wide Climate Stress Test Shows,” press release, September 22,\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr210922~59ade4710b.en.html.\n\n- 10 -\ndata and making existing publicly available climate data more useful for modeling and\nresearch capabilities.\nCurrent voluntary climate-related disclosures are an important first step in closing\ndata gaps, but they are prone to inconsistent quality and incompleteness. Without\nharmonization of the definitions and methods underlying these disclosures, it will be\nchallenging to make comparisons across firms and exposures. Consistent, comparable,\nand, ultimately, mandatory disclosures are likely to be vital to enable market participants\nto measure, monitor, and manage climate risks on a consistent basis across firms.18 The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission has responsibility for this critical workstream in\nthe United States.19\nMaking Progress\nGoing forward, it will be important to improve our understanding of climate-\nrelated financial risks and vulnerabilities. The Federal Reserve’s Supervision Climate\nCommittee is engaging with domestic stakeholders and other supervisors from a\nprudential perspective. Ultimately, I anticipate it will be helpful to provide supervisory\nguidance for large banking institutions in their efforts to appropriately measure, monitor,\nand manage material climate-related risks, following the lead of a number of other\ncountries.\n18 See, for instance, Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (2021),\nProgress Report on Bridging Data Gaps (Paris: NGFS, May),\nhttps://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/medias/documents/progress_report_on_bridging_data_gaps.pdf;\nand the communiqué on the Third G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting, held\nJuly 9–10, 2021, https://www.g20.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Communique-Third-G20-FMCBG-\nmeeting-9-10-July-2021.pdf.\n19 See Gary Gensler (2021), “Prepared Remarks before the Principles for Responsible Investment ‘Climate\nand Global Financial Markets’ Webinar,” Washington, July 28, https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-\npri-2021-07-28.\n\n- 11 -\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Climate Committee is\nassessing climate-related risks to financial stability from a macroprudential perspective—\nthat is, one that considers the potential for complex interactions across the financial\nsystem. Both the prudential and macroprudential work programs will benefit from the\ndevelopment of climate scenario analysis.\nConclusion\nTogether these efforts can help ensure that the financial system is resilient to\nclimate-related risks and well positioned for the transition to a sustainable economy. Our\nconversations with climate experts, large banking institutions, other financial\nintermediaries, stakeholders, and regulators underscore the complexity of the connections\nbetween the climate and economic and financial systems. To better understand these\nconnections, several foreign regulators have already undertaken climate scenario\nanalysis, affording us the opportunity to learn from their experiences. It will be helpful to\nmove ahead with the first generation of climate scenario analysis to identify risks and\npotential issues and to inform subsequent refinements to our models and data. We will\nreach better outcomes if we tackle these challenges through open dialogue and continued\nengagement of the kind exemplified by today’s conference.",

In my time at the Federal Reserve, I have found that hearing directly from\npeople around the country about how their communities are experiencing the economy is\nvital to carrying out my responsibilities. It helps me to understand what is working well\nand what the challenges are, and it provides ideas on how to improve economic\nopportunities. Today I look forward to hearing your perspective on the economy and the\nbanking business in and around Scranton.\nBefore hearing from you, I was asked to provide my perspective on the national\neconomy. Recent data suggest the economy is growing solidly. Consumer spending is\nrobust, buoyed by the strong labor market and continued strong confidence. Last week’s\nstrong jobs report provided reassurance that employment has continued to expand at a\nhealthy pace. Payrolls have risen at a 170,000 monthly pace over the past three\nmonths—more than enough to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. The\nunemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, wages are growing at a moderate pace,\nthe percentage of prime-age adults who are employed is close to its pre-crisis peak, and\nclaims have been hovering around historic lows. Furthermore, financial conditions\noverall remain quite supportive of continued employment and output growth.\nBy contrast, capital spending by businesses has been lackluster, and indicators of\nbusiness sentiment have been soft. The recent G-20 summit provided a constructive\nchange in tone about trade discussions, but business sentiment and investment plans will\nlikely remain sensitive to uncertainty around trade and the global outlook. Fiscal policy\nis also a source of uncertainty, with both the debt ceiling and the federal budget needing\nto be resolved.\n\n- 2 -\nOver the past year, inflation has fallen short of the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent\nobjective, and that has been the case more often than not in recent years. On the one\nhand, that means the economy can continue to grow without pushing inflation too high.\nOn the other hand, inflation that runs too low for long periods can pose difficult\nchallenges. Below-target inflation reduces the amount of room the Federal Reserve has\nto cut the federal funds rate to cushion the economy from negative developments. And it\ncould lead people to lower their expectations for future inflation, which in turn could lead\nto an increasing shortfall of inflation from our objective.1 Indeed, some indicators of\nlonger-run inflation expectations have been on the soft side in recent months.\nPutting all of the pieces together, it appears the economy has been doing well so\nfar this year, bolstered by confident consumers and a strong job market. And after\nfluctuations earlier in the year, financial markets currently appear supportive of growth,\nwith borrowing rates low and the stock market at all-time highs.\nWhile the modal outlook is solid, the downside risks, if they materialize, could\nweigh on economic activity. Taking into account the downside risks at a time when\ninflation is on the soft side would argue for softening the expected path of monetary\npolicy according to basic principles of risk management. Of course, my judgment about\nthe actual path of policy will continue to be influenced by the evolution of the data and\nthe risks.\nI am mindful that low spreads on corporate credit, together with risky corporate\ndebt at historic highs, suggest financial imbalances are growing. We should be\n1 The federal funds rate was close to zero for nearly seven years following the financial crisis, and it likely\nwould return to zero in a downturn. When nominal interest rates are zero, a drop in inflation expectations\ncan be especially problematic, making the “real” interest rates that matter for household and business\ndecisions higher than they would otherwise be and therefore less supportive of growth.\n\n- 3 -\naddressing these financial imbalances by activation of the countercyclical capital buffer,\nmore rigorous use of stress tests, and active monitoring of leveraged lending.\nSo what does this mean for you and the families and businesses you serve in and\naround Scranton? I hope and expect that the progress you have made in transforming the\nregion’s economy will continue as the expansion extends into its 11th year. I am well\naware of the challenges this area has been working to overcome since the Great\nRecession. And I am impressed by how much has been accomplished here. You have\nhad important success in attracting new logistics jobs to take advantage of Northeastern\nPennsylvania’s proximity to major cities. You are making important investments in the\nforward-looking “eds and meds” (education and health-care) sectors by leveraging the 19\ncolleges and universities in and around Scranton. There are signs that these investments\nare paying off. Household incomes in Scranton are growing again. The area’s\nunemployment rate is close to its lowest level in the past 40 years. I look forward to\nhearing from the community bankers gathered here today about the outlook for families\nand businesses in Northeastern Pennsylvania and how you are helping the region invest\nand grow.\nAnd I am looking forward to continuing the discussions tomorrow, when I will\nvisit with the Scranton Area Community Foundation to discuss the Northeastern\nPennsylvania equitable transportation initiative, NEPA Moves, that is working on\ntransportation solutions to connect residents with opportunity. I look forward to visiting\nGeisinger Fresh Food Farmacy and meeting with patients to hear about the innovative\n“food as medicine” program. I also look forward to visiting the Cedar Avenue corridor\n\n- 4 -\nwith the United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern Pennsylvania to hear about the\nresident-driven revitalization there.\nLet me again thank Pat Harker and all of you for having me here today. I look\nforward to our discussion.",

Kennedy School of Government\nHarvard University\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nMarch 1, 2017\n\nThe economy appears to be at a transition. We are closing in on full employment,\ninflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing,\nand risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time.\nAssuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional\naccommodation, continuing on a gradual path.1\nAs normalization of the federal funds rate gets further under way, monetary\npolicy too is approaching a transition, prompting increased focus on the balance sheet.\nHow the federal funds rate and the balance sheet should be adjusted individually and in\ncombination depends on the degree to which they are substitutes, their relative precision,\nand the degree to which their effects on the economy are well understood.\nLet me start with the outlook and then turn to policy.\nProgress at Home and Abroad\nOver the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity\nboth at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from\nabroad was considerable. Between the middle of 2014 and 2016, a combination of\nnotable fragilities and risks in large foreign economies, elevated sensitivity of the dollar\nto policy divergence, a sharp decline in oil prices, and financial markets’ heightened\nsensitivity to these downside risks slowed progress in the U.S. economy and the\nadjustment of monetary policy to an extent few had anticipated. After being an important\nconstraint in the past few years, the external environment currently appears more benign\nthan it has been for some time, even though risks remain.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nNear-term risks to the United States from abroad appear to have diminished.\nRecoveries are gaining traction in China, Europe, and Japan in part reflecting greater\nconfidence in their respective policy environments. The improvement in the global risk\noutlook was also helped by the continued economic progress and the gradual pace of\nmonetary policy adjustment in the United States last year.\nIn recent quarters, market participants appear more confident that China has the\nwill and capacity to maintain its exchange rate regime, while achieving its growth targets,\nalthough there is a tension with high credit growth that will eventually need to be\naddressed. Early last year, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which had\naveraged nearly 8 percent over the previous five years, was only a little above an annual\nrate of 5 percent in the first quarter, according to official data, and many observers\nbelieve that actual growth was weaker. Relatively large discrete declines in the renminbi\nagainst the dollar and a surge in private-sector investment outflows led to considerable\nvolatility in foreign exchange markets and financial markets more broadly.\nIn response, Chinese authorities boosted the supply of credit, ramped up fiscal\nstimulus, initiated new communications regarding the exchange rate, and clamped down\non capital outflows. These actions appear to have stabilized growth and calmed fears of\nfinancial instability stemming from a sudden large devaluation in the renminbi. GDP\ngrowth rebounded to an average annual pace of over 7 percent in the final three quarters\nof the year. The exchange value of the renminbi has remained relatively constant against\nthe central bank’s designated basket of currencies, and it has depreciated against the\ndollar at a more gradual pace. Capital outflows, while still significant, have moderated.\n\n- 3 -\nIn Europe, the recovery has proven to be increasingly resilient. Monetary policy\nhas continued to provide crucial support. As a result, several challenges--including\nreferendums in the United Kingdom and Italy and liquidity and capital stresses faced by\nGerman and Italian banks--have so far been navigated without significant damage to\ngrowth, financial stability, or inflation expectations. Fiscal policy has ceased being a\ndrag on demand growth and, in some cases, has turned moderately expansionary. Overall\neuro-area GDP increased at an annual rate of 1-3/4 percent last year, sufficiently in\nexcess of potential output growth to bring the unemployment rate down nearly 1\npercentage point. Despite some instances of heightened volatility, financial markets have\nfunctioned reasonably well, and risk spreads have stayed contained, although uncertainty\nabout upcoming elections has likely led to some increase in French and Italian sovereign\nspreads in recent months. Fears of disinflation also appear to have abated: Measures of\ninflation compensation based on 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation swaps, which fell to 1-1/4\npercent in the middle of last year, have recently moved up to 1-3/4 percent.\nActivity in Japan has also picked up recently, with GDP increasing 1-1/2 percent\nlast year--noticeably above the estimated rate of potential growth--and the unemployment\nrate declining 1/4 percentage point to 3 percent, as monetary policy has remained\nsupportive.\nOf course, concerns regarding the medium to longer run remain. In China, the\nprice of near-term stability has been an increase in leverage, particularly in the corporate\nsector. China’s overall debt-GDP ratio is elevated for an emerging market economy,\nespecially considering that Chinese growth is likely to slow noticeably in coming years.\nIn Japan, core consumer price inflation is close to zero--well below the central bank’s 2\n\n- 4 -\npercent target--and scope for additional monetary policy accommodation is limited,\nleaving the economy vulnerable to adverse demand shocks. In the euro area, growth and\ninflation may remain low for some time, which could pose challenges for banks with low\ncapital or high amounts of nonperforming loans and for highly-indebted sovereigns.\nPolitical events in Europe also raise some uncertainty. Going forward, it will be\nimportant to continue to monitor these and other foreign developments carefully.\nHere at home, the economy is at a transition. The past few months have seen\ncontinued progress in the labor market. Monthly gains in payroll employment have\nmaintained a pace sufficient to continue eroding labor market slack, and wage growth\nappears to be moving higher on balance. Compensation per hour in the business sector,\nthe most comprehensive measure of wages, increased at a 3 percent pace the past two\nyears, noticeably above the pace earlier in the recovery.\nWe appear to be closing in on full employment. The unemployment rate--after\nremaining relatively flat from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016--fell\n1/4 percentage point last quarter to 4-3/4 percent. In addition, the labor force\nparticipation rate has been about flat, on net, over the past 2-1/2 years, which indicates\nconsiderable ongoing cyclical improvement, given the declining demographic trend.\nEven so, there may be some room for further improvement. The prime-age employment-\nto-population ratio remains depressed relative to pre-crisis levels; the share of employees\nworking part time who would prefer full-time work remains elevated; and some measures\nof wage growth, such as the employment cost index, have increased relatively little in\nrecent years.\n\n- 5 -\nMost recently, we are also seeing welcome signs of progress on the second leg of\nour dual mandate after a protracted period of shortfalls from the FOMC target of 2\npercent inflation. Recent months have seen a step-up in longer-run inflation\ncompensation, which had dropped to worrisomely low levels last year raising concerns\nabout a softening of inflation expectations to the downside. Both market- and some\nsurvey-based measures of inflation expectations remain somewhat low, but there has\nbeen some movement in the right direction in the past few months. Inflation has moved\nup lately as the effect of past increases in the dollar and declines in energy prices have\nfaded. The 12-month change in headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\nprices was 1.9 percent in January, although this partly reflects a temporary boost from\nenergy prices. Core PCE inflation--which strips out volatile food and energy prices and\nis a good gauge of future inflation--has also increased. At 1.7 percent in January, the 12-\nmonth change is 0.1 percentage point higher than a year ago. Still, core inflation has\nbeen below our 2 percent target for almost all of the past eight years, and further progress\nis necessary to reach and sustain our symmetric inflation goal.\nRecent indicators of aggregate spending suggest we will continue to edge closer\nto our goals in the months ahead. Consumption growth has been encouraging, supported\nby continued job gains, rising wealth, and greater confidence. Business investment\nchanged little the past two years, but there are currently signs of renewed growth. The\ncontrast with the situation a year ago is sharp. Then, risk spreads on corporate bonds had\nrisen noticeably--often a precursor to downturns--measures of business sentiment were\nrelatively depressed, and corporate profits had declined over 10 percent. In recent\nquarters, the environment has become more favorable. Risk spreads have moved back\n\n- 6 -\ndown to more normal levels, business sentiment has rebounded, economic profits look to\nhave turned up, and new orders for capital goods are moving higher. The partial rebound\nin oil prices has also given a boost to drilling activity. However, some crosscurrents\ncould weigh on aggregate demand this year. The recent increases in longer-term interest\nrates could restrain housing activity as well as other interest-sensitive areas of demand,\nand some further pickup in the dollar could weigh on net exports and business\ninvestment.\nRecent months have seen an increase in the upside risks to domestic demand.\nSentiment has increased along with equity prices, which are up around 10 percent since\nOctober. Increased optimism could lead to faster growth in consumption and business\ninvestment, although the spending data, thus far, do not suggest a noticeable acceleration.\nSome of the increase in sentiment and changes in asset prices could be tied to\nexpectations of more expansive fiscal policy, another upside risk. In addition, the\nprogress that we have made over the past year, with the economy closer to meeting full\nemployment and inflation objectives, has contributed to the favorable shift in the balance\nof risks. The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign\nrisks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had\nbeen for the preceding two years.\nNonetheless, the neutral real rate of interest--or the level of the real federal funds\nrate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment\nand stable inflation--is expected to remain low both in the near term and in the longer\nrun, and inflation is only slowly recovering from a protracted period of low levels. The\nnominal neutral interest rate--which adjusts the real neutral rate for the level of inflation--\n\n- 7 -\nis likely to remain below its historical average even once it reaches its new longer-run\nnormal level. The lower rate environment means there will be less room to cut the\nfederal funds rate, so that if the economy experiences adverse shocks similar in severity\nand frequency to those in the past the likelihood of returning to and operating near the\neffective lower bound will remain elevated relative to historical experience. Prudent risk\nmanagement suggests that policy should take into account the asymmetry in risks posed\nby the greater likelihood of the economy being at the effective lower bound, where\nconventional policy is constrained.\nWhat about the Balance Sheet?\nGiven the progress we have seen and the positive momentum in the incoming\ndata, continued gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be appropriate. But\nunlike in previous tightening cycles, the Federal Open Market Committee currently has\ntwo tools to remove accommodation: the balance sheet as well as the federal funds rate.\nIn December 2015, the Committee indicated that it would continue to reinvest\nprincipal payments until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is “well under\nway.”2 The decision to rely solely on the federal funds rate to remove accommodation\ninitially until normalization is well under way serves an important purpose, in my view.3\nWith asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary policy to respond to shocks,\nthere is a benefit to enabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would be\n2 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, February 1,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20170201a.htm. This approach is consistent\nwith the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\n3 This is the rationale in Lael Brainard (2015), “Normalizing Monetary Policy When the Neutral Interest\nRate is Low,” speech delivered at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford, Calif.,\nDecember 1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151201a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\npossible with a shrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for\nsignificant reductions if economic conditions deteriorate.4\nEven so, recognizing that the median of the Committee projections places the\nlong-run value of the federal funds rate around 3 percent--a very low level by historical\nstandards--some could judge normalization to be well under way before too long. Thus,\nmonetary policy too may be approaching a transition.\nOnce the short-term rate is comfortably distant from its effective lower bound,\nthere are broadly two types of policy strategies that could be contemplated. Many central\nbanks around the world may contemplate similar choices in the coming years, while the\nBank of Japan has already grappled with these issues in the past.5 One type of\n“complementarity” strategy might actively deploy the balance sheet as an independent\nsecond tool, complementary to the short-term rate. Under this strategy, both tools would\nbe actively used to help achieve the Committee’s goals. This strategy would seek to take\nadvantage of the ways in which the balance sheet might affect certain aspects of the\neconomy or financial markets differently than the short-term rate. Any differences in\neffects might derive from the fact that the balance sheet more directly, though not\nnecessarily more precisely, affects term premiums on longer-term securities, while the\nshort-term rate more directly affects money-market rates.\n4 The Bank of England has stated that it is unlikely that it will reduce the size of its balance sheet until the\nBank Rate has reached a level of around 2 percent; see Bank of England (2015), Inflation Report (London:\nBOE, November), p. 34,\nhttp://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2015/nov.pdf.\n5 In 2006, the Bank of Japan reduced the size of its balance sheet by allowing short-term security holdings\nto run off and without relying on asset sales; see Kazuo Ueda (2010), “The Bank of Japan’s Experience\nwith Non-Traditional Monetary Policy,” paper presented at “Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation\nEnvironment,” a conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 16,\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/conference/55/papers/Ueda.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nAlthough it may be tempting, in theory, to operate with the balance sheet as a\ncomplementary, additional tool to the federal funds rate, we have virtually no experience\nwith how such an approach would work in practice away from the effective lower bound.\nFor that reason, one might instead prefer a “subordination” strategy that would prioritize\nthe federal funds rate as the sole active tool away from the effective lower bound,\neffectively subordinating the balance sheet. Once federal funds normalization meets the\ntest of being well under way, triggering an end to the current reinvestment policy, the\nbalance sheet would be set on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until a\n“new normal” has been reached, and then increasing in line with trend increases in the\ndemand for currency thereafter.6 Under this strategy, the balance sheet might be used as\nan active tool only if adverse shocks push the economy back to the effective lower bound.\nThe case for the subordination strategy is straightforward and compelling. This\nstrategy recognizes that the two policy tools are broadly similar in the ways they affect\nthe economy by indirectly changing the level of interest rates used to finance purchases\nby households and businesses. These interest rate changes also have effects on asset\nprices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar\nand, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet\npolicies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively\ntested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to\nmeasure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real\n6 The Committee has indicated that it intends to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings in a\ngradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held\nin the System Open Market Account; see Federal Open Market Committee, Policy Normalization\nPrinciples and Plans, in note 2.\n7 There may be differences in the specific ways changes in short-term rates and the balance sheet transmit\nto different asset prices and the exchange rate, although estimates are limited and lack precision.\n\n- 10 -\nactivity. In contrast, experience using the balance sheet as an active tool has been very\nlimited and largely confined to a highly unusual period around the Global Financial\nCrisis, when short-term interest rates were constrained by the zero lower bound.\nPredictability, parsimony, precision, and clarity of communications all would seem to\nargue in favor of focusing policy on a single active tool that is most familiar. In short, it\nmakes sense to focus policy on the tool whose effects are better understood by both\npolicymakers and the public in circumstances where the tools are largely substitutes for\none another.\nEven with this subordination strategy, however, there may be limited\ncircumstances in which the balance sheet might be employed in a manner that is\nsupportive of the short-term rate. Most obviously, during the period when the balance\nsheet is running down, if the economy encounters adverse shocks, it may be appropriate\nto commence the reinvestment of principal payments again in order to preserve\nconventional policy space if the federal funds rate were to drop below some threshold\nlevel, perhaps similar to the “well under way” threshold.\nMore broadly, although the two tools can achieve roughly similar effects, they are\ndifferent, and we cannot rule out that there may be special circumstances in which these\ndifferences may be particularly valuable. In particular, these differences may be an\nimportant consideration in circumstances when the transmission of changes in the short-\nterm rate to long-term rates and other financial market variables and the real economy is\nimpeded. In addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the\nbalance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-\nterm rate. Some observers believe that such signaling was an important contributor to the\n\n- 11 -\neffect of the balance sheet on the economy during and after the Global Financial Crisis.8\nThus, the subordination strategy will likely be appropriate in most circumstances, but we\ncannot completely rule out special circumstances in which the complementary use of both\ntools may prove compelling.\nAssuming that a subordination strategy is adopted, and the balance sheet is set to\nshrink passively and predictably once reinvestment ceases or is phased out, there is some\nuncertainty around the size of the balance sheet when it returns to normal, which the\nCommittee has described as “no larger than necessary for the efficient and effective\nimplementation of monetary policy.”\nThere are good reasons to expect a normalized balance sheet to be considerably\nsmaller than its current size but larger than its pre-crisis level. Most obviously, trend\ngrowth in the demand for currency gradually pushes up the size of the balance sheet over\ntime, but there are also other reasons to expect the post-crisis new normal to be larger\nthan pre-crisis levels. The structural demand for reserves may be considerably larger\nnow than prior to the financial crisis because of a number of changes, including new\nregulations that favor safe liquid assets and changes in financial institutions’ attitudes\ntoward risk.9 If the demand curve for reserve balances has shifted out, then a greater\nsupply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target. Moreover, the\nsupply of reserves will need to be set far enough above the structural level of demand to\naccommodate unexpected shocks to the demand and supply of reserves. To accomplish\n8 See, for example, Michael Woodford (2012), “Methods of Policy Accommodation at the Interest-Rate\nLower Bound,” paper presented at “The Changing Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 30-September 1,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/mw.pdf.\n9 In addition, the Federal Reserve now remunerates reserve balances held by depository institutions.\n\n- 12 -\nthis, the Committee could choose to implement policy by adjusting the supply of reserves\nto offset such shocks. Or, the Committee could decide to maintain the current floor\nsystem, in which a buffer of reserves, sufficient to accommodate any sizable shocks to\nreserves demand and supply, is maintained, thereby obviating the need for high-\nfrequency adjustments to the supply of reserves. The Committee’s normalization\nprinciples suggest that any buffer would be the minimum amount needed to efficiently\nand effectively implement policy.10\nBecause of changes in structural and short-term factors since the crisis, it is\ndifficult to know with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop while still\nmaintaining effective interest rate control. Thus, as the balance sheet gradually declines,\nit will be important to carefully monitor money markets for indications that any further\nreduction in the supply of reserves will begin to put upward pressure on money market\nrates. At that point, the amount of reserves will likely be close to the minimum amount\nnecessary to satisfy demand at the target rate.11\n10 For a discussion of floor systems and other frameworks for implementing monetary policy, see the\nNovember FOMC minutes, available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016),\n“Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, November 1-2, 2016,” press release, November 23,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20161123a.htm.\n11 Some experts have made financial stability arguments in favor of maintaining a level of reserves that is\nsomewhat larger than needed for monetary control alone. In the past, the demand for safe short-term assets\nhas sometimes been met by an increased supply of private-sector short-term debt, which has been\nassociated with increased leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation. Some argue that a greater\nsupply of safe short-term public debt could help prevent these potentially destabilizing developments from\noccurring. See Robin Greenwood, Samuel G. Hanson, and Jeremy C. Stein (2016), “The Federal Reserve’s\nBalance Sheet as a Financial-Stability Tool,” paper presented at “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy\nFrameworks for the Future,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in\nJackson Hole, Wyo., August 25-27,\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/econsymposium-greenwood-hanson-\nstein-paper.pdf?la=en; and Ben S.

With full employment within reach, signs of progress on our inflation\nmandate, and a favorable shift in the balance of risks at home and abroad, it will likely be\nappropriate for the Committee to continue gradually removing monetary accommodation.\nAs the federal funds rate continues to move higher toward its expected longer-run level, a\ntransition in balance sheet policy will also be warranted. These transitions in the\neconomy and monetary policy are positive reflections of the fact that the economy is\ngradually drawing closer to our policy goals. How the Committee should adjust the size\nand composition of the balance sheet to accomplish its goals and what level the balance\nsheet should be in normal times are important subjects that I look forward to discussing\nwith my colleagues.",

In the United States, in\nmy assessment, normalization of the federal funds rate is now well under way, and the\nFederal Reserve is advancing plans to allow the balance sheet to run off at a gradual and\npredictable pace. And for the first time in many years, the global economy is\nexperiencing synchronous growth, and authorities in the euro area and the United\nKingdom are beginning to discuss the time when the need for monetary accommodation\nwill diminish.\nUnlike in previous tightening cycles, many central banks currently have two tools\nfor removing accommodation. They can therefore pursue alternative normalization\nstrategies--first seeking to guide policy rates higher before initiating balance sheet runoff,\nas in the United States, or instead starting to shrink the balance sheet before initiating a\n1 I am grateful to John Ammer, Bastian von Beschwitz, Christopher Erceg, Matteo Iacoviello, and John\nRoberts for their assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my own views, which do not\nnecessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 The new commitment stated: “We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will\nremain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that\nwe will not target exchange rates.” See Group of Seven (2013), “Statement by G7 Finance Ministers and\nCentral Bank Governors,” February 12, paragraph 1, www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm130212.htm. The\ncorresponding Group of Twenty statement included the new commitment: “We will not target our\nexchange rates for competitive purposes.” See Group of Twenty (2013), “Communiqué of Meeting of G20\nFinance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,” February 16, paragraph 5,\nwww.g20.utoronto.ca/2013/2013-0216-finance.html.\n\n- 2 -\ntightening of short-term rates, or undertaking both in tandem. Shrinking the balance\nsheet and raising the policy rate can both contribute to achieving the domestic goals of\nmonetary policy, but it is an open question whether alternative normalization approaches\nmight have materially different implications for the composition of demand and for cross-\nborder spillovers, including through exchange rates and other financial channels.\nBefore discussing the cross-border effects of normalization, it is worth noting that\nthe two tools for removing accommodation--raising policy rates and reducing central\nbank balance sheets--appear to affect domestic output and inflation in a qualitatively\nsimilar way. This means that central banks can substitute between raising the policy rate\nand shrinking the balance sheet to remove accommodation, just as both were used to\nsupport the recovery following the Great Recession.\nInsofar as a range of approaches is likely to be consistent with achieving a central\nbank’s domestic objectives, the choice of normalization strategy may be influenced by\nother considerations, including the ease of implementing and communicating policy\nchanges, or the desire to minimize possible credit market distortions associated with the\nbalance sheet. In the case of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) decided to delay balance sheet normalization until the federal funds rate had\nreached a high enough level to enable it to be cut materially if economic conditions\ndeteriorate, thus guarding against the risk of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB)\nin an environment with a historically low neutral interest rate.3 The greater familiarity\nand past experience with the federal funds rate also weighed in favor of this instrument\n3 See, for example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, December 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20151216a.htm; and Brainard (2015b).\n\n- 3 -\ninitially. Separately, for those central banks that, unlike the Federal Reserve, moved to\nnegative interest rates, there may be special considerations associated with raising policy\nrates back into positive territory.\nOne question that naturally arises is whether the major central banks’\nnormalization plans may have material implications for cross-border spillovers--an\nimportant issue that until very recently had received scant attention. This question is a\nnatural extension of the literature examining the cross-border spillovers of the\nunconventional policy actions taken by the major central banks to provide\naccommodation.\nAlthough this literature suggests there are good reasons to expect broadly similar\ncross-border spillovers from tightening through policy rates as through balance sheet\nrunoff, the effects may not be exactly equivalent. The balance sheet might affect certain\naspects of the economy and financial markets differently than the short-term rate due to\nthe fact that the balance sheet more directly affects term premiums on longer-term\nsecurities, while the short-term rate more directly affects money market rates. As a\nresult, similar to the domestic effects, while the international spillovers of conventional\nand unconventional monetary policy may operate broadly similarly, the relative\nmagnitude of the different channels may be sufficiently different that, on net, the two\npolicy strategies have distinct effects. For example, as will be discussed at greater length\nshortly, the two strategies may have very different implications for the exchange rate.\nMoreover, as was evident with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) asset purchases in\nlate 2014 and early 2015, and as we have seen again in reverse in recent weeks, in\naddition to the standard demand and exchange rate channels, expected or actual asset\n\n- 4 -\npurchases may have spillovers to foreign financial conditions--by lowering term\npremiums and the associated longer-term foreign bond yields--that are greater than\nconventional monetary policy.\nTo explore possible differences, it is useful to compare two different approaches\nto policy normalization, each of which is designed to have identical effects on aggregate\ndomestic activity and thus, at least in the long run, on inflation. At one extreme, a central\nbank could opt to tighten primarily through conventional policy hikes, while maintaining\nthe balance sheet by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets. At the other extreme, a\ncentral bank could rely primarily on reducing the balance sheet, while keeping policy\nrates unchanged in the near term.\nThe question is whether there are circumstances in which the choice of\nnormalization strategies, which are similarly effective in achieving domestic mandates,\nmight matter for the global economy. Where the two approaches have entirely equivalent\neffects, the central bank could freely substitute between them without changing the\ncomposition of home demand, and net exports, the exchange rate, and foreign output\nwould also be unaffected.\nConversely, under different assumptions about the transmission channels of\nmonetary policy, alternative approaches to normalization can have quite different\nimplications for foreign economies. Most prominently, the exchange rate may be more\nsensitive to the path of short term rates than to balance sheet adjustments, as some\nresearch suggests.4 Although several papers using an event study approach find on\nbalance little disparity in the exchange rate sensitivity to short-term compared to long-\n4 See, for instance, Stavrakeva and Tang (2016).\n\n- 5 -\nterm interest rates, this lack of empirical consensus may simply reflect the difficulty of\ndisentangling changes in short-term and longer-term interest rates, which are highly\ncorrelated.5\nIndeed, the greater sensitivity of exchange rates to expected short-term interest\nrates than to term premiums was a key rationale behind the Operation Twist strategy in\nthe early 1960s.6 Under Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury made\nlarge-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to drive down yields and\nstimulate the economy, which was suffering from an unemployment rate of nearly 7\npercent. This policy was combined with a modest increase in short-term interest rates\nintended to alleviate the capital outflow pressures that threatened the sustainability of the\nBretton Woods global monetary system. Ultimately, this policy mix did succeed in\nreducing long-term interest rates, and also contributed to a reduction in private capital\noutflows that relieved pressure on U.S. international reserves, at least for a time.\nLet’s turn to a simulation of a highly stylized model to explore how a greater\nsensitivity of the exchange rate to conventional policy relative to balance sheet actions\ncan make a difference in terms of cross-border transmission. In particular, let’s assume a\n100-basis-point rise in long-term yields coming from the conventional channel of higher\npolicy rates has double the effect on the exchange rate as a 100 basis point rise in yields\ncoming from higher term premiums.7 If a large country, which is already at potential,\nexperiences a favorable domestic demand shock, it would need to tighten monetary\n5 See Glick and Leduc (2015), Ferrari, Kearns, and Schrimpf (2016), and Swanson (2017); Swanson\nattempts to identify separately the effects of forward guidance and asset purchases.\n6 See Ross (1966), Modigliani and Sutch (1966), Stein (1965), and Alon and Swanson (2011).\n7 This simulation is shown in figure 1 in the appendix. The stylized model is composed of two identical\ncountries that are linked through trade flows. The model is calibrated so that either type of policy action\nkeeps the home country’s GDP at baseline.\n\n- 6 -\npolicy to return output to potential. If the central bank chooses to use the short-term\ninterest rate as its active policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, the current and\nexpected path of short-term interest rates rises, putting upward pressure on long-term\nbond yields and causing the real exchange rate to appreciate. The stronger currency\ncoupled with some initial expansion of domestic demand in turn cause a deterioration in\nreal net exports.\nTurning to the effects abroad, the decline in domestic real net exports corresponds\nto an increase in foreign net exports, which will tend to boost foreign GDP, other things\nbeing equal. How this affects a particular foreign economy will depend on its\ncircumstances and the corresponding policy response of the foreign central bank. In the\ncase where the foreign economy is pinned at the effective lower bound, the increase in\nnet exports will provide a welcome boost to aggregate demand. By contrast, if foreign\noutput is already near potential, the foreign central bank will need to respond by\ntightening policy in order to keep its economy in balance.\nNow, let’s instead consider tightening through the balance sheet. If the same\namount of policy tightening in the country experiencing a positive demand shock is\nachieved exclusively through a reduction in the balance sheet, while keeping the policy\nrate unchanged, the exchange rate would appreciate to a smaller degree, reflecting the\nlower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to the term premium than to policy rates.\nNet exports would decline by less--reflecting both the smaller exchange rate appreciation\nand the smaller rise in domestic demand--and similarly this would result in smaller cross-\nborder spillovers to foreign GDP.\n\n- 7 -\nThus, for a foreign economy that is at the effective lower bound, tightening in the\nhome country through balance-sheet policy will be less welcome than through short-term\nrates. The foreign economy will experience less exchange rate depreciation, and so less\nof a boost to net exports. In addition, the stimulus to the foreign economy could be\nfurther diluted to the extent that the balance sheet policy boosted term premiums on its\nlong-term bonds and hence tightened financial conditions, although this effect has not\nbeen built into the simulation model. By contrast, for a foreign economy that is close to\npotential, adjustment through the balance sheet in the home country will mean less of a\nneed for the foreign central bank to respond by tightening policy than under home\ncountry adjustment through conventional policy.\nSo far, we have considered the case of central banks with freely floating exchange\nrates and well-anchored inflation expectations. What about central banks with managed\nexchange rates or weakly anchored inflation expectations? To keep the analysis simple,\nlet’s assume a foreign central bank aims to completely stabilize its exchange rate vis-à-\nvis a core country. Let’s again consider circumstances in which the core country\nexperiences a positive demand shock that calls for policy tightening. Although the\npegging economy is likely to experience spillovers under either approach to\nnormalization in the core country, the spillovers are likely to be greater when the core\ncountry tightens through the policy rate. The tightening in the core country will compel\nthe country that is fixing its exchange rate to tighten policy in sync and the core country’s\ncurrency will rise more against its trading partners with conventional tightening, leading\nto greater effective appreciation of the pegging country’s currency as well. Although the\npegging economy will benefit somewhat from the stronger demand of the core country,\n\n- 8 -\nthat benefit is likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects of a tightening of domestic\nmonetary policy when domestic conditions would not otherwise call for it. Such\nconsiderations may have played a role in the market dynamics experienced by China as\ndiscussions about initiating rate hikes progressed in the United States in the second half\nof 2015 and early 2016.8\nNext let’s explore alternative approaches to policy normalization by countries\nfacing a similar need to tighten. This question is timely; with synchronous expansions\nnow underway, we may be approaching a turning point before too long. In particular,\nlet’s consider the case when two large countries, which are assumed identical for the sake\nof simplicity, experience the same positive shock to domestic demand. Under these\nassumptions, if both economies were to choose the same normalization strategy--putting\nprimary reliance on either the balance sheet or short-term interest rates--the implications\nfor the exchange rate and net exports are the same: In both cases, the exchange rate\nbetween the two countries does not change, and neither do net exports between the\ncountries. Each central bank would adjust interest rates by the same amount--enough to\noffset the stimulus from the demand shock--and with interest differentials unchanged,\nthere would be no pressure on the exchange rate between them to move.9 Of course, if\nthere are other economies in the rest of the world that do not experience the same shock,\nthe choice of normalization strategy does matter, similar to the analysis of spillovers from\n8 See Brainard (2015a). A number of recent studies have considered financial spillovers to EMEs,\nincluding Rey (2014) and Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2015). The analysis of Hofmann, Shim, and\nShin (2016) suggests that EMEs may be hurt more if their banks or nonfinancial corporations have\nrelatively large dollar liabilities, as the larger dollar appreciation associated with the policy rate tool would\nprecipitate greater EME balance sheet deterioration in this case.\n9 In this simple example, in which the two countries are hit by identical shocks, the offset in spillovers\nbetween the two economies will be complete. If one country faces a larger aggregate demand shock than\nthe other, then the situation becomes more like the one-country case we examined before, the policy\nadjustments lead to spillovers of different magnitudes, and the offset will be partial.\n\n- 9 -\nthe single core country, presumably magnified by the larger combined global weight of\nthe two economies.\nNow let’s turn to the case in which the two central banks choose to rely on\ndifferent policy tools. 10 In this case, one country responds to the positive shock by\nhiking its policy rate to reduce output to its initial level, while the second country\nresponds by shrinking its balance sheet. The country that relies on the policy rate to\nmake the adjustment experiences an appreciation in the exchange rate, a deterioration in\nnet exports and some expansion of domestic demand, while the country that chooses to\nrely solely on the balance sheet for tightening experiences a depreciation of its exchange\nrate and an increase in net exports. Thus, while both countries achieve their domestic\nstabilization objectives, whether the requisite policy tightening occurs through increases\nin policy rates or reductions in the balance sheet matters for the composition of demand,\nthe external balance, and the exchange rate.\nI highlighted at the outset the commitment adopted by many leading nations to\nset monetary policy to achieve domestic objectives such that the exchange rate would not\nbe a primary consideration in the setting of monetary policy. In the case that balance-\nsheet and conventional monetary policies have equivalent effects on both domestic\nspending and the exchange rate, this common principle is straightforward. But if the\ncross-border spillovers of reductions in the balance sheet and increases in the policy rate\nare not equivalent, the sequencing of policy rate and balance sheet normalization could\nhave important implications for the exchange rate and external balance.\n10 This simulation is shown in figure 2 in the appendix.\n\n- 10 -\nFinally, in circumstances where a major central bank is continuing to expand its\nbalance sheet or maintaining a large balance sheet over a sustained period, this policy\nwould likely exert downward pressure on term premiums around the globe, especially in\nthose foreign economies whose bonds were perceived as close substitutes. Indeed, until\nvery recently, it had been notable how little long yields moved up in the United States\neven as discussions of balance sheet normalization have moved to the forefront. This\nlikely reflects at least in part the expectation that ongoing asset purchase programs in\nother advanced economies would continue holding down long-term yields globally. The\ntide seems to have turned in recent weeks, as long yields in the U.S. have increased\nnotably on market perceptions that foreign officials are beginning to deliberate their own\nnormalization strategies.\nI have used a simple stylized model to illustrate circumstances in which the\nchoice of normalization strategies adopted by major central banks can potentially be quite\nconsequential. If anything, the analysis presented here serves to highlight the importance\nof research assessing this question from both an empirical and theoretical perspective.\nLet me conclude by returning to the policy choices facing central banks. The\nFederal Reserve chose to remove accommodation initially through increases in the\nfederal funds rate. In light of recent policy moves, I consider normalization of the federal\nfunds rate to be well under way. If the data continue to confirm a strong labor market\nand firming economic activity, I believe it would be appropriate soon to commence the\ngradual and predictable process of allowing the balance sheet to run off.\nOnce that process begins, I will want to assess the inflation process closely before\nmaking a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate in light of the\n\n- 11 -\nrecent softness in core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation. In my view,\nthe neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain close to zero in real terms\nover the medium term. If that is the case, we would not have much more additional work\nto do on moving to a neutral stance. I will want to monitor inflation developments\ncarefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to\nhelp guide inflation back up around our symmetric target.\nMeanwhile, in recent days, we have begun to hear acknowledgement from other\nmajor central banks that they too are seeing conditions that suggest policy normalization\ncould be on the table before too long, against the backdrop of a brighter global outlook.\nAs I just discussed, the pace and timing of how central banks around the world proceed\nwith normalization, and the importance of balance sheet policy relative to changes in\nshort term rates in these normalization plans, could have important implications for\nexchange rates and financial conditions globally.\n\n- 12 -\nAppendix: Description of Stylized Model and Simulation Results\nA. Model Description\nThe model is a stylized open economy model that includes two symmetric\ncountries linked through trade flows. The model is specified in real terms under the\nimplicit assumption that inflation is constant (so that real and nominal variables move by\nthe same amount). Moreover, the model abstracts from any financial linkages between\nthe two economies, including the possibility that monetary policy actions in one country\ncould directly affect yields in the other (e.g., through portfolio balance channels), though\nsuch effects are clearly important empirically.\nThe two countries include a “Home” (H) county and a “Foreign” (F) country of\nequal size. Variables in the foreign country are denoted with an asterisk. In each\ncountry, the national accounting identity specifies that output, y, is equal to the sum of\nabsorption d and net exports nx, that is:\ny = d +nx,\ny∗ = d∗ −nx,\nwhere the second equation incorporates the global resource constraint that nx + nx* = 0.\nHere output (y) and absorption (d) are expressed in percent deviation from their\nrespective steady states, while net exports are expressed as share of output, and are equal\nto zero in the steady state (that is, prior to any shocks).\n\n- 13 -\nHome and foreign absorption depend on long–term interest rates according to the\nfollowing expressions:\n( )\nd = −σrc+ru +u,\n( )\nd∗ = −σrc∗ +ru∗ +u∗,\nHere rc is the component of long–term interest rates that is driven by\nconventional monetary policy, ru is the component of long–term interest rates that is\ndriven by unconventional monetary policy, and u is an exogenous aggregate demand\nshock (with autocorrelation given by ρ). These interest rate components are assumed to\nhave identical effects on aggregate demand, with the parameter σ determining the\nsensitivity of aggregate demand to either component (n..b., interest rates are expressed in\npercentage points deviation from the steady state).\nNet exports are assumed to fall if the real exchange rate (e) rises/appreciates, and\nalso if domestic demand is higher relative to foreign demand (since this boost imports).\nThus:\n( )\nnx=−ηe−αd −d∗\nwhere η is the elasticity of net exports with respect to the exchange rate, and α is the\nelasticity of net exports to the differential between home and foreign absorption. The real\nexchange rate is expressed in percent deviation from the steady state.\nThe exchange rate is determined according to an interest rate parity condition\nwhich implies that the exchange rate appreciates when domestic interest rates are higher\n\n- 14 -\nthan foreign interest rates, with elasticities ( φ and φ ) that can differ depending on\nc u\nwhether interest rate movements are driven by conventional or unconventional policy:\n( ) ( )\ne =φ rc−rc∗ +φ ru−ru∗ .\nc u\nThe model is closed by specifying the behavior of the monetary authority. We\nassume that the monetary authority can adjust either the interest rate associated with\nconventional policy (rc), or the interest rate linked to balance sheet actions (ru), or both,\nto affect output (its goal variable). The conventional feedback rule is thus:\nrc =γ y,\nc\nrc∗ =γ∗y∗,\nc\nwhereas the unconventional feedback rule is:\nru =γ y\nu\nru∗ =γ∗y∗.\nu\nThe system above contains 10 equations in 10 endogenous variables (y, y*, d, d*,\nnx, e, rc, rc*, ru, ru*), as well two shocks, u and u*, that can move GDP, its components,\nexchange rates, and interest rates.\nB. Simulation Results\nFigures 1 and 2 show the results of simulating the model under alternative\nassumptions about the shocks and monetary policy reaction. In each case, the economy\nstarts in steady state with all variables at zero and experiences a demand shock in period\n1 that dies out with an autocorrelation ρ of 0.95. All parameter values are reported in\nTable 1.\n\n- 15 -\nFigure 1. Home Demand Shock\nFigure 1 illustrates the case of a favorable demand shock in the home country.\nThe solid lines illustrate the case when Home uses the short-term interest rate as its active\npolicy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, consistent with a desire to delay balance\nsheet normalization.\nThe policy reaction is calibrated to be sufficiently aggressive that home GDP\nalways remains at baseline (see column 2 of Table 1). The higher policy rate path (that\nis, higher rc) causes the long-term interest rate (panel A) to rise, which in turn induces the\nreal exchange rate to appreciate (panel B). The stronger currency and an expansion in\ndomestic absorption (panel C) causes a deterioration in net exports (panel D). At the end\nof the period shown, domestic demand has nearly returned to baseline, while net exports\nare just a bit below baseline--consistent with Home country’s GDP remaining at baseline\n(panel E). Because foreign monetary policy rates is assumed to remain on hold, foreign\nGDP (panel F) rises by the improvement in its net exports (that is, by the mirror image of\npanel D, given that foreign domestic absorption is unchanged).\nThe dashed lines illustrate the case of a favorable demand shock in the Home\ncountry when the central bank opts to tighten exclusively through reducing its balance\nsheet (again, by enough to keep output at potential--see column 3 of Table 1). Long-term\ninterest rates (panel A) rise in response, but the exchange rate appreciates less in this case\n(panel B), reflecting the lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to unconventional\nmonetary policy actions (φ < φ ). Net exports decline (panel D) by less--reflecting both\nu c\nthe smaller exchange rate appreciation and a smaller rise in absorption (panel C)--which\ntranslates into less of a boost to foreign GDP (panel F) than when the home country\nadjusts through conventional policy.\n\n- 16 -\nFigure 2. Common Demand Shock, Asymmetric Policy Tightening across Countries\nFigure 2 shows a simulation in which the demand shock is assumed to be\ncommon across countries ( u = u* ). The home country is assumed to pursue a policy of\nactively adjusting its policy rate, while the foreign Country is assumed to rely exclusively\non normalizing through the balance sheet. In each case, the central banks of the two\ncountries tighten policy aggressively enough to keep output at potential (see the\nparameter settings in column 4 of Table 1).\nAs policy rates rise in the home country (panel A) and the exchange rate is more\nsensitive to policy rates than to the balance sheet, the home country's exchange rate\n(panel B) appreciates, while its net exports (panel D) decline. Although GDP remains at\nbaseline in each country (panels E and F) given our assumption that monetary policy\nkeeps output at potential (which is unchanged), the alternative policy normalization\nchoices clearly have important effects--even under a common shock--on both exchange\nrates and the composition of demand in each country. In particular, because exchange\nrates in the foreign country are less sensitive to balance sheet than to interest rate policy,\nthe foreign central bank must enact a relatively larger interest rate tightening in order to\nkeep its GDP at potential.\n\n- 17 -\nTable 1: Parameter Values\n\n- 18 -\n\n- 19 -\n\n- 20 -\nReferences\nAlon, Titan, and Eric Swanson (2011). “Operation Twist and the Effect of Large-Scale\nAsset Purchases,” FRBSF Economic Letter 2011-13.

I also want to thank\nPresident Charles Evans for hosting today.\nUnder EGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint\nreview of our regulations every 10 years. At the Federal Reserve, we view the current\nreview as a timely opportunity to step back and look for ways to reduce regulatory\nburden, particularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the system.\nOur ultimate goal is to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations\nand to take action to address those burdens.\nI was pleased to participate, along with colleagues from the other banking\nagencies, in the launch meeting held last November in Los Angeles. Since that time, staff\nacross the Federal Reserve System, including here in Chicago, have been hard at work\nevaluating comments and identifying actions that will meaningfully reduce burden. In\nsome cases, where we have authority and the benefit is straightforward, we have taken\naction. In other cases, which may require interagency agreement and changes to rules,\nthe process will take longer. In still other cases, we may need to look to Congress to take\naction. I want to spend the rest of my time this morning highlighting those areas that\nhold the greatest promise to reduce undue regulatory burden, especially for our\ncommunity banks.1\nRegulatory Reports\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n\n- 2 -\nWe have heard the request to achieve a meaningful reduction in the burden\nassociated with regulatory reporting, and we are taking action. In early September, the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) detailed steps regulators are\ntaking to streamline and simplify regulatory reporting requirements for community banks\nand reduce their reporting burden. As an initial step to streamline some reporting\nrequirements, the federal banking agencies, under the auspices of the FFIEC, are seeking\ncomment on proposals to, in part, eliminate or revise several Call Report data items.\nAdditionally, the federal banking agencies are evaluating the feasibility and merits of\ncreating a streamlined version of the quarterly Call Report for community banking\norganizations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board is conducting a separate review of the FR series of\nreports for holding companies to identify unnecessary burden. Of course, any changes to\nthe bank Call Report forms will likely be reflected with corresponding changes to the\nBank Holding Company FR Y-9 reports, but there are additional reports for holding\ncompanies that are included in our broader review.\nSmall Bank Holding Company Policy Threshold\nThe Federal Reserve Board has taken action to address burden concerns from\ncommunity banks by expanding the universe of small bank holding companies covered\nby the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. In December 2014, following\ncongressional action, the Federal Reserve amended its regulation to raise the total asset\nthreshold for the policy statement’s applicability from $500 million to $1 billion in total\nconsolidated assets. As a result, more than 700 holding companies (that are not engaged\nin complex activities) are now exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements,\n\n- 3 -\nreducing both the cost of capital and reporting requirements for small depository\ninstitutions.2\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have received\nnumerous constructive comments on ways to update the implementation of the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA) to better reflect changes in the ways banking\nservices are being provided and banks are interacting with their communities. A few of\nthe most common issues raised include those related to whether the definition of\nAssessment Areas should be revised because of changes in technology that allow banks\nto gather deposits and make loans far from existing branches and deposit-taking ATMs,\nwhether the asset thresholds that determine the examination methods for banks of\ndifferent sizes should be raised to lessen regulatory burden on smaller banks, and whether\nthe performance tests should be revised to give more meaningful consideration to\ncommunity development activities.\nThese are important issues, and we are looking at a wide range of suggestions and\noptions, which may mean it will take us time to distill the comments and formulate\neffective policy responses in collaboration with the other banking agencies. In the\nmeantime, I urge you to continue providing specific suggestions to help inform our\ninteragency deliberations.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Rule to\nExpand Applicability of Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and Apply It to Certain Savings\nand Loan Holding Companies,” news release, April 9, 2015,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20150409a.htm. Regulatory capital requirements will\ncontinue to apply to the depository institution subsidiaries of these companies.\n\n- 4 -\nBank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering\nWe have heard from many community bankers that they would welcome\nguidance that would assist them in meeting their compliance obligations under the Bank\nSecrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering rules in more cost-effective ways. Accordingly, we\nare taking a careful look at options that might reduce exam frequency for lower-risk\nbanks and might enable small banking institutions to share expert resources. There may\nalso be an opportunity to align insider abuse Suspicious Activity Report filing\nrequirements with other filing requirements applicable to all other known or suspected\ncriminal violations.\nExpediting and Improving Applications\nThe Federal Reserve Board has received comments regarding the amount of time\nit takes to process applications. Last year, we started publishing a semiannual report that\nimproves the transparency of the applications process by providing information on the\napplications that have been approved, denied, and withdrawn and the length of time to\nreview applications.3 We are currently reviewing our rules to see whether there are ways\nto expedite the applications review process by delegating additional matters to the\nReserve Banks.\nIn addition, we have received suggestions regarding possibly broadening the\nmeasure of the degree of competition in a banking market to include the activities of\nInternet banks.4 Doing so would reduce the market shares of other banks and the\n3 See Board of Governors, “Federal Reserve Board releases First Semiannual Report on Banking\nApplications Activity,” news release, November 24, 2015,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20141124a.htm.\n4 The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (“HHI”) is used to measure economic concentration in a banking market\nunder the Department of Justice Bank Merger Competitive Review guidelines.\n\n- 5 -\nmeasures of local market concentration, which in turn may help community banks in\nrural areas that are engaged in acquisitions.\nAppraisal Thresholds\nAt past EGRPRA outreach meetings, participants have raised concerns that the\nrequirement to obtain an appraisal on small dollar real estate loans is a significant burden,\nparticularly in rural areas. The prudential regulators’ rules issued under the Financial\nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) currently do not\nrequire the use of a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser for federally related\ntransactions of $250,000 or less, or real estate secured business loans of $1 million or less\nwhen the primary source of repayment is not sale proceeds or rental income from the\nproperty. The statute allows the agencies to determine the appropriate threshold below\nwhich an appraisal by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser is not required if that\nthreshold would not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial\ninstitutions. The agencies adopted these two thresholds in 1994.\nGiven the passage of time and changes in the condition of real estate markets, I\nbelieve it is appropriate for the agencies to again review the current thresholds. In\nparticular, the agencies need to assess whether the thresholds appropriately address\ncollateral and credit risk in small dollar real estate loans and are reasonably balanced\nagainst the cost and time to obtain an appraisal, particularly in rural markets where fewer\nappraisers may be available. Of course, the agencies would need to consider whether any\nrevision to the $250,000 threshold level would provide reasonable protection for\nconsumers. Board staff is evaluating the appropriateness of the thresholds in the\n\n- 6 -\nprudential appraisal regulation. We will work with other agencies in completing this\nanalysis.5\nSimplified Capital for Small Institutions\nAt previous outreach meetings, community banks have asked whether the Federal\nReserve can exempt smaller financial institutions from meeting all of the revised capital\nrequirements. Based on lessons from the crisis, bank capital requirements were\nsignificantly revised to make the requirements more risk-sensitive and raise the quality\nand quantity of capital. In some instances, smaller institutions have indicated that the\ndegree of categorization of risks, the attendant recordkeeping and systems changes, and\nthe increased reporting burden on their institutions are generating significantly increased\ncompliance costs that are not commensurate with the risk profile of the institution. For\nsmaller and less complex community banks, the benefit from this increased risk\nsensitivity may be outweighed by the burden of increased complexity, and a\ncommensurate improvement in safety and soundness of the institution may be achievable\nby simply holding a larger cushion of capital measured against a simpler definition of\nassets. To be workable, such an approach would need to provide a robust measure of the\nfinancial institution’s capital health and meet the objectives of the Collins amendment.\nWe are currently exploring possible options.6\n5 It is important to note that any change in the appraisal threshold will only affect federally related\ntransactions covered by the prudential regulators’ rules. The majority of residential mortgages would\nremain subject to the appraisal requirements set by secondary market, particularly by Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac.\n6 See Daniel K. Tarullo, “Tailoring Community Bank Regulation and Supervision” (speech at the\nIndependent Community Bankers of America 2015 Washington Policy Summit, Washington, DC),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20150430a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nStress Tests for Regional Banks\nOne additional item that I would consider worthy of congressional consideration\nin the EGRPRA context would be the stress tests currently performed by smaller,\nregional lenders, or those above $10 billion in assets but less than $50 billion in assets. It\nmight be worthwhile to examine the prudential benefits--the additional insights gained by\nus as supervisors as well as by the banks’ senior managers from the stress tests--against\nthe opportunity costs in terms of compliance measures and the allocation of management\nand examination resources for both supervisors and those banks. And I look forward to\ndiscussing this in the coming months.\nIn considering these issues, it is also important to underscore that we are already\ntailoring our expectations for the stress tests to the lower risk profile of smaller banking\ninstitutions, and the stress tests currently performed by these institutions should in no way\nbe designed to mimic the more comprehensive and extensive stress testing program for\nlarger and more complex institutions, particularly the Comprehensive Capital and\nAnalysis Review (CCAR) program.\nExamination Cycle\nWe are also examining whether there may be scope to extend examination cycles\nfor community banks with lower risk profiles and in some areas have already taken\naction. For example, the Federal Reserve recently revised our consumer compliance\nexamination frequency policy to lengthen the time frame between on-site consumer\ncompliance and CRA examinations for lower-risk community banks with less than $1\nbillion in total consolidated assets. Another item to evaluate includes potentially\nincreasing the number of healthy, well-managed community institutions that could\n\n- 8 -\nqualify for an 18-month examination cycle by raising the threshold from its current $500\nmillion level. In addition to reducing the examination burden on many community\nbanks, this would also allow the federal banking agencies to better allocate resources to\nthose banks that pose more significant supervisory concerns.\nVolcker Rule\nFinally, EGRPRA may provide a good opportunity to reevaluate whether\ncommunity banks should be subject to the Volcker rule. Exempting banks with less than\n$10 billion in assets from its requirements would significantly help reduce burden on\nsmaller institutions.7\nConclusion\nThe list that I have laid out here is meant to be suggestive, not comprehensive. I\nlook forward to hearing your views on these issues as well as any additional suggestions\nyou believe to be worthy of consideration. Each of the agencies will be using the\ninformation gathered at this outreach meeting and our other outreach efforts to support\nthe review process, so we can reduce burden where possible, particularly for community\nbanks. I encourage everybody to speak frankly and to be as specific as possible.\nThank you again for coming.\n7 See Tarullo, “Tailoring Community Bank Regulation and Supervision”; and Jerome H.

As the Global Financial Crisis\ndemonstrated, when severe financial stress triggers a broad pullback from risk, the\nresulting disruption in financial intermediation can impose deep and lasting damage on\nAmerican families, workers, and businesses.1\nThe primaryfocus of financial stability policy is tail risk(outcomes that are\nunlikely but severely damaging) as opposed tothe modal outlook(the most likely path of\nthe economy). The objective of financial stability policy is to lessen thelikelihood and\nseverity of a financial crisis. Guided by that objective, our financial stability work rests\non four interdependent pillars: systematic analysis of financial vulnerabilities; standard\nprudential policies that safeguard the safety and soundness of individual banking\norganizations; additional policies, which I will refer to as “macroprudential,”that build\nresilience in the large, interconnected institutions at the core of the system; and\ncountercyclical policies that increase resilience as risks build up cyclically.2 This work\nalso recognizes the important connections to our monetary policy objectives.\nAssessment of Financial Vulnerabilities\nThe foundation for our financial stability work is our assessment of systemic\nfinancial vulnerabilities. Our assessment framework is informed by historical episodes of\nfinancial stress here at home and around the world, as well as by a growing body of\n1I am grateful to John Schindler of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. The\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2In this work agenda, the Federal Reserve cooperates closely with other regulators to facilitate joint\nresponsibility for financial stability while respecting that each independent agency has its own specific\nstatutory mandate and governing body.\n\n-2-\nresearch on key indicators of building imbalances.3 Instead of attempting to forecast\nparticular adverse shocks that could buffet the economy, the focus is on vulnerabilities--\nthat is, on features of the financial system that amplify bad shocks, spreading damage to\nhouseholds and businesses. Each quarter, Federal Reserve Board staff assess a set of\nvulnerabilities relevant for financial stability: asset valuations and risk appetite,\nborrowing by the nonfinancial sector (households and nonfinancial businesses), liquidity\nrisks and maturity transformation by the financial system, and leverage in the financial\nsystem.\nIt may be illuminating to briefly describe our current assessment in each of these\nareas. Valuations in a broad set of markets appear elevated relative to historical norms,\neven after taking into account recent movements. Estimates of risk premiums and\nspreads in a range of markets remain narrow by historical standards. Corporate bond\nyields remain low by historical comparison, and spreads of yields on junk bonds above\nthose on comparable-maturity Treasury securities are near the lower-endof their\nhistorical range. Spreads on leveraged loans and securitized products backed by those\nloans remain narrow. Prices of multifamily residential and industrial commercial real\nestate (CRE) have risen, and capitalization rates--the ratios of operating income relative\nto the sale price of commercial properties--for these segments have reached historical\nlows. However, measures ofcredit conditions suggest that lenders are, to an extent,\ntaking into account the potential for a reversion of valuations.\n3In addition to cyclical vulnerabilities, structural vulnerabilities, such as those that arise from the\ncomplexity and interconnectedness of large financial institutions, also remain potential sources of risk to\nthe financial system. The Federal Reserve assesses structural vulnerabilities in support of its financial\nstability and supervision and regulation responsibilities. For instance, cybersecurity is the subject of\nongoing monitoring and policy efforts.\n\n-3-\nBy contrast, prices of single-family homes appear to be closer to historical norms.\nHouse prices have risen at a robust pace, and the price-to-rent ratio is high in absolute\nterms, but it does not appear to be far out of line with its longer-run trend. This broad\nnational trend belies significant variationamong local markets, however.4\nOne area that the Federal Reserve is monitoring is the extreme volatility\nevidenced by some cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin rose over 1,000 percent in\n2017and has fallen sharply in recent months.5 These markets may raise important\ninvestor and consumer protection issues, and some appear especially vulnerable to\nmoney-laundering (BSA/AML, or Bank Secrecy Act/anti-moneylaundering) concerns.\nAs in other highly speculative markets, individual investors should be careful to\nunderstand the possible pitfalls of these investments and the potential for losses. But it is\nless clear how the valuations of cryptocurrencies currently could pose a threat to financial\nstability. For instance, it is hard to see evidence of substantial leverage used in the\npurchase of the cryptocurrencies, or a material degree of use in payments, although our\nassessment of these markets is limited by their opacity. Nonetheless, we will continue to\nstudy them.\nIn the assessment of elevated asset valuations, the relatively low level of Treasury\nyields is a mitigating factor; many asset valuation metrics,such as price-to-earnings\nratios, corporate bond yields, and property capitalizationrates,appear notably less\nstretched when judged relative to low Treasury yields. That said, Treasury yields reflect\nhistorically low term premiums--the compensation investors demand to hold assets over a\n4For example, the price-to-rent ratios in Los Angeles, Miami, and Denver are 10 to 20 percent above their\nlong-run trends, compared with 4percent at the national level.\n5Similar volatility was seen in some other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether, XRP, and Litecoin.\n\n-4-\nlonger horizon. This poses the risk that term premiums could rise sharply--for instance,if\ninvestor perceptions of inflation risks increased. I will return to this risk later.\nAlthough asset valuations are elevated, vulnerabilities due to debt owed outside\nthe financial sector appear to be moderate--in the middle of their historical range. This\nreflects elevated leverage in the nonfinancial business sectorand a moderate pace of\nborrowing in the household sector. In the nonfinancial business sector, the debt-to-\nearnings ratio has increasedto near the upper end of its historical distribution, and net\nleverage at speculative-grade firms remains especially elevated. Overall, however, the\nratio of nonfinancial-sector borrowing to gross domestic product has been below an\nestimate of its trend for several years as a result of the deleveraging of the household\nsector following the crisis. While the sustained period of post-crisis household\ndeleveraging appears to have come to an end and savings rates have recently moved\ndown, overall borrowing has been at a moderate pace and, on net, concentrated among\nborrowers with high credit scores. Even thoughthe balance sheet of the household sector\nas a whole appears relatively strong, recent years have seen a rapid rise in student debt as\nwell as risingdefault rates for borrowers with subprime credit scores on auto loans and,\nmore recently, credit card balances.\nBeyond the nonfinancial sector, the vulnerabilities associated with maturity and\nliquidity transformation in the financial system appear to have fallen significantly relative\nto the levels seen prior to the crisis. The amount of wholesale short-term funding, which\nproved to be a substantial source of run risk during the crisis, has dropped substantially\nsince its peak in 2008. Money market funds, which had been an area of vulnerability in\nthe crisis, have undergone important reforms, including a move to floating net asset\n\n-5-\nvalues for prime institutional funds along with the imposition of fees and restrictions on\nredemption. The anticipation ofthe enactment of these reforms in October 2016 led to a\nlargedecline in the level of assets under management at the affected funds, which has\nsince held steady. So far, the growth of alternative short-term investment vehicles that\ncould pose similar risks appears to have been weak.\nFinally, risks associated with leverage in the financial sector also appear to be\nsubdued by historical standards. Leverage in the banking sector has declined notably\nsince the crisis. Issuance of securitized products remains well below pre-crisis levels for\nmost asset classes, with few signs of securitizations that involve maturity or liquidity\ntransformation and limited issuance of complex securities whose opaque structures can\ncontain significant leverage. And the data that are available suggest that leverage at\nnonbank financial firms has been stable. That said, there are indications that the use of\nleverage has been increasing at some institutions; for example,margin credit providedby\ndealers to equity investors such as hedge funds has expanded.\nPrudential, Macroprudential, and Countercyclical Policies\nThereis an important connection between the robustness of our financial\nregulatory framework and the assessment of resilience in the financial sector. The\nsubdued level of vulnerabilities from liquidity and maturity transformation and leverage\nis duecentrally to reforms undertakenin response to the financial crisis. The Federal\nReserve has implemented a framework of rules and supervision that requires large,\ninterconnected banking organizations to hold substantial capital and liquidity buffers.\nThis framework requires banks to be forwardlooking in their capital decisions and to be\nprepared for the possibility of severely stressed conditions occurring. The framework is\n\n-6-\nmacroprudential in design so that banks internalize the costs of undertaking activities that\npose risks to the system.\nThe core of the framework is the requirement of a substantial stack of common\nequity to build resilience against shocks and to provide an incentive for prudent risk\nmanagement. Regulatory capital ratios for the largest banking firms at the core of the\nsystem have about doubled since 2007 and are currently at their highest levels in the post-\ncrisis era. U.S. firms have substantially increased their capital since the first round of\nstress tests led by the Federal Reserve in 2009. The common equity capital ratio--which\ncompares high-quality capital to risk-weighted assets--of the bank holding companies\nparticipating in the 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review has more than\ndoubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12 percent in the fourth quarter of\n2017. Their leverage ratios--defined as Tier 1 capital to total assets--increased from 7.3\npercent to 8.6 percent over the same period.6 There has also been an important shift in\nthe distribution of high-quality capital so that the average ratio of high-quality common\nequity to risk-weighted assets at the largest banks now exceeds the average for smaller\nbanks. The larger and more complex banking organizations are now holding more\ncapital, commensurate with the greater risks their distress could pose.\nReduced vulnerability associated with liquidity and maturity transformation\nsimilarly is due importantly to key financial reforms instituted since the crisis. Large\nfinancial institutions are required to maintain substantial buffers of high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA) calibrated to their funding needs and to their likely run risk in stressed\n6These statistics are for the 18 bank holding companies that participated in both the 2009 and 2017 stress\ntests. The risk-based capital statistics for 2009 report tier 1 common equity, and for 2017 report Basel III\ncommon equity tier 1.\n\n-7-\nconditions. Similar to the capital buffers, the liquidity buffers are greatest for those\nfinancial institutions that pose the greatest risks. Indeed, banks are holding buffers of\nHQLA in excess of their liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirements. Our largest\nbanking firms have increased their holdings of HQLA from 13percent of assets in 2011\nto 20 percent in 2017and have reduced their reliance on short-term wholesale funding\nfrom 36percent of liabilities in 2011 to 29percent in 2017.7\nJust as our strengthened policy frameworkhelps modulate vulnerabilities in the\nfinancial sector that could make the economy more vulnerable to shocks, so, too, our\nquarterly surveillance is intended to identify rising vulnerabilities early enough to be able\nto act to prevent disruptions that could damage the economy. In particular, the quarterly\nassessment of financial stability is a critical input into the Board’s processes for adjusting\nthe supervisory scenarios used in the stress test and the setting of the countercyclical\ncapital buffer--the two tools that permit the Board to respond to vulnerabilities that build\nover time.\nThe supervisory stress test is intended to ensure that large banking institutions\nwill be able to continue to function normally even under severely adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions. It also assesses the resilience of the largest trading firms to\nrisks of a large disturbance to global financial markets and the failure of the firms’ largest\ncounterparty. These components reflect some of the key linkages through which the\ndistress or failure of one firm could affect others, including direct credit losses as well as\nthe severe financial disruptions that would be expected to accompany fire sales and an\nincrease in risk aversion.\n7 These statistics reflect the 18 advanced approaches bank holding companies subject to the standard LCR.\n\n-8-\nBy design, the Fed’s stress test is intended to incorporate some elements to make\nthe tests more stringent when the economy and financial markets are heating up. These\ncountercyclical features are intended to give the stress tests some utility as a\nmacroprudential tool--that is,to mitigate the financial system’s inherent pro-cyclicality.\nThe most prominent countercyclical feature of the stress-test scenario architecture is the\nsetting of the unemployment rate in the severely adverse scenario. The general rule is to\nincrease the unemployment rate by 4 percent unless the baseline unemployment rate\nstarts at levels below 6 percent, in which case the ultimate level of the unemployment rate\nreached in the severely adversescenario is fixed at 10percent. In addition, last\nDecember, the Board put out a proposal for comment to introduce a systematically\ncountercyclical mechanism in the component of the scenario that shocks house prices.8\nBeyond these systematic elements, the assessment of vulnerabilities is a critical\ninput in the development of scenarios for the stress tests each year to strengthen resilience\nagainst vulnerabilities that may be identified. As I noted earlier, recent assessments have\nnotedhigh levels of valuations across a broad set of asset markets and elevated business\nleverage in an environment where Treasury yields and term premiums have been\nrelatively low by historical standards. In such circumstances, asset prices might be\nparticularly susceptible to an unexpected development that accentuates downside risks to\nthe macroeconomic outlook. For instance, a sharp increase in concerns about the\n8See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “Policy Statement on the Scenario Design\nFramework for Stress Testing,” proposed rule(Docket No. OP-1588),Federal Register,vol. 82 (December\n15), pp. 59533-59547,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/15/2017-26858/policy-\nstatement-on-the-scenario-design-framework-for-stress-testing.\n\n-9-\npotential for high inflation orin uncertainty about policy could boost term premiums on\nTreasury securities, which could trigger declines in asset prices across a range of markets.\nThe scenarios for this year’s stress tests, which were announced in February,\nfeature material decreases in asset prices--notably including CRE prices--along with a\nsubstantial rise in Treasury term premiums. Although the severely adverse scenarios\nalways include severe recessions and sharp declines in asset prices, in past years,they\nhave been accompanied by large declines in Treasury yields,which have resulted in\ncapital gains on these securities.9 In contrast, in this year’s severely adverse scenario,\nyields on longer-maturity Treasury securities are flat. In this way, this year’s severely\nadverse scenario addresses one of the salient vulnerabilities that havebeen identified. By\nencouraging institutions at the core of the system to build resilience against such an\neventuality, we seek to lessen the severity of the distress to the overall financial system\nshould asset prices fall and term premiums rise sharply in a challenging macroeconomic\nenvironment.\nEven with these design features, the Fed’s stress-testing framework has some\nlimitations in counteracting the inherent pro-cyclicality in the availability of credit.\nIndeed,the stress tests have become less binding on banks as the recovery has gathered\nstrength. Thus, losses on loans and positions in the severely adverse scenario among\nparticipating banks have declined over time as the economy has strengthened. For\nexample, in the 2016 exercise, losses amounted to $526 billion,while in 2017 they had\nfallen to $493 billion, despite a larger increase in the unemployment rate in the scenario.\nAs economic conditions strengthen,typical measures of underwriting quality look strong,\n9Over the years, our adverse scenarios, which are not designed to be the binding scenario for capital\nplanning purposes, have featured large increases in Treasury yields across the maturity curve.\n\n-10-\ndelinquencies fall tolowlevels, and profits rise consistently, all of which could lead to\nlower projected stress losses. Of course,these effects tend to reverse during bad\neconomic conditions: Underwriting deficiencies tendto be revealed, delinquencies to\nrise,and profits to fall. Thus, capital requirements based on stress tests alone are unlikely\nto completely compensate for the financial system’s natural pro-cyclicality.\nIn part for that reason, we also have a specifically countercyclical capital\nrequirement that applies to the largest banks. Countercyclical capital requirements can\nlean against a dangerous increase in financial vulnerabilities at a time when the degree of\nmonetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal would be inconsistent\nwith the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of full employment and price stability. The\nreverse is also true. The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is designed to increase the\nresilience of large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal\nlosses, which often follow periods of rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth that\nare not well supported by underlying economic fundamentals. The CCyB is an additional\nmargin of capital that the nation’s largest banks can be asked to build to augment\nresilience at times of rising cyclical pressures and to release as the economy weakens in\norder to allow banks to lend more when it is most needed.\nThe CCyB framework, which was finalized in September 2016, requires the\nFederal Reserve Board to vote at least once per year on the level of the CCyB. Put\nsimply, the criterion for raising the CCyB above its minimum value of zero is that\nfinancial risks are assessed to be in the upper one-third of theirhistorical distribution.\nOurassessment of financial vulnerabilities is a key input into the Federal Reserve\nBoard’s decisions surrounding the setting of the CCyB, along with a variety of other\n\n-11-\nmodel-based and judgmental criteria. On December 1, 2017, with overall risks assessed\nas moderate and with other measures that we routinely monitorsending a similar signal,\nthe Board announced its decision to leave the CCyB at its minimum value of zero.\nOf course, our assessments of financial vulnerabilities are also animportant input\ninto Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations, recognizing that there is\nimportant interdependence between financial stability and our monetary policy objectives\nof full employment and price stability.10 The FOMC Statement on Longer-Run Goals\nand Monetary Policy Strategy notes that “the Committee’s policy decisions reflect . . . its\nassessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could\nimpede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”11 Generally speaking, lessons from a\nbroad range of countries suggest financial crises occur with substantially lower frequency\nthan business cycles, and there is no settled doctrine to dateon the use of the short-term\npolicy rate--the key instrument of monetary policy--to lessen the probability and severity\nof financial crises. While financial imbalances are an important consideration in\nmonetary policymaking and the expected path of monetary policy can have important\nimplications for financial vulnerabilities, both research and experience suggest there is no\nsimple rule for accomplishing our dual-mandate and financial stability objectives through\nreliance on a single policy instrument.\n10(cid:3) See the box “Developments Related to Financial Stability” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem(cid:3)(2018),(cid:3)Monetary Policy Report(cid:3)(Washington: Board of Governors, February),(cid:3)pp. 24-26,\n(cid:75)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:83)(cid:86)(cid:29)(cid:18)(cid:18)(cid:90)(cid:90)(cid:90)(cid:17)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:74)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:18)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:92)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:16)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:16)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:17)(cid:75)(cid:87)(cid:80).\n11(cid:3) For the most recent statement, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), “Federal\nOpen Market Committee Reaffirms Its ‘Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,’(cid:3)”(cid:3)\npress release, January 31,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180131b.htm.\nNote: On April 5, 2018, a typo was corrected to change 19 to 18 in the following sentence in footnote 7:\n“These statistics reflect the 19 advanced approaches bank holding companies subject to the standard LCR.”\n\n-12-\nCyclical Considerations\nAs I have noted elsewhere, the recentlyenacted fiscal stimulus should boost the\neconomy at a time when it is close to full employment and growing above trend. It is\nhard to know with precision how the economy is likely to respond. If unemployment\ncontinues to decline at the rate of the past year, it could reach levels not seen in several\ndecades. Historically, such episodes tendedto see a risk of accelerating inflation in\nearlier decades or a risk offinancial imbalances in more recent decades. It is important to\nbe attentive to the emergence of any imbalances, because we do not have much\nexperience with pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus at a time when resource constraints are\ntightening and growth is above trend.\nDespite elevated asset valuations, overall risks to the financial system remain\nmoderate in no small part because important financial reforms have encouraged large\nbanking institutions to build strong capital and liquidity buffers. History suggests,\nhowever, that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards and an\nattendant increase in risky debt levels. At a time when valuations seem stretched and\ncyclical pressures are building, I would be reluctant to see our large banking institutions\nreleasing the capital and liquidity buffers that they have built so effectively over the past\nfew years, especially since credit growth and profitability in the U.S.banking system are\nrobust.\nOf course, if cyclical pressures continue to build and financial vulnerabilities\nbroaden, it may become appropriateto ask the largest banking organizations to build a\ncountercyclical buffer of capital to fortify their resilience and protect against stress.\nAlternatively, if there were to be a material adjustment to the calibration of the structural\n\n-13-\nbuffers held by the large banking institutions, it would be important to make a\ncompensating adjustment to the countercyclical buffer in order to achieve the same\noverall resilience to financial vulnerabilities.\nAs a rough rule of thumb--and as described in the Board’s framework for\nimplementing theCCyB, which was finalized in September 2016--the criteria for setting\nthe CCyB are calibrated so that the CCyB will be above its minimum value about one-\nthird of the time,assuming that vulnerabilities evolve as they did pre-crisis. It is worth\nnoting that some other jurisdictions have designed their countercyclical buffer\nrequirement to be above zero roughly half of the time--spanning a greater range of\neconomic conditions than in the United States. This may reflect a difference in the\nrelative emphasis on structural buffers relative to cyclically varying buffers. It is worth\nnoting that,although U.S.structural buffers are on the stronger end of the range\ninternationally, the U.S.banking system is also among the healthiest and most\ncompetitive in the world. Credit growth is robust,andbanks are registering strong\nprofitability relative to their international peers.\nConclusion\nOur financial stability agenda seeks to reduce the likelihood and severityof\nfinancial crises. In the wake of the2007-09 financial crisis and recession, we learned\nimportant lessons about the critical necessity of monitoringemerging financial\nvulnerabilities in a systematic fashionand takingcorresponding prudential,\nmacroprudential, and countercyclical policies to build resilience. We undertake\nsystematic assessment of financial vulnerabilities as an important input into our\npolicymaking processes--helping to calibratethe prudential, macroprudential, and\n\n-14-\ncountercyclical policies that are our first lines of defense, in addition toinforming FOMC\ndeliberations because of the important feedback loops between financial conditions and\nour dual-mandate goals. This work is complemented by the efforts of our domestic and\ninternational partners through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council here at home and through the Financial\nStability Board and the International Monetary Fundinternationally.",

While New York is known\nglobally as a cultural hub that attracts the world to its doorstep, it is known locally as a city of\nneighborhoods. Like other cities across this country, New York’s future is bound to the vitality\nof its neighborhoods as places to live, work, learn, play, worship, and invest.1\nNeighborhoods have been the focus of ANHD’s work for over 40 years. The\norganization’s success is a function of its unwavering focus on preserving and strengthening the\nquality of life in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods across the five boroughs. The\nmission of each of the members of ANHD is to strengthen these communities. Together, your\norganizations are providing capacity building, advocacy, and services for the benefit of your\ncommunities and the city as a whole.\nLike many of the nation’s metropolitan areas, New York City has rebounded since the\nrecession and is thriving.2 That, however, has not been the experience for many. Many of the\ncity’s residents have not fully recovered, and some have fallen further behind. Here, as\nelsewhere in the country, there remain important gaps in economic opportunity.\nPowerful research now demonstrates that persistent gaps in economic opportunity are\nconnected to the health of neighborhoods. The effects of place on opportunity can stretch from\none generation to the next. Raj Chetty and others have shown that upward mobility can vary\nimmensely by neighborhood even within the same metropolitan area. The longer a child lives in\n1 I am grateful to Theresa Stark of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing these remarks. The\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n2According to the most recent report by the New York City Comptroller, the city’s GDP grew 2.7 percent in the first\nquarter of 2018 as compared to 2.3 percent for the nation, and the unemployment rate for the city fell to 4.3 percent,\nthe lowest rate on record. See “NYC Economic Growth Slows Down, but Still Surpasses the Nation,”\nhttps://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/new-york-city-quarterly-economic-update/.\n\n-1-\na neighborhood of opportunity--a neighborhood that is racially integrated and has a strong\nmiddle class, strong family structures, more social capital, and better schools--the more likely\nthat a child will do better than their parents economically in adulthood and navigating a path of\nupward mobility.3\nAs I have noted previously, these disparities matter for growth and prosperity. If there\nare large disparities in opportunity, such that enterprise, exertion, and investments reap lower\nreturns in some communities than others, then families and small businesses in these\ncommunities will invest less in the future, and potential growth will fall short.4 Although there\nare important implications at the national level for growth and prosperity, to the extent that the\nroots of the disparities in opportunity and mobility lie in local communities, an important part of\nthe solution is likely to be investments in those communities.5\nThe Community Reinvestment Act\nThat one powerful insight--the importance of investment in communities--lies at the heart\nof the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA is one of the principal tools the Congress\nhas provided for improving investment and development in lower-income communities.\nImplementing this law effectively is one of the important responsibilities of the banking agencies\nin promoting strong outcomes locally that reverberate nationally. So let me turn to the role of the\nCRA in supporting local efforts to strengthen low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and\n3 See http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/.\n4 See, for example, Lael Brainard, Why Opportunity and Inclusion Matter to America’s Economic Strength, May\n2017, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170522a.htm. Studies have shown\n22,\ninequality is associated with lower long-term growth and with lower income growth. See, for example, Heather\nBoushey and Carter C. Price, How Are Economic Inequality and Growth Connected: A Review of Recent Research\n(Washington, DC: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, October 2014), http://equitablegrowth.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/10/100914-ineq-growth.pdf.\n5\nSee Raj Chetty https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/10/to-revive-the-american-dream-take-a-neighborhood-\nprecision-approach/543630/.\n\n-2-\noffer my preliminary thoughts on the opportunity before us to make the regulations even more\neffective in this regard.\nThe CRA was enacted in 1977 to combat the legacy of redlining--literally, the\ndemarcation in red ink of neighborhoods deemed too risky for lending. Federal lending agencies\nused these redlined maps in deciding where to guarantee mortgage loans.6 Not surprisingly, the\nresulting deprivation of credit stifled opportunity for the people living in these areas.\nThrough the CRA, Congress requires the federal banking agencies to encourage banks\nand thrifts to help meet the credit needs of the communities they are chartered to serve, including\nlow- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safety and soundness. It requires the\nFederal Reserve and other agencies to evaluate how well banking institutions help meet those\nneeds and to assign ratings to their performance.7 The CRA further requires the agencies to\nmake public both the ratings and their written evaluations of the banks’ performance. This\ntransparency provides an incentive for banks to work with their communities to meet the needs\nof low- and moderate-income members and provides important information to enable community\nmembers to engage meaningfully with banks.\nResearch has demonstrated that the CRA has had a positive effect on low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods.8 The CRA is unique in that it puts decisionmaking about the\n6 See http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/housing-discrimination-redlining-maps/ for details about how\nmaps created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in the 1930s were used to designate areas considered\nhazardous for mortgage lending and influenced whether mortgage loans qualified for government guarantees from\nthe Federal Housing Administration. To view interactive historical maps, see\nhttps://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=10/44.1788/-84.8433&opacity=0.8.\n7 See 12 U.S.C. § 2901; the ratings are Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and Substantial Non-\ncompliance.\n8 CRA-related mortgage loans had delinquency rates lower than the average across all 2006-vintage mortgages and\nsharply lower than those of subprime loans; see Neil Bhutta, and Glenn B. Canner, “Mortgage Market Conditions\nand Borrower Outcomes: Evidence from the 2012 HMDA Data and Matched HMDA-Credit Record Data,” Federal\nReserve Bulletin 99 (November 2013). In addition, a study of mortgage loans originated between 2003 and 2006 as\npart of a CRA targeted, low- to moderate-income homebuyer program found that they performed nearly as well as\n\n-3-\ncommunity’s needs and priorities in the hands of local stakeholders: financial institutions that\nlend and invest, community organizations that deliver services and develop real estate, and state\nand local governments that direct incentives and subsidies. The enactment of other laws around\nthe same time supported the CRA’s success, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,\nwhich requires lenders to report the location of their home mortgage lending and the race and\nincome of borrowers.\nMuch has changed in the years since the CRA was enacted, including technology-driven\nchanges in the delivery of financial services, and it is high time to consider corresponding\nimprovements to the regulations. Both banks and community organizations have offered a\nvariety of suggestions for improving the CRA regulations and their implementation in the last\nseveral years. We are undertaking discussions with the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with which we have traditionally\nissued joint rulemakings on the CRA. The Federal Reserve has long been interested in engaging\nin an interagency review of the CRA regulations, so we are pleased to participate in this process.\nIn addition, the Treasury Department recently completed an extensive outreach effort related to\nmodernizing the CRA regulations.\nCRA is a vital tool to address the credit needs of low- and moderate-income\ncommunities, and I believe the time is ripe for a refresh to make it even more relevant to today’s\nchallenges. There are five principles that can help guide our efforts.\nprime loans and much better than subprime mortgage loans through the financial crisis; see Lei Ding, Roberto G.\nQuercia, Janneke Ratcliffe, and Wei Lei, “Risky Borrowers or Risky Mortgages: Disaggregating Effects Using\nPropensity Score Models,” Journal of Real Estate Research 33 no. 2 (2011): 245–77. Another analysis found\nevidence of a substantial increase in mortgage lending due to the CRA--especially among low-income borrowers--\nwith no measurable rise in the likelihood of default; see Daniel Ringo, “Mortgage Lending, Default, and the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act,” June 15, 2017.\n\n-4-\nThe Importance of Place\nFirst, we should update the area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA activities\nwhile retaining the core focus on place. This is the most important aspect of refreshing the CRA,\nand also the one that will require the most care. As our Federal Advisory Council noted, “…a\nbank’s ability to engage in meaningful community development efforts continues to require a\nmeaningful knowledge of and presence in local communities.”9 A significant strength of CRA\nevaluations is that a bank’s performance is evaluated taking into account the demographics of its\ncommunities, the types of housing and businesses they serve, and the other financial institutions\nserving those communities.\nThe current regulations use branches and deposit-taking ATMs as a proxy for the\ncommunities the bank serves because these were the primary mechanisms for delivering services\nwhen the CRA was enacted and for many years subsequently. This reflected an environment\nwhere interstate banking was not allowed, and physical branches were necessary for deposit\ntaking and lending. Today, changes in technology and consumer preferences have made it\npossible for banks to serve customers far beyond their physical branches and deposit-taking\nATMs--via online and mobile platforms.\nEven so, as much as technology has made banking transactions more convenient for\ncustomers, it has not eliminated the need for branches. For large parts of the country, branches\nand deposit-taking ATMs remain an important way that banks engage with a community.\nBranches and ATMs are still necessary for depositing and withdrawing cash. Branches also\nprovide personal service and assistance to consumers and business customers. They provide a\n9 Federal Reserve Board Federal Advisory Council, Record of Meeting, May 2018,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/fac-20180511.pdf.\n.\n\n-5-\npresence for lenders to get to know borrowers and the communities in which they live, lend, and\ninvest. As our Community Advisory Council recently emphasized, “[f]or many rural and LMI\npopulations, bank branches remain critical for the provision of bank loans, investments, and\nservices.”10\nRecent studies measuring the impact of branch closures on credit availability in\nneighborhoods demonstrate that branches still matter, particularly with respect to accessing small\nbusiness credit.11 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that access to small business\ncredit declines and the rates for small business loans increase as the distance between the bank\nand the borrower grows.12 Similarly, the large majority of mortgage lending continues to be\nlocated in one or more of a bank’s delineated assessment areas--that is, near a physical branch.\nThis research also found that people in low-income census tracts were more than twice as\nlikely to live in a banking desert--an area without a branch within 10 miles--than those in higher-\nincome tracts.13 When they are cut off from mainstream banking institutions, some consumers\nrely on more expensive alternatives that include payday loans, auto title loans, pawn shops, and\ncheck cashing services.\nBanks vary widely in terms of the types of services they offer and the mechanisms they\nuse for reaching their customers. On one end of the spectrum, many community banks still rely\n10 Federal Reserve Board Community Advisory Council, Record of Meeting, May 4, 2018,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/cac-20180504.pdf.\n11 See Hoai-Luu Q. Nguyen, Do Bank Branches Still Matter? The Effect of Closings on Local Economic Outcomes,\nOctober 2015. The reason is the information-intensive nature of the underwriting process. Even in areas with plenty\nof bank branches, declines in small businesses lending because of the loss of the relationship between a small\nbusiness owner and their loan officer were significant. Once broken, the study found that those relationships take\nyears to replace. The impact of branch closures were found to be more severe in tracts with lower median income, a\nhigher fraction of minority households, and where firms were, on average, closer to their lending.\n12Donald Morgan, Maxim Pinkovskiy, and Bryan Yang, “Banking Deserts, Branch Closings and Soft Information,”\nLiberty Street Economics blog, March 7, 2015, http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/03/banking-\ndeserts-branch-closings-and-soft-information.html.\n13 See, again, Morgan, Pinkovskiy, and Yang, March 7, 2015; between 2009 and 2014, the fraction of low-income\ntracts that were also banking deserts increased 0.17 percentage points compared to a 0.06 percentage point increase\nin higher-income tracts.\n\n-6-\nprimarily on branches and ATMs to reach their customers, with mobile functionality offered\nprimarily to enhance the customer experience. In the middle of the spectrum, regional and\nnational banking organizations are using online and mobile app capabilities to attract and retain\ncustomers well beyond their physical footprint. At the other end of the spectrum, online banks\nemploy business models that reach customers across much or all of America without relying on\nbranches. Although these online banks may provide the same retail products and services as a\ntraditional bank with a branch network, because they have only one location, they are evaluated\nfor CRA purposes in the area around that location, rather than in the many areas where they have\ncustomers.\nStill other banks offer a limited set of credit products or wholesale services. Take, for\ninstance, the example of Industrial Loan Companies (ILCs), which have CRA obligations as\nstate-chartered insured depository institutions. ILCs are owned by corporations rather than bank\nholding companies and are typically chartered to provide credit cards or other forms of financing\nrelated to their parent company’s business. Many large ILCs are chartered in Utah and are\nevaluated on their CRA performance in Salt Lake City, even though they lend nationally. The\nresult is a saturated market for community development lending and investment in Salt Lake\nCity. At the same time, other areas in Utah and beyond have important community development\nopportunities that may go unmet. At a minimum, revised CRA regulations should allow banks\nwith this type of business model to expand CRA activities beyond the area surrounding its\nbranch so that the community and economic development needs of more underserved\ncommunities can be met.\nBranches are important vehicles for reaching small business customers and low-income\nconsumers, but they are not the only way. In considering ways to revise the CRA regulations,\n\n-7-\nthe agencies should be thoughtful about how to make the areas in which we evaluate CRA\nperformance more meaningful to both banks and low- and moderate-income communities. For\ncommunity banks that rely on branches to serve their customers, the current assessment area\napproach may need only small adjustments. For banks that serve their customers through a\nvariety of approaches, assessing their broader deposit-taking and loan-making footprint might\nmake sense. For large wholesale banks, it might make sense to evaluate CRA activity in a\nbroader area and to encourage them to spread their investments and services to underserved\nareas.\nThe CRA regulations should be updated in a way that is appropriate for different business\nmodels. To the extent that banks are able to serve the needs in low- and moderate-income\ncommunities through additional channels, it is important they receive due consideration, while\nCRA revisions should also continue to recognize the importance of sustaining branches in\ncommunities where they are needed.\nOpportunities in Underserved Areas\nThe second, and related, principle guiding our CRA refresh is that the regulations should\nencourage banks to seek out opportunities in underserved areas. As I noted earlier, the CRA\nrecognizes that banks make a unique contribution. Banks are able to make targeted and valuable\ninvestments because of their stake in the local community and their knowledge of it. As a long-\nterm stakeholder in a community, a bank’s efforts to finance housing, small businesses, and\ncommunity services are not just good business short-term, but also good investments long-term\nas residents improve their economic standing and use more banking services. Streamlining the\nCRA regulations and clarifying the performance measures could create stronger incentives for\n\n-8-\nbanks to pursue the less obvious, but potentially more impactful, projects that low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods need the most to become areas of opportunity.\nWe will want to update the CRA in ways that reduce the distortions that lead to some\nareas becoming credit “hot spots” and others credit deserts. Where there is a high density of\nbanks relative to investment opportunities, the result of too many banks competing for too few\nCRA-qualified investments can be declining returns. Meanwhile, other areas have a difficult\ntime attracting capital not because the social return on investment is low, but rather because they\nare not in a bank’s major market, if they are served by a bank at all. However we define a bank’s\nassessment areas in the future, the regulations need to be designed and implemented in a way\nthat encourages banks to direct their community investment activities productively.\nTailoring\nThe third guiding principle is that the CRA regulations should be tailored to banks of\ndifferent sizes and business models. We should set standards that are flexible enough to evaluate\nthe CRA performance of a $100 million bank no less effectively than a $2 trillion bank. Banks\nseek clearer, simpler rules that result in more CRA activity with less burden. We believe this can\nbe done while retaining the flexibility to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance in light of its size,\nbusiness model, capacity, and constraints as well as its community’s demographics, economic\nconditions, and credit needs and opportunities. Regulatory revisions that do not contemplate\nevaluating CRA performance in context could arguably undermine the CRA’s greatest attribute--\nits recognition that banks are uniquely situated to be responsive to the most important\ncommunity and economic development needs in their communities.\nThe typical small community bank focuses on serving its community through deposit and\ncredit products and may not have the capacity to finance a major community development\n\n-9-\ninitiative. But as banks grow in size or specialize in different types of lending, they may have\ngreater capacity to invest through additional channels. We should be sensitive to the ways in\nwhich a bank’s business model, in addition to its size, influences the types of activities it\nundertakes to meet its CRA obligations. We will want to maintain the flexibility to ensure that,\nno matter the business line, a bank can meet its CRA obligation by doing what it has the\nexpertise to do well. And as we look to improve our CRA evaluations, the agencies will need to\ndetermine what kind of data will be necessary to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance based on\nthe activities it chooses and which banks should collect and report that data based on their scale\nand business model.\nConsistency and Predictability\nThe fourth principle is that the revised regulations should promote greater consistency\nand predictability in evaluations and ratings, both within and across the agencies. The members\nof our Federal Advisory Council have recommended that the regulations “need to be consistent\nacross the [a]gencies and provide for all regulated financial institutions to be subject to the same\nCRA ‘crediting’, examination, and remedial standards.” 14 Banks have expressed understandable\nconcern regarding the variation they see in evaluations. Banks seek greater clarity in advance\nabout what activities will qualify for CRA consideration. They want to understand how the\nqualitative criteria--those measuring the impact and responsiveness of loans, investments, and\nservices--will be factored into their ratings.\nThis concern is not limited to banks. The community organizations and local\ngovernments that are trying to attract bank financing to their projects need this clarity, too.\nRegulatory streamlining can help to promote consistency, as would regular examiner training.\n14 Federal Reserve Board Federal Advisory Council, Record of Meeting, May 2018.\n\n-10-\nFair Credit Access\nThe fifth and final principle for CRA modernization is to ensure that revised CRA\nregulations support its position as one of several mutually reinforcing laws designed to promote\nan inclusive financial services industry. The central thrust of the CRA is to encourage banks to\nensure that all creditworthy borrowers have fair access to credit. For banks to be successful in\nmeeting the credit needs of their entire community, it follows that they must guard against\ndiscriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices. Ensuring fair access to credit is\ndifficult and requires ongoing vigilance.15 For this reason, taking a holistic view of closely\nrelated issues is likely to be the best way to fulfill the purpose of the CRA, as one of several\nimportant laws intended to promote fair financial access.\nAffordable Housing and the CRA\nI want to briefly connect the dots between the high priority we put on strengthening the\nCRA and the pressing challenge of affordable housing that is a key focus of the work that you all\ndo. Access to affordable housing connects families concretely to place and can be a source of\nstrength or fragility. Pew just released a study showing that 38 percent of renter households in\nAmerica are spending more than 30 percent of their pretax income on rent, representing a 19\npercent increase from 2001.16 The percent of renter households that are spending half or more of\ntheir pretax income on housing increased by 42 percent during the same period.\nHouseholds that spend a high fraction of their income on rent often may find themselves\nunable to pursue proven strategies to achieve financial security and invest in their family’s\n15 Richard Rothstein, The Color of Law: The Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America (New\nYork: W.W. Norton & Company, 2017).\n16 See http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2018/04/american-families-face-a-growing-rent-\nburden.\n\n-11-\nfuture. They may need to turn to costly short-term sources of credit to cover emergency\nexpenses. Some may experience eviction if there is an unexpected expense or loss of income.\nTo manage the high cost of housing, workers may be compelled to live far from where\nthey work, rent substandard units, or resort to overcrowding. Research shows that households\nthat live far from work often pay a large share of their budget in commuting costs.17 As a society,\nwe need to do better in ensuring that affordable housing is available where it is needed.\nThe supply of affordable housing is a good example of a problem of national scope\nwhose solution must be tailored to local needs and economic conditions. This audience knows\nbetter than most about the complex dynamics that affect housing at the local level. Local\ndecisions on land use, zoning, taxes, and leveraging of federal funding, and whether community\nneeds are prioritized, are at the heart of whether neighborhoods thrive.\nI’m not going to suggest that there are any easy answers to housing affordability. Still,\nthe CRA is one of the important policy levers that can make a difference by encouraging\nsolutions that are tailored to local needs and circumstances. It does this by encouraging banks to\nprovide affordable and sustainable mortgage products to qualified low- and moderate-income\nfamilies. This helps those families have a chance to purchase homes sustainably and build equity.\nIn addition, by encouraging banks to work with the community to identify tailored rental and\nhomeownership investment opportunities, the CRA helps encourage the construction of\naffordable housing where it is needed most.\n17 See, for example, the Center for Neighborhood Technology’s Housing and Transportation (H+T) Affordability\nIndex at https://htaindex.cnt.org/about/.\n\n-12-\nThe Path Forward\nIn our effort to refresh the CRA regulations, we will continue to honor the purpose of the\nCRA by encouraging banks to engage in local community and economic development initiatives.\nI am confident that there are ways to update the areas where we evaluate a bank’s CRA\nperformance without losing the core focus on place. We should do more to encourage banks to\noffer deposit and credit products designed to help rent-burdened customers save for\nhomeownership and build strong credit scores that will enable them to succeed in obtaining\nmortgage credit on favorable terms. We should do more to encourage banks to lend to the\nunderserved entrepreneurs and small businesses that hold the promise of providing jobs and\ngrowing local economies. Even as the economy looks strong overall, significant challenges\nremain for low- and moderate-income areas, making the CRA and its focus on local credit needs\nmore important than ever. I look forward to hearing from you over the next several months to\nhelp inform our interagency effort to refresh the CRA regulations.\nThis conference is an opportunity for ANHD members to envision the future for New\nYork’s neighborhoods and discuss critical actions to achieve that vision. I know you have a full\nagenda today, replete with pressing conversations on the compelling challenges that face your\nneighborhoods. I want to applaud your work to ensure that all of New York’s neighborhoods are\ncommunities of opportunity. Thank you.",

Many observers interpret normalization to mean a tightening\ncycle similar in pace to previous cycles, such as those from 1994 to 1995 and from 2004\nto 2007, with the effect of returning interest rates to the level viewed as normal in the\ndecades before the crisis. The Federal Reserve describes normalization as “steps to raise\nthe federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels.”2 But\nwhat do we mean by “more normal levels”? A broad deterioration in foreign growth\nprospects, together with greater risk sensitivity in the wake of the crisis and changes in\nthe rate of potential output growth, may be contributing to a “new normal.” The new\nnormal is likely to be characterized by a lower level of interest rates than in the decades\npreceding the crisis, which counsels a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting\nmonetary policy.\nThe Benchmark Neutral Rate\nThe appropriate pace and target for normalizing monetary policy depend centrally\non understanding the neutral rate of interest. The nominal neutral interest rate is the level\nof the federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate\nwith full employment and stable inflation.3 The appropriate benchmark for assessing the\nstance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal neutral rate\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For example, see Board of Governors (2014, paragraph 2).\n3 The closely related concept of the natural rate of interest--the rate of interest at which investment and\nsavings are equilibrated at full employment--is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.\n\n- 2 -\nof interest: When the federal funds rate is below the nominal neutral rate, monetary\npolicy is accommodative, and, when it is above the neutral rate, policy is contractionary.\nFor this reason, many monetary policy rules, such as the well-known Taylor rule,\nincorporate an estimate of the neutral real interest rate as a critical parameter along with\nthe target rate of inflation.4\nAlthough the neutral rate is a critical benchmark for monetary policy, it changes\nover time in response to important changes in economic conditions, necessitating\ncorresponding adjustments in monetary policy in order to restore the economy to full\nemployment. For instance, when there are modest adverse shocks to demand that lead to\nmodest reductions in the shorter-run neutral rate, monetary policy can provide enough\nsupport to keep the economy at full employment simply by reducing the policy rate\ncommensurate with the decline in the nominal neutral rate. However, when the adverse\nshocks to demand are sufficiently severe to push the nominal neutral interest rate\nsubstantially below zero, as they were during the Great Recession, monetary policy\nconfronts the zero-lower-bound constraint, at which point the federal funds rate cannot\nfall low enough to provide the necessary degree of accommodation without becoming\nnegative. This was the case in the United States for several years following the crisis and\nremains true today in a number of advanced foreign economies. That is why monetary\npolicymakers in the United States and several other major economies have been\ncompelled to use additional unconventional tools to promote full employment and target\ninflation, such as forward guidance and asset purchases.\n4 See Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999).\n\n- 3 -\nThe neutral rate of interest is not directly observable, but we can back out an\nestimate of the neutral rate by relying on the observation that output should grow faster\nrelative to potential growth the lower the federal funds rate is relative to the nominal\nneutral rate. In today’s circumstances, the fact that the U.S. economy is growing at a\npace only modestly above potential while core inflation remains restrained suggests that\nthe nominal neutral rate may not be far above the nominal federal funds rate, even now.\nIn fact, various econometric estimates of the level of the neutral rate, or similar concepts,\nare consistent with the low levels suggested by this simple heuristic approach.5\nThe Past and Future Neutral Rate\nIn assessing the policy path ahead, the critical question is whether a low neutral\nrate is likely to be a “new normal” in the longer run or whether the neutral rate is soon\nlikely to increase back to levels considered normal in the decades before the crisis. To\nanswer this question, it is helpful to use economic forecasts, market-implied expectations,\nand econometric models to assess where real interest rates are expected to be in the\nlonger run, and compare them with the levels that prevailed in the decades before the\ncrisis. In doing so, it is important to abstract from shocks that are transitory or cyclical\nand thus likely to fade away over a year or two.6\nStarting with economic forecasts, Blue Chip Forecasts publishes projections of\nthe federal funds rate and consumer price index (CPI) inflation 6 to 10 years into the\nfuture, when the economy is typically expected to be near full employment. The implied\nBlue Chip consensus longer-run real federal funds rate averaged around 2.2 percent in the\n5 See, for example, Cúrdia (2015) and Del Negro and others (2015).\n6 Hamilton and others (2015) use moving averages of real rates as their measure of the equilibrium real\nrate. Using a similar measure, in the United States, the 11-year moving average of the short-term real\ninterest rate is now at its lowest level since the beginning of the series in the late 1950s.\n\n- 4 -\ntwo decades preceding the crisis, which is close to the level of the intercept term in the\nTaylor (1993) rule, which in turn is based on empirical analysis of the period from the\nmid-1980s to the early 1990s. In contrast, the Blue Chip consensus longer-run rate is\ncurrently around 1.1 percent, about 1 percentage point lower than the pre-crisis average.7\nSimilarly, although the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has not\nexplicitly defined “normal,” the central tendency or the median of the longer-run level of\nthe federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) might reasonably\nbe considered a rough proxy. By this proxy, forecasts of the neutral rate have moved\ndown noticeably over the past several years. The median projection of the longer-run\nlevel of the real federal funds rate was 2-1/4 percent in January 2012, when projections of\nthe longer-run federal funds rate were first included in the SEP. By comparison, the\nmedian projection for the longer-run real federal funds rate had fallen by 3/4 percentage\npoint to 1-1/2 percent in the most recent SEP.8\nMarket measures of expected forward rates evidence a similar decline. For\nexample, we can back out an implied 1-year real rate 10 years from now from the\nTreasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, yield curve. The most recent readings\nare around 1.3 percent, close to 2 percentage points below the average rate from 1999\nthrough 2007. Swaps prices tell a similar story. The implied expected 1-year real rate 10\nyears from now is currently close to 1 percent, again well below levels prior to the\nfinancial crisis.\n7 Here the longer-run real rate is defined as the consensus longer-run nominal federal funds rate minus the\nconsensus longer-run rate of CPI inflation. Because most forecasts of economic conditions far into the\nfuture are predicated on the economy being at full employment, forecasts of relatively low actual real rates\nare consistent with forecasts of relatively low neutral rates.\n8 In the SEP, longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each\nvariable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further\nshocks to the economy.\n\n- 5 -\nFinally, some of the econometric models used to estimate the current neutral rate,\nor closely related concepts, can also be used to assess whether low neutral rates are likely\nto persist. While estimates will depend on the model specification, several models\nestimate that the neutral rate will remain low for some time to come. Laubach and\nWilliams, for example, estimate that the natural rate, a concept closely related to the\nneutral rate, likely will remain near zero for the foreseeable future.9\nWhy Is the Neutral Rate Low?\nWith a variety of estimates suggesting that the neutral rate of interest is likely to\nremain low relative to historical norms for some time, it is important to assess the\nunderlying causes and their likely persistence. There are a host of factors that could lead\nthe neutral rate to remain depressed in the longer run--ranging from the low level of\nworld real interest rates, which affects the United States via the exchange rate and\nfinancial market channels, to slow-moving secular trends in the labor force and\nproductivity, to persistent changes in risk perceptions stemming from the crisis.\nAlthough tight domestic credit conditions and concerns about downside risks to\nasset prices and domestic demand were the dominant drivers early in the recovery, the\nforeign outlook has become increasingly important as a source of downward pressure on\nthe neutral rate in the past few years. In addition to concerns about weak demand in\nJapan and the euro area, more recently foreign growth concerns have broadened to\ninclude China, which is navigating difficult structural as well as cyclical adjustments.\nThe financial reverberations from China are adversely affecting commodity exporters and\n9 Laubach and Williams define the natural rate as “the real short-term interest rate consistent with the\neconomy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate supply or demand have abated”\n(2015, p. 2).\n\n- 6 -\nemerging markets more broadly, and weak growth trajectories are now the norm in much\nof the world, pushing down interest rates globally.\nThe broad-based reduction in interest rates in the rest of the world, by increasing\ndemand for U.S. assets, puts upward pressure on the dollar, which in turn implies\ndownward pressure on the U.S. neutral rate. One way to think about the spillover from\nabroad is how much adjustment in the federal funds rate might be necessary to insulate\ndomestic employment from an appreciation in the dollar that is expected to persist. Let’s\ntake the roughly 15 percent real appreciation of the dollar that we have seen since June\n2014. According to the Board’s FRB/US model, it would require lowering the path of\nthe federal funds rate by roughly 1 percentage point over the medium term to insulate\ndomestic employment from the 15 percent stronger exchange rate in inflation adjusted\nterms. In the neighborhood of the zero lower bound, this shift down implies a delay in\nthe date of liftoff and a shallower path for the federal funds rate over several years. In\neffect, this spillover from abroad implies some limitations on the extent to which U.S.\nmonetary conditions can diverge from global conditions.\nGoing forward, many observers expect global growth to stabilize and eventually\nmove higher, easing pressure on the dollar and on commodity prices and leading to a\nhigher neutral interest rate globally.10 However, as foreign economies face structural as\nwell as cyclical adjustments, the speed at which the stabilization and recovery of foreign\ngrowth takes place is highly uncertain, and there is a risk that this influence on the neutral\nrate could fade very slowly. Moreover, there are downside risks to the foreign outlook.\n10 See, for example, chapter 1 of the IMF World Economic Outlook (2015).\n\n- 7 -\nOther factors likely pushing down the current neutral rate may prove even more\npersistent. Importantly, expectations that the economy’s growth potential has fallen\ncould contribute to a persistent decline in the neutral rate. Indeed, there is evidence that\ngrowth in the labor force, and perhaps productivity, have slowed persistently in recent\nyears. After increasing noticeably over much of the post-World War II period, the labor\nforce participation rate flattened out over the 1990s and began to decline in the early\n2000s as the baby boom generation approached retirement. Most recently, the pace of\ndecline has quickened, with the participation rate declining 1/2 percent per year, on\naverage, over the recovery.11 Productivity growth has also slowed, averaging just\n1 percent per year over the recovery, about half the pace over the 50 years prior to the\nfinancial crisis.12 Given this data, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that\nthe growth rate of potential output is only 1.7 percent currently, less than half the rate\nduring the 50 years before 2008. Nevertheless, although there is evidence of a\nconnection between low potential output growth and a low neutral rate, as pointed out by\nHamilton and others, the relationship is not precisely estimated, which leaves\nconsiderable uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect.13\nFinally, investors’ risk sensitivity appears to have been altered by the experience\nof tail risks during the crisis, which could have a persistent depressing effect on the\n11 Population growth has also moved gradually lower in the United States, though the effect has not been as\nlarge as in some foreign economies, where the size of the population is now stagnant or falling.\n12 It is unclear how persistent recent low rates of measured productivity growth will be. While weak\ninvestment levels, particularly early on in the recovery, likely contributed to lower productivity gains,\ninvestment levels going forward could be closer to historical norms. Also, recent technological gains may\neventually contribute strongly to productivity growth; see, for example, Baily, Manyika, and Gupta (2013).\nIn addition, there is evidence that some of the contribution of technology gains to productivity growth is\nbeing understated; see, for example, Byrne and Pinto (2015), Byrne and Corrado (2015), and Byrne, Oliner\nand Sichel (2015).\n13 See Hamilton and others (2015).\n\n- 8 -\nneutral rate. To the extent that investors or firms are more attuned to the risks associated\nwith capital investments than before the financial crisis, it increases the premium for\nrisky investments, or the difference in return between a risk-free investment, such as\novernight reserves, and somewhat riskier investment opportunities. A higher risk\npremium necessitates a lower risk-free rate to encourage the same amount of riskier\ninvestments as previously. Consistent with this explanation, there is evidence that the\ngap between the return to capital investment and the risk free rate has risen. For example,\naccording to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models estimated by the Federal\nReserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the natural rate of interest\nhas been held down during the recovery by shocks that increase the difference between\nthe marginal product of capital and the risk free rate, pushing down investment and\nreducing the level of capital.14 In addition, a simple measure of the marginal product of\ncapital suggests that the return to capital investment has not changed very much, or\nperhaps has even increased, over the past decade despite the decline in risk free rates.15\nImplications for the Path of Monetary Policy\nBefore addressing what a persistently low neutral interest rate might mean for the\nnormalization of monetary policy, it is helpful to review inflation developments. Because\nthe federal funds rate is the real rate plus the expected rate of inflation and because it is\nthe real rate that influences economic activity, the amount of monetary accommodation\nrepresented by a given nominal level of the federal funds rate decreases as expected\ninflation declines. In a low neutral rate environment, it is especially important to guard\n14 See Del Negro and others (2015). In these models, the natural rate of interest is defined as the “rate of\ninterest that would obtain if all prices and wages had adjusted so as to bring the level of economic activity\nto its full-employment rate.”\n15 See Gomme, Ravikumar, and Rupert (2015).\n\n- 9 -\nagainst extended periods of below-target inflation, which may lead inflation expectations\nto drift lower.\nIt is thus notable that inflation has been below our 2 percent target for 3 years.\nCurrent below-target levels of inflation in part reflect disinflationary pressures from\nabroad, including lower import prices and lower commodity prices, which are likely to\nfade over time. However, inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy\nprices. Over the 12 months ending in October, core personal consumption expenditures,\nor PCE, prices, which exclude the often volatile categories of food and energy, increased\n1.3 percent, and the 12-month change in core prices has been around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2\npercent since the beginning of 2013. The persistent weakness in core price inflation\ndeserves continued vigilance.\nIn determining the outlook for inflation, the gravitational force of long-term\ninflation expectations is especially important. Some survey measures of inflation\nexpectations have declined recently. For example, the University of Michigan Surveys of\nConsumers median measure of inflation expectations at a 5-to-10 year horizon was 2.6\npercent in November and has averaged 2.7 percent over the past year, slightly below the\naverage reading over the past decade of 2.9 percent. Projections from the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters also suggest that 10-year-ahead inflation expectations edged\nlower this quarter, although they have remained at or very near 2 percent since the end of\n2012.\nMarket-based measures of inflation compensation at longer-term horizons, such\nas inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury\nbond yields, have declined more noticeably over the past year and a half. Although it is\n\n- 10 -\ndifficult to precisely disentangle the contribution of changes in inflation expectations,\nliquidity premiums, and inflation risk premiums to this downward shift, some\ndecompositions suggest that, while expected inflation may not have declined much,\nmarket participants may be placing a somewhat greater likelihood than previously on\nepisodes of below-potential growth being accompanied by below-target inflation. Thus,\nthe decline in measures of inflation expectations warrants close monitoring.\nThe slow progress on inflation, together with the likely low level of the longer-\nterm neutral real rate and the slow pace at which the very low shorter-term rate may\nmove to the longer-term rate, suggest that the federal funds rate is likely to adjust more\ngradually and to a lower level than in previous expansions. In short, “gradual and low” is\nlikely to be the new normal.\nIn addition, the combination of a low neutral real rate with slow progress on\ninflation suggests a greater likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound than in previous\ndecades, when the neutral rate was probably much higher. The lower the longer-term\nnominal neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to\npush growth sufficiently below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate below\nzero to provide accommodation. Assuming there has not been a material reduction in the\nfrequency and severity of negative shocks since the pre-crisis period, the implication is\nthat the probability of being constrained by the zero lower bound is greater than prior to\nthe crisis.\nAlthough empirical analysis suggests that unconventional tools affect the\neconomy through the same channels as the federal funds rate, even so, there are greater\ncosts and uncertainties associated with unconventional policies relative to changes in the\n\n- 11 -\nfederal funds rate. 16 As a result, policy is likely to remain more constrained at the zero\nlower bound than above it. As the probability of hitting the zero lower bound increases,\nthe asymmetry in policy flexibility becomes more pronounced. Because we have more\nspace to respond by raising rates if inflationary forces accelerate than by cutting rates if\ndisinflationary forces emerge, when nominal neutral rates are likely to be lower on\naverage, we should be cautious about raising rates, do so gradually, and carefully assess\nthe effects on economic and financial conditions as we go. Moreover, because the\nFederal Reserve’s asset holdings help maintain accommodative financial conditions, it\nwould be prudent to maintain reinvestments until the normalization of the federal funds\nrate is sufficiently far along to allow room to cut nominal rates if economic conditions\ndeteriorate.\nThe asymmetry of policy flexibility at the zero lower bound also arises when\nthere is uncertainty about the level of the neutral real rate. As discussed in recent papers,\nif there is significant uncertainty about the level of the neutral real rate, risk management\nconsiderations suggest that policymakers should respond cautiously to signs that the\nneutral real rate may be rising, particularly when the policy rate is close to the zero lower\nbound.17 In the presence of uncertainty, there is a risk that the actual neutral real rate is\neither higher or lower than current estimates of the neutral real rate, and the stance of\npolicy will therefore be either more accommodative or more restrictive than intended. If\nthe actual neutral rate is higher than estimated, and policy is more accommodative than\nintended, the stance of policy can be readily tightened later to restrain any buildup in\ninflationary pressures. But, if the actual neutral real rate is lower than estimated, and the\n16 See Engen, Laubach and Reifschneider (2015), for example.\n17 See the recent papers by Gust, Johannsen and López-Salido (2015) and Evans and others (2015).\n\n- 12 -\nstance of monetary policy is tighter than intended, unexpected policy restraint may prove\ndifficult to offset later with more accommodative policy because the policy rate is already\nclose to the zero lower bound.\nFinally, there is a risk that with persistently lower neutral rates, there may be\ngreater pressures for investors to reach for yield, increasing the demand for risky assets.\nAs a result, macroprudential policy may take on greater importance to guard against\nfinancial stability risks. Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory\nagencies have implemented a number of new rules to strengthen capital, liquidity, and\nrisk management at the largest financial institutions. Many of these rules are “through\nthe cycle” safeguards, meaning that they impose structurally higher standards. In\naddition, when the risks to financial stability increase, the Federal Reserve, in\nconsultation with the other banking agencies, can temporarily increase the amount of\ncapital that large banks are required to hold in order to build resilience at these\ninstitutions and to restrain undue risk-taking on a cyclical basis.\nConclusion\nA variety of evidence suggests that the longer-run neutral rate is lower now than it\nhas been historically, and that the very low shorter-run neutral rate may adjust to it very\nslowly, due to a combination of weaker foreign demand growth, greater risk sensitivity as\na result of the crisis, higher risk premiums for productive investment, and lower growth\nin potential output. The lower neutral rate means the normalization of the federal funds\nrate is likely to follow a more gradual and shallower path than in previous cycles,\nalthough the actual path will be determined by economic conditions. It also implies that\nthe likelihood of the federal funds rate hitting the zero lower bound will be persistently\n\n- 13 -\ngreater than it has been previously, which could make it more difficult to achieve our\nobjectives of full employment and 2 percent inflation. With the nominal neutral interest\nrate lower than in the past, and with policy options being more limited if conditions\ndeteriorate than if inflationary pressures accelerate, the asymmetry in risk-management\nconsiderations counsels a cautious and gradual approach.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nBaily, Martin Neil, James Manyika, and Shalabh Gupta (2013). “U.S. Productivity\nGrowth: An Optimistic Perspective,” International Productivity Monitor, vol. 25\n(Spring), pp. 3-12, www.csls.ca/ipm/25/IPM-25-Baily-Manyika-Gupta.pdf.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve (2014). “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” press release,\nSeptember 17,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm.\nByrne, David, and Carol Corrado (2015). “Recent Trends in Communications Equipment\nPrices,” FEDS Notes.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EDT\nOctober 12, 2017\nRethinking Monetary Policy in a New Normal\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPanel on Monetary Policy\n“Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy,” a conference sponsored by\nthe Peterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 12, 2017\n\nI enjoyed Ben Bernanke’s paper titled “Monetary Policy in a New Era.” 1 He\npresents a compelling diagnosis of the issues facing policymakers and discusses a variety\nof policy options. Bernanke proposes an approach to policy that is elegant and\nstraightforward to communicate. I will focus on those elements that I find particularly\nrelevant for the challenges faced by policymakers and suggest some implications and\ncomplications. My comments are not intended to address current policy.2\nThe New Normal\nPolicymakers in advanced economies are confronting a different constellation of\nchallenges today than those that dominated the canon of U.S. monetary policymaking\nover the previous half-century, which I refer to as the “new normal.”3 A key feature of\nthe new normal is that the neutral interest rate--the level of the federal funds rate that is\nconsistent with the economy growing close to its potential rate, full employment, and\nstable inflation--appears to be much lower than it was in the decades prior to the crisis.\nIn the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) most recent Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP), the median FOMC participant expected a longer-run real federal funds\nrate, after subtracting inflation, of 3/4 percent, down sharply from the value the first time\nthe policy projection was published in the January 2012 SEP of 2-1/4 percent--and the\naverage value in the decades prior to the financial crisis of 2-1/2 percent.4\n1 Bernanke (2017).\n2 I am grateful to John Roberts for his assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my own\nviews, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n3 See Brainard (2015, 2016b).\n4 The well-known Laubach-Williams model currently suggests an estimate of the longer-run neutral federal\nfunds rate that is close to zero. The latest estimates are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco’s website at http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/files/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx. Over the 1960-2007 period, the real federal\nfunds rate--measured as the nominal federal funds rate less trailing four-quarter core PCE (personal\nconsumption expenditures) inflation--averaged 2-1/2 percent.\n\n- 2 -\nThe low level of the neutral rate limits the amount of space available for cutting\nthe federal funds rate to offset adverse developments and thereby can be expected to\nincrease the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is constrained by the\neffective lower bound, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target. In this\nenvironment, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down\nprivate-sector inflation expectations, which could amplify the degree and persistence of\nshortfalls of inflation, thereby making future lower bound episodes even more\nchallenging in terms of output and employment losses. To the extent it is weighing on\nlonger-run inflation expectations, the persistently low level of the neutral federal funds\nrate may be a factor contributing to the persistent shortfall of U.S. inflation from the\nFOMC’s target.5\nFurther complicating the ability of central banks to achieve their inflation\nobjectives in today’s new normal is the very flat Phillips curve observed in the United\nStates and many other advanced economies, which makes the relationship between labor\nmarket conditions and price inflation more tenuous. For instance, inflation has remained\nstubbornly below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for the past five years even as\nunemployment has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.2 percent, a level that most experts\nbelieve is in the vicinity of full employment.6\nBernanke’s paper provides an excellent review of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to\noperate in this new environment and makes some interesting new proposals. Reflecting\non the Fed’s available “policy toolbox,” Bernanke concludes that the available tools are\n5 See, for example, Brainard (2017b), Kiley and Roberts (2017), and Nakata and Schmidt (2016).\n6 The inflation information refers to core PCE inflation measured on a 12-month average basis.\n\n- 3 -\nnot likely to be sufficient and proposes a framework that relies on forward guidance with\ncommitment to help central banks achieve their inflation and employment objectives.\nThe Makeup Principle\nThe academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for\npreventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation expectations.\nThe paper argues convincingly that many of these proposals present practical difficulties\nthat would create a very high bar for their adoption. For instance, raising the inflation\ntarget sufficiently to provide meaningfully greater policy space could engender public\ndiscomfort or, at the other extreme, risk unmooring inflation expectations. The transition\nto a notably higher target is likely to be challenging and could heighten uncertainty.\nAs I have noted previously, the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our\nobjective is an important consideration for monetary policy.7 The makeup principle, in\nwhich policy would make up for past misses of the inflation target, is not reflected in\nmost standard monetary policy frameworks, although it is an important precept in\ntheory.8 Some of the proposals that have been advanced to implement this principle\npresent some difficulties. For example, while price-level targeting would be helpful in\nthe aftermath of a recession that puts the economy at the effective lower bound, it could\nrequire tightening into a negative supply shock, which is a very unattractive feature, as\nBernanke points out.9\n7 See Brainard (2017b).\n8 See, for example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) or Reifschneider and Williams (2000).\n9 As Bernanke notes, one way to avoid this feature is to adopt “flexible price-level targeting,” in which\npolicy takes into account resource utilization as well as the deviation of the price level from its target.\nKiley and Roberts (2017) examine a form of flexible price-level targeting—which they refer to as a\n“shadow rate rule”—and find that it performs well.\n\n- 4 -\nBernanke proposes a framework that avoids this undesirable possibility by\nimplementing a temporary price-level targeting framework only in periods where\nconventional policy is constrained by the lower bound. Bernanke’s proposal thus has the\nadvantage of maintaining standard practice in normal times while proposing a makeup\npolicy in periods when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound and inflation is\nbelow target. His proposed temporary price-level target would delay the liftoff of the\npolicy rate from the lower bound until the average inflation over the entire lower bound\nepisode has reached 2 percent and full employment is achieved. This type of policy,\nwhich would result in temporary overshooting of the inflation target in order to make up\nfor the previous period of undershooting, is designed to, in Bernanke’s words, “calibrate\nthe vigor of the policy response . . . to the severity of the episode.”\nThe Normalization Bias\nThe proposed temporary price-level targeting policy is designed to address what I\nsee as one of the key challenges facing policymakers. Following deep recessions of the\ntype we experienced in 2008-09, there appears to be an important premium on\n“normalization.” This was apparent in 2010, for instance, when there was substantial\npressure among Group of Twenty officials to commit to timelines and targets for\nreducing fiscal support and to articulate exit principles for monetary policy.10 This\ninclination proved premature, as was evident from the subsequent intensification of the\neuro-area crisis.\n10 The 2010 G-20 Toronto communiqué indicated that advanced economies “committed to fiscal plans that\nwill at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016.” The\ndocument is available on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website at\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/Documents/The%20G-\n20%20Toronto%20Summit%20Declaration.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nMoreover, the benchmark for “normal” tends to be defined in terms of pre-crisis\nstandards that involved policy settings well away from the lower bound, at least initially,\nbecause it may take some time to learn about important changes in underlying financial\nand economic relationships. For example, the factors underlying what we now\nunderstand to be the new normal of persistently low interest rates were in many cases\ninitially viewed as temporary headwinds. In these circumstances, a standard policy\nframework calibrated around the pre-crisis or “old” normal may be biased to\nunderachieving the inflation target in a low neutral rate environment. The kind of policy\nframework that Bernanke proposes, which pre-commits to implementing the makeup\nprinciple based on the actual observed performance of inflation during a lower bound\nepisode, could guard against premature liftoff and help prevent the erosion of longer-term\ninflation expectations.\nMonetary policymakers operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty\nand therefore have to weigh the risks of tightening too little or too late against those of\ntightening too much or too soon. While past experience has conditioned U.S.\npolicymakers to be highly attentive to the risks associated with a breakout of inflation to\nthe upside, as in the 1970s, they balance these risks against those associated with\nundershooting the inflation target persistently, as in Japan in the late 1990s and the 2000s.\nIn weighing these risks, the standard approach is typically designed to achieve\n“convergence from below,” in which inflation gradually rises to its target. Given the lags\nin the effects of monetary policy, convergence from below would necessitate raising\ninterest rates preemptively, well in advance of inflation reaching its target. Moreover,\nparticularly in the early stage of a recovery, this kind of preemptive approach tends of\n\n- 6 -\nnecessity to rely on economic relationships derived from pre-crisis observations, when\npolicy rates were comfortably above the lower bound.\nDuring a period when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound, Bernanke’s\nproposal would represent a substantial departure from the standard approach. While a\nstandard policy framework would tend to prescribe that tightening should start\npreemptively, well before inflation reaches target, Bernanke’s temporary price-level\ntarget proposal would imply maintaining the policy rate at the lower bound well past the\npoint at which inflation has risen above target. In principle, policymakers would have to\nbe willing to accept elevated rates of above-target inflation for a period following a\nlengthy period of undershooting.\nJust as policymakers could run a risk of low inflation becoming entrenched in the\nstandard preemptive framework, so, too, there are risks in the temporary price-level target\nframework. One risk is that the public, seeing elevated rates of inflation, may start to\ndoubt that the central bank is still serious about its inflation target. It is worth noting that\nthe policy is motivated by the opposite concern--that convergence from below, following\nan extended lower bound episode, may lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations to\nthe downside. Still, a conscious policy of overshooting may be difficult to calibrate,\nespecially since the large confidence intervals around inflation forecasts suggest that the\nrisks of an undesired overshooting are nontrivial. A related risk is that the central bank\nwould lose its nerve: Maintaining the interest rate at zero in the face of a strong economy\nand inflation notably above its target would place a central bank in uncomfortable\nterritory.\n\n- 7 -\nOne additional challenge of the proposed framework is specifying a path for the\npolicy rate immediately following liftoff that smoothly and gradually eases inflation back\ndown to target and facilitates a gradual adjustment of the labor market. In the proposed\nframework, once the cumulative average rate of inflation during the lower-bound period\nhas reached the target of 2 percent, policy would revert to a standard policy rule.11 This\nimplies that a standard policy rule would kick in at a point when inflation is above target\nand the economy is at or beyond full employment. Even with a smoothing (inertial)\nproperty, a standard policy rule could result in a relatively sharp path of tightening, and\nthe anticipation of the steep post-liftoff rate path itself could undo some of the benefits\nassociated with the framework. Thus, there would likely need to be a transitional\nframework to guide policy initially post-liftoff that might make both communications and\npolicy somewhat more complicated.\nIntegrating the Policy Rate and the Balance Sheet\nThe temporary price-level targeting framework proposed by Bernanke is\nappealing on a conceptual level because it proposes a simple and clear mechanism to help\npolicymakers deal with the challenges posed by the lower bound on the policy rate in an\nenvironment of uncertainty. The reality is more complicated, however, especially if, as\nthe paper suggests, many central banks in advanced economies are likely to operate with\nan additional tool when the policy rate is constrained. In the paper, Bernanke cites Chair\nYellen’s 2016 Jackson Hole speech, which suggests that in a recession, the FOMC could\nbe expected to turn to large-scale asset purchases as well as forward guidance after the\nfederal funds rate is lowered to zero.12\n11 In the paper, this rule is specified as an inertial Taylor rule.\n12 See Yellen (2016).\n\n- 8 -\nToday, when many central banks in advanced economies are operating with two\ndistinct tools, policymakers consider the effects of the balance sheet as well as the policy\nrate in their assessment of the extent of accommodation provided by monetary policy. In\nthe United States, from the time tapering was first discussed to the September 2017\nmeeting, when the path for balance sheet runoff was adopted, FOMC minutes and\nstatements suggest that participants considered the degree of accommodation provided by\nboth policy tools in their discussions of the sequencing and timing of changes to policy\nsettings. Discussions about the sequencing of “normalization” and the delay of balance\nsheet runoff “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way”\neffectively consider the extent to which maintaining the balance sheet may continue to\nprovide makeup support for the economy while enabling the policy rate to escape the\nlower bound earlier than otherwise in a low neutral rate environment.\nAs Bernanke acknowledges, now that many central banks have developed\nplaybooks specifying the operational modalities associated with asset purchases, and\nthere is some familiarity with their effects on asset prices and financial conditions, there\nis a greater likelihood that asset purchases would become a part of the policy reaction\nfunction, along with forward guidance, during lower-bound episodes. Yet, as I have\nnoted previously in the international context, asset purchases can complicate policy\nframeworks and communications, because their deployment and withdrawal has tended\nto be discontinuous and discrete and thus may be associated with greater uncertainty\nabout the policy reaction function.13 It appears the public closely follows statements\nabout both the policy rate and asset purchases to glean possible information about the\n13 See Brainard (2015).\n\n- 9 -\nfuture overall stance of monetary policy. This suggests there may be benefits in\ncommunications and predictability of a unified policy framework across the tools that is\nmore predictable and continuous. Relatedly, one helpful elaboration of the framework\nBernanke proposes might be to incorporate a unified measure, or shadow rate, that would\ncapture the degree of policy accommodation provided through the combined settings of\nboth asset purchases and the policy rate.14\nGreater Cross-Border Spillovers\nMoving away from the policy proposal in the paper, there are two other aspects of\na low neutral rate world that I want to touch on briefly: cross-border spillovers and\nfinancial imbalances. The new normal appears to be characterized by low neutral rates\nand a weak relationship between overall inflation and unemployment not only in the\nUnited States, but also in many other advanced economies with lower-bound episodes\nlikely to be more prevalent. The current environment appears also to evidence intensified\ncross-border feedback into financial conditions.15 In this kind of environment, it is\nconceivable the kind of committed forward guidance associated with the temporary price-\nlevel targeting framework proposed by Bernanke, by helping rule out anticipation of a\nstandard preemptive tightening, could help avoid unwarranted premature tightening\nthrough the exchange rate.\nGiven available data, it is difficult to disentangle whether the heightened cross-\nborder feedback effects are attributable to the low level of neutral rates, particular\nfeatures of today’s lower-bound episodes, or the interaction of the policies adopted by\nmany central banks. In any case, recent Federal Reserve staff analysis suggests that\n14 See, for instance, Krippner (2016) and Wu and Xia (2016).\n15 See Brainard (2016a, 2016b).\n\n- 10 -\ncross-border spillovers have increased notably since the crisis and are quite large. For\ninstance, European Central Bank policy news that leads to a 10 basis point decrease in the\nGerman 10-year term premium is associated with a roughly 5 basis point decrease in the\nU.S. 10-year term premium; by contrast, these spillovers were smaller in the years\nleading up to the crisis.16\nMoreover, news about policy rates and term premiums appears to have quite\ndifferent effects on exchange rates, such that the ordering of policy normalization can\nhave important implications for exchange rates and associated financial conditions, as I\ndiscussed earlier this year.17 Recent staff estimates suggest that news about expected\nchanges in the policy rate tends to have a large spillover through the exchange rate,\nwhereas news about changes in term premiums tends to lead to corresponding cross-\nborder changes in term premiums, as discussed previously, with much smaller effects on\nthe exchange rate. Moreover, the exchange rate effect of changes in short-term rates is\nmuch greater than it was pre-crisis. For instance, policy news that leads to a 25 basis\npoint increase in the expected interest rate portion of the 10-year Treasury yield is\nassociated with a roughly 3 percentage point appreciation in the dollar, which is three\ntimes greater than the response pre-crisis. By contrast, policy news surrounding a change\nin U.S. term premiums has a muted effect on the exchange rate both now and pre-crisis.\nFinancial Imbalances\nFinally, a low neutral rate environment may also be associated with a heightened\nrisk of asset price bubbles, which could exacerbate the tradeoff for monetary policy\nbetween achieving the traditional dual-mandate goals and preventing the kinds of\n16 See Kamin, Li, and Rodriguez (forthcoming).\n17 See Brainard (2017a).\n\n- 11 -\nimbalances that could contribute to financial instability. Standard asset-valuation models\nsuggest that a persistently low neutral rate, depending on the factors driving it, could lead\nto higher ratios of asset prices to underlying income flows--for example, higher ratios of\nprices to earnings for stocks or higher prices of buildings relative to rents. If asset\nmarkets were highly efficient and participants had excellent foresight, this would not\nnecessarily lead to imbalances. However, to the extent that financial markets extrapolate\nprice movements, markets may not transition smoothly to asset valuations that reflect\nunderlying fundamentals but may instead evidence periods of overshooting.18 Such\nforces may have played a role in both the stock market boom that ended in the bust of\n2001 and the house price bubble that burst in 2007-09.\nThe risks of such financial imbalances may be greater in the context of the kind of\nexplicit inflation target overshooting policies proposed in the paper. Again, if market\nparticipants were perfectly rational, overshooting policies would not likely pose financial\nstability risks. But the combination of low interest rates and low unemployment that\nwould prevail during the inflation overshooting period could well spark capital markets to\noverextend, leading to financial imbalances.\nMacroprudential tools are the preferred first line of defense to address such\nfinancial imbalances, which should in principle enable monetary policy to focus on price\nstability and macroeconomic stabilization. But the development and deployment of\nmacroprudential tools is still relatively untested in the U.S. context, and the toolkit is\nlimited.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:30 p.m. EDT\nOctober 12, 2015\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“North America’s Place in a Changing World Economy”\n57th National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 12, 2015\n\nThe will-they-or-won’t-they drumbeat has grown louder of late. To remove the\nsuspense, I do not intend to make any calendar-based statements here today. Rather, I\nwould like to give you a sense of the considerations that weigh on both sides of that\ndebate and lay out the case for watching and waiting.1\nThe Outlook\nDomestic real activity has proven reassuringly resilient. Most notably, the labor\nmarket has continued to improve this year, pushing the economy closer to full\nemployment. While monthly nonfarm payroll employment growth looks to have slowed\nover the past three months to a 167,000 monthly pace, so far this year it has averaged\nabout 200,000. With these gains more than sufficient to absorb trend growth in the labor\nforce, they have led to gradual increases in resource utilization. At 5.1 percent in\nSeptember, the unemployment rate has declined ½ percentage point since December.\nAlternative broader gauges of unemployment--which include individuals who are\nmarginally attached to the labor force and employees working part-time for economic\nreasons--have also shown steady improvement this year.\nEven so, a variety of evidence suggests there may be some distance to go to\nachieve full employment. Although the unemployment rate is near longer-run norms,\nother measures of labor utilization are not. The labor force participation rate remains\nmaterially below the pre-recession trend, even after adjusting for demographics.2 And\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Much of the decline in recent years is due to the aging of the baby boom cohort. But even holding\ndemographics constant, the participation rate is considerably lower now than before the recession,\nsuggesting it is cyclically depressed. Aaronson and others (2014) find that demographics can explain only\nabout half of the decline in the participation rate since the end of 2007.\nThus, it may be a while further before the participation rate fully reacts to the full amount of\nimprovement in labor market conditions that we have seen thus far, since wage growth has remained low,\n\n- 2 -\nthe share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains a full percentage\npoint above the pre-recession level of around 3 percent, despite considerable recent\nimprovement. Even if there has been some trend increase in part-time work, it seems\nunlikely to account for all of the difference between current levels and pre-recession\nlevels.3\nPerhaps the most striking evidence in support of continued labor market slack is\nthe absence of any acceleration in wages and prices. Our main gauges of wage inflation\nsuggest that labor compensation is increasing at a pace of about 2 to 2-1/4 percent, little\ndifferent from the rate of increase over the past several years. Indeed, the lack of wage\nacceleration is likely one of the key reasons that many Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) participants have revised down their estimates of the longer-run level of the\nunemployment rate. Most recently, a majority of participants moved their estimates\nbelow 5 percent.4 By comparison, in September 2012, the central tendency of estimates\nof the longer-run unemployment rate ranged from 5.2 to 6.0 percent.\nMore broadly, domestic real activity appears likely to continue to grow at a\nmoderate pace. Domestic final sales, which exclude net exports and the volatile category\nof inventory investment, increased at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the first half of\nand the decision to participate in the labor force may respond with a lag to cyclical improvements. See\nAaronson and others (2014) and Erceg and Levin (2014).\n3 Changes in the structure of labor demand, such as a shift toward occupations or industries characterized\nby flexible and part-time hours, may have led to an increase in the equilibrium level of part-time work. For\nmore on this issue, see Cajner and others (2014) and Valletta and van der List (2015). If workers combine\ntwo or more part-time jobs to arrive at a full-time workweek, part-time employment could be elevated with\naverage weekly hours at normal levels. But the logistical costs of multiple job holding make such an\noutcome unlikely, and in recent years elevated part-time employment has not coincided with an increase in\nofficial estimates of multiple job holding.\n4 See “Figure 3.B, Distribution of Participants’ Projections for the Unemployment Rate, 2015-18 and over\nthe Longer Run,” in the Summary of Economic Projections, addendum to the minutes of the September\n2015 FOMC meeting, released on October 8, 2015, and available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150917.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nthe year, and recent indicators suggest a similar pace in the second half. Perhaps most\nnotable, personal consumption expenditures are estimated to have increased at an annual\nrate of a little over 3 percent in the three months ending in August, and auto sales moved\nup to a strong 18.1 million unit annualized pace in September. Thus, even though equity\nprices are down this year, continued job growth, lower gas prices, rising house prices and\nsome loosening in consumer credit look likely to support consumer spending over the\nsecond half of the year.\nMoreover, domestic investment also looks to be increasing at a moderate pace\ndespite the drag from the energy sector. New orders and shipments of nondefense capital\ngoods have turned up recently, pointing to positive equipment investment going forward,\nand investment in nonresidential buildings looks to have risen noticeably in the middle of\nthe year. While investment in energy-related structures will likely move lower over the\nsecond half of the year in response to the most recent step-down in oil prices, the decline\nshould be smaller than the sharp decline in the first half.\nImportantly, recent data suggest that the gradual recovery in housing continues.\nSingle-family building permits were close to an annual rate of 700,000 units in August,\nup nearly 5 percent from the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement in single-\nfamily housing is welcome after having been somewhat slow to materialize. Even so,\ncurrent levels remain below what would be suggested by fundamentals, such as\npopulation growth.\nWhile private consumption and investment thus appear to be on reassuringly solid\ntrajectories, growth in government expenditures on goods and services is likely to remain\ntepid. Combined purchases at the federal, state, and local levels rose at an annual rate of\n\n- 4 -\nonly 1-1/4 percent in the first half of the year, and modest growth in revenue at the state\nand local level suggest continued limited gains going forward. In addition, spending\nrestrictions in the Budget Control Act and the winding down of defense spending related\nto Afghanistan and Iraq have led to restraint at the federal level, although there is some\nuncertainty on the federal budget outlook.\nIn contrast to the considerable progress in the labor market, progress on the\nsecond leg of our dual mandate has been elusive. To be clear, I do not view the\nimprovement in the labor market as a sufficient statistic for judging the outlook for\ninflation. A variety of econometric estimates would suggest that the classic Phillips\ncurve influence of resource utilization on inflation is, at best, very weak at the moment.\nThe fact that wages have not accelerated is significant, but more so as an indicator that\nlabor market slack is still present and that workers’ bargaining power likely remains\nweak.\nOverall inflation has been subdued, running persistently below our 2 percent\ntarget. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased only 0.3\npercent over the 12 months ending in August. Much of the weakness in this index can be\nexplained by the drop in oil and energy prices over the past year. Assuming energy\nprices stabilize going forward, as futures markets suggest, then energy should be a neutral\nor perhaps even a small positive influence on inflation next year.\nBut inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy prices. Over the 12\nmonths ending in August, core PCE prices, which exclude the often volatile categories of\nfood and energy, increased 1.3 percent, and the 12-month change in core prices has been\naround 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since the beginning of 2013.\n\n- 5 -\nThe persistence of the weakness in core price inflation deserves attention. For the\npost-recession period as a whole, low levels of resource utilization surely accounted for a\nsubstantial part of the weakness. But resource utilization has increased dramatically\nsince 2009, and core price inflation has remained quite low.\nA sizable decline in import prices over the past year has also contributed. As a\nresult of the sharp increase in the dollar over the past year or so, prices for non-oil\nimports fell at an annual rate of a little over 4 percent in the first half of the year and look\nto decline a further 2 percent at an annual rate over the second half. Estimates suggest\nthe dollar’s rise will hold down core inflation between 1/4 and 1/2 percentage point this\nyear, restraint that would wane if the dollar stabilized going forward.\nHowever, recent weakness is not completely explained by import prices. Services\nprices excluding energy, which are generally relatively little affected by changes in the\ndollar, have also shown no sign of acceleration in recent years. Instead, inflation in this\ncategory has moved lower over the past year. In August, the 12-month change in non-\nenergy services prices was 2 percent, 1/4 percentage point lower than the pace of increase\nfrom 2012 through the middle of 2014.\nThe outlook for inflation is critical for purposes of assessing progress toward our\n2 percent goal, since monetary policy operates with a lag. In this regard, the gravitational\nforce of long-term inflation expectations is critically important. Although the story on\nthis front is mostly reassuring, it warrants monitoring. Projections from the Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters suggest that longer-run inflation expectations--which appear to\nbe most relevant for predicting future inflation--have remained at 2 percent since the end\nof 2012. Household surveys, such as University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers,\n\n- 6 -\nsuggest that households’ longer-run inflation expectations have remained in a narrow\nrange throughout the crisis and the recovery, although they have stayed in the lower end\nof that range over the past year. In contrast, market-based measures of inflation\ncompensation, such as inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflation-\nindexed Treasury bond yields, have declined noticeably over the past year and a half at\nlonger-term horizons. Of course, factors other than inflation expectations, such as\nchanges in liquidity premiums and inflation risk premiums, may be at play.\nAlthough the balance of evidence thus suggests that long-term inflation\nexpectations are likely to have remained fairly steady, the risks to the near-term outlook\nfor inflation appear to be tilted to the downside, given the persistently low level of core\ninflation and the recent decline in longer-run inflation compensation, as well as the\ndeflationary cross currents emanating from abroad--a subject to which I now turn.\nOver the past 15 months, U.S. monetary policy deliberations have been taking\nplace against a backdrop of progressively gloomier projections of global demand. The\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) has marked down 2015 emerging market and world\ngrowth repeatedly since April 2014.\nIn the second half of 2014, persistently weak aggregate demand in Japan and the\nEuro Area led to heightened deflationary pressures. The policy response to these\npressures and the anticipated divergence between the policy trajectory in these economies\nand the United States contributed to a 10 percent appreciation in the dollar in inflation-\nadjusted terms through the spring of this year, pushing down net exports and restraining\nactivity in the United States. Net exports subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from the\n\n- 7 -\nannual rate of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first part of the year, and\nthe most recent trade data suggest another substantial subtraction in the third quarter.\nMore recently, weakness in foreign demand has extended to emerging market\neconomies, which now account for about half of world output and have been an\nimportant source of growth for more than the past decade. Growing recognition of this\nweakness pushed the dollar up further to 15 percent above its level last summer, and has\ncontributed to a more general tightening of financial conditions in the past few months.\nMuch of the focus has been on China, whose large size and double-digit growth\nrate put it at the center of a powerful global commodity super-cycle over the past decade.\nConsequently, the challenges China faces today are raising questions about emerging\nmarket growth prospects more broadly. Most immediately, China’s buildup of past\nproperty, and more-recent stock market, bubbles together with a steep run-up in business\ndebt levels and questions about the policy stance and the outlook have raised concerns\nabout downside risks.\nIn weighing the implications for the U.S. outlook, it would be misleading to focus\nnarrowly on the direct effect of U.S.-Chinese bilateral trade alone. Many commodity-\nexporting countries that have depended heavily on Chinese demand are adjusting with\ndifficulty to the recent sharp commodity price declines. After increasing at an average\nrate of nearly 5-1/2 percent over the period from 2003 through 2011, GDP growth in\nemerging market commodity exporters is projected to be only 3-1/2 percent this year.\nProjected growth going forward has also been marked down materially. Moreover, more\ndeveloped economies, such as Mexico and Canada, our most important trading partners,\n\n- 8 -\nhave also been affected, with Canadian GDP declining in the first two quarters of the\nyear.5\nIn addition, many non-commodity-producing East Asian economies are closely\ntied to China through trade and investment. Because of these ties, and for other\nidiosyncratic reasons, growth in East Asian economies has been weak so far this year.\nGrowth in emerging Asia economies outside of China that are important destinations of\nU.S. exports slipped to 2-1/2 percent in the first half of the year, well below a trend rate\nof close to 5 percent.\nDowngrades to foreign growth affect the U.S. outlook through several channels.\nFirst, weak growth abroad reduces demand for U.S. exports. Second, the expected\ndivergence in U.S. growth increases demand for U.S. assets, putting upward pressure on\nthe dollar, which, in turn, weighs on net exports. The estimated effect of dollar\nappreciation on net exports has been shown to be substantial and to persist for several\nyears.6 Weak demand weighs on global commodity prices, which, together with the\neffects on the dollar, restrains U.S. inflation. Finally, the anticipation of weaker global\ngrowth can make market participants more attuned to downside risks, which can reduce\nprices for risky assets, both abroad and in the United States--as we saw in late August--\nwith attendant effects on consumption and investment.\n5 For more detail on the recent experiences and likely prospects of commodity exporters, see “Where Are\nCommodity Exporters Headed? Output Growth in the Aftermath of the Commodity Boom,” chapter 2 of\nthe International Monetary Fund’s (IMF, 2015) World Economic Outlook, available at\nwww.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/pdf/c2.pdf.\n6 Looking across a broad set of countries, the IMF (2015) estimates that a 10 percent appreciation in the\nreal exchange rate will cause an eventual 1.5 percentage point reduction in the contribution of net exports\nto real GDP, with effects lasting for several years (see chapter 3, “Exchange Rates and Trade Flows:\nDisconnected?” available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/pdf/c3.pdf).\n\n- 9 -\nOver the past year, a feedback loop has transmitted market expectations of policy\ndivergence between the United States and our major trade partners into financial\ntightening in the U.S. through exchange rate and financial market channels. Thus, even\nas liftoff is coming into clearer view ahead, by some estimates, the substantial financial\ntightening that has already taken place has been comparable in its effect to the equivalent\nof a couple of rate increases.\nLooking ahead, one of the biggest sources of known uncertainty to the U.S.\noutlook is whether this foreign weakness fades or intensifies. A plausible baseline\nscenario might include a soft landing in China and growth in other emerging markets\nmoving gradually back up to underlying trends. Of course, it is possible that a recovery\nin emerging market growth occurs sooner than in the baseline, such that the U.S economy\nmoves modestly more quickly toward our goals.\nHowever, demand in emerging markets could also fall short of such a baseline.\nChina is only part-way through challenging economic adjustments and financial market\nreforms, including reform of its exchange rate regime, debt deleveraging, and rebalancing\nof its economy toward more consumer-driven growth. During this process, market\nparticipants may have less accuracy in forecasting developments in China relative to\nmany other major economies due to less clarity regarding the macroeconomic data and\nthe policy framework. A more negative assessment of underlying Chinese growth\nfundamentals or its exchange rate regime would likely affect other important economies\nin the region, as well as commodity-producing economies, pushing global demand down\nfurther. In turn, expectations of additional weakness in global demand could have\n\n- 10 -\nimportant effects on the exchange rate of the dollar, the valuation of risky assets in the\nUnited States, and U.S. inflation, moving the economy further from our goals.\nPolicy Considerations\nThere is a risk that the intensification of international cross currents could weigh\nmore heavily on U.S. demand directly, or that the anticipation of a sharper divergence in\nU.S. policy could impose restraint through additional tightening of financial conditions.\nFor these reasons, I view the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the downside. The\ndownside risks make a strong case for continuing to carefully nurture the U.S. recovery--\nand argue against prematurely taking away the support that has been so critical to its\nvitality.\nThese risks matter more than usual because the ability to provide additional\naccommodation if downside risks materialize is, in practice, more constrained than the\nability to remove accommodation more rapidly if upside risks materialize. The\nasymmetry in risk management stems from the combination of the likely low current\nlevel of the neutral real interest rate and the effective lower bound. Let me take each in\nturn.\nFirst, casual empiricism would suggest that we are experiencing a period of\nunusually low rates not only in the United States but also at the global level. Ten-year\nsovereign bond yields in G-7 economies excluding Japan currently range from just above\n1/2 percent to just above 2 percent--well below the average range of 4 1/2 to 5 percent in\n\n- 11 -\nthe decade before the financial crisis.7 This observation receives substantial support from\na number of rigorous empirical papers over the past year that have estimated the longer-\nrun equilibrium federal funds rate to be lower now than previously.8 The projection of a\nrelatively low neutral rate over the next few years also receives some weight in the\nSeptember 2015 Summary of Economic Projections. Most FOMC participants lowered\ntheir estimate of the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate in the long run, and\na majority of participants now forecast a level no higher than 3.62 percent--down from\n4.12 percent in September 2012.9 A lower equilibrium funds rate implies a higher\nprobability of policy being constrained by a lower bound for nominal interest rates.\nSecond, the ability of policymakers to react to unexpected shocks using\nconventional tools remains highly asymmetric in the neighborhood of an effective lower\nbound. From the perspective of risk management, in today’s circumstances, we have\nconsiderably greater latitude to adjust the path of policy in response to inflation that\nexceeds current forecasts than we have to provide additional accommodation in response\nto additional adverse shocks.\nConsider two possible scenarios. First, many observers have suggested that the\neconomy will soon begin to strain available resources without some monetary tightening.\n7 In Japan, the level is currently around 0.3 percent, down from an average of 1.5 percent in the decade\nbefore the crisis.\n8 Building on the work of Laubach and Williams (2003), both Hamilton, Harris, Hatzius, and West (2015)\nand Kiley (2015), for example, have recently constructed alternative estimates of the longer-run\nequilibrium federal funds rate. While these papers differ in their estimates and acknowledge a considerable\namount of uncertainty, they all weigh in on the side of a relatively low equilibrium federal funds rate over\nthe next few years.\n9 See “Figure 3.E, Distribution of Participants’ Judgments of the Midpoint of the Appropriate Target Range\nfor the Federal Funds Rate or the Appropriate Target Level for the Federal Funds Rate, 2015-18 and over\nthe Longer Run,” in the Summary of Economic Projections, addendum to the minutes of the September\n2015 FOMC meeting, released October 8, 2015,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20150917.pdf .\n\n- 12 -\nBecause monetary policy acts with a lag, in this scenario, high rates of resource\nutilization may lead to a large buildup of inflationary pressures, a rise in inflation\nexpectations and persistent inflation in excess of our 2 percent target. However, we have\nwell-tested tools to address such a situation and plenty of policy room in which to use\nthem. Moreover, the persistently deflationary international environment, the gradual\npace of increases in U.S. resource utilization, the estimated small effect of resource\nutilization on inflation, the likely low level of neutral interest rates, and the persistence of\ninflation below our 2 percent target suggests this risk remains modest. Financial markets\nappear to agree, as five-year inflation compensation is well below 2 percent.\nNow, take the alternative risk: that the underlying momentum of the domestic\neconomy is not strong enough to resist the deflationary pull of the international\nenvironment. A further step-down in global demand growth and a further strengthening\nin the dollar could increase the already sizable negative effect of the global environment\non U.S. demand, pushing U.S. growth back to, or below, potential. Progress toward full\nemployment and 2 percent inflation would stall or reverse. With limited ability to ease\npolicy, it would be more difficult to move the economy back on track.\nIndeed, many central banks in advanced economies have tightened policy since\nthe financial crisis, prompted by improving domestic activity. In these cases, the\ntightening was reversed as the outlook evolved. Given the current uncertainty, we should\nput some weight on the risk of following this pattern. Indeed, market participants put the\nprobability of returning to the zero lower bound within two years of liftoff at 20 percent.10\n10 See the July 2015 “Responses to Survey of Market Participants,” from the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, available at http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey/2015/mp-July-result.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nTo be fair, the past few years have demonstrated the capacity and will of central\nbanks in many jurisdictions to deploy unconventional monetary policy tools, including\nquantitative and credit easing, forward guidance, and negative rates. That said, resorting\nto such tools is not without costs and uncertainties.\nWe should not take the continued strength of domestic demand growth for\ngranted. Although the outlook for domestic demand is good, global forces are weighing\non net exports and inflation, and the risks from abroad appear tilted to the downside. Our\neconomy has made good progress toward full employment, but sluggish wage growth\nsuggests there is some room to go, and inflation has remained persistently below our\ntarget. With equilibrium real interest rates likely to remain low for some time and policy\noptions that are more limited if conditions deteriorate than if they accelerate, risk-\nmanagement considerations counsel a stance of waiting to see if the risks to the outlook\ndiminish.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity\n(Fall), pp. 197-275, www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/fall-\n2014/fall2014bpea_aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nCajner, Tomaz, Dennis Mawhirter, Christopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014).\n“Why Is Involuntary Part-Time Work Elevated?” FEDS Notes.

I am happy to have an opportunity to learn from your extensive\nexperience and expertise.1\nAt the Federal Reserve, we value the CRA as a critical tool for providing support to low-\nand moderate income (LMI) families and their communities. And we are interested in\nstrengthening the CRA as it encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities\nthey are chartered to serve. Today’s research forum is one part of an extensive outreach effort\nwe are undertaking to gather the best ideas for improving implementation of the Community\nReinvestment Act.\nOver the past four months alone, all 12 of our Reserve Banks have hosted roundtables in\nlocations around the country, from San Francisco to Boston, and from Rapid City to Puerto Rico.\nThe purpose is to hear ideas on improving the CRA regulations from the bankers and community\ngroups that have a stake in the CRA’s success. In addition, we held two roundtables at the\nFederal Reserve Board earlier this week to gather perspectives from national organizations\nfocused on policy topics, such as housing, small business lending, and consumer credit.2\nWe have also consulted with our advisory councils to gather their thoughts on CRA\nreform. We have asked our large and community bank advisory councils, the Federal Advisory\nCouncil and the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, about their experiences\nwith the CRA and suggestions for improvements. We have also sought community perspectives.\n1 I am grateful to Amanda Roberts for assistance in preparing these remarks. These remarks represent my own\nviews, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n2 A summary of the findings will be made public in the spring.\n\n- 2 -\nAt our most recent meeting with our Community Advisory Council, we asked for their\nrecommendations for reform.3\nEven though we decided not to join the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the\npublication of its August 2018 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning revisions to\nthe CRA regulations, we have been reviewing the approximately 1,500 comment letters\nsubmitted by academics, banks and banking trade associations, community and consumer\ngroups, and citizens.\nSo what have we learned so far from the comment letters we have reviewed and the\nroundtables we have held? If there is one common thread, it is that support for the Community\nReinvestment Act is broad and deep. Commenters across the board applauded the significant\nvolume of CRA loans and investments that have supported LMI households and communities, as\nwell as the benefits households and communities have realized from the CRA’s focus on local\nretail financial services, small business lending, and community development lending,\ninvestments, and services. And they asked that the three banking agencies work together toward\na joint rulemaking proposal so that CRA policies can be clearly and consistently applied across\nagencies.\nSecond, there are some good ideas about how to modernize the procedures for setting the\narea in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA activities while retaining the core focus on\nplace. This is not a simple challenge, and this morning’s panel identified some promising\nsolutions to the challenge of modernizing the definition of assessment areas to keep up with\nchanges in banks’ business models. I appreciated the panelists’ insights on how to balance the\n3 A summary of the response is available on our public website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/cac-20181005.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nimportance of place with various business models, including to reflect the extensive use of\ndigital channels and other changes in the banking industry. The public comments we have read\nso far suggest general agreement that there is a need for an update--but not a complete overhaul--\nof assessment areas through a balanced package of reforms. We have heard general support for\nassessment areas that reflect each bank’s business model, recognizing that branch-based\nassessment areas work for many banks but that additional or different assessment areas may be\nappropriate for others.\nThird, we have received helpful input on tailoring CRA regulations to banks of different\nsizes and business models. Many of the comments we reviewed expressed support for retaining\ndifferent performance tests for different types of banks, including the strategic plan option. We\nalso heard this at the regional roundtables, where banker participants ranged from small\ncommunity banks to large internet-only banks. It was clear that CRA regulations cannot be one-\nsize-fits-all.\nFourth, we have heard some good suggestions for ensuring that any modernization of\nassessment areas should keep in focus the goal of encouraging banks to seek out opportunities in\nunderserved areas, including in this morning’s panel on assessment areas. The concern about\nCRA hotspots and credit deserts was echoed in the comment letters, and several commenters\noffered helpful suggestions for addressing this problem going forward. And the need to create\nincentives for CRA capital to reach underserved communities was a theme we heard in our\nregional roundtables from both bankers and community groups.\nFifth, we have received many suggestions about how to increase the consistency and\npredictability of CRA evaluations and ratings. Although we are still in the process of working\nthrough the public’s comments, those we have read so far suggest general support for the view\n\n- 4 -\nthat the CRA regulations and examinations would benefit from more clarity, consistency, and\npredictability. Likewise, there is an openness to expanding the use of metrics that evaluate\ncomponents of a bank’s activity on an assessment area level, while recognizing the importance\nof also leveraging performance context information, including of a qualitative nature, so that\nbankers and examiners are able to identify and understand local community needs. The first\npanel this morning on metrics and evaluating performance also helped further our understanding\nin this area, with particular focus on the investment behaviors of CRA-motivated banks and on\nhow we might strengthen the CRA to better evaluate a bank’s performance in meeting the credit\nneeds of its communities.\nSixth, in both comment letters and roundtables, community and consumer groups\nemphasized the historical context of the CRA as it relates to redlining practices. To that end,\nthey strongly supported the CRA retaining a proactive focus on reaching all underserved\nborrowers, including low-income communities and communities of color. The central thrust of\nthe CRA is to encourage banks to ensure that all creditworthy borrowers have fair access to\ncredit, and, to do so successfully, it has long been recognized that they must guard against\ndiscriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices.\nThis has been an excellent convening so far, and I want to thank you for sharing your\nknowledge and insights with us. The Federal Reserve is a research-driven institution, and we\nwant to be sure that we are aware of all the latest research on the effectiveness of the CRA and\nwhat the research has to say about potential regulatory improvements. Today’s conversation is\nan opportunity not only to hear from external academic researchers, but also to have a robust\nconversation with practitioners about how this research might inform the Board’s work. This\n\n- 5 -\nafternoon, I look forward to hearing the conversation on the effectiveness of the CRA, past,\npresent, and future.\nI have had opportunities to hear directly from stakeholders in a variety of settings,\nkicking off with a community development visit in Baltimore last April and most recently in\nDenver, at our first regional roundtable.4 The Denver roundtable was attended by state member\nbanks and was hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. I appreciated the robust\nconversation among knowledgeable individuals whose work touches on the CRA every day.\nSitting around a table together provided an opportunity for me to hear community bankers reflect\non what has worked well for their communities and what they see as challenges, and to provide\nthoughtful suggestions on what they think might work best going forward. It was also helpful to\nbe exposed to some differences of views. The best approach to implementing the CRA in\ntoday’s environment is a complex issue, so I value hearing a wide range of suggestions.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate my own commitment to strengthening the CRA, which is\nwidely shared across the Federal Reserve System. We aim to promote more CRA activity, not\nless. We think that simplifying and clarifying the regulations while strengthening local\ncommunity engagement will help us accomplish that goal. Thank you for your help in this\nprocess.\n4 See Lael Brainard, “Community Development in Baltimore and A Few Observations on Community Reinvestment\nAct Modernization” (speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Baltimore Community Development\nGathering, April 17, 2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180417a.htm; and\n“Community Investment in Denver” (speech at the Denver Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\nOctober 15, 2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180417a.htm.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nMay 10, 2019\nIs the Middle Class within Reach for Middle-Income Families?\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Renewing the Promise of the Middle Class”\n2019 Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 10, 2019\n\nIt is good to be here at the Federal Reserve System’s Community Development\nResearch Conference. This year, our conference is focusing on renewing the promise of\nthe middle class, a topic that goes to the heart of the American dream and underpins the\nvibrancy of our democracy and society.1\nWhat Does It Mean to Be Part of the Middle Class?\nBefore I dig into the data, I want to touch on what it means to be a part of the\nmiddle class, recognizing aspirations differ from person to person. From a purely\neconomic perspective, being middle class commonly means having financial security and\nthe ability to invest for our futures and for our children. In turn, having a strong middle\nclass implies that families with average incomes have the purchasing power to consume\nand the savings to invest. So a strong middle class is often seen as a cornerstone of a\nvibrant economy and, beyond that, a resilient democracy.2\nIn recent years, households at the middle of the income distribution have faced a\nnumber of challenges. That raises the question of whether middle-class living standards\nare within reach for middle-income Americans in today’s economy.\n1\nI am grateful to Claudia Sahm of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing this text,\nalong with Barbara Lipman, Kevin Moore, Karen Pence, Paul Smith, and Mike Zabek. The views\nexpressed are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\n2 Take, for example, this statement attributed to Aristotle: “The best political community is formed by\ncitizens of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be well-administered in which the middle\nclass is large, and stronger if possible than both the other classes.” See Constitutional Rights Foundation\n(2010), “Plato and Aristotle on Tyranny and the Rule of Law,” Bill of Rights in Action, vol. 26 (Fall),\nhttp://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-26-1-plato-and-aristotle-on-tyranny-and-the-rule-of-\nlaw.html (quoted text under the heading “Aristotle’s Politics”).\n\n- 2 -\nThere are a number of ways to define middle income. I will primarily focus on\nhouseholds between the 40th and 70th percentiles of the income distribution. In 2018,\nthese households had incomes between $40,000 and $85,000.3\nTo explore the issues associated with financial resilience and intergenerational\nfinancial well-being, it is necessary to go beyond measures of income and better\nunderstand household assets and liabilities.\nToday I will share with you findings from a promising new data resource\ndeveloped by Federal Reserve staff, the Distributional Financial Accounts (DFAs).\nThese accounts combine household-level data on balance sheets, incomes, and\ndemographic characteristics of families in the United States from the triennial Survey of\nConsumer Finances (SCF) with aggregate data from the Financial Accounts of the United\nStates to track the distribution of these household assets and liabilities on a quarterly\nbasis.4 The timeliness of the data, which are currently available through the fourth\nquarter of 2018, can provide valuable insights into how different types of households are\nfaring over the business cycle.\nI will also share some new results from the 2018 Survey of Household Economics\nand Decisionmaking (SHED), which deliver further insights on the financial resilience of\n3 This definition errs slightly on the higher side of what might be considered middle income, but the results\nare qualitatively robust to taking the middle third of the income distribution.\n4 For more details on the construction of the DFAs, see Michael Batty, Jesse Bricker, Joseph Briggs,\nElizabeth Holmquist, Susan McIntosh, Kevin Moore, Eric Nielsen, Sarah Reber, Molly Shatto, Kamila\nSommer, Tom Sweeney, and Alice Henriques Volz (2019), “Introducing the Distributional Financial\nAccounts of the United States,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2019-017 (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.017. The\npublicly available DFAs data can be found on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/efa/efa-distributional-financial-accounts.htm. Visualization tools\nfor the data are forthcoming.\n\n- 3 -\nhouseholds, particularly those with low and moderate income, on an annual basis.5 These\nresults are slated for release soon.\nWealth across Households\nLet us start by taking a look at how the wealth of middle-income households has\nevolved over recent years.6 Over the past three decades, the wealth of middle-income\nhouseholds increased an average of about 1 percent per year, adjusted for inflation (figure\n1).7 That compares with average annual growth of 2.6 percent in real gross domestic\nincome over this period. By comparison, the average wealth of the households in the top\ndecile of the income distribution has increased three times faster per year, on average,\nthan the wealth of middle-income households, more than doubling over the period as a\nwhole.\nThe past decade is even more sobering. Middle-income families still have not\nfully recovered the wealth they lost in the Great Recession. On average, households at all\nlevels of income lost wealth as a result of the declines in asset prices and rise in\nunemployment during the crisis (figure 2). But the recovery in wealth since the Great\nRecession has been much less for middle- and lower-income households than for higher-\nincome households. The wealth of the top 10 percent of households is 19 percent higher\n5 The SHED is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm.\n6 The published data set includes data on the distribution of nominal wealth by wealth percentiles. For this\nspeech, Board staff analyzed the data, with the wealth distribution by income percentiles and other\ndemographic categories. Wealth and all of its subcomponents are reported here in 2018 dollars using the\npersonal consumption expenditures price index from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (see table 1.1.4,\nwhich is available at https://www.bea.gov). Wealth is defined as the sum of assets, including financial and\nnonfinancial assets, net of liabilities, including mortgages, consumer debt, and other liabilities.\n7 Income groups at each point in time are defined here using current household income. Specific\nhouseholds may move across income groups over time. Since households in the high-income group during\ntheir working years may, in retirement, move to low- or middle-income groups, some of the wealth\nassigned to low- or middle-income groups in this analysis comes from households with high lifetime\nincome.\n\n- 4 -\nthan before the recession, even after factoring in the decline in stock prices at the end of\nlast year. In contrast, the wealth of middle-income families still has not returned to its\npre-crisis level, and lower-income families have a wealth shortfall of 16 percent.8\nThe gap is also large in absolute terms. At the end of 2018, the average middle-\nincome household had wealth of about $340,000, while the average households in the top\n10 percent of the income distribution had wealth of about $4.5 million (figure 3). The\naverage wealth of the top income decile is now 13 times higher than that of the middle-\nincome group, while it was 7 times higher in 1989.\nGiven these developments, it is no surprise that the share of wealth held by\nmiddle-income households has declined over the past three decades. However, the extent\nof the decline is nonetheless striking: Today the 30 percent of households between the\n40th and 70th percentiles of the income distribution hold 13 percent of all wealth, down\nfrom 19 percent over the past three decades (figure 4). The top 10 percent of households\nby income now own 57 percent of all wealth—up from 47 percent 30 years ago. The 10\npercent of households with the highest income hold more of the national wealth than the\nremaining 90 percent of households combined.\nDo Middle-Income Households Have Middle-Class Economic Security?\nHaving sketched out the contours of the overall level and growth of wealth owned\nby middle-income households, let us now turn to economic security. Basic financial\nsecurity is one important marker of the middle class. Wealth is an important source of\neconomic resilience for households, allowing them to handle unexpected expenses as\n8 Wealth in figure 2 is indexed to the first quarter of 2007, which is between the peak in house prices in\n2006 and the start of the Great Recession at the end of 2007. As figure 2 shows, household wealth began\ndeclining before the recession officially began.\n\n- 5 -\nwell as providing them with the financial security to manage the usual changes in income\nover a lifetime. When we dig into the various liquid savings, assets, and liabilities that\nunderlie the overall wealth numbers for middle-income households, the picture suggests\nlimited room to absorb volatility in cash flows. Many middle-income families have\nrelatively little in easily accessible, or liquid, savings, carry a significant amount of debt,\nand are concerned about the adequacy of their retirement savings.\nLiquid savings\nBy drawing from several household surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve,\nwe can gain important insights into how assets and liabilities of middle-income\nhouseholds affect their economic security. Research based on the 2016 SCF shows that\nonly about one-fourth of middle-income households have enough liquid savings to cover\nsix months of expenses—the amount often recommended by financial advisers—and only\n4 in 10 could cover three months of expenses.9 The majority of middle-income\nhouseholds thus do not have sufficient liquid savings to weather a typical material\nfinancial disruption—for instance, one associated with a temporary job loss or illness.\nEven modest unexpected expenses could be disruptive for many middle-income\nfamilies. According to the forthcoming results from the 2018 SHED, one-third of\nmiddle-income adults said that they would borrow money, sell something, or not be able\n9 See Neil Bhutta and Lisa Dettling (2018), “Money in the Bank? Assessing Families’ Liquid Savings\nusing the Survey of Consumer Finances,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, November 19), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2275. In this study, “middle income”\nrefers to households with income between the 25th and 75th percentiles. Income is defined as the “usual\namount” of income the household earned in the previous year and could differ from the actual amount.\nOverall expenses are estimated using partial data on household expenses, including rent, mortgages\npayments, car loans, and food.\n\n- 6 -\nto pay an unexpected $400 expense (figure 5).10 Drilling down further indicates that\nwhile 6 percent of middle-income adults said they would not be able to pay the expense\nusing any means, 27 percent would borrow or sell something to pay the expense.\nThe reliance on credit to meet unexpected expenses is pronounced among those\nalready carrying a balance on their credit cards. Nearly 3 in 10 middle-income adults\ncarry a balance on their credit card most or all of the time, and the same households are\nfive times as likely to borrow if faced with a $400 expense as those who never carry a\nbalance.\nBorrowing money is not the only way that middle-income households cope with\nunexpected expenses. In 2018, one-fourth of middle-income adults said they skipped\nsome kind of medical care because of its cost, suggesting insufficient savings can have\nimplications for physical health as well as financial health. Thus, low levels of savings\ncan create a challenging cycle when material disruptions in income, or even smaller\nunexpected expenses, spiral into a broader financial setback.\nFinancial security in retirement\nA key component of middle-class financial security is the cushion of savings to\ncover retirement. Here, the DFAs suggest some progress. One of the innovations of the\nDFAs is that they include defined benefit plans from the Financial Accounts in addition\nto defined contribution plans, whereas measures of household pension wealth in the SCF\nare confined to the latter. The balances in defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, in\nwhich retirement savings accumulate in an account, are typically simpler to measure. By\n10 This statistic and the rest in this subsection are from the 2018 SHED and are only for middle-income\nadults. The SHED collects ranges of family income, not a dollar amount. Middle income is defined as the\nranges of family income from $40,000 to $99,000, which is roughly the 40th to 70th percentiles.\n\n- 7 -\ncontrast, the value of defined benefit plans requires estimating how much the future fixed\npayments each year in retirement are worth today. These future payments are a sizable\nasset for households, currently estimated at about $15 trillion, or about 70 percent of total\npension assets.11\nThe DFAs indicate that the average pension wealth for middle-income\nhouseholds—including both types of plans—has increased 2.5 percent per year over the\npast three decades (figure 6). Pension assets are now the largest asset held by middle-\nincome households, representing 40 percent of their wealth, substantially exceeding the\n22 percent share of home equity in their wealth.\nIn part, the growth in pension balances reflects the sustained decrease in long-\nterm interest rates over this period, which has boosted the value of the future fixed\npayments associated with defined benefit pensions. It reflects the aging of the\npopulation, since households near or in retirement age have the largest accumulated\nlevels of pension savings and are also likely hold a relatively greater share of defined\nbenefit plans (figure 7).\nHow do we square the growth in pension assets with survey evidence indicating\nthat many households in the middle of the income distribution are concerned that they\nwill not have enough to live on in retirement? Only 35 percent of middle-income adults,\nwho are not retired, say that their retirement saving is on track, and 16 percent of middle-\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statistical Release Z.1, “Financial Accounts of\nthe United States,” table L.117, https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/fof/DisplayTable.aspx?t=l.117. For\nmore information, see John Sabelhaus and Alice Henriques Volz (2019), “Are Disappearing Employer\nPensions Contributing to Rising Wealth Inequality?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, February 1), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/are-\ndisappearing-employer-pensions-contributing-to-rising-wealth-inequality-20190201.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nincome adults do not have any money saved for retirement.12 In part, this may reflect the\nlong-term shift by employers to defined contribution plans and away from defined benefit\nplans, especially in the private sector. While in 1989 more middle-income households\nhad a defined benefit pension than a defined contribution plan, the reverse has been true\nsince 1989.13 With defined contribution plans, employees have to decide how much they\nwill save and how they will invest, and they face uncertainty regarding how much\nsavings will be available in retirement. Those who save and invest effectively can help\nsecure their retirement. But those who opt out, save too little, or make investment\nchoices that turn out to yield low returns may find themselves unprepared as retirement\napproaches, despite years of hard work. Two-thirds of middle-income adults who hold\nself-directed accounts, including defined contribution plans and individual retirement\naccounts, say that they have little or no comfort in managing the investments.14\nAssets and liabilities\nStepping back, it is instructive to look at the evolution of the underlying assets\nand liabilities of middle-class households more broadly. The liabilities of the average\nmiddle-income household have nearly doubled over the past three decades, while assets\nhave increased only 50 percent (figure 8). The gap between the relative growth of\nliabilities and assets peaked during the financial crisis and has narrowed somewhat for\nmiddle-income households more recently. While mortgages rose and fell sharply around\n12 The data are from the 2018 SHED. Tabulations include only middle-income adults who are not retired.\nRetirement savings in the SHED include pensions, individual retirement accounts, and other savings for\nretirement.\n13 The data source is the SCF (1989–2016). In 1989, 50 percent of middle-income households had a\ndefined benefit pension, and 29 percent had a defined contribution pension, but by 1998, the relative\nownership of each pension type had reversed to 36 percent and 43 percent, respectively. Since then, the\nrates have been fairly stable.\n14 The data are from the 2018 SHED. The tabulation includes only middle-income adults, who have self-\ndirected retirement accounts.\n\n- 9 -\nthe Great Recession, the rise in consumer debt, such as credit cards, auto loans, and\nstudent loans, has been relatively steady.\nThe rapid growth in liabilities reflects both short-term cash flow management and\nlonger-term investments. Taking on debt is an important way for middle-income families\nto help buffer unexpected expenses or a temporary loss of income, as indicated by the 8\nin 10 middle-income adults who are at least somewhat confident that they could obtain an\nadditional credit card if they applied for it.15 Debt is also a critical mechanism for\nmaking key middle-class investments, which I turn to next.\nInvesting in the Future\nThere is a palpable sense that the opportunity to reach the middle class and remain\nin it is receding for many middle-income households. Many households find it\nchallenging to make key middle-class investments because incomes at the middle are not\nkeeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership, and it is difficult to\nsave enough. Often, making these investments requires having some savings in the first\nplace—for instance, to make a down payment on a home, forgo income for a few years\nwhile paying tuition, or secure credit for a small business.\nDisparities by race and ethnicity\nThis challenge is compounded for some racial and ethnic minority groups that\nhave experienced large and persistent racial gaps in wealth. In 2016, the average wealth\nof white households ($933,700) was seven times the average wealth of black households\n($138,200) and five times that of Hispanic households ($191,200). Even among\nhouseholds at the middle of the income distribution, the average wealth in 2016 of white\n15 The 2018 SHED is the data source. Tabulations include only middle-income adults.\n\n- 10 -\nhouseholds ($277,200) was roughly one and a half times that of black households\n($179,700) and nearly three times that of Hispanic households ($95,400).16 Differences\nin educational attainment cannot fully account for these disparities: The average wealth\nof black households in which the head had a bachelor’s degree ($271,200) was 26 percent\nless than that of white households in which the head did not attend college ($367,800).17\nThis matters not least because disparities in wealth often are inherited.18 The\nprospects that a young person will reach the middle class often depend on attributes he or\nshe inherits—such as the income, wealth, education, age, race, and ethnicity of his or her\nparents.19 Beyond financial wealth, children inherit intangible assets that affect their\nability to access information and social networks that help in obtaining jobs and taking\nadvantage of educational and other wealth-building opportunities.\nHomeownership\nOwning a home has been a key marker of middle-class status for many\nAmericans. The accumulation of equity in a home is the primary form of wealth building\nand economic security for many middle-class families. Homeownership is valued for\n16 The source is the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm.\n17 See Lisa J.

Home equity—defined as the difference between the house value\nand the mortgage balance—for an average middle-income household peaked at $90,200\nin late 2005, then declined by almost two-thirds through 2011 (figure 9). By the end of\n2018, after several years of rising house prices, the home equity of the average middle-\nincome family was still below the pre-recession peak and not much above the value in\n1989.\nMiddle-income households saw such steep declines in their average home equity\nduring the Great Recession because they had taken on a high level of mortgage debt\nrelative to their house values.21 This high leverage amplified the effect of the fall in\nhouse prices on their wealth. Moreover, the homeownership rates of middle-income\nhouseholds also declined during the recession, so they did not benefit as much from the\nsubsequent rebound in house prices since 2013 as did higher-income families.\nThe recent decline in homeownership rates does not appear to reflect a change in\nattitudes toward homeownership, as recent surveys show that the desire to own a home\nremains strong.22 Instead, it appears house prices are rising faster than income for many\n20 See Matthew Desmond (2016), Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City (New York: Crown).\n21 See Lisa Dettling, Joanne Hsu, and Elizabeth Llanes (2018), “A Wealthless Recovery?

Their analysis\nfocused on working-age households, and income classifications are based on the “usual amount” of income\nthe household earns.\n22 As one example, in March 2019, according to Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey, 69 percent of\nhouseholds say they would “buy” if they were going to move. See Fannie Mae’s March 2019 Data\nRelease, which is available on its website at\nhttp://www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/research/housingsurvey/pdf/nhs-monthly-data-040819.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nmiddle-income families, putting homeownership out of reach. By 2017, the median sales\nprice for a single-family home was about four times median household income, up from\nthree times median income in 1988.23 The homeownership rate for middle-income\nfamilies was 68 percent in 2016, down from its peak in 2004 of 74 percent.24 For black\nhouseholds, the declines during and after the recession erased a decade of increases in\nhomeownership—the homeownership rate for black households across the income\nspectrum was 42 percent in 2018, the same as the rate in the mid-1990s.25 The\nhomeownership rate of Hispanics also declined with the recession but has recovered\nsomewhat, reaching 47 percent in 2018.\nWith homeownership lower and home prices rising faster than incomes, renting is\nalso taking a bigger slice of many middle-income households’ earnings, leaving less\nsavings for a down payment, an unexpected expense, or other investments. From 2007 to\n2018, the share of income spent on rent rose from 18 percent to 25 percent for middle-\nincome renters.26\nMany middle-income families struggle to afford rent, particularly in the high-\ndemand areas where jobs are most available, underscoring the need for more workforce\nhousing. One way to increase the supply of middle-income housing is to reduce\nexclusionary zoning and other land-use restrictions that limit the supply of housing and\n23 See Alexander Hermann (2018), “Price-to-Income Ratios Are Nearing Historic Highs,” Joint Center for\nHousing Studies of Harvard University, Housing Perspectives (blog), September 13,\nhttps://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/price-to-income-ratios-are-nearing-historic-highs.\n24 The data are from the Survey of Consumer Finances.\n25 See U.S. Census Bureau (2019), Current Population Survey/Housing Vacancy Survey, April 4,\nhttps://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/ann18ind.html.\n26 See Dettling, Hsu, and Llanes, “A Wealthless Recovery?” in note 23; and Jeff Larrimore and Jenny\nSchuetz (2017), “Assessing the Severity of Rent Burden on Low-Income Families,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 22),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2111.\n\n- 13 -\nkeep prices high.27 Often put in place in areas with single-family homes to block the\ndevelopment of affordable, multifamily housing, these policies also have contributed to\nthe persistence of racially segregated neighborhoods. The challenge is to increase\naccessibility to workforce and affordable housing in ways that address legacy\ndisparities.28\nSkills, education, and student debt\nManufacturing and the skilled trades have provided an important pathway to the\nmiddle class for many workers, enabling them to own their homes, educate their children,\nand retire securely. Today, though, many face uncertainties associated with the decline in\nmanufacturing jobs, the erosion of employee benefits, and reduced bargaining power.\nIncreasingly, the onus is on individuals to ensure that their skills are marketable and up-\nto-date in a highly competitive global marketplace with growing automation.\nJuan Salgado, the chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago and our closing\nkeynote speaker, has emphasized the role of community colleges in offering affordable,\nquality education and training.29 Students can begin with a certificate program in\nadvanced manufacturing and continue either to a bachelor’s degree in engineering at a\nnearby public university or to the workplace, acquiring marketable skills likely at lower\ncost than if they had started at a four-year college. Similar programs around the country\nhelp provide accessible pathways to the middle class.\n27 Glaeser and Gyorko found that zoning restrictions increased the cost of housing by 25 percent or more in\naround 15 percent of cities in 2013 and doubled housing costs in about 6 percent of cities. See Edward\nGlaeser and Joseph Gyourko (2018), “The Economic Implications of Housing Supply,” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, vol. 32 (Winter), pp. 3–30.\n28 See Richard Rothstein (2017), The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government\nSegregated America (New York: Liveright).\n29 See Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (2019), “An Interview with Juan Salgado, Chancellor of the City\nColleges of Chicago: Charting Pathways to the Middle Class,” CDPS Blog, April 5,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/blogs/cdps/2019/interview-with-juan-salgado.\n\n- 14 -\nFor others, college is seen as an important pathway to middle-class economic\nsecurity. The average wealth of households with a college degree significantly exceeds\nthe average wealth of those without a college degree (figure 10). A key reason is that\ncollege graduates generally have higher incomes. Graduates with a bachelor’s degree\nhave median weekly earnings that are about 65 percent higher than high school graduates\nand unemployment rates that are 2 percentage points lower, and they are often better\npositioned to adapt to changes in the labor market.30\nHowever, the cost of higher education has been rising, placing an increasing\nfinancial burden on many middle-income households. Between 2008 and 2018, tuition\nand fees at four-year public colleges rose more than six times faster than real median\nincomes.31 Moreover, as Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Evans discussed,\nwhile there are benefits associated with attending college, there are also some financial\nrisks, and the returns to education vary widely. While two-thirds of individuals with a\nbachelor’s degree or more say that the lifetime financial benefits of their education\nexceed its costs, those who do not complete their degree are half as likely to report net\nbenefits from their studies.32 And some groups face higher barriers in accessing college:\nChildren of parents who did not attend college are far less likely to attend college due to\n30 See Elka Torpey (2018), “Measuring the Value of Education,” Bureau of Labor Statistics, Career\nOutlook (blog), April, https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2018/data-on-display/education-pays.htm.\n31 Net tuition and fees at four-year public colleges increased 44 percent between 2008 and 2009 and\nbetween 2018 and 2019 (according to data from the College Board, which are available on its website at\nhttps://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-room-and-board-over-time),\nwhile income increased about 7 percent in the same period (as indicated by U.S. Census Bureau data,\nwhich can be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s FRED website at\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=nDPn).

Tabulations include all adults (regardless of income) who attended\nany post-secondary program.\n\n- 15 -\nfinancial and informational barriers, and those who do start college are more likely to\ndrop out.33\nFor many middle-income families, affording post-secondary education means\ntaking on a sobering amount of student debt. Total student loan debt, in inflation-\nadjusted terms, more than doubled from 2006 to 2018 (figure 11).34 Repayment of\nstudent loans can be challenging. In 2018, 2 in 10 middle-income adults with education\ndebt were behind on their payments, and those who did not complete a degree were\nnearly twice as likely to be behind.35 Repayment status also differs by the type of\ninstitution attended. Among middle-income adults with education debt, 30 percent who\nattended for-profit institutions were behind on student loan payments, compared with 17\npercent of those who attended public institutions and 12 percent who attended not-for-\nprofit private institutions.\nInvesting in higher education may come at the cost of deferring or forgoing other\ninvestments. For example, higher tuition costs—reflected in increasing student loan\ndebt—together with the rising costs of homeownership, have left many middle-income\nhouseholds in a poor position to save for a down payment or handle a mortgage.\nResearchers at the Fed have estimated that roughly 20 percent of the decline in\nhomeownership among young adults can be attributed to their increased student loans\n33 The 2018 SHED is the data source.

This suggests that more than 400,000 young individuals would have owned a\nhome in 2014 had it not been for the rise in student debt.36\nBusinesses and stock ownership\nAnother concern is that high debt may hinder people seeking to start a business.\nStarting a business is a classic pathway to securing a foothold in the middle class. This\nhas been particularly true for members of some groups that historically have faced\nchallenges in the labor market, particularly minorities and first-generation Americans.37\nAspiring small business owners with student loans may lack the financial ability\nto invest in starting a business while staying current on payments. One study found that\nindividuals with student loan debt are less likely to start a business, and those who do are\nmore likely to fall behind on their loan payments.38 Another study found that growth in\nstudent loan debt resulted in a 14 percent reduction in small business formation in\ncounties over a 10-year period.39\n36 See Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, and Kamila Sommer (2019), “Can Student Loan Debt Explain Low\nHomeownership Rates for Young Adults?” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer\n& Community Context, vol. 1 (January), pp. 2–6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/consumer-community-context-201901.pdf.\n37 African American women are one of the fastest-growing groups of entrepreneurs.

As wealth for\nmiddle-income households has stagnated, reliance on this source of capital has declined\nin recent years.40 Very small firms depend heavily on personal debt for start-up and\nworking capital. Owners of smaller firms often struggle to qualify for bank credit, and\namong those that apply and are denied, low credit scores and insufficient credit history\nare the most frequently cited reasons.\nMore broadly, a key reason that middle-income households have not seen wealth\nincreases commensurate with high-income households is that they have not benefited as\nmuch from the strong performance of stocks and privately held businesses. In inflation-\nadjusted terms, total business assets (including corporate stocks, mutual funds, and\nunincorporated businesses) have more than tripled since 1989. Similarly, the average\nbusiness assets of top-income households have more than tripled since 1989. But the\naverage business assets of middle-income families have grown only 31 percent since\n1989 and are lower than they were before the Great Recession (figure 12). Stock market\nparticipation fell for middle-income families after the Great Recession, so they have not\nbenefited as much from the subsequent rise in stock prices.41 By 2018, the 30 percent of\nhouseholds in the middle of the income distribution held only 6 percent of aggregate\nbusiness assets, while the top 10 percent of households held over three-fourths.\n40 See Arthur B. Kennickell, Myron L. Kwast, and Jonathan Pogach (2017), “Small Businesses and Small\nBusiness Finance during the Financial Crisis and the Great Recession: New Evidence from the Survey of\nConsumer Finances,” in John Haltiwanger, Erik Hurst, Javier Miranda, and Antoinette Schoar, eds.,\nMeasuring Entrepreneurial Businesses: Current Knowledge and Challenges, National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, Studies in Income and Wealth (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 291–349.\n41 See Dettling, Hsu, and Llanes, “A Wealthless Recovery?” in note 23; and Bing Chen and Frank P.\nStafford (2016), “Stock Market Participation: Family Responses to Housing Consumption Commitments,”\nJournal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 48 (June), pp. 635–59.\n\n- 18 -\nMaximum Employment, Wages, and Wealth\nWith lower net worth and financial assets, the livelihoods of most middle-income\nfamilies, other than retirees, depend primarily on compensation from working. So the\nrobustness of labor income over time is central to the ability of middle-income families to\nachieve and maintain middle-class financial security. While the strengthening of the\nlabor market over the course of this extended recovery has benefited middle-income\nfamilies, the long-term decline in the share of national income going to wage earners is\nconcerning.\nThe Congress put maximum employment right at the heart of the Federal\nReserve’s mandate, alongside price stability. In fact, we are one of only a handful of\ncentral banks that have the explicit responsibility to promote maximum employment.\nGiven that households at the middle of the income distribution rely primarily on wage\nincome, our full employment mandate has served the country well during this extended\nrecovery.\nThe gains to workers, including those in the middle class, from the strong labor\nmarket are clear. Unemployment is now at 3.6 percent—its lowest level in 50 years.\nEmployment rates of adults in their prime working years (ages 25 to 54) have been rising\nsteadily during the expansion and recently reached their pre-recession peak of 80\npercent.42 Importantly, wage growth has begun to pick up after years of slow gains.\nIt is notable that the near recovery in middle-class wealth from the Great\nRecession did not take hold until the labor market began to strengthen. While higher-\nincome households saw their wealth begin to recover as soon as financial markets\n42 The data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n- 19 -\nstabilized in early 2009, middle-income households did not see their wealth begin to\nrecover until 2010, when the unemployment rate began to decline (figure 13).\nEven as we welcome the many benefits of the current strong job market, longer-\nterm trends raise concerns. Labor market disparities by race have been an enduring\nfeature of the labor market for decades. The unemployment rate of blacks, while near its\nhistorical low, remains at about 7 percent, twice the unemployment rate of whites.\nRecent research suggests that the strong labor market may be helping to narrow some of\nthe long-standing disparities for some racial minorities and women, although the results\nare tentative and very modest.43\nThe progressive long-term decline in the share of national income that goes to\nworkers through wages is concerning for middle-income households. The share going to\nworkers—which economists call the labor share—translates into how much of our\neconomic output shows up in people’s paychecks. The decline in the labor share goes to\nthe heart of the rising inequality of wealth and the unequal sharing of prosperity.\nSeveral explanations have been put forward for the decline in the labor share.\nThe increasing concentration of industries into the hands of a few firms has likely\nreduced the bargaining power of workers.44 Increasing automation in the workplace is\n43 See Stephanie R.

Earnings\nhave declined as the job market has shifted away from important middle-income\noccupations. Manufacturing, for example, employs vastly fewer people now than it has\nhistorically.45 It is important to understand the relative importance of these different\ndrivers, as they have different implications for the overall health of the economy and for\npolicies to support middle-income families.\nMonetary policy aims to influence employment and inflation over the business\ncycle, as opposed to addressing these longer-run structural changes. But the distribution\nof income and wealth may have important implications for macroeconomic\ndevelopments, such as the evolution of consumption, which is the single biggest engine\nof growth in our economy. That is why the Federal Reserve has a significant interest in\nunderstanding distributional developments and their implications.\nRecent research finds that households with lower levels of wealth spend a larger\nfraction of any income gains than households with higher levels of wealth.46\nConsequently, an economy that delivers an increasing share of income gains to high-\nwealth households could result in less growth in consumer demand than one in which the\ngains are distributed more equally. In fact, the recovery of consumer spending after the\nGreat Recession was slower than the recovery in aggregate household income and net\n45 See David Autor and Anna Salomons (2018), “Is Automation Labor-Displacing?

These are\nimportant questions, and I am pleased that this conference is bringing to light interesting\nresearch to shed light on them.\n47 See Aditya Aladangady and Laura Feiveson (2018), “A Not-So-Great Recovery in Consumption: What\nIs Holding Back Household Spending?” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, March 8), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-is-holding-back-\nhousehold-spending-20180308.htm.\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:15 p.m. EDT\nMay 25, 2022\nCommencement Remarks\nLael Brainard\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2022 Commencement of the School for Advanced International Studies\nJohns Hopkins University\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 25, 2022\n\nIt is an honor to be here today. Thank you, Dean Steinberg, members of the\nfaculty and staff, members of the Board, distinguished guests, parents, and family\nmembers. To the Class of 2022, congratulations. I am honored to be here with you to\ncelebrate this day for which you have worked so hard and on which you go out to make\nyour mark in the world, fortified with an incredible intellectual arsenal and lifelong\nfriends from your time at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies\n(SAIS). As a parent, I would like to extend a special welcome to the parents and families\nwho have joined this celebration today. I’m sure many of you must be filled, like I am\noften, with awe and admiration for our amazing offspring and the good they will do in the\nworld.\nTo be honest, when Dean Steinberg invited me to speak, I was concerned that you\nmight not be excited to hear from a central banker. Central bankers are dull by design.\nWe use 17 words when 2 would suffice. We make a virtue of using language that is\nprosaic and concrete. Our pronouncements are carefully calibrated so they are\nunderstood exactly as intended, leaving nothing to the imagination. In short, we are the\nopposite of the poetry, drama, and inspiration that are the stuff of launching gifted\ngraduates on their career quest.\nBut a friend reminded me that if there’s anywhere a central banker might be a\ngood fit for graduation, it’s SAIS. At SAIS, you are required to not only take, but pass\nmonetary theory. No doubt your parents must be wondering—monetary theory? How is\nthat going to help your career? Is it too late to become a doctor or a lawyer?\nBut that is the point. You have chosen a different path. Two years ago, when a\nnovel coronavirus struck, when fear and panic spread, you decided you wanted to learn\n\n- 2 -\nmore. When economies and markets struggled, you chose to focus on developing\nsolutions. When travel and trade trickled to a stop, you made a commitment to a life in\nglobal affairs.\nYou have endured lockdowns and Zoom lectures to get an education that will help\nyou understand and address the complexities of our world. Your generation has had to\nshow resilience and strength in the face of a once-in-a-hundred-year pandemic and\nprepare for a world where once-in-a-hundred-year events occur every couple of years.\nThat strength and learning will serve you well as you embark on your life’s work.\nAs you do so, I hope some of you are considering a career in public service.\nOthers, not so much. I get it. Public service is not glamorous. Still, I hope many of you\nwill consider devoting a part of your life’s work to a public mission and will do so with\nenthusiasm and urgency, because public service has a profound effect on the lives of\npeople and communities across the country. And it can be motivating and satisfying in\nways that are rare.\nSo perhaps I could provide a glimpse of the hopes and dreams that animate my\njourney and guide my work, as a reminder that you can and must dream big and stay true\nto your chosen mission as you navigate your journey with as much passion as\nprofessionalism and as much integrity as intellect.\nSo let me start by tracing back what I do today to what I cared about when I was a\nyoung American growing up in Europe. Ever since I was a little girl observing life in\nPoland under Soviet rule, I have been making mental checklists of the communities\naround me: gray apartment block with cratered walls and broken glass, dilapidated\nfactory with an open furnace, long line at the bread shop.\n\n- 3 -\nI noticed the contrast between the bright colors and bustle of the farmers selling\nproduce from their own plots of land and the gray bleakness of communist factories and\npoorly stocked shelves. And the even greater contrast with West Germany at a time\nwhen it was fast integrating with its western neighbors: new cars, thriving small\nbusinesses, packed store shelves. What I observed around me as I came of age, I later\nunderstood, were features of the Cold War battle over the ideals of freedom and\nenterprise and the kind of political systems and institutions that could best uphold those\nideals.\nIn those early days it was hard to imagine the rise of Solidarity and the fall of the\nwall. Three decades later, it is inspiring to stand with a united and free Europe as it\nopposes Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.\nOnce I started working, I found myself compiling these checklists in Maggie\nThatcher’s industrial towns, in auto assembly plants in Detroit, in financial-crisis-stricken\nMexico City, in agricultural towns in Senegal. Whether I am on vacation or a community\nvisit, I read neighborhoods the way that some people survey land for planting or\nspreadsheets for weak links or legal briefs for inconsistencies: boarded up rowhouse, not\na grocery store in sight, multilane highway splitting the old commercial district.\nAs I have traveled around this country from Milwaukee to the Mississippi Delta,\nfrom Atlanta to Appalachia, from Detroit to the Colonias, and from Scranton to the Pine\nRidge Reservation, in urban and rural areas alike, it is striking how much the\nopportunities and challenges facing families are shaped by the health of their\ncommunities and the broader economy. At the most foundational level, what animates\n\n- 4 -\nmy job at our nation’s central bank is the opportunity to lift up the livelihoods and lives\nof working families in communities across America.\nAs central bankers, we don’t think of inflation or unemployment as blue or red.\nWe focus on data and proven solutions, and our mission is to serve all Americans.\nWe see time and time again that the families that have the smallest financial\nbuffers and the communities with the least resilience suffer the most when turbulence\nstrikes. The risk that turbulence will strike is always present, as I have learned from the\nmany financial crises that have punctuated my own career. In the past decade alone, our\ncommunities have contended with the devastation of the Global Financial Crisis, the\nEuropean Debt Crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and now the burden on stretched\nhousehold budgets from Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.\nThe arc from the collapse of the Berlin Wall to the response to the COVID-19\npandemic is this: Ideas and actions can change the course of communities and countries.\nLet me share with you three examples of how individuals have come together to shape\npolicy for the greater good.\nNinety years ago, the first woman Cabinet Secretary, Frances Perkins, convinced\na skeptical Franklin Roosevelt that unemployment insurance wasn’t a handout but a smart\ninvestment. Not only would it be an effective self-financed approach to help families\nsmooth through periods when work was hard to find through no fault of their own, but it\nalso would support the health of the broader economy when demand weakened.\nSo, two years ago, when a global pandemic struck, the application of Perkins’s\nlogic through an expanded set of programs and facilities sustained millions of families\nand saved countless small businesses. After returning from a meeting in Europe in late\n\n- 5 -\nFebruary 2020 when COVID was starting to spread globally, I had a startling realization\nthat these are the moments we are here for, when communities around the country rely on\nus to act. With a shocking 20 million Americans laid off from their jobs in one short\nmonth, with U.S. stock market capitalization down by 12 percent in one day, with main\nstreet businesses shuttering and 94 percent of classes moving to distance learning, it was\nvital to respond with boldness and creativity as we committed to using all our tools to\nprovide vital support for communities around the country.\nIn contrast to the devastation wrought by the inaction in the lead-up to the Great\nDepression, the COVID response showed that swift, decisive action can stave off\ncatastrophe. When there is the will to do so, with the support of Congress, we can and\nmust use our tools to help protect families, businesses, and their communities from crisis\nand make the broader economy more resilient so it rebounds faster.\nThe second example is of Augustus Hawkins, a Black Congressman who in the\n1970s was a key architect of the statute enshrining the words “full employment” in the\nFederal Reserve’s mandate along with price stability. He knew that only with maximum\nemployment would there be true opportunity for workers of all races, ethnicities, and\ngenders. Every day, I am mindful that the opportunities and prosperity of working people\nall across the country rest in part on our commitment to the prosaic words “maximum\nemployment and price stability,” which, like policy work itself, belie the enormity of\ntheir effect.\nMaximum employment and stable low inflation benefit all Americans but are\nparticularly important for those earning less. Price stability is of greatest importance for\nlower-income families because they spend more than three-quarters of their paychecks on\n\n- 6 -\nessentials like groceries, gas or bus fare, and rent—more than double the 31 percent spent\nby higher-income households. High inflation is our most pressing challenge. That is\nwhy we are taking strong actions that will bring inflation back down.\nThe third example took place 45 years ago, when civil rights leaders, banks, and\ncommunity groups worked together with leaders in Congress to enact the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA). To address the damaging legacy from redlining—the practice\nof restricting access to credit in neighborhoods, often on demographic grounds—\nCongress assigned banking regulators with the responsibility to ensure banks serve the\ncredit needs of their entire communities. As of today, this responsibility remains the\nfoundation of the ecosystem supporting credit, investment, and financial inclusion in\ncommunities that face the greatest challenges. By revitalizing the CRA, we provide\nshopkeepers, entrepreneurs, first-time homebuyers, and families better opportunities to\nthrive individually and, in turn, to contribute to the broader vibrancy of our economy.\nA commitment to mission, to providing opportunities in all communities, to\nembracing change, to taking bold action—these guidelines that have been important for\nme may also be important for you as you embark on your professional journey. They\nwill be important whether you work in the public, private, or nonprofit sector, and\nwhether you work within borders or across them.\nI noted that in the early days, the demise of the Iron Curtain was virtually\ninconceivable. But when the tides turned, the change came hard and fast. The digital\nrevolution similarly heralded a recognition at a visceral level that we were hurtling\ntoward a new era.\n\n- 7 -\nYour generation is experiencing change of this magnitude at a breathtaking pace.\nWe are living through a profound shift in our individual and collective histories. This\ngreat reordering gives you a unique opportunity to shape what comes next. You are\nheaded into the world at the exact moment that your ability to change it has never been\nmore important. You understand the need to embrace change—to understand it and\nshape it, not hide from it.\nAnd you came to the right place to do so. SAIS was founded in 1943—during\nWorld War II. It was established one year before the Bretton Woods Conference, two\nyears before the United Nations was established, and four years before the National\nSecurity Council first met. SAIS was established during a crisis to enable its graduates to\nmake a better world. Sound familiar?\nAs SAIS graduates, you are equipped with an intellectual framework that enables\nyou to work across disciplines as much as within them, at both a national and global\nlevel. I guarantee that no challenge worthy of your attention will be simple. The\nchallenges your generation faces are multifaceted, requiring you to think and act across\ndisciplinary boundaries to develop effective solutions.\nAs SAIS graduates, you understand that whatever your professional calling may\nbe—whether in finance or technology or development or diplomacy—you are called to\ndo so by a mission that animates you and that holds its own inspiration and poetry for\nyou.\nAs SAIS graduates, you are supremely well positioned to combine theory and\npractice in the arena and to be nimble and agile in adapting to even the most extreme\nevents. You will have your own moment when you realize with startling clarity that you\n\n- 8 -\nare called to act with boldness and resolve. I encountered two groups of people when I\nwas navigating the aftershocks of the Global Financial Crisis and the complexities of the\nEuropean Debt Crisis: SAIS graduates I worked with, and SAIS graduates I worked for.\nThey were excellent, dedicated, and inspiring. So, I am confident that your education\nhere has equipped you well to understand and act on the big forces that will continue to\ndrive change.\nFinally, as SAIS graduates, you embark on your professional journey equipped\nnot only with a powerful intellectual framework but a lifelong network of friends,\nmentors, and collaborators here and around the world that will sustain and support you as\nyou rise to meet challenges that may be impossible to even imagine right now. Indeed,\nthis SAIS community may turn out to be the greatest gift of your time here.\nSo let me conclude by saying to each of you and to your families:\nCongratulations, and Godspeed.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:30 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 26, 2017\nWhy Persistent Employment Disparities Matter for the Economy’s Health\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Disparities in the Labor Market: What Are We Missing?”\na research conference sponsored by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 26, 2017\n\nI want to compliment the organizers and others for gathering an outstanding group\nof researchers and papers for this conference. Understanding why some groups\npersistently fare better than others in the job market and how these disparities may affect\nthe economy’s overall performance is vitally important to the Federal Reserve. While\nopportunity and inclusion have long been central to American values, it is increasingly\nclear that they are also central to the strength of our economy.1\nAs directed by the Congress, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is to promote\nmaximum employment and stable prices. In fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) has set a target of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a\nsimilarly fixed numerical goal for maximum employment. That is because the level of\nmaximum employment depends on “nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market,” which “may change over time and may not be directly\nmeasurable.”2 Understanding how close the labor market is to our full-employment goal\nrequires consulting a variety of evidence along with a healthy dose of judgment. The\nrecognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes in the\neconomic landscape serves us well by requiring FOMC participants to develop a nuanced\nunderstanding of labor market developments.\nThis approach to maximum employment has allowed the FOMC to navigate the\ncurrent expansion in a way that has likely brought more people back into productive\nemployment than might have been the case with a fixed unemployment rate target based\n1 I am grateful to Christopher Smith for his assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my\nown views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n2 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy is available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\non pre-crisis standards. This is especially true at a time when the traditional Phillips\ncurve relationship is flatter than in the past, which means that price inflation is likely to\nbe less informative regarding labor market tightness than it was previously.3 It therefore\nseems particularly valuable to look beyond inflation and headline unemployment to\nassess the strength of the labor market. Even when aggregate economic statistics look\nstrong, studying geographic areas and demographic groups that are not faring as well can\npoint to ways of further improving the economy’s performance.\nThe Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor\nforce participation, income, and wealth because they may have implications for the\ngrowth capacity of the economy. When we consider appropriate monetary policy, we\nneed to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive\nprice inflation. At a time when the retirement of the baby-boom generation looks likely\nto be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to\nconsider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for\nsome prime working-age groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could\nincrease the labor force and boost economic activity.\nMore broadly, when a person who was previously unemployed or discouraged\nsecures a job, not only does it boost the economy, but that person also may gain a greater\nsense of economic security, self-sufficiency, and self-worth and be better able to invest in\ntheir family’s future. With a richer understanding of economic or social barriers that\ninhibit labor market success and prosperity for some groups, we may better grasp how\n3 For more on the Phillips curve and its ability to provide information on labor-market slack, see Brainard\n(2015), Blanchard (2016), and Kiley (2015).\n\n- 3 -\nmuch these individuals can be helped by broad economic expansion and how much\ntargeted intervention is required through other policy means.\nThere is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth\nrate and equality of opportunity. Large disparities in opportunity based on race, ethnicity,\ngender, or geography mean that the enterprise, exertion, and investments of households\nand businesses from different groups are not rewarded commensurately. To the extent\nthat disparities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect\nsuch disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged\ngroups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth\nwill fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.4\nAside from reducing the long-run productive potential of the economy,\npersistently high levels of income and wealth inequality may also have implications for\nthe robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of aggregate\nspending in the United States. The gaps in household income and wealth between the\nrichest and poorest households are at historically high levels, as income and wealth have\nincreasingly accrued to the very richest households. For example, results from the\nFederal Reserve’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is due to be released\nsoon, indicate that the share of income held by the top 1 percent of households reached\n24 percent in 2015, up from 17 percent in 1988. The share of wealth held by the top\n1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.5 Some research\nsuggests that widening income and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in\n4 For more on inequality of opportunity see Marrero and Rodriquez (2013).\n5 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data (to be released on September 27); for additional analysis of\nthese data, see Bricker and others (forthcoming).\n\n- 4 -\nthe aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of\nany additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are\nlikely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.6\nDisparities by Race and Ethnicity\nWhen we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we find\nsignificant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.7 In August, the national\nunemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked\nsubstantial differences across different demographic groups. As shown in figure 1,\nunemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians,\n5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 7.7 percent for African Americans. Labor force\nparticipation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than\nunemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at 62.2 percent. These\ndifferences are not a recent development--similar differences across racial and ethnic\ndimensions have existed for as long as these data have been collected. Even more\nstriking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic\ngroups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age\nand education levels.8\nAlthough the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups\nare still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably\nduring the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades. Differences in\nunemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during\n6 See Bernstein (2013) and Alichi, Kantenga, and Solè (2016) for more on the potential link between\nincome and wealth inequality and consumer spending.\n7 For a discussion of gender disparities, see Yellen (2015).\n8 See Cajner and others (2017) for more on racial gaps and the labor market.\n\n- 5 -\nrecessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and\nthese differences shrink during recoveries. For example, in the second quarter of 2017,\nthe unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 percentage points\nhigher than for white adult men. This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to\nthe smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.\nDifferences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women\nrelative to white women, and for Hispanics relative to whites. Since racial disparities\ntend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that\nracial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall\nunemployment rate falls further.9\nMore broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in\nsignificant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in families’ income and wealth.\nAccording to forthcoming findings from the latest SCF and as shown in figure 3, the\naverage income for white families in 2015 was about $123,000 per year, compared with\n$54,000 for black families and $57,000 for Hispanic families.10 Disparities in wealth,\nshown in figure 4, are even larger: Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016\nwere about $933,000, compared with $191,000 for Hispanic families and $138,000 for\nblack families.11 Moreover, these racial and ethnic gaps in average family income and\n9 Data on recent estimates of unemployment rates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity\nare available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Historical gaps are provided by Cajner and others\n(2017).\n10 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data. Recent estimates of household income from Current\nPopulation Survey data and reported by the Census in Semega, Fontenot, and Kollar (2017) are\nqualitatively similar, in that between 2013 and 2016 for both sets of data, family income has increased for\nwhites, blacks, and Hispanics (with greater increases, in percentage terms, for black and Hispanic families).\n11 Racial and ethnic differences in median income and wealth are somewhat smaller. For example, in 2016\nmedian income for white families was about $61,000, compared with $35,000 for black families and\n$39,000 for Hispanic families. Median wealth was about $171,000 for white families, compared with\n\n- 6 -\nwealth have generally widened rather than narrowed over the past few decades. Based on\nSCF data, median family wealth has grown much more rapidly for white families than for\nother families over the past few decades, while median family incomes have risen by\nabout the same amount for white, black, and Hispanic families.\nAs the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the\nsidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in\nemployment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue.\nThat said, the benefits of a lengthy recovery can only go so far, as the research points to\nsome barriers to labor market outcomes for particular groups that appear to be structural.\nAfter controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these\nfactors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and\ninformal social networks that may be an important source of information and support\nregarding employment opportunities.12 While the policy tools available to the Federal\nReserve are not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent\ndisparities in labor market outcomes, understanding these barriers and efforts to address\nthem is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth.\nGeographic Disparities\nThe Federal Reserve System benefits not only from our engagement with\nresearch, statistics, and surveys, but also from our presence in communities all across\nAmerica. This local presence, by design, provides valuable perspectives on how\nAmericans in different communities are experiencing the economy and the varied\nabout $20,000 for black and Hispanic families. The larger gap in average income and wealth than median\nincome and wealth reflects a greater concentration of income and wealth among the wealthiest white\nfamilies than for other races and ethnicities.\n12 For example, see Fryer (2011) and Ritter and Taylor (2011).\n\n- 7 -\nchallenges that lie beneath the aggregate numbers. While traveling around the country\nwith our community development staff, I have been struck by the widening gulf between\nthe economic fortunes of our large metropolitan areas and those of our small cities,\ntowns, and rural areas.\nThe statistics bear this out. Over the past 30 years, the convergence in income\nacross regions of the country has slowed dramatically.13 Much of the gains in\nemployment, income, and wealth since the end of the recession, and more broadly over\nthe past few decades, have accrued to workers and families in larger cities. Since some\nworkers and families may find it difficult to move, this concentration of economic\nopportunities in larger cities may have adverse implications for the well-being of these\nhouseholds and, potentially, the growth capacity of the economy as a whole.\nAlthough pockets of opportunity and poverty are found in large metropolitan and\nrural areas alike, a greater share of the new jobs and business establishments created\nduring the recovery that followed the Great Recession have been in larger metro areas\nthan was the case in previous recoveries.14 In countless rural towns and small cities we\nare seeing how a deep economic setback can leave a profound and long-lasting mark.\nThese experiences challenge common assumptions about the ability of local economies to\nrecover from a setback. This could be the legacy of the concentrated presence of an\nindustry that experiences decline due to trade or technology, or it could be the byproduct\nof a lack of connectivity--whether by highways or broadband. Technological change,\nglobalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to the U.S. economy, but\n13 See Ganong and Shoag (2017) and references therein for more on the decline in income convergence.\n14 See Goetz, Partridge, and Stephens (2017) and Economic Innovation Group (2016) for details on\ngrowing regional differences during the recovery.\n\n- 8 -\nthere are troubling signs that less diversified or connected localities have a diminished\nability to adapt. And the evidence suggests that concentrated economic shocks and the\nassociated labor market stress also have broader consequences for health and mortality.15\nTo provide some sense of the magnitudes, on average over the past year the\nunemployment rate for adults of prime working age (25 to 54) was about 1 percentage\npoint higher in nonmetropolitan areas than in larger metro areas.16 But there is an even\ngreater gap in labor force engagement, as can be seen in figure 5. The participation rate\nfor prime-age adults in larger metro areas is currently nearly 3-1/2 percentage points\nabove the participation rate for prime-age adults in nonmetro areas. Interestingly, the\ngeographic participation rate gap between more and less populous areas is apparent for\nall races as well as, in recent years, for both men and women.17\nThis gap in labor force participation between large cities and other areas has\nwidened substantially since just before the Great Recession: Since 2007, the\nparticipation rate for prime-age adults in nonmetro areas has fallen nearly 3 percentage\npoints, as compared with less than 1 percentage point on net in larger metro areas.\nIndeed, since 2007, the large decline in labor force participation in small metro and rural\nareas can explain about 40 percent of the economy-wide decline in prime-age labor force\nparticipation, even though these areas account for a smaller 25 percent of the population.\nBefore discussing possible contributors to this growing participation gap, it is\nimportant to emphasize that less populous areas appear to be falling behind in ways\n15 See Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016b).\n16 Larger metro areas are defined as metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with a population of 500,000 or\nlarger, while smaller metro areas are MSAs with population between 100,000 and 500,000, and nonmetro\nareas are the remainder; see Weingarden (2017).\n17 This gap appears to be a post-crisis phenomenon for women, while for men the gap began to widen in the\n1990s.\n\n- 9 -\nbeyond these employment outcomes. Based on forthcoming SCF data, for example, the\naverage annual income for families in metro areas was about $54,000 higher than for\nfamilies in nonmetro areas, and the average wealth holdings for families in metro areas\nexceeded average wealth for families in nonmetro areas by nearly $500,000--and these\ngaps have more than doubled over the past three decades.18 The gaps in many other\nmeasures of well-being have widened as well. In small towns and rural areas, college\nattainment rates have increased by less, disability rates have increased by more, divorce\nrates have risen by more, and mortality due to lung disease, cancer, or cardiovascular\ndisease have either improved by less or worsened by more.19 Opioid use is also most\nprevalent in less populous metro and rural areas.20\nI have seen many of these challenges first hand. In the small towns and hollers of\neastern Kentucky, I visited with community development financial institutions that are\ntrying to plug the gap in access to credit so that small businesses can continue operating\nand hiring locally, and so that families can access housing that is safe and affordable. In\nrural communities in the Mississippi Delta, I learned about diminished access to financial\nservices available to rural residents, which can be a barrier to housing and business\ninvestment and pose vexing challenges to local governments. In Texas, I learned about\nbarriers to economic development in the rural colonias areas on the southern border\nassociated with underinvestment in physical and broadband infrastructure.21\n18 Staff estimates from forthcoming SCF data. Although the difference in average income and wealth has\ngrown, there has been little change in differences in median family income and wealth in larger metros\nrelative to other areas. The widening gap for average income and wealth, but not for median income and\nwealth, is because in larger metro areas income and wealth has become increasingly held by wealthier\nfamilies.\n19 These statistics are provided in Adamy and Overberg (2017).\n20 See Guy, Jr., and others (2017).\n21 See the Brainard (2017) speech on opportunity and inclusion.\n\n- 10 -\nAs we consider the long-term health of the U.S. economy, it is important to better\nunderstand the decade-long decline in aggregate labor force participation. It is striking\nthat in larger metro areas, the labor force participation rate for prime-age men has\nrecently retraced much of the decline experienced during the recession, while in smaller\nmetro and rural areas, the labor force participation rate remains well below its pre-\nrecession level, with only modest improvements of late. The evidence increasingly\nsuggests that much of the decline relates to a sustained decline in job opportunities for\nprime-age men, especially less-educated prime-age men, resulting in languishing wages\nrelative to other groups.22 Indeed, it is notable that the striking decrease in labor force\nparticipation rates for nonmetro areas relative to large metro areas is highly concentrated\namong adults with no more than a high school education, who comprise a larger share of\nthe prime-age population in nonmetro areas. The labor force participation rate for adults\nwith no more than a high school education has fallen to 72 percent in nonmetro areas--\nabout 3-1/2 percent below larger metro areas.23\nAlthough the precise causes of this decline are still not fully settled, one\ncontributing factor is advancing automation and computerization.24 Another contributor\nis globalization. For example, a growing body of research has identified a steeper decline\nin the employment and labor force attachment of prime-age men in areas of the country\n22 Most analysis suggests that at least half of the decline in the aggregate labor force participation rate since\n2007 is attributable to the aging of the population, with a significant portion of the decline that is not\nrelated to aging attributable to a longer-run decline in participation for younger individuals and prime-age\nmen; for example, see Aaronson and others (2014) and the Council of Economic Advisors (2014). For an\noverview of factors potentially attributable to the decline in labor force participation of prime-age men, see\nthe Council of Economic Advisors (2016).\n23 These estimates are based on data from Weingarden (2017).\n24 For an overview of factors that have potentially impacted job opportunities for this group, see Autor\n(2010). For examples of research on the recent labor market effects of technology and automation, see\nAutor, Dorn, and Hanson (2015) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017).\n\n- 11 -\nthat specialized in the industries that were most negatively affected by increased imports\nfrom China.25\nResearch suggests that some of the decline in prime-age labor force participation\nrelates to some individuals’ reduced ability or desire to work, in some cases resulting\ndirectly from the ongoing decline in job opportunities. There are many reasons why\nsome prime-age men may be less willing or able to work. One possibility is that the\nunusually long spells of nonemployment associated with the Great Recession may have\neroded job skills and informal employment networks. Another possibility that is\nincreasingly in focus is that physical disabilities, as well as sharp increases in opioid use,\nhave increasingly inhibited some individuals from participating in the labor force. The\nfraction of prime-age men receiving disability insurance benefits has increased from\n1 percent in the late 1970s to 3 percent more recently.26 Recent research also finds that\namong all prime-age men who are not in the labor force, about one-third reported having\nat least one disability, and nearly one-half reported taking pain medications daily.27\nThese supply-side explanations may be related to the drop in labor demand: the despair\nrelated to diminished prospects of a stable and quality job may lead to substance abuse\nand related health or mortality concerns.28\n25 For national-level estimates of the labor market effects from cheaper Chinese imports, see Pierce and\nSchott (2016a) and Acemoglu and others (2016). For evidence related to cross-country differences in these\neffects, see Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013), and Pierce and Schott (2016b).\n26 See Council of Economic Advisors (2016).\n27 Krueger (forthcoming) describes evidence from a variety of surveys showing that a significant fraction of\nprime-age men who are out of the labor force report having pain, being in poor health, or taking medication\nrelated to this pain, and that these behaviors are far more common among prime-age men than prime-age\nwomen.\n28 See Case and Deaton (2015, 2017).\n\n- 12 -\nAt least some of these explanations potentially relate to the growing divide\nbetween large metro areas and other areas of the country. As noted earlier, the opioid\nepidemic appears to be particularly acute in smaller cities and rural areas. In addition,\nemployment in non-metro areas tends to be more concentrated in manufacturing, which is\nthe sector that has experienced the largest decline in employment from automation and\nglobalization.29 Similarly, research suggests that workers in less populous areas have\nbeen more likely to be directly affected by increased import competition from China due\nto the geographical distribution of industries.30 And for many less populous areas, job\nopportunities are less diverse than in bigger cities, so that when a plant shuts down, there\nare fewer local alternative job opportunities for unemployed workers, especially with\ncomparable levels of employment security or benefits.\nThese striking results naturally raise the question of whether we are seeing\nheightened migration from the less populous areas to the larger metros with greater\neconomic opportunity. A conventional assumption in economics is that regional\ndifferences should narrow over time as workers move toward areas where jobs are more\nplentiful and wages are higher.31 In reality, Americans’ propensity to move is currently\nat its lowest level in many decades. In 2016, the fraction of the population that had\nmoved within the United States in the past year was 11 percent, down from 17 percent or\nmore in the early 1980s, with the steepest decline in the fraction of people moving longer\ndistances, across county or state lines.32 The evidence suggests that the decline in\n29 Based on staff analysis of publically available data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on\nmetropolitan and nonmetropolitan employment by industry.\n30 This observation reflects unpublished calculations from Pierce and Schott (2016b).\n31 See Blanchard and Katz (1992).\n32 Data on internal migration rates come from the Current Population Survey and are published annually by\nthe Census Bureau; see “Table A-1. Annual Geographic Mobility Rates, by Type of Movement: 1948-\n2016,” https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/historic.html.\n\n- 13 -\ngeographic mobility cannot be fully explained by population aging, by the housing boom\nand bust, by changes in the composition of industries, by the increasing ease of\ntelecommuting from longer distances, or by the rise in dual-earner households which may\nmake work-related relocation more difficult. Some of the decline may be related to\nchanges in the labor market, perhaps because workers are more likely to perceive that job\nopportunities are no better elsewhere, and consequently that the labor market returns to\nswitching jobs or locations--in terms of better wages or higher job quality--have\ndeclined.33 Also, zoning requirements may be boosting housing costs in cities where job\nopportunities are most abundant, such as San Francisco, pricing out many potential\nworkers and inhibiting migration.34\nWhatever the reason, the fact that families are less likely to move now than in the\npast suggests that many of those in less populous areas are not able to access the\neconomic opportunity present in denser and more diversified large metropolitan areas at a\ntime when the gap in labor market outcomes for larger metros relative to other areas\ncontinues to grow.\nFederal Reserve Work on Labor Market Disparities\nThe Federal Reserve is deeply engaged in understanding disparities through our\ndata collection, research collaboration, and community development work. One way the\nFederal Reserve seeks to obtain a clearer picture is by collecting data ourselves. For\ninstance, some of the data I have cited today come from the Federal Reserve’s triennial\nSurvey of Consumer Finances, which provides detailed information on income and\n33 For a discussion of the multidecade decline in internal migration and its potential causes, see Molloy,\nSmith, and Wozniak (2011, 2017) and Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2017).\n34 See Ganong and Shoag (2017) and Herkenhoff, Ohanian, and Prescott (2017).\n\n- 14 -\nwealth holdings by demographic groups. The Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, employment, housing, and\ndebt; the Survey of Young Workers provides insights into younger adults’ employment\nexperiences soon after entering the labor force; and the Enterprising and Informal Work\nActivities Survey provides information about income generating activities that are often\noutside the scope of other employment and income surveys.35\nAcross the Federal Reserve System, a variety of initiatives are aimed at\nunderstanding economic disparities and how to foster more-inclusive growth. The\nOpportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\nbrings together researchers from a variety of fields to analyze barriers to economic\nopportunity and advancement. The Economic Growth and Mobility Project at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia aims to bring together researchers with community\nstakeholders to focus on differences in poverty and economic mobility across\ndemographic characteristics. The Investing in America’s Workforce Initiative is a\ncollaboration between the Federal Reserve System and academic research institutions to\npromote investment in workforce skills that better align with employers’ needs.36\nAll of that brings me to today’s conference, which I am confident will make an\nimportant contribution to this mission. I am heartened to see so many researchers and\n35 Further information on these surveys are found on the Board’s website; see the Surveys of Consumer\nFinances, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm; the Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking, https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm; the Survey of Young\nWorkers, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2016-survey-young-workers-executive-\nsummary.htm; and the Survey of Enterprising and Informal Work Activities,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/files/EIWA_Chartbook_2016.pdf.\n36 For information about the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, see\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute, for information about the Economic Growth and Mobility\nProject, see https://www.philadelphiafed.org/egmp, and for information about the America’s Workforce\nInitiative, see https://www.investinwork.org.\n\n- 15 -\npractitioners from a variety of backgrounds focused on these important issues. This\nconference is part of our efforts to hear from experts with diverse backgrounds and\nperspectives to better understand the nature and implications of labor market disparities.\nA deeper understanding of labor market disparities is central to the mission of the\nFederal Reserve because it may help us better assess full employment, where resources\nmay be underutilized, and the likely evolution of the labor market and overall economic\nactivity. We look forward to hearing what you have to say about these important\nquestions and learning what other questions are in need of attention.\nNote: On September 27, 2017, a typo was corrected to change $25,000 to $54,000 in the following\nsentence on page 9: \"Based on forthcoming SCF data, for example, the average annual income for\nfamilies in metro areas was about $54,000 higher than for families in nonmetro areas, and the average\nwealth holdings for families in metro areas exceeded average wealth for families in nonmetro areas by\nnearly $500,000--and these gaps have more than doubled over the past three decades.\" The original\nnumber incorrectly stated the median instead of the mean.\n\n- 16 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-255, www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/labor-force-participation-\nrecent-developments-and-future-prospects.\nAcemoglu, Daron, David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon H.

This conference has established itself as\nan important venue for sharing research and exchanging ideas on how best to support the\nadvancement of low- and moderate-income communities.\nThe many economic decisions an individual makes early in his or her working\nlife--their first job, how much and what kind of an educational investment to make, how\nto finance that investment, whether to strike out on their own, and whether to rent or buy\na home--can have a lasting effect on their subsequent financial security and the economic\nfoundation they provide for their children. There are times, however, when larger forces\nmaterially interrupt or impede the individual efforts of young people to build a better\neconomic life. The Great Depression left an indelible imprint on the generation that\ncame of age in that era, influencing their subsequent job trajectories and attitudes toward\nrisk and investment. The question we face today is whether the Great Recession may\nsimilarly leave a lasting mark on the many Americans who came of age in its shadow.\nIt is important to understand the headwinds encountered by the Great Recession\ngeneration as they navigated a daunting job market, and the lessons they have taken from\nthe crisis, particularly with respect to investments in education and housing. And it is\nimportant to identify what actions can be taken to improve economic outcomes for the\nGreat Recession generation, as their experiences will powerfully influence not just\ngrowth today, but also the contours of opportunity faced by their children.\nEmployment and Participation in the Labor Force\nLet’s start by considering what it was like to graduate from high school or college\nin June 2009. The overall unemployment rate stood at 9.5 percent, and employers\n\n- 2 -\nslashed 500,000 jobs that month, the 18th month in a row of job cuts. For young people,\njob prospects were even bleaker. Nearly one-fourth of teenagers in the labor force were\nunemployed, and the unemployment rate for people between the ages of 20 and 24 stood\nat 15.2 percent. Young African Americans and Hispanics experienced higher rates of\nunemployment than their white peers.\nEven these painfully high unemployment rates--the highest since the early 1980s--\nunderstate the damage caused by the Great Recession to young people’s work lives. The\nlack of job opportunities appears to have caused many young people to become so\ndiscouraged that they dropped out of the labor force altogether, exacerbating a downtrend\nand driving labor force participation among young people to historical lows.\nEven for those who remained in the labor force and have been fortunate to find\nwork, compensation prospects have been poor. For example, inflation-adjusted full-time\nweekly earnings among 19- to 24-year-olds with only a high school diploma fell about\n5 percent between 2008 and 2012.1\nOf those who have found work, not only are many young people receiving low\nwages, but also many are working at jobs for which they are overqualified. A recent\nstudy by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that employers responded to the\nslack labor market by increasing the educational requirements or the number of years of\nexperience required for new hires, which likely froze out many from the labor pool and\nresulted in the underemployment of others.2 In 2012, roughly 45 percent of college\n1 The data, which consist of median usual weekly earnings for employed full-time wage and salary workers\nwho are 16 to 24 years old, are from the Current Population Survey (a joint effort between the Census\nBureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and are adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff to\nconstant 2009 dollars using the personal consumption expenditures index.\n2 See Alicia Sasser Modestino, Daniel Shoag, and Joshua Ballance (2015), “Upskilling: Do Employers\nDemand Greater Skill When Skilled Workers Are Plentiful?” Working Paper Series 14-17 (Boston:\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston, January), www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2014/wp1417.htm.\n\n- 3 -\ngraduates between the ages of 22 and 27 were underemployed, up by one-third relative to\n2001 and the highest underemployment rate since the early 1990s.3 Moreover, a recent\nstudy by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the Great\nRecession is prolonging the time it takes for a college graduate to settle into a career.4\nRecently, the labor market prospects for young people have started to improve,\nwith the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds falling about one-third relative to its\npeak and inflation-adjusted earnings starting to rise. Nevertheless, even with this recent\nimprovement, there is a risk that the high rates of unemployment, low labor force\nattachment, and stagnant wages experienced by those who have come of age in the years\nsurrounding the Great Recession may have long-lasting consequences. A number of\nstudies have found that graduating from college during a recession can have a lasting\neffect. If past studies hold true today, the employment rate of those graduating from\ncollege during the Great Recession may recover relatively soon, but their earnings may\nbe reduced for up to a decade or longer as this cohort initially secures lower-quality jobs\nand then only gradually works its way back up to the normal earnings trajectory.5 To the\nextent that these lost earnings translate into reductions in lifetime resources, they could\naffect life-cycle spending and investment decisions, topics that I will turn to next.\n3 See Jaison R. Abel, Richard Deitz, and Yaqin Su (2014), “Are Recent College Graduates Finding Good\nJobs?” Current Issues in Economics and Finance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, vol. 20 (1),\nwww.ny.frb.org/research/current_issues/ci20-1.html.\n4 See Abel, Deitz, and Su, “Are Recent College Graduates Finding Good Jobs?” in note 3.\n5 See Lisa B. Kahn (2010), “The Long-Term Labor Market Consequences of Graduating from College in a\nBad Economy,” Labour Economics, vol. 17 (April), pp. 303-16; Philip Oreopoulos, Till von Wachter, and\nAndrew Heisz (2012), “The Short- and Long-Term Career Effects of Graduating in a Recession,” American\nEconomic Journal: Applied Economics, vol. 4 (January), pp. 1-29.\n\n- 4 -\nEducation and Student Debt\nEnrollment in colleges and graduate schools increased sharply during the Great\nRecession. With skyrocketing youth unemployment and compensation under pressure,\nthe recession sharply reduced the opportunity costs of additional years of schooling.6 For\nmany, these additional educational investments are likely to be beneficial. Investing in\nadditional education is a classic way of mitigating the negative effects of graduating in a\nrecession, and empirical research suggests that the lifetime returns to completing a\ncollege degree are substantial on average.7\nAs with any investment, however, the returns on educational investments are not\nuniform, and some investments do not pay off. The risk of a low return is accentuated\nwhen the investment is financed through debt and based on the assumption that the\neducational investment will translate into higher wages that make the debt payments\naffordable.\nIndeed, student indebtedness rose sharply in the years surrounding the Great\nRecession.8 The capacity of many families to pay for tuition was substantially reduced\nby the declines in income and wealth associated with the housing crisis and the deep\nrecession. At the same time, public colleges and universities--long the most affordable\n6 Those graduating into a recession are slightly more likely to obtain an advanced degree.

Dettling, Alice Henriques, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, John Sabelhaus, Jeffrey\nThompson, and Richard A. Windle (2014), “Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013:\nEvidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 100 (September),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/pdf/scf14.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\noption for students--saw some of the steepest rises in tuition as a result of state and local\nbudget pressures due to the recession (and possibly reductions in quality in many cases).9\nThirty-seven states have cut per-student funding for higher education more than\n20 percent since the 2007-08 academic year, when the recession began. Since the outset\nof the recession, the annual published tuition at four-year public colleges increased\n24 percent, after adjusting for inflation, during a period when real median incomes\ndeclined 8 percent.10\nThis confluence of higher enrollments, higher tuitions, reduced family resources,\nand uneven job prospects has caused outstanding student loan balances to more than\ndouble since the start of the Great Recession.11 Moreover, this sharp rise in debt burdens\nis unevenly distributed across the population, with students from socioeconomically\ndisadvantaged backgrounds disproportionately likely to use debt to finance education. In\n2012, 79 percent of bachelor’s degree recipients whose parents made under $30,000\nincurred educational debt, compared with 55 percent of those whose parents had income\n9 See Michael Mitchell, Vincent Palacios, and Michael Leachman (2014), States Are Still Funding Higher\nEducation below Pre-Recession Levels (Washington: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities),\nwww.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=4135.\n10 The change in public tuition is for tuition and fees, excluding room and board, and is from the National\nCenter for Education Statistics website at\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_330.10.asp?current=yes. Published tuition rates do not\nreflect what students actually pay after financial aid and other assistance. The trend in real median income\ncomes from Carmen DeNavas-Walt and Bernadette D. Proctor (2014), Income and Poverty in the United\nStates: 2013 (Washington: United States Census Bureau),\nwww.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-249.pdf.\n11 The total amount of outstanding student debt, $1.2 trillion in 2014, is a reflection of both the high cost\nand the substantial rise in the number of students borrowing to go to school--some 41.5 million, compared\nwith 22 million in 2004.\n\n- 6 -\nover $106,000.12 Even adjusting for family income, it appears that, on average,\nminorities make greater use of student loan debt than their white counterparts.13\nIn most cases, the investments in education undertaken during the Great\nRecession will turn out to be positive over the longer term, even for individuals with\nloans to pay off. However, there are several factors that might substantially reduce the\nexpected return of some of these educational investments. The first important\ndeterminant of whether an investment in education pays off is whether it leads to the\nsuccessful completion of a degree. Recent data suggest that fewer than 60 percent of\nstudents who have started a bachelor’s degree program graduate with their degree, and\nonly 30 percent of those who have started an associate’s degree or certificate program\nwill finish their degree.14 The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Household Economics\nand Decisionmaking (SHED) indicated that students who had not completed a degree\nconsider the cost of the education not to have been worth the investment by significantly\nlarger margins than those who had.15\n12 See Sandy Baum, Diane Cardenas Elliott, and Jennifer Ma (2014), Trends in Student Aid 2014 (New\nYork: College Board), http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid.\n13 For example, among families earning between $60,000 and $99,999, 76 percent of African American\nbachelor’s degree recipients graduate with student loan debt, compared with 66 percent of Hispanic\ngraduates and 64 percent of white graduates. See Sandy Baum and Patricia Steele (2010), “Who Borrows\nMost? Bachelor’s Degree Recipients with High Levels of Student Debt,” Trends in Higher Education\nSeries (New York: College Board), https://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/trends-2010-who-\nborrows-most-brief.pdf.\n14 Bachelor’s degree graduation rates are within six-year graduation rates for the 2007 entering cohort.\nAssociate’s degree and certificate completion rates are for within 150 percent of normal completion time\nfor the 2007 entering cohort. See table 326.10 and table 326.20 in the “Digest of Education Statistics”\nsection of the National Center for Education Statistics website at\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2014menu_tables.asp.\n15 See table 11 in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), Report on the Economic\nWell-Being of U.S. Households in 2013 (Washington: Board of Governors, July),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201407.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nA second important determinant is the type of educational program, as there is\nwide variation in rates of return across different programs. For example, recent research\nhas shown that for-profit colleges, on average, tend to provide a lower rate of return for\neducational investment than public or not-for-profit colleges and universities. Young\nadults who attended for-profit colleges are also more likely to default on their student\nloans, even after completing four or more years of education.16 Unfortunately, the\nstudents who are the first in their family to attend college are more likely than others to\nattend for-profit colleges.17\nDespite the apparent lower likely average return to education at for-profit schools,\nattendance at these schools has increased faster since the financial crisis than at other\ninstitutions. Attendance at for-profit schools increased over 50 percent between 2007 and\n2012--far outpacing the 10 percent growth in enrollments seen over this period at not-for-\nprofit and public institutions. This rapid growth, and the fact that for-profit colleges\ndisproportionately attract first-generation college students as well as students relying on\ndebt to fund their education, bears careful scrutiny.18\nOverall, the added educational investments made by the Great Recession\ngeneration could be a positive legacy of the crisis over the long term. But for some, the\nreturns may not turn out to be worth the cost. For this group, the burden associated with\n16 See Stephanie Riegg Cellini and Latika Chaudhary (2012), “The Labor Market Returns to a For-Profit\nCollege Education,” NBER Working Paper Series 18343 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, August); David J. Deming, Claudia Goldin, and Lawrence F. Katz (2012), “The For-\nProfit Postsecondary School Sector: Nimble Critters or Agile Predators?” Journal of Economic\nPerspectives, vol. 26 (Winter), pp. 139-64; and\nKevin Lang and Russell Weinstein (2012), “Evaluating Student Outcomes at For-Profit Colleges,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 18201 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, June).\n17 See Riegg Cellini and Chaudhary, “The Labor Market Returns”; Deming, Goldin, and Katz, “The For-\nProfit Postsecondary School Sector”; and Lang and Weinstein, “Evaluating Student Outcomes,” all in\nnote 16.\n18 See Lang and Weinstein, “Evaluating Student Outcomes,” in note 16.\n\n- 8 -\nstudent debt may constrain their economic opportunities for years to come. Borrowers\nwho struggle to repay student loans face special challenges because student loans cannot\nbe discharged in bankruptcy, unlike other forms of household credit.19 Fortunately,\nlargely because of significant policy changes, beginning in the 2008-09 school year, the\nvast majority of student loans have been originated directly by the federal government\nand have flexible repayment and deferment options.20 Nonetheless, high levels of student\nindebtedness appear to be one factor influencing the Great Recession generation’s slow\nprogression into homeownership.\nHousehold Formation and Homeownership\nSharply lower household formation and homeownership rates are among the most\nstriking legacies of the Great Recession, distinct from earlier recessions. The number of\nhouseholds formed each year dropped by more than half, from about 1.35 million in the\nearly and middle 2000s to about 600,000 households per year after 2007. Moreover, the\nfraction of young adults who own homes also fell substantially: After peaking at\n19 11 U.S. Code § 523(a)(8) prevents education debt from being discharged in bankruptcy unless the debtor\nproves that paying the debt would “impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents.”\nFor the complete 11 U.S. Code § 523(a)(8), see the U.S. Government Publishing Office website at\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2011-title11/USCODE-2011-title11-chap5-subchapII-sec523.\n20 The Great Recession also affected the way students borrowed to pay for college as private lenders\ntightened underwriting standards. Private lenders originated more than $20 billion in student loans during\nthe 2007-08 academic year. However, that figure fell to about $9.4 billion in the following year and\nreached just $5.6 billion in the 2010-11 academic year. During that same period, total federal loans\noriginated increased from $49 billion to $76 billion. Federal student loan programs also changed\nsignificantly during this time. In 2010, the Congress eliminated the Federal Family Education Loan\nProgram, which provided a federal guarantee for student loans originated by private lenders, leading to a\nsharp increase in the number of students borrowing directly from the U.S. Department of Education\nthrough the Federal Direct Loan Program. In 2012, the Obama Administration created the Pay As You\nEarn program, which caps loan payments at 10 percent of discretionary income for eligible borrowers. The\nfollowing year, the Congress changed the method for determining Direct Loan interest rates--switching\nfrom a rate set by statute to a rate pegged to the 10-year Treasury note plus a markup.\n\n- 9 -\n22 percent in 2005, the overall rate of homeownership among young people fell to\n16 percent in 2014.21\nThe combination of high educational debt levels and poor job market prospects\nfaced by young adults entering the workforce in the aftermath of the financial crisis are\nthe most likely causes of these sharp declines.22 Indeed, the share of adults under\n30 living with parents or other family members rose significantly in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis and has remained at a high level.23 The SHED found that, among\nindividuals who live with their extended family or with roommates, over half are doing\nso to save money, and nearly three-fourths would move out on their own if they could\nafford to do so. Federal Reserve research also indicates that debt is an important\ndeterminant of whether a young person lives with their parents, even after controlling for\nlabor and housing market conditions.24 That analysis also indicates that credit\ndelinquency and lower credit scores increase the propensity for adult children to move\nhome as well as the length of time that young people live with their parents.\n21 For those young adults who have formed a household, the rate of homeownership increased by about\n6 percentage points from 1995 to 2005, peaking at 37 percent in 2005, and has subsequently fallen sharply\nto below 30 percent today. The data consist of Board staff calculations using the Census Bureau’s\nhousehold vacancy survey.\n22 See William R. Emmons and Bryan J. Noeth (2014), “Despite Aggressive Deleveraging, Generation X\nRemains ‘Generation Debt’,” In the Balance: Perspectives on Household Balance Sheets, Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis, Issue 9 (August), www.stlouisfed.org/publications/in-the-balance/issue9-2014/despite-\naggressive-deleveraging-generation-x-remains-generation-debt; J.

That\nfraction gradually trended up through the early 2000s, then increased sharply to more than 45 percent by\n2012 and has not appreciably declined since then. The data consist of Board staff calculations using the\nAnnual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey.\n24 See Lisa J. Dettling and Joanne W. Hsu (2014), “Returning to the Nest: Debt and Parental Co-Residence\namong Young Adults,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2014-80 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, September),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2014/files/201480pap.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nHowever, it is possible that, even after improving economic prospects help young\npeople overcome these impediments and boost household formation rates,\nhomeownership rates among the Great Recession generation could lag. Young people’s\nattitudes toward homebuying may have changed as a result of witnessing their parents’\nexperiences during the housing crisis. Instead of seeing homeownership as a reliably safe\ninvestment, many of today’s young adults may now see some risk that houses could\nbecome financial albatrosses due to events beyond their control. If this is the case, the\nGreat Recession cohort may be slower to buy a home than previous cohorts, even after\nmeeting their pre-recession career and earnings expectations. Indeed, research suggests\nthat dramatic economic events, such as the Great Depression, can have a significant\neffect on individuals’ risk-taking over their lifetime.25\nMoreover, there is some evidence that today’s young people have a skeptical view\nof the wisdom of buying a home as a result of the housing crisis. The percentage of\nrenters in the 18-to-34 age group who thought housing was a safe investment dropped\nsignificantly from 2003 to the first quarter of this year, from 85 percent to 59 percent,\nrespectively.26 Of course, it is premature to conclude that the financial crisis has\npermanently altered young people’s attitudes toward housing investments, and several\nsurveys indicate that young people continue to express a desire to become homeowners\nsomeday.\n25 See Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel (2009), “Depression Babies: Do Macroeconomic Experiences\nAffect Risk-Taking?” NBER Working Paper Series 14813 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, March).\n26 The data are from results of the Fannie Mae National Housing Survey, which were provided directly to\nthe Federal Reserve. The relevant survey question asked respondents, “Do you think homeownership is a\nsafe investment (with a lot of potential or very little potential) or a risky investment (with very little\npotential or a lot of potential)?”\n\n- 11 -\nNonetheless, if the decline in homeownership among young people proves\npersistent, the implications for asset building for the future could be of concern, since\nhomeownership remains an important avenue for accumulating wealth, particularly for\nthose with limited means. Even after taking into account the risks associated with\nhomeownership that were brought into sharp focus by the financial crisis, there is still a\nstrong case that homeownership positively contributes to household balance sheets.27\nThe benefit is largely due to the forced savings associated with homeownership--not just\nfor the down payment, but also for the regular monthly paydown of principal. While\nrenters could, in theory, save and invest money on a monthly basis to achieve a similar\nresult, the evidence suggests most do not.\nMoreover, study after study has shown that homeownership positively contributes\nto the wealth accumulation of lower-income and minority households, albeit in smaller\namounts than for higher-income and white households.28 This finding is particularly\nimportant because housing also accounts for the majority of the assets held by these\nhouseholds. Lower-income and minority renters, on the other hand, have been found to\naccrue little or no wealth over time.29\n27 See Christopher E. Herbert, Daniel T. McCue, and Rocio Sanchez-Moyano (2013), “Is Homeownership\nStill an Effective Means of Building Wealth for Low-Income and Minority Households? (Was it Ever?),”\npaper presented at “Homeownership Built to Last: Lessons from the Housing Crisis on Sustaining\nHomeownership for Low-Income and Minority Families,” a symposium held at the Harvard Business\nSchool, Boston, April 1-2, www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/jchs.harvard.edu/files/hbtl-06.pdf.\n28 See Christopher E. Herbert and Eric Belsky (2006), The Homeownership Experience of Low-Income and\nMinority Families: A Review and Synthesis of the Literature (Washington: U.S. Department of Housing\nand Urban Development, February), www.huduser.org/portal/publications/homeown/hisp_homeown9.html.\n29 See Herbert and Belsky, The Homeownership Experience of Low-Income and Minority Families, in\nnote 28.\n\n- 12 -\nThe Great Recession Generation and Economic Mobility\nToday’s young people are the fulcrum of the economic mobility agenda. Those\nwho have come of age in the shadow of the Great Recession have experienced substantial\nrisks and faced daunting challenges in establishing themselves independently in their\nwork lives and their home lives. By studying these effects and the actions that can\nsupport the resilience of the Great Recession generation, we will strengthen not only\ntoday’s recovery, but also the opportunities facing tomorrow’s children.\nSo it is particularly heartening that, despite the challenges of coming of age in the\nGreat Recession, today’s young adults--including minorities--remain optimistic about\ntheir future.30 The challenge for practitioners and the research community is to deliver\non this youthful optimism through policies and opportunities that promote strong and\nequitable economic growth.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee has been playing an important role by\npursuing policies aimed at achieving maximum employment in the context of price\nstability. Monetary policy has remained accommodative over an extended period, which\nhas supported labor market recovery--with significant improvement in overall\nunemployment, increases in job openings, and recent declines in underemployment--\nwhile inflation has remained below its target. In addition, the Federal Reserve System,\nthrough its research and analysis of economic data, provides important insights on the\ndynamics of the labor market, investments in education, and the housing sector.\n30 See Paul Taylor, Kim Parker, Rakesh Kochhar, Richard Fry, Cary Funk, Eileen Patten, and Seth Motel\n(2012), Young, Underemployed and Optimistic: Coming of Age, Slowly, in a Tough Economy\n(Washington: Pew Research Center, February 9), www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/09/young-\nunderemployed-and-optimistic.\n\n- 13 -\nThe community development staff at the Board and the 12 Federal Reserve\nBanks--the organizers of this conference--complement traditional research with applied\nfield research and outreach. Before wrapping up, I want to touch briefly on a handful of\nthe System’s many community development initiatives that focus on the post-crisis needs\nof young people.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland recently published an analysis of\nemployment and education patterns for non-college-bound workers in the Fourth\nDistrict’s metropolitan area as part of ongoing efforts to improve high school graduation\nrates and facilitate workforce development in line with local labor market demand.31\nCleveland’s analysis emphasizes the importance of investing in primary and secondary\neducation, as well as technical education beyond high school, to ensure high school\ngraduates possess the strong analytical and soft skills and the guidance they need to\naccess technical and service jobs that can provide an on-ramp to the middle class.\nThe Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and San Francisco are developing an\nonline course, Life after High School, to help students navigate their first major financial\ndecision--choosing the path to pursue after high school. The course encourages students\nto explore a number of educational paths and job options and provides them with\ninformation on how investing in education can contribute to their future well-being.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, for its part, has focused attention on\nstrengthening the financial capability of community college students. It has recently\n31 See Lisa Nelson and Francisca Richter (2014), “The Prospects of Non-College-Bound Workers in the\nFourth District,” A Look Behind the Numbers (Cleveland: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\nFebruary 10),\nwww.clevelandfed.org/en/Newsroom%20and%20Events/Publications/A%20Look%20Behind%20The%20\nNumbers/A%20Look%20Behind%20the%20Numbers/The%20Prospects%20of%20Non-College-\nBound%20Workers%20in%20the%20Fourth%20District.aspx.\n\n- 14 -\npublished Promoting Pathways to Financial Stability, a handbook designed for\ncommunity college personnel and others interested in helping students learn to manage\ntheir financial lives.32\nAs the economic recovery continues to strengthen, it is important that we monitor\nthe progress of young workers and their experience in the job market, their educational\noutcomes, their management of student debt, and their progress toward forming\nindependent households and owning homes. Understanding the interaction of various\neconomic pressures on young workers is the first step. The ultimate goal is to develop\nevidence-based policies and opportunities to support the generation that has come of age\nin the shadow of the Great Recession as they gain a foothold on the ladder to a better\neconomic future.\n32 See Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (2015), Promoting Pathways to Financial Stability: A Resource\nHandbook on Building Financial Capabilities of Community College Students (Boston: Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston), available at www.bostonfed.org/education/financial-capabilities/handbook/index.htm.",

For the first time, the CRA will provide powerful\nincentives for banks to make investments in communities that do not have access to\nbranches, such as in Native lands.\nAs representatives of Native communities, you know all too well the challenges\nfaced by Native communities in getting access to financial services—challenges that\nwere made worse by the pandemic. I have visited with Native communities in South\nDakota and Oklahoma and seen firsthand the resiliency and innovation of these\ncommunities in the face of numerous challenges.2 Even with the implementation of the\nCRA and other complementary laws, tribal economic inclusion is hindered by a lack of\nbanking and credit access. As of the most recent 2019 data, over 16 percent of Native\n1 I am grateful to Amanda Roberts and Matthew Lambert of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance\nin preparing this text. The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the\nFederal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Lael Brainard, “Financial Inclusion and Economic Challenges in the Shadow of the Pandemic: A\nConversation with Tribal Leaders” (speech at Fed Listens: Roundtable with Oklahoma Tribal Leaders,\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma, October 13, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20211013a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nAmericans are unbanked—three times higher than the rate for all U.S. households.3 In\npart, the large share that is unbanked reflects low access to a bank branch. As of 2021,\nmajority-Native American counties have an average of only two and a half bank\nbranches—less than one-tenth the 26-branch overall average for all counties nationwide.4\nNative small businesses often struggle to access capital: CRA small business and small\nfarm lending per capita in majority-Native American census tracts is only about a quarter\nof that in majority-White-non-Hispanic tracts.5\nAs representatives of Native communities, you bring valuable insights to CRA\nreform because of your extensive knowledge of the investment and credit needs of Native\ncommunities, citizens, and businesses. The interagency CRA proposal was informed by\nconsultation with Native representatives through roundtables, listening sessions,\nmeetings, and comment letters. Indeed, we took much of your feedback from comment\nletters to develop the Native Land Areas sections of this proposal. As a result of this\nvaluable feedback, the interagency CRA proposal would provide additional scope for\nbank loans, investments, and services in Native communities. Today, I want to focus on\nseveral aspects of the proposal that are beneficial for Native communities.\nFirst, the proposal provides greater incentives for community investments in\nNative Land Areas by providing enhanced clarity and specificity about what activities\nqualify for CRA credit. The proposed activities in Native Land Areas cover four specific\nplace-based categories: revitalization; essential community facilities; essential\n3 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and\nFinancial Services,” FDIC Survey (2019), https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/.\n4 Information calculated using Summary of Deposits (SoD) 2021. Note that not all counties, especially\nsome with high Native American populations, exist in the SoD dataset.\n5 Federal Reserve Board staff analyzed annually reported CRA Small Business and Small Farm loan data\nsubmitted by banks at the tract level and combined it with demographic data from the American\nCommunity Survey 2015-2019 5-Year Survey.\n\n- 3 -\ncommunity infrastructure; and disaster preparedness and climate resiliency. The proposal\nalso incorporates a new definition of Native Land Areas based on the political status and\ngovernment recognition of tribes and tribal areas that would enable the qualification of\nplace-based activities in Native Land Areas.\nThe proposal also provides clarity for Native community development financial\ninstitutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs). Recognizing that\nNative CDFIs and MDIs are critical players in supporting credit access and investment in\nNative communities, the proposal provides additional certainty that activities with\nTreasury-certified CDFIs will qualify for CRA consideration and provides greater clarity\nto banks on receiving credit for activities with MDIs.\nThe agencies also propose maintaining a publicly available illustrative list of\neligible community development activities, which provides an opportunity to highlight\nqualifying activities particularly responsive to the needs of Native communities.\nIn another important change, the proposal would result in greater CRA activity\noutside of where banks have branches and physical locations in order to address unmet\nneeds in communities that have more limited access to bank branches. To this end, we\nalso propose evaluating the impact and responsiveness of a bank’s community\ndevelopment activities through a series of specific qualitative factors, with activities\nbenefitting Native communities as one of those specific factors.\nIn addition, now that many banks conduct significant lending and investments\noutside of their branch networks, it is important to ensure CRA accounts for these\ndifferent business models. For example, we propose establishing retail lending\n\n- 4 -\nassessment areas where a large bank has a concentration of either 100 mortgage loans or\n250 small business loans for two years in a row.\nFinally, the proposal would continue to emphasize a bank’s performance in the\nlocal communities where it maintains branches, regardless of their performance in other\nareas. In addition to assessing a large bank’s retail lending and community development\nactivities in each facility-based assessment area, we also propose to evaluate whether\nbanks have branches in low-income and moderate-income census tracts. In particular, the\nagencies propose providing positive qualitative consideration if banks operate branches\nlocated in Native Land Areas.\nIn closing, your feedback is key to ensuring that we get CRA reform right. I\nstrongly encourage you to submit a comment letter by the August 5th deadline. We look\nforward to reading each comment letter and deeply appreciate your insight and\nparticipation with us through the rulemaking process. Thank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:45 a.m. EDT\nMarch 12, 2019\nThe Community Reinvestment Act:\nHow Can We Preserve What Works and Make it Better?\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2019 Just Economy Conference\nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 12, 2019\n\nIt is a pleasure to have an opportunity to discuss how we can preserve what is\nworking well with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and make it better.1 In\nrecent months, we have seen a high level of engagement from banks and community\norganizations in discussions and comments about revising the CRA regulations, which\nserves as testament to the value of the CRA and provides valuable suggestions for\nimproving our regulatory approach. The one message that comes through most clearly is\nthat the CRA is highly valued by bankers and community groups alike. A second\nmessage is that the CRA could be even more effective in mobilizing community and\neconomic development.\nPurpose and History\nBefore offering some thoughts on what we have learned and some possible ways\nforward, I want to begin by recalling why the CRA was established and what it was\ndesigned to achieve, as well as the important role it has played for over 40 years in low-\nand moderate-income communities across this country.\nThe CRA was one of several landmark pieces of legislation to address inequities\nin the credit markets in the wake of the civil rights movement. The Fair Housing Act of\n1968 and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 addressed lending discrimination in\nmortgage and consumer credit based on race, sex, and other personal characteristics,\nwhile the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) of 1975 and later amendments\nrecognized the importance of data in making these laws enforceable. In 1977, Congress\npassed the CRA to address the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\n1 I am grateful to Theresa Stark of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing this text.\nThese remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nWith the passage of the CRA, Congress aimed to reverse the urban disinvestment from\nyears of government policies and market actions that deprived lower-income areas of\ncredit by redlining--using red-inked lines to set apart neighborhoods that were deemed\ntoo risky.\nThe CRA is unique in important ways. Unlike previous government efforts to\naddress the needs of lower-income areas, the CRA puts decisionmaking about a\ncommunity’s needs and priorities in the hands of local actors. By stipulating that banks\nhave an affirmative and continuing obligation to meet the credit needs of all segments of\nthe local communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income\ncommunities, the CRA changed the way banks approach their lending and investment\ndecisions in those communities. More than 40 years later, the CRA continues to animate\na vibrant community development ecosystem connecting community members with the\nbanks that lend and invest, community organizations that deliver services and develop\nhousing, and state and local governments that direct incentives and subsidies. We\nparticipate actively through our community development and examination staff around\nthe country, who help to connect stakeholders, analyze community needs, and assess\noutcomes.\nA second unique feature is the public nature of evaluations. The CRA, as\namended in 1989, directs federal regulators to evaluate banks’ records of helping to meet\nthe credit needs of their local communities and assign one of four statutorily mandated\nratings to their performance.2 Following additional amendments in 1991, the law\n2 The banking agencies are the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The ratings are: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and\nSubstantial Non-compliance.\n\n- 3 -\nrequires that the agencies make public the banks’ ratings and the analysis supporting\nthem. The public nature of CRA evaluations provides a strong incentive for good\nperformance as well as a platform for public input on community needs.\nOpportunities for Improvement\nCongress largely left it to the banking agencies to describe in regulations how\nthey would evaluate a bank’s CRA performance. This flexibility is valuable because it\nenables the agencies to revise the implementing regulations from time to time to keep the\nCRA relevant in response to technological innovation and other changes in the landscape\nfor banking and community development financing.3\nThe agencies have discussed revising the CRA regulations on and off since 2010,\nwhen interagency hearings were held in several locations across the country. Last\nAugust, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued an Advance Notice\nof Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to request comments on a variety of questions related\nto defining the areas in which regulators evaluate a bank’s CRA performance, clarifying\nand expanding the types of activities that are eligible for CRA consideration, and\nestablishing a metrics-based approach to rating a bank’s CRA performance, among other\nthings. The OCC received nearly 1,500 comment letters in response to the ANPR, and\nwe have been reading those letters with great interest.\nTo augment this analysis, since October, the Federal Reserve System has held\nmore than 25 outreach meetings across the country with banks and community\n3 The current regulatory structure dates back to 1995 when the agencies reworked the regulations to provide\nfor a variety of evaluation methods for banks of different sizes and business strategies and set out criteria\nby which a bank’s lending, investment, and service activities in its community are evaluated. There were\nfurther regulatory revisions in 2005.\n\n- 4 -\norganizations, including representation from the other banking agencies, culminating in\nan in-depth research symposium at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nSeveral themes are emerging from the comment letters and outreach. Perhaps\nmost important, stakeholders overwhelmingly support the CRA and its goals, noting a\nsignificant increase in loans and investments in low- and moderate-income communities\nsince the law’s enactment. Many commenters emphasize the importance of the CRA in\nsupporting a vital community development ecosystem by bringing together banks,\ncommunity organizations, state and local governments, educators, foundations, and other\nstakeholders to address community and economic development needs. Many cautioned\nthe banking agencies to proceed carefully so as not to disturb this important ecosystem. I\nshare this commitment to the CRA and to strengthening its role in community and\neconomic development in the low- and moderate-income communities where it can make\nthe greatest difference.\nDefining a Bank’s Community: Where Activities Count\nBanks and community organizations agree that the regulations should better\nreflect the way in which banking products and services are currently delivered. Much has\nchanged since the last major revision to the CRA regulations, which occurred at a time\nwhen physical branches were essential for all the deposit and lending needs of bank\ncustomers. The current definition of a bank’s assessment area--the area in which a\nbank’s performance is assessed--relies on the area around its main branches and deposit-\ntaking automated teller machines (ATMs), which includes a substantial portion of its\nlending. The internet was just becoming available for commercial use when the current\nassessment area regulations were finalized. Since that time, technology and changing\n\n- 5 -\nconsumer preferences have led to banks gathering deposits and making loans well outside\nof their physical branches--for example, online and via mobile devices. So it is fair to ask\nwhether the CRA’s current assessment area definition adequately reflects the community\na bank serves today.\nClearly, it is time to better define the area in which the agencies evaluate a bank’s\nCRA activities, but it is important to retain a focus on the credit needs of local\ncommunities. As tempting as it may be to think that digital channels have rendered bank\nbranches unnecessary, my discussions with banks and community stakeholders around\nthe country have underscored the importance of branches as a venue for banks to engage\nwith their communities. Branches are the places that provide the personal face-to-face\nassistance valued by many consumers and business customers. Moreover, branches\nprovide a local presence for lenders to get to know the borrowers and the communities in\nwhich they live, lend, and invest. While technology has much to offer by way of\nconvenience and customer experience, it is often a complement to rather than a\nreplacement for bank branches. For this reason, and to be true to the original intent of the\nlaw, I believe that CRA evaluations should retain a focus on the credit needs of the local\ncommunities banks serve as indicated by their physical presence in those areas, but not be\nlimited to where they have a physical presence.\nEach quarter, I have been fortunate to make community visits around the country\nalong with Board and Reserve Bank community development staff. I have seen\nfirsthand the success of the CRA in bringing banks to the table along with community\norganizations to address complex community needs. Recently, I met with bankers in\nDenver, Colorado, who were working with local government officials and nonprofits to\n\n- 6 -\nmaintain affordable housing near newly developed public transit lines. In North St.\nLouis, I met with a community bank that was working with a place-based community\ndevelopment organization called Better Family Life to develop a micro-loan fund that is\nempowering low-income entrepreneurs.\nIn other places, particularly in high-poverty and rural areas, I saw firsthand how\ndifficult it can be to get access to basic banking services. In a visit to the Mississippi\nDelta in 2016, I heard from community members about having to drive long distances to\ndeposit a check or access an ATM. The same was true for my visits to Pine Ridge, South\nDakota and some towns in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. There is a complex\nbalancing between banks’ need to operate branches profitably with communities’ needs\nto connect to the financial mainstream, which we want to recognize in any revisions to\nthe CRA regulations. Bankers and other commenters have emphasized the high value\nthat bank branches have for retail customers and small business owners in underserved\ncommunities, and research corroborates this.\nSimilar to banks, community organization commenters support updating the CRA\nregulations as they relate to a bank’s assessment area. They suggest retaining assessment\nareas around a bank’s branches in order to retain the CRA’s focus on local low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods, while adding areas where banks conduct significant\nactivity without branches.\nBoth bank and community organization commenters were open to having a larger\narea defined for the purposes of pursuing meaningful community development activities,\nparticularly in cases where banks operate largely without branches. By allowing for more\nactivity in a broader geographic area, they argue that the artificial competition for\n\n- 7 -\ninvestments in areas served by several banks (such as New York or Salt Lake City)--so-\ncalled credit hot spots--could be mitigated. This could be to the benefit of credit deserts--\nthose perennially underserved rural areas or small metropolitan areas that may not have a\nbank branch or, if they do, may not constitute a major market for purposes of banks’\nCRA evaluations.\nIn reflecting on these suggestions, we have been considering a possible approach\nthat might rework the assessment area definition so that banks of a certain scale would\nhave separate assessment areas for their retail activities and their community\ndevelopment activities. This would retain the law’s focus on the credit needs of a bank’s\nlocal community by evaluating the retail lending and services it offers in the county or\nother geographic area surrounding its branches, deposit-taking ATMs, and other\nconcentrations of lending and deposit-taking.4\nAs part of this approach, a bank would get CRA consideration for community\ndevelopment activities in a more expansive area. Under the current rule, there is no ex\nante certainty that a bank’s community development activities will receive CRA\nconsideration if they are in the broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank’s\nassessment area. This current approach has proven challenging in practice, as banks\nsometimes invest in a community development activity only to find that their examiner\ndoesn’t agree that the activity is located within the bank’s assessment area.\nCommunity development activities, in order to achieve an appropriate scale, often\noperate in larger areas that may not neatly overlap with a bank’s assessment area. A\nmore expansive and ex ante clearer community development assessment area definition\n4 The agencies could consider requiring assessment areas around a bank’s other physical locations, such as\nloan production or trust offices, or in areas where the bank has significant deposit or lending activity.\n\n- 8 -\nwould afford CRA consideration for any such activity in a state where the bank has an\nassessment area. This approach would help eliminate uncertainty and could encourage\nmore capital for affordable housing, community facilities, and economic development\nactivities in underserved areas. Moreover, a broader assessment area for community\ndevelopment activities could help address the concentration of investment dollars in\nmetropolitan areas where several banks may have branches, while other smaller\nmetropolitan and rural areas remain chronically underserved.\nMy recent visit to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota brought home the\nimportance of addressing the problem of credit hot spots and deserts that result from the\nCRA’s current assessment area definition. I met with the Thunder Valley Community\nDevelopment Corporation and viewed their impressive 34-acre mixed-use project to\ncreate a new commercial center for the reservation. When completed, it will include\nsingle-family and multifamily housing units, a boarding house for visitors, a community\ncenter, and a retail shopping area in a community where residents currently must drive an\nhour to reach a grocery store. In examining a list of all the project funders, it was\nnoticeable that there were active financing commitments from many foundations, but no\nbanks. Although this is likely to be a very impactful investment, there is only one bank\ncurrently whose assessment area may extend to Pine Ridge. In contrast, under the\nproposed community development assessment area approach, more of the banks with\nbranches in Aberdeen, South Dakota, for instance, might be inclined to make such a\ncommunity development loan with confidence it would get CRA consideration.\nBy creating separate assessment areas for retail and community development\nactivities, we believe that banks would continue to place their community at the center of\n\n- 9 -\ntheir retail lending and service activities while participating in meaningful community\ndevelopment opportunities that may have greater impact due to their broader reach.\nEvaluating Community Development Performance: What Counts\nIn reflecting on the comments, listening sessions, and research conference, we\nhave also been contemplating approaches to what community development activities\ncount in order to provide greater predictability and better incentives. Banks and\ncommunity organizations have noted that the current structure of the large bank\nperformance tests may actually hinder community development financing in a couple of\nways. First, under the existing approach, community development loans are considered\nin the lending test, while community development investments are considered in a\nseparate test. A number of banks and community organizations argue that the form of\ncommunity financing may be influenced more by the structure of the CRA performance\ntests than by what makes the most sense for the project. For example, if a bank is\nconcerned about passing its lending test, it might structure financing as a loan rather than\nan investment to beef up its lending test performance even if an investment would be\nmore effective.\nSecond, a number of banks and community organizations pressed the case for\ngiving CRA consideration to any community development loan outstanding, rather than\nonly those originated since the bank’s last CRA evaluation. Under the current rule, banks\noften make short-term, renewable community development loans simply to ensure that\nthe incremental lending receives CRA consideration at each examination. By contrast,\nwhen it comes to investments, all investments on the bank’s books at the time of the\nevaluation are given consideration. Banks and community organizations alike make a\n\n- 10 -\ncompelling argument that all types of community development finance, whether in the\nform of a loan or an investment, have greater impact when they serve as patient, reliable,\ncommitted sources of financing.\nOne possible approach to address these distortions and provide more effective\nincentives is to create a separate, comprehensive community development test to evaluate\ncommunity development loans and qualified investments through a similar lens, possibly\nalong with community development services. A separate, comprehensive community\ndevelopment test could encourage banks to provide the patient, committed financing--in\nthe form of loans as well as investments--that community development organizations\nvalue the most. This is important because banks are uniquely situated to evaluate the\ncommunity development finance projects in the states where they operate and to provide\nthe smaller, more complex, and often more impactful, investments that don’t attract\ninstitutional investors. If banks cannot be confident ex ante that they will get the benefit\nof CRA consideration for these efforts, which may be time-consuming to evaluate and\nstructure, it is not surprising they would instead gravitate toward activities they know will\ncount.5\nIn addition to these broad changes to what and how community development\nactivities should be counted, we recognize there are several definitional issues that merit\nconsideration. For example, many commenters advocated for an expansion of the\ndefinition of “community development” to include loans to or investments in community\n5 We recognize that the agencies will need to give careful consideration to how to weight community\ndevelopment loans, investments, and services, so as not to harm the complex system of community\ndevelopment financing that is dependent largely on CRA-motivated investments.\n\n- 11 -\ndevelopment financial institutions (CDFIs), regardless of the bank’s assessment area,\nbecause the sole purpose of CDFIs is community development. There are also\nsuggestions that in high-poverty rural areas, where incomes overall may be low relative\nto federal benchmarks, it may be helpful to adjust the definition of what qualifies as low-\nand moderate-income so that more CRA activity receives consideration, which we will\nstudy.\nTailoring\nRecognition of the variation in how banks deliver their products and services\nbrings me to the third theme expressed by both banks and community organizations,\nwhich is the need for the CRA regulations to be flexible enough to evaluate banks of\nwidely different sizes and business strategies. Different perspectives were offered about\nsome aspects of how to better tailor the regulations, particularly with regards to whether\nmore banks should be considered “small” and, as such, eligible for a streamlined\nevaluation.\nIndeed, one of the benefits of creating separate assessment area definitions and\nperformance tests for retail activities and community development activities could be\nstreamlining the tests and applying them in different ways to tailor CRA evaluations to\nbanks based on their size and business strategy. Small banks could have their lending\nand retail services evaluated under the retail test, while larger banks could be evaluated\nunder both the retail and community development tests. The assessment area definition\ncould be flexible enough to allow banks that conduct most or all of their retail activity\nonline to identify states in which they have a significant level of deposits, lending, or\n\n- 12 -\nother banking activity in which they would have obligations under either the retail or\ncommunity development test, as appropriate.\nConsistency and Predictability\nThere was also wide support for making CRA definitions and evaluation criteria\nclearer and taking other actions to improve the consistent and predictable application of\nthe regulations during evaluations. Perhaps more important, the commenters strongly\nsupported the agencies continuing the tradition of working together to have one set of\nrules, consistent interpretive guidance, and regular examiner training to ensure that the\nCRA is implemented as consistently as possible both within and across the agencies. At\nthe Federal Reserve, we agree that it is important for the banking agencies to take a\nconsistent approach.\nMetrics\nFinally, there was broad support for expanding the use of metrics in CRA\nevaluations, where appropriate, especially if they are clearly articulated, are used in\ntandem with performance context information, and add to the transparency of CRA\nratings. We recognize that effective and predictable evaluations rely on good metrics.\nMetrics, in turn, require good data. Currently, CRA evaluations use HMDA data, which\nare very useful in understanding where mortgages are made, to whom, and at what cost.\nMoreover, HMDA data are collected from both banks and non-bank mortgage lenders.\nBut the data collected under CRA to support our analysis of small business and small\nfarm loans are not as comprehensive as mortgage lending data. The Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act charges the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau with promulgating regulations for the collection of small business loans, and that\n\n- 13 -\ndata should be very helpful when they become available. Separately, the data collected\nunder the CRA on community development loans are not adequate to support the analysis\nof a separate community development test, so it may be necessary to consider a better\nreporting system.\nCollecting data and developing clear metrics will provide the improved clarity\nand ex ante predictability that banks seek. More and better data will allow for more\nmeaningful metrics by which we can evaluate performance criteria, such as the borrower\nand geographic distribution of lending and how a bank’s performance compares with\nother similarly situated banks. We may also consider providing more baseline\ninformation that describes a bank’s performance context, such as the demographic and\neconomic information that helps to describe the credit needs and opportunities present in\neach assessment area. In addition, there may be ways to more effectively incorporate\ncommunity engagement into the process--for example, by having the banking agencies\ndevelop a joint community contacts database to facilitate access to information from local\ncommunity stakeholders.\nConclusion\nOverall, I have been impressed with the number of organizations that took the\ntime to comment on the OCC’s ANPR to and attend the Federal Reserve’s outreach\nmeetings. It is encouraging to see the high level of commitment to the CRA from banks\nand community organizations alike. As we think about the path forward, it is important\nthat we retain the CRA’s core focus on place while improving upon the regulation’s\nflexibility in order to provide meaningful CRA evaluations of banks that largely deliver\n\n- 14 -\ntheir products and services digitally. We want whatever we design to be clear and more\npredictable for banks in order to promote more and more impactful CRA activity.\nTaken together, changes to the CRA regulations’ definition of assessment areas\nand performance test structure, along with improved metrics based on better data have the\npotential to enhance the regulations and better serve its purpose of encouraging banks to\nhelp meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities. We understand\nand appreciate that banks want to be able to make plans and manage their risks carefully\nthrough clearer standards regarding what counts, where it will be counted, and how. If\nwe can address these suggestions effectively, banks will be more effective in addressing\nthe needs of their local communities and in some cases extend their activities to benefit\nchronically underserved communities.\nI will be interested to hear whether some of the ideas I have shared today resonate\nwith you. I want to assure you that we will continue to engage with bank and community\nstakeholders to find a path forward that honors the purpose of the CRA by encouraging\nbanks to attend to the credit needs of their local communities and to better address the\nneeds of underserved areas. This engagement will be vital as we join together with the\nother banking agencies to formulate regulatory changes that preserve what is best about\nCRA while ensuring its value and relevance for another generation.",

I want to take a moment to thank you for giving us such great\ninsights into all the important work that is taking place here in the neighborhoods of Baltimore.1\nEvery few months, I try to get out to some of the areas of the country where our Reserve Banks\nare engaged with community members, community development institutions, businesses, banks,\nand schools in efforts to create more vibrant communities. I last had the pleasure of visiting\nBaltimore with community development staff from the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank in 2015.\nEach visit teaches me so much more about the complexity of the challenges you face, the\ncreativity of the solutions you devise, and ultimately the determination you all demonstrate to lift\nup the lives of all community members in this city. Collectively, as community development\nprofessionals, concerned residents, and community partners, I can see the considerable progress\nyou are making in the neighborhoods of Baltimore, although of course there is still plenty of\nwork to be done.\nWe, at the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, recognize\nthe unique challenges Baltimore faces, and we are committed to remaining focused on this city\nand to partnering where that can be helpful. Baltimore and its residents deserve a more\nprosperous and equitable future. I am pleased that the Federal Reserve’s Community\nDevelopment team has been supporting your work and helping to convene collaborative\nendeavors, such as the Symposium on Workforce Transportation that occurred in February, and\ncross-state learning exchanges that connect community development leaders from Maryland and\nthe Carolinas.\n1 I am grateful to Amanda Roberts and Theresa Stark of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance in preparing\nthis text. The remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n2\n\nPerhaps the work that best exemplifies our commitment to understanding the complex\ndynamics of this city is the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Persistent Poverty Study. The\ngoal of this research initiative is to further understand the barriers and incentives that individuals\nliving in persistent poverty face in making economic decisions. This multiyear qualitative\nresearch project will interview households in the Baltimore metro area to better understand how\nindividuals have been able to overcome intergenerational poverty. I will be very interested in\nwhat we will all learn from this work.\nI would also like to highlight that the Reinventing our Communities conference will be\nheld here in Baltimore from October 1st through 3rd. This is an excellent conference that draws\non resources from across the Federal Reserve System, along with Johns Hopkins University, to\nhighlight effective models and emerging strategies for investing capital to foster economic\ngrowth by enabling every individual to contribute to and derive benefit from the economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System has a valuable perspective because we are in communities\nall across this nation and because as a supervisor we engage with banks as they seek to fulfill\ntheir affirmative obligations to meet the credit needs of their communities. I have seen the value\nof the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) as a vital tool to address the credit needs of low-\nand moderate-income communities, and I believe the time is ripe for a refresh to make it even\nmore relevant to today’s challenges. As you may know, the Treasury Department recently\ncompleted an extensive outreach effort related to modernizing the CRA regulations. We look\nforward to working with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, with which we have traditionally issued joint rulemakings on CRA.\nThe Federal Reserve is deeply committed to the Community Reinvestment Act’s goal of\nencouraging banks to meet their affirmative obligation to serve their entire community, and in\n3\n\nparticular the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities. As we have seen all over\nthe country, when banks are inclusive in their lending, it helps low- and moderate-income\ncommunities to thrive by providing opportunities for community members to buy and improve\ntheir homes and to start and expand small businesses. We employ an extraordinary group of\nCRA examiners and community development professionals to make sure that we do our part to\nhelp banks meet this obligation, as the statute directs. We are very proud of the role we play in\neducating banks on the CRA’s provisions, introducing them to potential partners in the\ncommunity, and keeping them informed of best practices in the field. In fact, one of CRA’s\nimportant achievements has been to help foster the growth of the community development field\nby building stronger relationships between financial institutions and community and economic\ndevelopment professionals. This development has expanded the number and range of\nopportunities for banks to lend and invest in safe and sound ways, benefiting both banks and\ntheir communities.\nThe current CRA regulations date back to 1995. In the two decades since, there have\nbeen substantial changes in the ways that banks serve their customers and in the challenges faced\nby low- and moderate-income communities. The time is ripe to modernize the CRA regulations\nto make them more effective in making credit available in low- and moderate-income areas at a\ntime when technological and structural changes in the banking industry allow banks to serve\ncustomers outside of the areas with branches that have traditionally defined a bank’s community.\nAs we update the rules, it should be possible to achieve better outcomes--both providing banks\nwith the greater clarity and predictability they seek while also facilitating better provision of\ncredit, investments, and banking services in low- and moderate-income areas. There are several\noutcomes that we will work toward in the interagency rule-writing effort.\n4\n\nFirst, we should seek to modernize the definition of assessment areas in such a way that\nthe core focus remains the credit needs of local communities. The definition in the existing CRA\nregulation of a bank’s assessment area--that is, the area in which we evaluate a bank’s CRA\nperformance--reflects a banking environment when interstate banking was not yet allowed, and\nphysical branches were necessary to serve the deposit and lending needs of bank customers.\nTechnological advances and changing consumer preferences have made it possible for banks to\nserve customers far outside of their physical branches--for example, online and on mobile\ndevices. Clearly, it is time to find a way to expand the area in which the agencies evaluate a\nbank’s CRA activities. At the same time, it is important to retain a focus on place--and in\nparticular the credit needs of local communities. We are confident that there are ways to expand\nthe area where we evaluate a bank’s CRA performance without losing the regulation’s focus on\nthe unique role banks play in meeting local credit needs and providing services that are only\npossible by using branches. Treasury’s recommendation that the agencies revisit the regulations\nto allow CRA consideration for a bank’s activities in its assessment area, as currently delineated\naround branches and deposit-taking automated teller machines, as well as in low- and moderate-\nincome areas outside that branch footprint, is a reasonable place to start our interagency\ndiscussions.\nSecond, banks should be encouraged to seek opportunities in areas that are underserved.\nCurrently, a bank’s performance in its major markets is evaluated most closely and weighs most\nheavily in its CRA rating. This emphasis has resulted in what banks and community\norganizations refer to as credit “hot spots” where there is a high density of banks relative to\ninvestment opportunities. Meanwhile, other areas have a difficult time attracting capital because\nthey are not in a bank’s major market, if they are served by a bank at all. Key priorities in any\n5\n\nnew set of regulations are to eliminate such market distortions and to avoid creating new ones.\nNo matter how we define a bank’s assessment area in the future, new regulations need to be\ndesigned and implemented in a way that encourages banks to spread their community investment\nactivities across the areas they serve.\nThird, revised regulations should be tailored, recognizing that banks vary widely in size\nand business strategy and serve communities with widely varying needs. Banks seek clearer,\nsimpler rules that result in more CRA activity with less burden. We believe this can be done\nwhile retaining the flexibility to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance in light of its size, business\nstrategy, capacity, and constraints as well as its community’s demographics, economic\nconditions, and credit needs and opportunities. We should not adopt a set of evaluation criteria\nthat would be appropriate for large banks and assume that smaller community banks would be\nable to meet them without substantial additional burden. We should also be sensitive to the ways\nin which a bank’s business strategy, no matter its size, influences the types of activities it\nundertakes to meet its CRA obligations. Regulatory revisions that do not contemplate evaluating\nCRA performance in context risk undermining CRA’s greatest attribute--its recognition that\nbanks are uniquely situated to be responsive to the most impactful community and economic\ndevelopment needs in communities.\nFourth, we should seek greater consistency in examinations and ratings across the\nagencies as well as within each agency. Clarity about the activities that qualify for CRA\nconsideration, the area in which those activities will be considered, and the type of demographic\nand economic information examiners evaluate will go a long way toward promoting consistency.\nIn addition to regulatory revisions, however, the agencies can promote consistency in other, non-\nregulatory ways. For example, we can improve the way in which examiners present their\n6\n\nanalysis in written performance evaluations and provide more opportunities for interagency\nexaminer training.\nFifth and finally, revised regulations should support CRA’s position as one of several\nmutually reinforcing laws designed to promote an inclusive financial services industry. As banks\nseek to meet the credit needs of their entire community, it is important to ensure against\ndiscriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices.\nIn the months ahead, I look forward to receiving input from the many stakeholders about\nthe path forward on modernizing CRA regulations. I want to express my commitment to\nsupporting the goals of CRA as we revise the regulations to better align them with current\nbanking practices.\nIn closing, I want to express my appreciation to you for inviting me to join you today. I\nam very impressed with the important ways different kinds of organizations represented in this\nroom are working in partnership to promote economic development here in your community.\n7",

Going into the crisis, Black and Latinx households had significantly smaller wealth\ncushions to fall back on than the average American household. For instance, Federal\nReserve research based on the Survey of Consumer Finances notes that, in 2019 “the\ntypical White family has eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times\nthe wealth as the typical Hispanic family.”2\nThe COVID-19 crisis has made existing racial disparities even worse. Low-wage\nand minority workers have experienced disproportionate harm to both their lives and\nlivelihoods as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. As you know from the communities you\nserve, the crisis has exacerbated pre-existing disparities in the labor market. Black\nemployment, in particular, is recovering at a much slower pace than employment in the\noverall population, and unemployment for Black and Hispanic/Latinx workers remains\nhigher than for the workforce as a whole. As of last month, the overall unemployment\nrate had come down to 7.9 percent, which was a marked improvement from 14.7 percent\n1 I am grateful to Amanda Roberts, Carrie Johnson, and Joseph Firschein of the Federal Reserve Board for\ntheir assistance in preparing this text.

However, the September unemployment rate for Black Americans was still 12.1\npercent, more than 4 percentage points higher than the overall unemployment rate.3\nResearch confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted substantial harm on\nsmall businesses, particularly minority-owned businesses. For example, recent research\ndocumented that the number of working Black and Latinx small business owners\ndeclined in the early months of the crisis by even more than White small business\nowners. According to this research, the nation saw a 22 percent decline in small business\nowners between February and April overall, as compared with an even more precipitous\n41 percent decline in Black business owners and 32 percent decline in Latinx business\nowners.4\nContributing to this perfect storm, minority individuals are suffering worse health\noutcomes as a result of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) report significant disparities in the infection rate of COVID-19 by race and\nethnicity, with Black, Latinx, and Native American individuals contracting COVID-19 at\nover two and a half times the rate of White, non-Hispanic individuals. For those who do\ncontract COVID-19, African Americans are suffering twice the mortality rate of White,\nnon-Hispanic individuals.5\nThe disparities in COVID-19 health risk reflect in part differences in the ability to\nwork remotely, with minority individuals more likely to work in front line jobs that put\n3 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population by race,\nHispanic or Latino ethnicity, sex, and age, seasonally adjusted,” Current Population Survey (Washington:\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, October 2020), https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea04.htm.\n4\nRobert W.

Last month, the Federal Reserve Board unanimously voted to approve an\nAdvance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on the CRA. The ANPR is built on\nideas advanced by a broad set of stakeholders, including the NBA and MDIs. It has been\n25 years since we last reformed CRA, so it is important that we get it done right.\nThe CRA is a critical law, enacted along with other complementary federal civil\nrights laws during the late 1960s and 1970s, to address redlining and systemic inequities\nin access to credit and other financial services for minority communities that contributed\nto dramatic differences in economic access and overall financial well-being. Even with\nthese critical laws, the legacy of discriminatory lending and systemic inequity in credit\naccess remains in evidence today.\nA foundational goal for the ANPR is to advance the core purpose of the CRA\nstatute. Right at the outset, the ANPR asks for open-ended feedback on a foundational\nquestion: how should CRA’s regulatory implementation be modified or changed to\naddress systemic inequity in credit access to minority individuals and communities? As\nleaders in this field, we welcome your feedback on how to strengthen CRA\nimplementation to further the statute’s core purpose.\nAdvancing the CRA’s core purpose includes strengthening the regulations to\nensure that a wide range of low-income and minority banking needs are being met. As\npart of this objective, CRA modernization provides a unique opportunity to carefully\n\n- 6 -\nexamine the MDI provisions in the CRA statute to ensure proposed changes to the\nregulation maximize the benefit and impact for MDI banks and the customers and\ncommunities they serve. In the ANPR, we placed a priority on strengthening the special\nconsideration for MDIs, women-owned financial institutions, and low-income credit\nunions in the current regulation, as well as adding new proposals based on your feedback.\nThe Board believes that any provisions to assist MDIs should be clearly defined\nand applied in CRA performance assessments. We consistently heard from MDIs and\nlarger banks that there is a lack of awareness of the existing MDI provisions in the CRA\nregulations or a lack of understanding of how collaboration with MDIs ultimately “count”\nin a CRA examination. In response, the Board plans to highlight all MDI special\nprovisions and make the credit they receive more prominent and clear in revised\nregulation, examination guidance, and other public documentation.\nIn addition, in the ANPR, we proposed four specific new MDI provisions. First,\nthe ANPR proposes giving banks credit for activities with MDIs, women-owned financial\ninstitutions, and low-income credit unions located outside their assessment areas at either\nthe state or institution level, which would ensure that there is a clear “place” for such\nactivities to be counted. Though majority-owned institutions currently can get CRA\nconsideration for activities with MDIs outside of the majority-owned institution’s\nassessment areas(s), we have heard feedback that there can be a lack of clarity about\nwhere and how these activities will count in their CRA rating. As a result, stakeholders\nlike NBA have indicated that such activities are not common.\nThe second proposal would explicitly designate activities in MDIs, women-owned\nfinancial institutions, and low-income credit unions as a potential pathway to achieving\n\n- 7 -\nan “outstanding” CRA rating. The purpose of this provision would be to elevate the\nprofile of and create more incentives for activities with these mission-oriented\ninstitutions.\nThe third proposal would provide credit for MDIs and women-owned financial\ninstitutions investing in other MDIs, women-owned financial institutions, and low-\nincome credit unions. Currently, only majority-owned institutions can receive CRA\nconsideration for investing in MDIs. We know that MDIs vary greatly in size, and we\nhave heard from MDIs that there could be mutually beneficial partnerships between\nMDIs.\nFinally, the ANPR proposes providing credit for MDIs and women-owned\nfinancial institutions investing in limited activities to improve their own banks.\nEligibility could be limited to activities that demonstrate meaningful investment in the\nbusiness, such as staff training, hiring new staff, opening new branches in minority\nneighborhoods, or expanding products and services.\nIn addition to activities specific to MDIs, the ANPR seeks to strengthen CRA’s\ncore purpose in other ways. This includes proposals to promote greater financial\ninclusion, such as allowing banks to get credit for community development activities\noutside of assessment areas but in designated areas with persistent unmet needs. An\nexample mentioned in the ANPR is activities in Indian Country. Native American MDIs\nhave been working diligently to serve Indian Country for years with limited resources;\nwe hope that our proposals will bring additional capital into Indian Country to\ncomplement the work of Native American MDIs.\n\n- 8 -\nOur second major goal for the ANPR is to provide greater certainty, tailor\nregulations based on bank size and business model, and minimize burden. There are a\nnumber of proposals to advance these objectives. Most MDIs are small banks, so let me\nsay a bit more about the proposals in the ANPR that are tailored to small banks. Under\nthe ANPR proposals, small retail banks would continue to have their retail lending\nactivities evaluated under the current CRA framework unless they elect to be evaluated\nunder the proposed Retail Lending Subtest using a metrics-based approach. Small banks\nthat opt for the metrics-based approach would also have the option to submit retail\nservices and community development activities for consideration, and we are interested\nin feedback on how to do this. Additionally, the ANPR proposes ways to minimize data\ncollection and reporting burden by relying on existing data as much as possible, as well\nas exempting small banks from deposit and certain other data collection requirements.\nOur third major goal for the ANPR is to provide a foundation for the agencies to\nconverge on a consistent approach that has broad support among stakeholders.\nStakeholders like NBA have expressed strong support for the agencies to work together\nto modernize CRA. By reflecting stakeholder views and providing an appropriately long\nperiod for public comment, the ANPR advances the goal of building a foundation for the\nbanking agencies to converge on a consistent approach that has the broad support of\nstakeholders. All three regulators have benefitted from the stakeholder comments\nprovided through comment letters, roundtables, and meetings. There is significant\ninteragency agreement on the objectives of CRA reform and many of the ideas in the\nANPR reflect interagency discussions and regulatory proposals.\n\n- 9 -\nIn closing, we look forward to modernizing the CRA in a way that strengthens the\nregulations to advance the core purpose of the statute, while providing greater certainty,\ntailoring regulations, and minimizing burden. We have appreciated the NBA’s strong\nengagement throughout this process, and we look forward to your continued engagement\nas we seek to converge on a consistent approach that has broad stakeholder support. Our\nPartnership for Progress Program seeks ways to preserve and promote MDIs through\nengagement, technical assistance, and research in recognition of your institutions’\ncontinued innovation and flexibility in adapting to the ever-changing financial needs of\nyour communities. We see CRA modernization as a significant opportunity to strengthen\nfurther the ability of MDIs to serve their communities, and we hope that you will provide\nus with feedback on how to modernize the CRA regulations in a way that supports MDIs\nand the communities you serve. Thank you.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EDT\nJune 3, 2016\nThe Economic Outlook and Implications for Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 3, 2016\n\nIn recent months, financial conditions have eased, and there are encouraging signs\nthat consumption has regained momentum. On the other hand, there are tentative signs of\nslowing in the labor market and risks remain.1 We cannot take the resilience of our\nrecovery for granted.\nRecent Developments\nAs we consider the appropriate posture of policy going forward, the most\nimmediate question is whether the data provide confidence that domestic economic\nactivity has strengthened notably following two disappointing quarters. This is critical\nfor making progress on the Committee’s dual mandate objectives of full employment and\n2 percent inflation. The data in today’s labor market report on balance suggest that the\nlabor market has slowed. Nonfarm payroll employment increased at an average monthly\npace of 116,000 over the last three months--well below the 220,000 per month average\npace over the preceding twelve months. The unemployment rate moved lower, reaching\n4.7 percent, a new low in the current recovery, but involuntary part-time employment\nincreased and the labor force participation rate declined.\nEven so, there are reasons to expect that the labor supply still has room to respond\nif labor demand increases. Importantly, the employment to population ratio for prime-\nage workers still remains 1-3/4 percentage points below pre-crisis levels. The recent data\non wage inflation suggest a similar conclusion. Although there have been some signs of\nincreasing wage growth recently, the step-up has been modest, and growth in the broad\nmeasures of wages remains quite low. For example, the average change over the past\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nyear across the three most commonly cited wage measures was about 2-1/2 percent,\ncompared with an average change from the end of 2009 to the end of 2014 of 2 percent.2\nThe recent news on inflation--the second leg of our dual mandate--has also been\nmixed. The price of oil has rebounded significantly from the lows reached earlier in the\nyear on expectations that supply and demand are likely to come into better alignment.\nOver the same period, the dollar has receded a bit, on net, from its peak in January,\nthough it is still about 15 percent above the level in mid-2014 in inflation-adjusted trade-\nweighted terms. As a result, non-oil import prices look likely to stabilize this quarter\nafter a year and a half of declines. Still, it should be noted that these developments\ncoincided with the easing in financial conditions since mid-February and are likely due,\nat least in part, to expectations of more gradual U.S. monetary policy tightening. If those\nexpectations were to shift materially, the conditions supporting higher inflation could\ndiminish.\nWhile there are thus signs that inflation will move higher over the medium term,\nmeasures of core inflation have yet to convincingly exceed the low levels that have\nprevailed over much of the recovery. The 12-month change in core personal\nconsumption expenditure (PCE) prices, a reasonable proxy for the underlying trend in\ninflation, was only 1.6 percent in April. This is still noticeably below our target and is\nroughly equal to the average change in core and total PCE inflation from the end of 2009\nto the end of 2014.\nWe cannot rule out that stubbornly low inflation may be having an effect on\ninflation expectations. Market-based measures of inflation compensation--which reflect\n2 The three commonly cited measures of wages are the private-industry employment cost index,\ncompensation per hour in the business sector, and average hourly earnings.\n\n- 3 -\ninflation risk and liquidity premiums, as well as inflation expectations--remain extremely\nlow. For example, inflation compensation at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon is\ncurrently around 1.5 percent, 1-1/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to\nmid-2014. Some survey-based measures of inflation expectations are also somewhat\nbelow historical norms. Median 5- to 10-year inflation expectations in the University of\nMichigan Surveys of Consumers, for example, over the past year have been on average\nabout 1/4 percentage point below the average over the 10 years from 2005 to 2014.\nThus, although some signs point to a firming of inflation going forward, I view\nthe persistently low level of inflation during the recovery together with some signs of a\ndeterioration in inflation expectations as suggesting that the risks to the return of inflation\nto our 2 percent target over the medium term are weighted to the downside.\nProgress toward our goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation will depend\nimportantly on solid growth in aggregate demand. Following disappointing gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of\nthis year that averaged only 1.1 percent, I have been very attentive to incoming data,\nespecially on consumption, which point to a pick-up in growth this quarter.3 In\nparticular, consumer expenditures rose a strong 0.6 percent in April, and auto sales edged\nhigher in May. These are encouraging signs, but the data relevant for second-quarter\ngrowth are still relatively sparse.\nIn general, demand growth in recent quarters has benefited from a relatively\nstrong household sector--buoyed by a recovering labor market, reduced oil prices, and\n3 Growth in gross domestic income (GDI) has not slowed as much as GDP growth recently. However, the\naverage of GDP and GDI growth has still slowed recently from an average annual rate of 2-1/2 percent\nfrom the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2015 to an average of 1-1/2 percent in the past two\nquarters.\n\n- 4 -\nlow interest rates--and has been pulled down by weak business investment and net\nexports. Indeed, consumption and housing investment can more than account for the 2\npercent increase in GDP over the past four quarters. By contrast, business investment\nand net exports together subtracted 1/4 percentage point. The rise in the dollar and\ndecline in foreign growth reduced demand for American exports, as well as profits and\ninvestment at U.S. firms, which were also adversely affected by declines in the price of\noil. Over the twelve months ending in April, manufacturing output increased only 0.4\npercent, while total industrial production, which also includes the drilling for, and\nextraction of, oil and gas, fell 1.1 percent. Although the most recent indicators suggest\nthat weakness in investment and net exports has persisted into the current quarter, if the\neasing in financial conditions since mid-February and the recent firmness in oil prices\nwere to continue, along with stabilization of the dollar, business investment and exporters\nwould benefit.\nRisks to the Outlook\nOf course, there are risks to the projection that future GDP growth will be strong\nenough to deliver progress on inflation and employment. Most immediately, there is\nimportant uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s June 23 “Brexit” referendum on\nwhether to leave the European Union (EU). The International Monetary Fund has noted\nthat a vote in favor of Brexit could unsettle financial markets and create a period of\nuncertainty while the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU is\nrenegotiated. Although the economic effects of this uncertainty and the costs of adjusting\nto altered trade and financial ties are difficult to quantify, we cannot rule out a significant\nadverse reaction to such an outcome in the near term, such as a substantial jump in\n\n- 5 -\nfinancial risk premiums. Because international financial markets are tightly linked, an\nadverse reaction in European financial markets could affect U.S. financial markets, and,\nthrough them, real activity in the United States.\nIn addition, we should not dismiss the possible reemergence of risks surrounding\nChina and emerging market economies (EMEs) more broadly. In recent months, capital\noutflows in China have moderated as pressures on the exchange rate have eased. Should\nexchange rate pressures reemerge, we cannot rule out a recurrence of financial stress,\nwhich would affect not only China but also other emerging markets that are linked to\nChina via supply chains or commodity exports and, ultimately, conditions here. China is\nmaking a challenging transition from export- to domestic demand-led growth, and the\ncost of reallocating resources from excess capacity sectors to more dynamic sectors could\nfurther impair growth in the near term. While China has taken policy steps to limit the\nextent of the slowdown, there is an evident tension in policy between reform and\nstimulus, and the effect of the stimulus may already be waning. Vulnerabilities--such as\nexcess capacity, elevated corporate debt, and risks in the shadow banking sector--appear\nto be building, and could pose continued risks over the medium term.\nThe fragility of the global economic environment is unlikely to resolve any time\nsoon. Growth in the advanced economies remains dependent on extraordinary\nunconventional monetary policy accommodation, while conventional policy continues to\nbe constrained by the zero lower bound. Conventional policy, whose efficacy is more\ntested and better understood than unconventional policies, can respond readily to upside\nsurprises to demand, but presently would be constrained in adjusting to downside\n\n- 6 -\nsurprises. This asymmetry in the capability of policy effectively skews risks to the\noutlook to the downside.\nIt also may amplify the sensitivity of exchange rates. Indeed, the evidence\nsuggests that over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become\nconsiderably greater in response to U.S. monetary policy surprises than previously.4 The\nevidence that the sensitivity of exchange rate movements has been elevated lately is\nconsistent with recent research suggesting that cross border financial transmission is\nlikely to be amplified at near-zero interest rates where the ability to provide additional\nsupport through domestic channels in response to negative shocks may be viewed as\nlimited.5\nIn this environment, markets have become quite sensitive to the possibility of a\nprolonged period of low growth, low inflation, and economic underperformance. One\npossible example of this sensitivity is the current negative term premium for 10-year\nTreasury notes, or the difference between the yield on the 10-year Treasury and expected\nrisk-free short rates over the next 10 years. Prior to the Great Recession, the term\npremium was positive, as bond investors seem to have been most concerned about the\nrisk that inflation would be higher than expected. But since the Great Recession, the term\npremium has been persistently negative, suggesting that investors have instead been\nfocused on the risk of prolonged lower-than-expected inflation in the context of low\ngrowth and underperformance.6\n4 Recent research by Federal Reserve staff suggests that over the past year, a surprise of 25 basis points in\nthe Federal Funds rate following FOMC announcements has triggered dollar appreciation of over 5 percent,\nalthough the confidence interval is extremely large, and the coefficient has varied substantially over time,\nincluding intervals when the relationship has been negative.\n5 See Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2015).\n6 See Chen, Engstrom, Grishchenko (2016). Another factor affecting the term premium is Federal Reserve\nasset purchases. In addition, some have suggested the low term premium could reflect an “insurance”\n\n- 7 -\nThus, while the easing in financial conditions since mid-February is very\nwelcome, it is important to recognize that some of the conditions underlying recent bouts\nof turmoil largely remain in place, and an important reason for the fading of this\nturbulence was the expectation of more gradual U.S. monetary policy tightening.7\nShould an event trigger renewed fears about global growth or a reassessment of the\npolicy reaction function in the United States, turbulence could well return.\nPolicy Implications\nOn balance, recent developments have signaled continued progress toward our\ngoals. While signs of weakness in business investment and global demand remain,\nconsumption and residential investment have held firm, and the labor market has moved\ncloser to full employment. At the same time, the relative stabilization in the dollar and\noil prices in recent months has boosted somewhat the likelihood of a return to 2 percent\ninflation over the medium term. However, the data on progress toward our inflation\nobjective are equivocal. Measures of underlying inflation have yet to convincingly signal\na move back to 2 percent, and inflation expectations appear low, as I noted earlier.\nI want to emphasize that monetary policy is data dependent and is not on a preset\ncourse. In this regard, I look forward to hearing the deliberations of the Committee.\nRecognizing the data we have on hand for the second quarter is quite mixed and still\nlimited, and there is important near-term uncertainty, there would appear to be an\nadvantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence. Prudent risk-\nmanagement would suggest the risks from waiting until the totality of the data provides\nvalue that investors attach to Treasury securities because the price of Treasuries would be expected to rise\nif there are adverse shocks to the global economy.\n7 For an estimate of the role of U.S. monetary policy in offsetting the recent tightening in financial\nconditions, see Del Negro, Giannoni, and Smith (2016).\n\n- 8 -\ngreater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity, and there is greater certainty\nregarding the “Brexit” vote, seem lower than the risks associated with moving ahead of\nthese developments. This is especially true since the feedback loop through exchange\nrate and financial market channels appears to be elevated. In light of this amplified\nfeedback loop, when conditions are appropriate for a policy move, it will be important\nthat it be understood that any subsequent moves would be conditioned on further\nevidence confirming continued progress toward our objectives and not as inevitable steps\non a preset course.\nIndeed, several factors suggest that the appropriate path to return monetary policy\nto a neutral stance could turn out to be quite shallow and gradual in the medium term. In\nparticular, it appears likely that the medium-term neutral rate, or the real federal funds\nrate consistent with the economy remaining at full employment and 2 percent inflation,\nmay be quite low. With productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and\ndisinflationary pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the neutral rate may\nbe lower and today’s federal funds rate closer to neutral than previously anticipated.\nAlthough we cannot observe the neutral rate directly, a variety of models suggests that it\nis currently very low relative to historical norms. Earlier in the recovery it seemed likely\nthat the low level of the neutral rate was largely due to temporary factors, such as tight\ncredit, weak consumer confidence, and the loss in household wealth following the crisis.\nHowever, with the recovery well into its seventh full year, credit in many markets is\nwidely available, while consumer confidence and household net worth are at high levels.\n\n- 9 -\nAs a result, it appears more likely that much of the decline in the neutral rate is likely to\nprove persistent, consistent with a variety of estimates.8\nOne likely explanation for this persistence is the sharp drop-off in potential output\ngrowth since the Great Recession. From 1953 to 2003, potential output growth varied\nbetween 3 and 4-1/2 percent, with one brief exception, according to the Congressional\nBudget Office. Over the recovery, it has averaged only 1-1/4 percent. One contributor to\nthis decline has been a reduction in the labor force participation rate due to population\naging. Another has been a marked slowing in productivity growth. Over the six years\nfrom the end of 2009 to the end of 2015, productivity grew only a little over 1/2 percent\nper year, compared with average growth of 2-1/4 percent over the 50 years prior to the\nGreat Recession.9\nThe reasons for such a dramatic slowing in productivity growth are not clear.\nPossible explanations include the fading of a one-time boost to productivity from\ninformation technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s; the reduced movement of\nresources from the least productive to the most productive firms, including new\nbusinesses, perhaps due to greater financial constraints for new and small businesses; and\na delay between the introduction of new technologies, such as robotics, genetic\nsequencing, and artificial intelligence, and their effect on new production processes and\nproducts.10\n8 See, for example, Laubach and Williams (2015); the estimates from the dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium models cited in Yellen (2015); the median estimated neutral rate from the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York’s most recent Survey of Market Participants (Federal Reserve Bank of New York,\n2016); and Johannsen and Mertens (2016).\n9 Since the end of 2007, the average annual gain in productivity has been 1.1 percent.\n10 For more on the recent slowing in productivity growth and its possible causes, see Fernald (2014),\nDecker and others (2014, 2016), and Zarutskie and Yang (forthcoming). For an investigation into whether\nmismeasurement may be responsible for some of the slowing in productivity growth, see Byrne, Fernald,\n\n- 10 -\nTo conclude, recent economic developments have been mixed, and important\ndownside risks remain. In this environment, prudent risk management implies there is a\nbenefit to waiting for additional data to provide confidence that domestic activity has\nrebounded strongly and reassurance that near-term international events will not derail\nprogress toward our goals. In addition, because the depressed level of the neutral rate of\ninterest reflects forces that are likely to persist, the appropriate path of policy is likely to\nremain shallow for several years.\nand Reinsdorf (2016) and Syverson (2016).

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:40 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 7, 2022\nBringing Inflation Down\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Clearing House and Bank Policy Institute\n2022 Annual Conference\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 7, 2022\n\nOver the past year, inflation has been very high in the United States and around\nthe world (figure 1). High inflation imposes costs on all households, and especially low-\nincome households. The multiple waves of the pandemic, combined with Russia’s war\nagainst Ukraine, unleashed a series of supply shocks hitting goods, labor, and\ncommodities that, in combination with strong demand, have contributed to ongoing high\ninflation. With a series of inflationary supply shocks, it is especially important to guard\nagainst the risk that households and businesses could start to expect inflation to remain\nabove 2 percent in the longer run, which would make it much more challenging to bring\ninflation back down to our target. The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation\nexpectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time.1\nWhile last year’s rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative\nfiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those\ntailwinds have abated. A sizable fiscal drag on output growth alongside a sharp\ntightening in financial conditions has contributed to a slowing in activity. In the first half\nof 2022, real gross domestic product (GDP) declined outright, overall real consumer\nspending grew at just one-fourth of its 2021 pace, and residential investment, a\nparticularly interest-sensitive sector, declined by 8 percent (figure 2).2\n1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text and to\nKenneth Eva for preparing the figures. These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the\nFederal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For comparison, growth in the alternative activity measure of real gross domestic income (GDI) has come\nin just below potential in the first half of the year. The national income and product accounts contain two\nmeasures of total economic output, measured through an expenditure approach, reported as more-familiar\nGDP, or an income approach, reported as GDI. These two series generally track each other fairly closely,\nbut research indicates that some independent information about the business cycle can be found in each of\nthe series. The gap between the levels of GDP and GDI, known as the statistical discrepancy, was over\n$750 billion in the second quarter, by far its largest historical size. For a discussion of these series and the\nbusiness cycle, see Jeremy J. Nalewaik (2010), “The Income- and Expenditure-Side Estimates of U.S.\nOutput Growth,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring, pp. 71–106,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010a_bpea_nalewaik.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nThe concentration of strong consumer spending in supply-constrained sectors has\ncontributed to high inflation. Consumer spending is in the midst of an ongoing but still\nincomplete rotation back toward pre-pandemic patterns. Real spending on goods has\ndeclined modestly in each of the past two quarters, while real spending on services has\nexpanded at about half its 2021 growth rate. Even so, the level of goods spending\nremains 5 percent above the level implied by its pre-pandemic trend, while services\nspending remains 4 percent below its trend (figure 3).\nIn addition to the fiscal drag and tighter financial conditions, high inflation—\nparticularly in food and gas prices—has restrained consumer spending by reducing real\npurchasing power. While price increases in food and energy are weighing on\ndiscretionary spending by all Americans, they are especially hard on low-income\nfamilies, who spend three-fourths of their income on necessities such as food, gas, and\nshelter—more than double the 31 percent for high-income households.3\nSince the very elevated prices at the pump in June, the nationwide average price\nof a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline has declined every day throughout July and\nAugust, most recently falling below $4 a gallon, according to the American Automobile\nAssociation.4 The rise and fall of gasoline prices played a major role in the dynamics of\ninflation over the summer, contributing 0.4 percentage point to month-over-month\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in June and subtracting 0.2\npercentage point in July. This 0.6 percentage point swing in the contribution of gasoline\n3 For more details on this difference and further information on how the effect of inflation varies across\nhouseholds, see Lael Brainard (2022), “Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households,” speech\ndelivered at the Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute,\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, April 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm.\n4 For more information, see https://gasprices.aaa.com.\n\n- 3 -\nprices was an important driver of the decline in month-over-month PCE inflation from 1\npercent in June to negative 0.1 percent in July.\nIn contrast, food price pressures continue to worsen, reflecting Russia’s\ncontinuing war against Ukraine, as well as extreme weather events in the United States,\nEurope, and China.5 The PCE index for food and beverages has increased each month\nthis year by an average of 1.2 percent, resulting in an 8½ percent cumulative increase in\nthe index year-to-date through July. For context, the net change in the food and\nbeverages price index over the entire four-year period before the pandemic was only 0.5\npercent.\nCore inflation—inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices—also\nmoderated in July. Core goods PCE inflation decelerated to 0.1 percent month-over-\nmonth in July after averaging 0.5 percent in May and June.6 While the moderation in\nmonthly inflation is welcome, it will be necessary to see several months of low monthly\ninflation readings to be confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent.\nHow long it takes to move inflation back down to 2 percent will depend on a\ncombination of continued easing in supply constraints, slower demand growth, and lower\nmarkups, against the backdrop of anchored expectations. With regard to supply\nconstraints, a variety of indicators are showing signs of improvement on delivery times\nand supplies of some goods. In addition, labor force participation showed a welcome\nincrease in the August employment data, particularly in the boost in participation among\n5 See, for example, Kim Chipman and Tarso Veloso Ribeiro (2022), “Dried-Out Farms from China to Iowa\nWill Pressure Food Prices,” Bloomberg, August 27.\n6 Price increases for nondurable goods moderated, and price declines in used vehicles as well as durable\ngoods other than motor vehicles more than offset further increases in the prices of new cars and trucks.\nPrices for PCE services excluding energy and housing declined 0.1 percent in July, the first price decline in\nthis category since November 2020.\n\n- 4 -\nwomen in the core working years of 25 to 54 years of age. Even with this improvement,\nthe participation rate is still 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level, well in\nexcess of the decline in the participation rate that would have been expected due to\nretirements in the absence of the pandemic.\nReductions in markups could also make an important contribution to reduced\npricing pressures. Last year’s rapid demand growth in the face of supply constraints led\nto product shortages in some areas of the economy and high margins for many firms.\nAlthough we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to\nexcess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that\nbusinesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.\nAt an aggregate level, in the second quarter, measures of profits in the nonfinancial sector\nrelative to GDP remained near the postwar peak reached last year.7\nUsing the available macroeconomic data, it is challenging to measure directly\nhow much firms mark up their prices relative to their costs. That said, there is evidence\nat the sectoral level that margins remain high in areas such as motor vehicles and retail.\nAfter moving together closely for several years, starting early last year, the new motor\nvehicle consumer price index (CPI), which measures the price dealers charge to\ncustomers, diverged from the equivalent producer price index (PPI), which measures the\nprice dealers paid to manufacturers. Since then, the CPI has increased three times faster\nthan the PPI (figure 4). This divergence between retail and wholesale prices suggests an\nunusually large retail auto margin. With production now increasing, and interest-\n7 After-tax profits in the nonfinancial corporate sector, adjusted for inventory valuation and capital\nconsumption and expressed as a fraction of nominal GDP, were 13 percent in the second quarter. This is\njust slightly lower than the series high since 1947 of 13.5 percent, set in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n- 5 -\nsensitive demand cooling, there may soon be pressures to reduce vehicle margins and\nprices in order to move the higher volume of cars being produced off dealer lots.\nSimilarly, overall retail margins—the difference between the price retailers charge\nfor a good and the price retailers paid for that good—have risen significantly more than\nthe average hourly wage that retailers pay workers to stock shelves and serve customers\nover the past year, suggesting that there may also be scope for reductions in retail\nmargins. With gross retail margins amounting to about 30 percent of sales, a reduction in\ncurrently elevated margins could make an important contribution to reduced inflation\npressures in consumer goods.\nLabor demand continues to exhibit considerable strength, which is hard to\nreconcile with the more downbeat tone of activity. Year-to-date through August, payroll\nemployment has increased by about 3½ million jobs, a surprisingly strong increase given\nthe decelerating spending and declining GDP over the first half of the year. The\nunemployment rate has fallen, on net, from 4 percent in January to 3.7 percent in August.\nPossibly the strongest indications that the labor market is tight were the first- and second-\nquarter readings of the employment cost index (ECI), which point to strong and broad-\nbased growth in total hourly compensation. The 6.3 percent reading for the ECI in the\nsecond quarter was the largest annualized quarterly growth in compensation under this\nmetric since 1982. The most recent reading of average hourly earnings suggested some\npossible cooling, decelerating from a gain of 0.5 percent in July to 0.3 percent in August,\nalthough it will be important to see additional data.\nThe deceleration in economic activity thus far this year has coincided with only a\nslight easing in job openings, on net, since their peak in March. The current high level of\n\n- 6 -\njob openings relative to job seekers remains close to the largest in postwar history,\nconsistent with a tight labor market (figure 5). Businesses that experienced\nunprecedented challenges restoring or expanding their workforces following the\npandemic may be more inclined to make greater efforts to retain their employees than\nthey normally would when facing a slowdown in economic activity. This may mean that\nslowing aggregate demand will lead to a smaller increase in unemployment than we have\nseen in previous recessions, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and I\nwill be monitoring a variety of labor market indicators closely.8\nAs we follow through on our plan to move monetary policy to an appropriately\nrestrictive stance, the effect of the increased policy rate and pace of balance sheet\nshrinkage should put downward pressure on aggregate demand, particularly in interest-\nsensitive sectors like housing. Continued improvements in supply conditions and a\nfurther rotation of consumption away from goods and into services should also help by\nreducing price pressures in goods. With regard to non-housing services, the magnitude of\nprice pressure over the next several quarters will depend on an overall slowing in\nspending as well as the extent to which labor supply improves in these sectors.\nSince pivoting last year, our actions and communications have tightened financial\nconditions significantly and at a much more rapid speed than earlier cycles. So far during\n2022, real 2-year yields have risen more than 350 basis points to about 1.2 percent, and\n10-year real yields have risen almost 200 basis points and now stand at 0.85 percent—in\n8 The debate in this area can be seen in two recent pieces. See Andrew Figura and Chris Waller (2022),\n“What Does the Beveridge Curve Tell Us about the Likelihood of a Soft Landing?” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 29), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-\n7172.3190; and Olivier Blanchard, Alex Domash, and Lawrence H. Summers (2022), “Bad News for the\nFed from the Beveridge Space,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, Policy Brief 22-7\n(Washington: PIIE, July), https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/pb22-7.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nthe range of values for 10-year real yields from 2014 to 2018. The rapid tightening in\nmonetary policy is also reflected in a significant increase in the projected real short rate:\nThe Blue Chip Financial Forecasts has the expected short rate moving above 0.5 percent\nin real terms to a significantly higher level than pre-pandemic within the next 12 months\n(figure 6).\nIt may take some time for the full effect of these tighter financial conditions to\nwork their way through the economy. The disinflationary process here at home should be\nreinforced by weaker demand and tightening in many other countries. This is particularly\nthe case as Europe contends with downside risks to activity and a severe energy shortage\ncaused by Russia’s war against Ukraine, and as China maintains its zero-COVID\napproach against a backdrop of weaker consumption.\nAt some point in the tightening cycle, the risks will become more two-sided. The\nrapidity of the tightening cycle and its global nature, as well as the uncertainty around the\npace at which the effects of tighter financial conditions are working their way through\naggregate demand, create risks associated with overtightening. And if history is any\nguide, it is important to avoid the risk of pulling back too soon. Following a lengthy\nsequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities that, in combination\nwith strong demand, drove inflation to multidecade highs, we must maintain a risk-\nmanagement posture to defend the inflation expectations anchor.9 While we have no\ncontrol over the supply shocks to food, energy, labor, or semiconductors, we have both\nthe capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations and price\nstability.\n9 See Ricardo Reis (2022), “The Burst of High Inflation in 2021–22: How and Why Did We Get Here?”\nworking paper.\n\n- 8 -\nWe are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down. So far, we have\nexpeditiously raised the policy rate to the peak of the previous cycle, and the policy rate\nwill need to rise further. As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the\nbalance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the\nincrease in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring\ndemand into alignment with supply. Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some\ntime to provide confidence that inflation is moving down to target. The economic\nenvironment is highly uncertain, and the path of policy will be data dependent. While the\nprecise course of action will depend on the evolution of the outlook, I am confident we\nwill achieve a return to 2 percent inflation. Our resolve is firm, our goals are clear, and\nour tools are up to the task.\n10 As of September 2022, the monthly caps on the runoff of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed\nsecurities are $60 billion and $35 billion per month, as compared with $30 billion and $20 billion,\nrespectively, from 2017 to 2019.",

Following the deepest plunge since the Great Depression, employment and\nactivity rebounded faster and more sharply than anticipated. But the recent resurgence in\nCOVID cases is a sober reminder that the pandemic remains the key driver of the\neconomy’s course. A thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us, and downside risks\npredominate. The recovery is likely to face headwinds even if the downside risks do not\nmaterialize, and a second wave would magnify that challenge. Fiscal support will remain\nvital. Looking ahead, it likely will be appropriate to shift the focus of monetary policy\nfrom stabilization to accommodation by supporting a full recovery in employment and a\nsustained return of inflation to its 2 percent objective.1\nA variety of data suggest the economy bottomed out in April and rebounded in\nMay and June. Payroll employment rebounded strongly in May and June. Retail sales\njumped 18 percent in May, exceeding market expectations, and real personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) are estimated to have increased 8 percent. Consumer\nsentiment improved in May and June.2 And both the manufacturing and\nnonmanufacturing Institute for Supply Management indexes jumped into expansionary\nterritory last month. Financing conditions remain broadly accommodative on balance:\nThey continued to ease over recent weeks for nonfinancial corporations and\nmunicipalities, although they remained stable or tightened slightly for small businesses\nand households.3\n1 I am grateful to Ivan Vidangos of the Federal Reserve Board for assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 This is reflected in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Conference Board.\n3 Nearly all of the financial conditions indexes that we track indicate only slightly less accommodative\nfinancial conditions currently than just before the onset of the COVID outbreak.\n\n- 2 -\nThe earlier-than-anticipated resumption in activity has been accompanied by a\nsharp increase in the virus spread in many areas. Uncertainty will remain elevated as\nlong as the pandemic hangs over the economy. Even if the virus spread flattens, the\nrecovery is likely to face headwinds from diminished activity and costly adjustments in\nsome sectors, along with impaired incomes among many consumers and businesses. On\ntop of that, rolling flare-ups or a broad second wave of the virus may lead to widespread\nsocial distancing—whether mandatory or voluntary—which could weigh on the pace of\nthe recovery and could even presage a second dip in activity. A broad second wave could\nre-ignite financial market volatility and market disruptions at a time of greater\nvulnerability. Nonbank financial institutions could again come under pressure, as they\ndid in March, and some banks might pull back on lending if they face rising losses or\nweaker capital positions.\nA closer look at the labor market data hints at the complexity. The improvement\nin the labor market started earlier, and has been stronger, than had been anticipated. Over\nMay and June, payroll employment increased by 7.5 million, the unemployment rate fell\n3.6 percentage points, and the labor force participation rate rose 1.3 percentage points.4\nThe large bounceback is a sharp contrast to the Global Financial Crisis, when the initial\nemployment decline was shallower and it took much longer before a similar share of the\ninitial job losses was recouped.\n4 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has indicated that the official unemployment rate has understated\nthe extent of joblessness in recent months because many workers who lost their jobs were incorrectly\nreported as being employed but absent from work, rather than unemployed on temporary layoff. The BLS\nestimated that this misclassification held down the unemployment rate by about 5 percentage points in\nApril and by about 1 percentage point in June, such that the reduction in the unemployment rate would be\nabout 7½ percentage points if these job losses were classified correctly.\n\n- 3 -\nThe job gains in the past two months were concentrated among workers who were\non temporary layoff. They likely were driven by an earlier-than-expected rollback of\nCOVID-related restrictions as businesses ramped up hiring and consumers exhibited\nmore comfort engaging in commercial activities, as well as by a boost to employment\nfrom the Paycheck Protection Program. While nearly all industries experienced\nincreases, the improvement was especially notable in the leisure and hospitality sector,\nwhich had been particularly hard hit by COVID-related closures in April.\nIt is unclear whether the rapid pace of labor market recovery will be sustained\ngoing forward, and risks are to the downside. The pace of improvement may slow if a\nlarge portion of the easiest gains from the lifting of mandated closures and easing of\ncapacity constraints has already occurred. Moreover, weekly COVID case counts have\nbeen rising, and some states are ramping up restrictions. These developments mostly\noccurred after the reference period for the June employment report. After declining at a\nfast clip through early June, initial claims for unemployment insurance have moved\nroughly sideways in recent weeks and remained at a still elevated level of 1.3 million in\nthe week ending July 4.5 Some high-frequency indicators tracked by Federal Reserve\n5 The flattening out seen in recent weeks is even clearer when looking at nonseasonally adjusted claims\nnumbers, which might be a slightly better measure than seasonally adjusted numbers in the current\nenvironment. The usual seasonal adjustment procedure, which relies on multiplicative seasonal factors, is\nnot ideally suited to the current extraordinary circumstances. See Jason Bram and Fatih Karahan (2020),\n“Translating Weekly Jobless Claims into Monthly Net Job Losses,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York,\nLiberty Street Economics (blog), May 7,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/05/translating-weekly-jobless-claims-into-monthly-\nnet-job-losses.html.\nIn addition, the Department of Labor stated that 49 states reported about 1 million initial claims for\nPandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) in the week ending July 4. However, since most PUA\napplicants must first apply for, and be denied, regular state unemployment insurance (UI) benefits before\nthey apply for PUA, initial PUA claims and initial claims for regular UI benefits will be strongly correlated\n(likely with some lag) and do not constitute independent measures of the number of unemployed persons\nseeking unemployment benefits.\n\n- 4 -\nBoard staff (including mobility data and employment in small businesses) suggest that\nthe strong pace of improvement in May and the first half of June may not be sustained.\nThe pandemic’s harm to lives and livelihoods is falling disproportionately on\nblack and Hispanic families. After finally seeing welcome progress narrowing the gaps\nin labor market outcomes by race and ethnicity in the late stage of the previous recovery,\nthe COVID shock is inflicting a disproportionate share of job losses on African American\nand Hispanic workers. According to the Current Population Survey, the number of\nemployed persons fell by 14.2 percent from February to June among African Americans\nand by 13.4 percent among Hispanics—significantly worse than the 10.4 percent decline\nfor the population overall.6\nSeparately, on the other side of our dual mandate, inflation has receded further\nbelow its 2 percent objective—reflecting weaker demand along with lower oil prices in\nrecent months. Both core and total PCE price inflation measures have weakened, with\nthe 12-month percent changes through May standing at 1.0 percent and 0.5 percent,\nrespectively.7 Measures of inflation expectations are mixed; while market-based\nmeasures have moved below their typical ranges of recent years, survey measures have\nremained relatively stable within their recent historical ranges.8 Nonetheless, with\n6 The Current Population Survey (or household survey) measures the number of employed persons and\nincludes detailed demographic information, whereas the Current Employment Statistics survey (or\nestablishment survey) measures the number of jobs in the payrolls of nonfarm establishments.\n7 That said, the trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas over the\n12 months ending in May remained stable at 2.0 percent; the data as of May 2020 are available on the\nBank’s website at https://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce. And this morning’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)\ndata for June showed some signs of stabilization, with both core and total CPI inflation increasing\nnoticeably last month, driven by a partial rebound in price categories that seemed most affected by social\ndistancing in prior months (such as apparel, accommodation, and transportation services).\n8 The median 5-to-10-year measure from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the median\nthree-year-ahead expected inflation from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer\nExpectations both came in at 2.5 percent in June—well within their ranges in recent years. Median long-\nrun expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters ticked down 0.1 percentage point to\n1.9 percent in the second quarter, which is historically low for this measure. Market-based measures of\n\n- 5 -\ninflation coming in below its 2 percent objective for many years, the risk that inflation\nexpectations could drift lower complicates the task of monetary policy.\nThe strong early rebound in activity is due in no small part to rapid and sizable\nfiscal support. Several daily and weekly retail spending indicators tracked by Federal\nReserve Board staff suggest that household spending increased quickly in response to\nstimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance benefits. Household spending\nstepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to\nhouseholds and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most\npronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal\nsupport measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July,\ninflation compensation over the next few years have retraced much of their sharp declines in mid-March\nbut remain below their typical ranges in recent years. The 5-to-10-year measure of longer-term inflation\ncompensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, at around 1.4 percent, remains notably\nbelow pre-pandemic levels.\n9 This evidence is also consistent with recent research by Baker and others, who examine a panel of\nhouseholds using a financial planning app and show that these households responded quickly to CARES\nAct (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) stimulus payments despite stay-at-home orders\nand social distancing; see Scott R. Baker, R.A. Farrokhnia, Steffen Meyer, Michaela Pagel, and\nConstantine Yannelis (2020), “Income, Liquidity, and the Consumption Response to the 2020 Economic\nStimulus Payments,” NBER Working Paper Series 27097 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, May). Other recent studies, including Kargar and Rajan as well as Chetty and others,\nfind similar responses to the CARES Act using different data. See Ezra Karger and Aastha Rajan (2020),\n“Heterogeneity in the Marginal Propensity to Consume: Evidence from Covid-19 Stimulus Payments,”\nWorking Paper Series 2020-15 (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, May),\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2020/2020-15; and Raj Chetty, John N.\nFriedman, Nathaniel Hendren, Michael Stepner, and the Opportunity Insights Team (2020), “How Did\nCOVID-19 and Stabilization Policies Affect Spending and Employment? A New Real-Time Economic\nTracker Based on Private Sector Data,” Opportunity Insights Working Paper (Cambridge, Mass.:\nOpportunity Insights, May), https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf.\nAnalysis by Bhutta and others uses data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to assess how the cash\nassistance (expanded unemployment insurance benefits and stimulus payments) under the CARES Act\nwould help families cope with job loss and find that the CARES Act dramatically improves households’\nfinancial security; see Neil Bhutta, Jacqueline Blair, Lisa J. Dettling, and Kevin B. Moore (2020),\n“COVID-19, the CARES Act, and Families’ Financial Security,” working paper, July. The act’s cash\nassistance, in addition to families’ liquid savings, would allow an estimated 94 percent of working families\nto cover their recurring nondiscretionary expenses if they were to lose all of their income for six months\nfrom April through September 2020. In contrast, in the absence of the CARES Act, only about half of\nworking families would be able to cover six months of expenses by relying exclusively on their liquid\nsavings and standard unemployment insurance benefits.\n\n- 6 -\nthe strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and\ndistribution of additional fiscal support.\nAt the sectoral level, there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect of COVID.\nRecent data suggest that the recoveries in sectors such as manufacturing, residential\nconstruction, and consumer goods are likely to be relatively more resilient, while\nconsumer services are more likely to remain hostage to social distancing. Manufacturing\nproduction jumped nearly 4 percent in May (following a historic drop in April), and\nforward-looking indicators point to another solid increase in June. Pending home sales\nand single-family permits rose more than anticipated in May. In the consumer sector, the\nrebound in spending has been concentrated in goods categories—especially those sold\nonline—whereas most services categories have remained quite depressed. A similar\nconcern may apply to the commercial real estate (CRE) sector and to equipment\ninvestment. Some parts of the CRE market—most notably, the lodging and retail\nsegment—are experiencing significant distress and have seen sharp increases in\ndelinquency rates along with tighter bank lending standards. For equipment investment,\nproduction and supply chain disruptions and high levels of uncertainty continue to weigh\non expenditures.\nIn addition to the headwinds facing demand, there could be persistent effects on\nthe supply side of the economy. The cross-border distancing associated with the virus\nraises the possibility of persistent changes to global supply chains. Within the U.S.\neconomy, the virus may cause durable changes to business models in a variety of\nactivities, resulting in greater reliance on remote work, reductions in nonessential travel,\nand changes to CRE usage and valuations.\n\n- 7 -\nIn downside scenarios, there could be some persistent damage to the productive\ncapacity of the economy from the loss of valuable employment relationships, depressed\ninvestment, and the destruction of intangible business capital. A wave of insolvencies is\npossible. As the Federal Reserve Board’s May Financial Stability Report highlighted,\nthe nonfinancial business sector started the year with historically elevated levels of\ndebt.10 Already this year, we have seen about $800 billion in downgrades of investment-\ngrade debt and $55 billion in corporate defaults—a faster pace than in the initial months\nof the Global Financial Crisis. Several measures of default probabilities are somewhat\nelevated. It remains vitally important to make our emergency credit facilities as broadly\naccessible as we can in order to avoid the costly insolvencies of otherwise viable\nemployers and the associated hardship from permanent layoffs.\nFinally, in keeping with the global nature of the pandemic, foreign developments\ncould impinge on the U.S. recovery. The International Monetary Fund estimates that real\nglobal gross domestic product dropped at an annual rate of about 18 percent in the second\nquarter after falling nearly 13 percent in the first quarter. While the potential for a fiscal\nresponse across the euro area is positive and important, there has been some renewal of\ntensions between the United States and China, and the outlook for many emerging\nmarkets remains fragile.\nThe Federal Reserve moved rapidly and aggressively to restore the normal\nfunctioning of markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses. The forceful\nresponse was appropriate in light of the extraordinary nature of the crisis and the\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), Financial Stability Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, May), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-\n20200515.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nimportance of minimizing harm to the livelihoods of so many Americans. With the\nrestoration of smooth market functioning and credit flows, our emergency facilities are\nappropriately moving into the background, providing confidence that they remain\navailable as an insurance policy if storm clouds again move in.\nWhile it is welcome news that 7.5 million jobs were added in the past two\nmonths, it is critical to stay the course in light of the remaining 14.7 million job losses\nthat have not been restored since the COVID crisis started. The healing in the labor\nmarket is likely to take some time. Last month, a majority of Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) participants indicated they expect economic activity to decline\nnotably this year and recover only gradually over the following two years. A majority of\nFOMC participants indicated that they expect core inflation to remain below our\n2 percent objective and employment to fall short of its maximum level at least through\nthe end of 2022.\nLooking ahead, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from\nstabilization to accommodation by supporting a full recovery in employment and\nreturning inflation to its 2 percent objective on a sustained basis. As we move to the next\nphase of monetary policy, we will be guided not only by the exigencies of the COVID\ncrisis, but also by our evolving understanding of the key longer-run features of the\neconomy, so as to avoid the premature withdrawal of necessary support. Because the\nlong-run neutral rate of interest is quite low by historical standards, there is less room to\ncut the policy rate in order to cushion the economy from COVID and other shocks. The\nlikelihood that the policy rate is at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding\nexpected and actual inflation, which could further compress the room to cut nominal\n\n- 9 -\ninterest rates in a downward spiral. With underlying inflation running below 2 percent\nfor many years and COVID contributing to a further decline, it is important that monetary\npolicy support inflation expectations that are consistent with inflation centered on 2\npercent over time. And with inflation exhibiting low sensitivity to labor market tightness,\npolicy should not preemptively withdraw support based on a historically steeper Phillips\ncurve that is not currently in evidence. Instead, policy should seek to achieve\nemployment outcomes with the kind of breadth and depth that were only achieved late in\nthe previous recovery.11\nWith the policy rate constrained by the effective lower bound, forward guidance\nconstitutes a vital way to provide the necessary accommodation. For instance, research\nsuggests that refraining from liftoff until inflation reaches 2 percent could lead to some\nmodest temporary overshooting, which would help offset the previous\nunderperformance.12 Balance sheet policies can help extend accommodation by more\ndirectly influencing the interest rates that are relevant for household and business\nborrowing and investment.\nForward guidance and asset purchases were road-tested in the previous crisis, so\nthere is a high degree of familiarity with their use. Given the downside risks to the\noutlook, there may come a time when it is helpful to reinforce the credibility of forward\nguidance and lessen the burden on the balance sheet with the addition of targets on the\n11\nSee Lael Brainard (2019), “Federal Reserve Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and\nCommunications: Some Preliminary Views,” Remarks at the Presentation of the 2019 William F.

The\nchoices we make about our payment infrastructure today will affect all Americans many years\ninto the future. Today I am excited to announce the Federal Reserve will invest in a new service\nto help ensure that real-time payments are available to everyone. The Federal Reserve will\ndevelop the FedNow ServiceSM, a real-time payment and settlement service for the future.2\nEveryone deserves the same ability to make and receive payments immediately and securely, and\nevery bank deserves the same opportunity to offer that service to its community. FedNow will\npermit banks of every size in every community across the country to provide real-time payments\nto their customers.\nToday, whether you are relying on ACH, a debit card, or a check, it can take as much as a\nfew days to get access to your funds. With a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment\ninfrastructure, the funds would be available immediately—to pay utility bills or split the rent\nwith roommates, or for small business owners to pay their suppliers. Immediate access to funds\ncould be especially important for households on fixed incomes or living paycheck to paycheck,\nwhen waiting days for the funds to be available to pay a bill can mean overdraft fees or late fees\nthat can compound.

Fully 90\npercent of these comments called for the Federal Reserve to operate a real-time service for faster\npayments. Support came from a wide range of stakeholders, including individuals, merchants,\nfintech firms, and banks.4 Commenters noted that the Federal Reserve would ensure equitable\naccess to banks of all sizes nationwide by operating a real-time service for faster payments\nalongside the private-sector system. Commenters highlighted the importance of safety in faster\npayments and noted the Federal Reserve’s record of resiliency, especially during periods of\nstress. Commenters observed that a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment service would\nincrease competition, decrease market concentration, and provide a neutral platform for\ninnovation.\nThis broad support echoes and expands on the conclusions of the Faster Payments Task\nForce. Similarly, the U.S. Treasury Department recommended that “the Federal Reserve move\nquickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system, such as through the development of a real-\ntime settlement service that would also allow for more efficient and widespread access to\ninnovative payment capabilities.”5\n3 Lael Brainard, “Supporting Fast Payments for All” (remarks at the Fed Payments Improvement Community\nForum, Chicago, October 3, 2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20181003a.htm.\n4 Potential Federal Reserve Actions to Support Interbank Settlement of Faster Payments, Request for Comments, 83\nFed.

Phillips, A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunity: Nonbank\nFinancials, Fintech, and Innovation (Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury, July 2018), 156,\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/A-Financial-System-that-Creates-Economic-Opportunities---\nNonbank-Financi.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nIn determining the path forward, we are building on the Federal Reserve’s long history of\noperating payment systems as a core part of the nation’s payment infrastructure. Since they\nopened for business around the country in 1914, as directed by the Congress, the Federal Reserve\nBanks have provided payment and settlement services—in healthy competition with private-\nsector providers—to achieve public benefits ranging from resiliency to innovation to equal\naccess. When you look across the current payment infrastructure, whether in check processing,\nautomated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers, you will see a Federal Reserve\nservice operating alongside private-sector providers. The General Accountability Office has\nconcluded that the Federal Reserve’s provision of payment services has benefited the U.S.\npayment system and its users.6\nThe Federal Reserve does not have regulatory authority over the pricing set by a private-\nsector system or to require a private-sector system to extend the service to banks of all sizes,\nparticularly the last mile. In some other countries, central banks have been assigned the\nresponsibility for regulating payment systems. However, this is not the approach that Congress\nhas taken. Instead, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has long been seen as an effective\napproach to promote accessible, safe, and efficient payments in the United States.\nThrough the FedNow Service, we will provide a foundation for the future—a modern\npayment infrastructure that allows innovation and competition to flourish and delivers faster\npayments safely and securely for all. To ensure fast payments are available to everyone, FedNow\nwill be accessible to all banks, no matter the size. Given our long-standing service connections\n6 See, e.g., U.S. Government Accountability Office, Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits\nCustomers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase Assurance of Cost Accuracy, GAO-16-614 (Washington:\nGovernment Accountability Office, August 2016), https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-614.\n\n- 4 -\nwith more than 10,000 banks across the country, the Federal Reserve is uniquely placed to\ndeliver this outcome.\nThe bar is high when we assess whether the Federal Reserve should provide a new\npayment and settlement service, as it should be. We have carefully analyzed the criteria of the\nMonetary Control Act and long-standing Federal Reserve policies, considered the comments\nprovided by a wide range of stakeholders, and studied the experiences of foreign central banks.7\nWe are not making this decision lightly. On balance, after carefully weighing important\nconsiderations on both sides, we have concluded it is our responsibility to take action in support\nof a real-time payment infrastructure accessible to all. While we will work hard to stand up the\nFedNow Service in a timely manner, our most important goal is to achieve nationwide access for\nall, reflecting our public mission.\nBuilding a Modern Payment Infrastructure\nA key foundation of the payment infrastructure is interbank clearing and settlement—the\nmovement of funds and the associated information between banks. Today, the U.S. retail\npayment infrastructure lags behind many other countries. Europe, Mexico, and Australia have\nalready implemented real-time interbank clearing and settlement capabilities. In contrast, here in\nthe United States, the gap between the transaction capabilities in the digital economy and the\nunderlying payment and settlement capabilities continues to grow.8\nEarly adopters of fast payment services rely on a legacy infrastructure that was not\ndesigned to support faster payments. For example, some services offer real-time funds\navailability to certain consumers, but they conduct interbank settlement on a deferred basis using\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The Federal Reserve in the Payments System” (Issued 1984;\nrevised 1990), https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm.\n8 FIS Global, “2018 Flavors of Fast,” https://www.fisglobal.com/flavors-of-fast.\n\n- 5 -\nlegacy systems. This type of settlement entails a buildup of obligations—like IOUs between\nbanks—that could present real risks to the financial system in times of stress. These are not\nresilient long-term solutions for our dynamic economy and the banks that support it.\nWe are seeing some companies looking to establish a payment system that bypasses our\nbanks and our currency. Facebook’s Libra project raises numerous concerns that will take time to\nassess and address. But one thing is clear: consumers and businesses across the country want and\nexpect real-time payments, and the banks they trust should be able to provide this service\nsecurely—whatever their size. To provide everyone with the ability to send and receive funds\nsecurely on a 24x7x365 basis, banks need to embrace and invest in real-time innovations, and the\nFederal Reserve needs to provide a safe and efficient real-time interbank clearing and settlement\nservice accessible to all banks.\nWe are proud of our strong record of cooperating with and supporting private-sector\nservices, while fostering competition for public benefit. We have provided vital support to the\nsole private-sector provider of real-time settlement for faster payments, and we will continue to\ndo so. The Federal Reserve provided a joint account to enable the private-sector operator to offer\nreal-time payments. Moreover, today we are announcing our intent to explore the expansion of\nFedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service operating hours to support the efficiency\nof the joint account structure for the private-sector real-time gross settlement (RTGS) service and\nprovide broader benefits. That said, the joint account structure, with its requirement of\nprefunding and settlement on a private ledger, is fundamentally different from the approach the\nFederal Reserve will use to settle transactions directly between banks.\n\n- 6 -\nFostering a Dynamic and Resilient Payment Infrastructure That Serves Everyone\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to fulfilling our public policy goals in a spirit of\ncooperation and competitive fairness. We are pleased that the private-sector faster payment\nservice is in the market, and we see important benefits from the resilient and competitive market\nthat would result from the FedNow Service providing an alternative consistent with the\nrequirements of the Monetary Control Act. The requirement to consider the best way to make our\npayment and settlement services accessible to banks across the country, along with long-standing\nprinciples including cost recovery over the long run, guides our assessment of when the Federal\nReserve should engage in the payment system.9 In setting fees, the Federal Reserve is required\nby statute to “give due regard to competitive factors and the provision of an adequate level of\nsuch services nationwide.”10 I want to share with you some of the analysis—viewed through the\nprism of our public policy goals of accessibility, safety, and efficiency—that we considered in\nmaking today’s decision.\nAccessibility means serving more than 10,000 banks of varying sizes and missions that\nare in communities all around the country. It turns out no single private-sector provider of any\nU.S. payment system has ever achieved nationwide reach on its own, whether it be checks, ACH,\ncards, or wire transfers. Acting alone, a single private-sector RTGS service will face significant\nchallenges in establishing an accessible infrastructure for faster payments with nationwide reach.\nIn contrast, because of our experience with providing other services, the Federal Reserve already\n9 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Principles for the Pricing of Federal Reserve Bank Services”\n(Issued 1980), https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_principles.htm; and Board of Governors, “The\nFederal Reserve in the Payments System.”\n10 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-221 (March 31, 1980),\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/1032.\n\n- 7 -\nhas invested in connections and customer service relationships with nearly every bank, small and\nlarge, across the country.\nCurrently, we provide payment services to nearly all banks either directly or indirectly.\nWith our 12 regional Reserve Banks, we have the capacity to meet the needs of banks serving\ndifferent communities and with different needs and operating models. For that reason,\ncommenters stated that the Federal Reserve is uniquely positioned to offer nationwide access to a\nnew payment and settlement service for faster payments. FedNow will allow faster payments to\nreach banks of all sizes and their customers across the country, which is especially important for\nrural communities, who often struggle with access to financial services.\nGuided by our public mission, the Federal Reserve serves the needs of all banks, no\nmatter how small or challenging to reach, and with competitive fairness. In response to our\nrequest for feedback last November, several commenters emphasized how much they value the\nFederal Reserve’s mission of providing nationwide access on fair, transparent terms and\nexpressed concern that a sole private-sector RTGS service provider may be less likely to exhibit\nthe same commitment over the long run.\nSafety is also vital. If the Federal Reserve does not establish the FedNow Service, there\nwill be a single provider of real-time retail payment services. We are mindful of the serious\nsafety issues associated with a single point of failure, a risk that will rise as faster payments\ngrow. Stakeholders have noted the importance of having access to more than one real-time\npayment service for back-up purposes in order to provide resiliency through redundancy. In fact,\nmany banks already take advantage of having connections to multiple operators today in check,\nACH, and wire services. The Federal Reserve has always had a vital role in promoting the safety\nand stability of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity\n\n- 8 -\nespecially in times of stress. The FedNow Service would allow the Federal Reserve to extend\nthis role into the real-time retail payment market.\nFinally, competition will promote efficiency and innovation. The U.S. real-time retail\npayment infrastructure stands to gain from competition, including through higher service quality\nand lower prices over the long run, which in turn should support wider adoption.\nThe FedNow Service will provide a neutral foundation for innovation and competition in\nend-user faster payment services. In response to the request for feedback, merchants and fintech\ncompanies commented that a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment service could broaden the\nscope for innovation in faster payments. They noted that a single provider that is owned and\noperated by one segment of the payment industry may focus on a narrow set of use cases that do\nnot reflect the full breadth of possible use cases for faster payments. Recognizing the vibrancy of\nour payment industry, the addition of the FedNow Service could provide a springboard for\nbroader private-sector participation in the development of innovative end-user services.\nLooking Forward\nWith the announcement of the Federal Reserve real-time payment service, we are\nembracing a path that will bring transformative, rather than incremental, change to the retail\npayment infrastructure in the United States. The FedNow Service will run continuously at all\ntimes of the day, every day of the week, consistent with the needs of faster payments and will be\ndesigned to process large volumes of payments rapidly.\nIn the months ahead, we intend to explore a variety of approaches to achieving a real-\ntime retail payment infrastructure with nationwide reach. One such approach might be for\ndifferent payment services to interoperate by exchanging payments among the services directly.\nSuch interoperability is an important goal that we will pursue as standards, technology, and\n\n- 9 -\nindustry practices change over time, although it is not yet clear whether it will be an initial\nfeature.\nThe Federal Reserve plans to devote the necessary resources to deliver the highest quality\nFedNow Service in a timely manner. We are working to streamline our internal processes to\nmove quickly in the market. President George will play an integral role in this new process, and\nthe Conference of Reserve Bank Presidents has pledged its support.\nIt is important for the Federal Reserve, working with the payment industry, to act quickly\nin finalizing the initial business requirements of the FedNow Service. We will need to hear the\nviews of payment system stakeholders on the features of the FedNow Service, as discussed in the\nFederal Register notice announced today. We will engage with the industry through groups and\nforums to finalize the design and features of the service. We hope that these conversations will\nprovide an opportunity for stakeholders to work together to shape the evolution of the U.S.\npayment system.\nEarlier this month, I joined my Reserve Bank colleagues for a visit with bankers and\ncommunity organizations in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to hear about the biggest challenges they\nare facing. The head of a bank that has been serving the Scranton area for more than a century\ntold me that for his community bank to remain competitive in its payment offerings, it is vital to\nbe able to rely on the Federal Reserve for real-time payments just as he does for check, ACH,\nand wire transfer. I appreciate the importance of community banks to the economic health of our\ncommunities, and I recognize the role of the Federal Reserve in enabling community banks to\noffer payment services on a competitive basis. I am confident that by working together with all\npayment system stakeholders, we can collectively achieve widespread, safe, and efficient faster\npayments that will benefit all.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:15 p.m. EDT (7:15 p.m. CDT)\nSeptember 30, 2015\nCommunity Banks, Small Business Credit, and Online Lending\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Community Banking in the 21st Century”\nThe Third Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference\nCosponsored by the Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nSeptember 30, 2015\n\nI would like to thank the event organizers for inviting me to participate in this\nyear’s Community Banking Research and Policy Conference. Supporting the health and\nvitality of America’s community banks is an important priority for me. Community\nbanks have long been a central provider of finance to Main Street America. Despite the\nchallenging environment of the past several years, community banks have continued to\nplay a significant role in a number of key market segments.\nToday I want to focus on one of the most important of those segments--the\nprovision of credit to small businesses--and to explore how the traditional role of\ncommunity banks may be affected by the growing role of online lenders. Some view the\ngrowth of online platforms as a challenge to community banks in their traditional core\nbusinesses. But it is also possible that the very different strengths of community banks\nand online lenders could lead to complementarity and collaboration in the provision of\ncredit to small business while recognizing there are important risks that must be managed\nby banks and borrowers. By working together, lenders, borrowers, and regulators can\nhelp support an outcome whereby credit channels are strengthened and the possible risks\nare being proactively managed.\nSmall Businesses, Small Business Credit, and the U.S. Economy\nSmall businesses make up a large and vitally important segment of the U.S.\neconomy. And their vitality hinges centrally on their access to credit.\nMore than three-fourths of American businesses have fewer than 10 employees\nand another nearly one-fourth have between 10 and 500 employees.1 In addition to\nconstituting the vast majority of firms in the United States, small businesses account for\n1 See Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Table G, Distribution of Private Sector Firms by Size Class: 1993/Q1\nthrough 2014/Q1, Not Seasonally Adjusted,” www.bls.gov/web/cewbd/table_g.txt.\n\n- 2 -\nabout one-half of private-sector employment.2 And small firms, especially new small\nfirms, are an even greater source of net new jobs in our economy.3 Thus, ensuring that\ncreditworthy small businesses have access to credit is vitally important.\nDiscussions of small businesses, along with their credit needs, often fail to\nappreciate the tremendous heterogeneity that exists among these firms and, consequently,\nthe variation in their credit needs. Small businesses include plumbers and electricians,\nmedical and dental offices, dry cleaners and hair salons, restaurants and bodegas, as well\nas growth-oriented tech start-ups and small manufacturers. They range in size from\nhaving zero employees--which accounts for a very large share of small businesses--to the\nmuch smaller share of small businesses with a few hundred employees. Although some\nsmall businesses aspire to grow quickly, many others are unlikely to grow much at all.\nWhile some have audited financial statements, most small businesses do not. Some have\nassets that can be pledged as collateral, but many do not. Some have a long history of\nsolid, profitable performance, while others have short histories or a mixed track record\nwith regard to profitability.\nNot surprisingly, there is also considerable variation in the credit needs of small\nbusinesses. Some small businesses, particularly very small firms in knowledge or service\nindustries, may have little or no need for credit. Larger small businesses, and those that\nrequire a substantial amount of equipment or need to hold sizeable inventories, tend to\nhave greater credit needs. Among small businesses that do need credit, funds may be\nrequired for managing cash flow, for purchasing or maintaining property or equipment,\n2 See Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Table F, Distribution of Private Sector Employment by Firm Size Class:\n1993/Q1 through 2014/Q1, Not Seasonally Adjusted,” www.bls.gov/web/cewbd/table_f.txt.\n3 For more on small firms and net new jobs, see Haltiwanger (2013).\n\n- 3 -\nfor building inventory, or for expanding operations. Depending on the needs, firms may\nbe interested in term loans, capital leases, lines of credit, or credit card loans. The\ncharacteristics of a small business and the nature of its credit needs influence the type of\nlender that is best suited to meeting those needs.\nCommunity Banks and Small Business Lending\nCommunity banks have long been a primary source of credit for small businesses\nand today may continue to have the best business model for fulfilling many small\nbusiness credit needs.4 But changing technology has led to increased competition in this\nproduct space from both larger banks and, in recent years, alternative lenders.\nLarge banking organizations ramped up their small business lending between\n2003 and 2008. Although they pulled back from this market segment in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis, their small loans to businesses have been gradually rising since 2011.\nMeanwhile, community banks experienced very modest growth in small loans to\nbusinesses during the pre-crisis period, followed by a decline from 2009 through 2013\nand a subsequent leveling-off. Consequently, community banks’ share of the dollar\nvolume of outstanding small loans to businesses at commercial banks has declined over\nthe past decade.5 Despite this decline, community banks continue to hold about\n50 percent of outstanding small business loans at commercial banks, far in excess of\ntheir 20 percent share of commercial banking assets and deposits.6\n4 For purposes of this talk, I define a community bank as a bank with less than $10 billion in assets, which\nis either independent or part of a banking organization that also has less than $10 billion in assets.\n5 Small loans to businesses are loans to businesses with initial principal amounts of less than $1 million.\n6 Data on bank assets, deposits, and small loans to businesses were compiled from Consolidated Reports of\nCondition and Income, also known as Call Reports, that banks file with the Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council. Data on banks’ small loans to businesses are widely used to proxy for bank loans to\nsmall businesses because data on the latter are not collected.\n\n- 4 -\nTo understand the continued strong role played by community banks, it is helpful\nto look at the differences in small business lending between large and small banks.\nAlthough large banks and small banks now provide about equal dollar volumes of small\nloans to businesses, they tend to provide different types of loans to different types of\nborrowers, using different underwriting methods. On the one hand, large banks generally\nhave some advantages in the provision of transaction-based lending--that is, lending that\nrelies on hard or quantitative information such as financial ratios, collateral, or credit\nscores. Small banks, on the other hand, have advantages in the provision of relationship-\nbased lending--lending based on context-specific or qualitative information, such as the\nowner’s character and reliability and the needs of the community.\nWhen we use Call Report data to break down commercial banks’ loans to\nbusinesses by loan size, it is striking that most of the erosion in community banks’ share\nover the past decade has been concentrated among the very smallest loans--those with\ninitial principal amounts less than $100,000. Among these so-called micro loans, the\nshare held by large banks grew from 42 percent in 2005 to 67 percent in 2015. In\ncontrast, large banks’ share of larger outstanding small loans to businesses--those with\ninitial principal amounts between $100,000 and $1 million--grew much more modestly,\nfrom 39 percent to 43 percent, over the same time period. Business micro loans are\ntypically underwritten based, primarily or exclusively, on credit scores because the small\nloan size makes it unprofitable to produce such loans using more costly traditional\nunderwriting methods. Thus, the growth in large banks’ share of micro business loans is\nlikely attributable to their ability to benefit from economies of scale in credit-score-based\nlending.\n\n- 5 -\nBusiness loans with principal amounts between $100,000 and $1 million are\ngenerally not underwritten solely on the basis of credit scores--probably because lenders\nare not willing to incur the risk associated with larger loan amounts without the benefit of\na traditional underwriting approach. For these larger loans--and for smaller loans where\nthe borrower does not qualify based on credit score alone--community banks are often the\nlender of choice. Their local knowledge and close ties to the communities they serve\nenable community bankers to establish a deep understanding of local businesses that\nallows them to prudently provide credit to borrowers who might not otherwise be\nconsidered creditworthy. A number of empirical studies confirm that relationships are\nimportant factors influencing both the availability and the terms of loans to small\nbusinesses.7\nSimilarly, when we slice the Call Report data to separate commercial and\nindustrial (C&I) loans from commercial real estate loans, we see that while community\nbanks’ share of outstanding small C&I loans dwindled from about 54 percent in 2005 to\n40 percent in 2015, their share of small commercial real estate loans has remained\nrelatively stable, moving marginally from 66 percent to 63 percent. Community bankers’\nintimate knowledge of their communities and their familiarity with local economic\nconditions provide an advantage relative to large, geographically dispersed banks in\nunderwriting commercial real estate loans.\n7 Examples of such studies include Petersen and Rajan (1994), Berger and Udell (1995), Cole (1998),\nBerger and others (2005), and Cole and others (2004).\n\n- 6 -\nSince large banks are unlikely to become as knowledgeable about local economic\nconditions or as adept at small business relationship lending as community banks, there\nmay be some limits to their expansion in this segment of lending.\nOnline Alternative Lenders\nIn recent years, online alternative lenders have also made inroads into small\nbusiness lending. There has been a lot of speculation about the effect of this sector on\ntraditional banks: Will it disrupt their activities, broaden their reach, or maybe a little of\nboth?\nFocusing specifically on nonbank alternative online lenders or online marketplace\nlenders, it is important to underscore that the online space is highly dynamic, with a\nnumber of business models emerging and evolving. I will touch on two business models\nin particular, recognizing that as these business models are tested, it is likely that some\nwill prove more successful than others, and that some may adapt in ways that will cause\nus to revise our segmentation of online alternative lending.8 First, online balance sheet\nlenders generally use their own capital to fund small business credit products that are\noriginated either directly on their platforms or indirectly through brokers or referral\n8 As the industry has evolved, alternative online lenders have increasingly been referred to as marketplace\nlenders, a term that helps emphasize the growing institutional investor base of the sector. So while peer-to-\npeer lenders initially allowed individual borrowers to connect with individual lenders, individual lenders\nincreasingly are being replaced by institutional investors who are turning to online marketplace lenders for\ninvestment opportunities. Because some balance sheet lenders are now originating small business loans for\ninstitutional investors to purchase, balance sheet lenders are also often referred to as marketplace lenders.\nIn the Treasury Department’s recent Request for Information, they defined online marketplace lending as\n“the segment of the financial services industry that uses investment capital and data-driven online platforms\nto lend either directly or indirectly to small businesses and consumers.” (See U.S. Treasury, 2015, p. 6.)\n\n- 7 -\npartnerships.9 Credit products offered by these lenders are usually short term and include\nloans, lines of credit, or cash advances.10\nSecond, peer-to-peer lending platforms, by contrast, act as intermediaries to\nconnect borrowers with lenders and to assist investors in identifying and purchasing loans\nthat meet their investment criteria. These lenders can be individuals, banks, or\ninstitutional investors.11\nAlthough data are limited on this sector, the data that are available suggest that\nthe various types of online alternative lenders have captured a small but rapidly growing\nshare of lending since the financial crisis. In aggregate, the outstanding portfolio\nbalances of these lenders have doubled every year since the mid-2000s.12 It is estimated\nthat online alternative lenders originated $12 billion in 2014, with unsecured consumer\nloans representing $7 billion and small business loans accounting for approximately\n$5 billion.13 While this amount represents only a small fraction of U.S. unsecured\nconsumer and small business lending overall, the rate of growth is notable.\nMuch of the growth in online alternative lending has been supported by\ninnovative uses of technology that allow lending platforms to streamline and automate\nloan applications, expedite underwriting and quickly price risk, and provide loan\napplicants with quick loan decisions and access to funds. Online alternative lenders use\nalgorithms to provide rapid decisions on loan applications, often taking into account\n9 Online balance sheet lenders include companies such as OnDeck, Square Capital, Fundation,\nCAN Capital, Kabbage, and PayPal Credit.\n10 Cash advances, sometimes known as merchant cash advances, capital advances, or business cash\nadvances, are credit products that allow businesses to convert future credit card or payment account\nreceivables into capital (Lipman and Wiersch, 2015).\n11 Peer-to-peer lending platforms include companies such as Prosper, Lending Club, and Funding Circle.\n12 See Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 42).\n13 For information on online alternative lenders, see U.S. Treasury (2015, p. 6); for more on unsecured\nconsumer loans and small business loans, see Morgan Stanley Research (2015).\n\n- 8 -\ninformation from a wide range of sources that are not typically involved in bank\nunderwriting of loans. For example, aggregated information for small business\nunderwriting may include data on online banking, accounting, bookkeeping, credit card,\nshipping, supplier, and social media. So, while traditional banks often focus on personal\ncredit scores for underwriting consumer loans and the majority of small dollar, small\nbusiness loans, online alternative lenders may analyze a broader variety of data to\ndevelop different metrics to measure and price loan risk. Currently, the largest platforms\ntypically offer online or mobile applications that allow consumers and small business\nowners to easily submit information and aggregate vast amounts of data to complete loan\napplications.\nAlthough rates vary by platform and borrower characteristics, when taking into\naccount origination fees and repayment periods, the average annual cost of borrowing,\nor APR, associated with loans and credit products offered by online alternative small\nbusiness lenders tend to be higher than those associated with traditional bank products.14\nReports suggest that some borrowers are willing to pay a higher price in exchange for an\neasy application process, a quick decision, and rapid availability of funds.15\nWhile some see online alternative lenders as a disruptive threat to traditional\nlenders, banks increasingly are finding ways to partner with online alternative lenders,\nincluding through loan purchases and referral agreements. Loan purchases by\ncommunity banks of loans originated by online alternative lenders have been focused on\n14 For example, Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 44) note that many alternative lending platforms charge\nyields ranging from 30 to 120 percent of the loan value, depending on the size, term duration, and risk\nprofile of the loan. Several alternative online lenders advertise lower rates, but industry sources note that\nlending is rarely done at those rates.\n15 For example, see Clark (2014), Cortese (2014), Crowley (2015), and Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 46).\n\n- 9 -\nunsecured consumer debt. As the percentage of unsecured consumer debt outstanding\nheld by community banks has been declining in recent years, several banks have\npartnered with online alternative lenders to grow and diversify their portfolios of\nunsecured consumer debt.16\nIn contrast to the consumer loan activity, the small business partnerships that have\ndeveloped so far are largely fee-based referral partnerships. In these partnerships, banks\nrefer to online alternative lenders some of their small business customers who are usually\nseeking loan amounts that the referring banks may see as too costly to underwrite and\nservice, particularly in the size range below $100,000.17 For example, in 2014, OnDeck\nannounced small business loan referral partnerships with BBVA Compass and with the\nProfitStars Lending Network, part of the Independent Community Bankers of America\nPreferred Service Provider program.\nAnother type of partnership that has been announced recently involves alternative\nonline lenders and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that seek to\nprovide loans to low-income and underserved borrowers and neighborhoods. These\npartnerships may enable the CDFI to use the online lender’s technology platform at no\n16 In 1994, banks and thrifts with less than $10 billion in assets held about 69 percent of U.S. consumer\nloans, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by SNL Financial. That share dropped to 19 percent in\n2004 and 9 percent in 2014 (Tracy, 2015). Recently, BancAlliance, a consortium of approximately 200\ncommunity banks, has partnered with Lending Club to purchase consumer loans originated on Lending\nClub’s platform and the Western Independent Bankers, a consortium of more than 160 independent and\ncommunity banks, have entered into a partnership with Prosper to encourage member banks to use\nProsper’s platform to facilitate consumer loans for their customers. Also, Lending Club and Citi\nCommunity Capital, the community development lending and investing division of CitiGroup, recently\nannounced a partnership to facilitate up to $150 million in consumer loans designed to provide more\naffordable credit to underserved, lower-income borrowers in low- and moderate-income communities.\n17 As an indication of the demand for small dollar loans on the part of small businesses, the Joint Small\nBusiness Credit Survey conducted in 2014 by the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Atlanta, Cleveland,\nand Philadelphia found that more than one-half of small business loan applicants sought $100,000 or less in\ncredit. (For more information, the survey report is available at www.newyorkfed.org/smallbusiness/SBCS-\n2014-Report.pdf.)\n\n- 10 -\ncost or for a reduced cost in order to make underwriting decisions faster and more cost\neffective.18 These partnerships are still in the early stages.\nRisks and Opportunities\nAcross the Federal Reserve System, we are actively following developments in\nthe alternative online lending space and have engaged with several alternative online\nlenders over the past few years to learn more about the industry, the technology, and the\nbusiness models as well as engaging with bankers to understand how these developments\nare affecting their markets.19 Most recently, several alternative lenders have participated\nin events where we have joined with community development finance experts to discuss\nways to adopt platform lending technology to better serve low- and moderate-income\nborrowers and small business owners.20\nWe want to better understand the opportunities presented by technological\nadvances that may bring new data to bear and help lenders make available credit to a\n18 For example, in June 2015, Lending Club and the Opportunity Fund, a California-based CDFI\nmicroenterprise lender, announced a partnership intended to provide $10 million in loans over a period of\nfive months to 400 small businesses in underserved areas of California (for more information, see\nwww.opportunityfund.org/media/blog/clinton-announces-partnership-between-opportunity-fund-and-\nlending-club). In 2012, the Association for Enterprise Opportunities (AEO) launched the TILT Forward\nplatform, an online lending platform that is powered by OnDeck’s technology and can be used by AEO’s\nnetwork of nonprofit community lenders and other community-based organizations to reach underserved\nentrepreneurs (more information is available at www.tiltforward.com).\n19 In April 2014, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York hosted “Filling the Gaps: Summit on Small\nBusiness Credit Innovations.” and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco will be hosting the\nConsumer Financial Services Revolution in November 2015.\n20 For example, in March 2014, the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and San Francisco\nconvened a small group of thought leaders for a discussion on the challenges and opportunities presented\nby crowdfunding investments as a significant source of capital for the community development industry;\nand in March 2015, we cohosted the Financial Innovations Roundtable with the University of New\nHampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy and brought together representatives from banks, CDFIs,\nmission-driven lenders, and small business online alternative lenders to talk about opportunities for\ncollaboration, the challenges of scaling up small business lending, and potential consumer and safety and\nsoundness regulatory issues facing partnerships between regulated financial institutions and alternative\nonline lenders. As the sector grows and evolves, we will continue to monitor the development of online\nalternative lenders and the risks and opportunities that they may have for a range of stakeholders.\n\n- 11 -\nmore diverse set of small business borrowers. In some cases, partnerships between\ncommunity banks and online platforms may help expand access to credit for consumers\nand small businesses, and help banks retain and grow their customer base.\nAs regulators, we also want to help the various stakeholders anticipate and\ncarefully manage the associated risks. Of course, third-party and vendor risks are factors\nthat banks should always take into account when introducing new products and services.\nTaking the time to identify and mitigate risks is a prudent step that banks can take to\navoid unintended consequences when entering into partnership agreements with\nalternative online lenders. In addition, banks should consider whether the partnerships\nprovide new opportunities to diversify their portfolios if they are purchasing loans, and\nwhether the partnerships provide opportunities to offer new products that are a good\nstrategic fit for their bank and their customers.21\nIt is also important for banks to carefully consider regulatory compliance. When\npurchasing consumer loans originated by online alternative lenders, banks should\nexamine whether fair lending or unfair or deceptive acts or practices issues result from\nthe origination and underwriting methods used by online alternative lenders.22 To the\nextent that the underlying algorithms used for credit decisionmaking use nontraditional\n21 If a bank is considering a referral partnership, the following questions could help identify potential risks:\nDo existing customers have a need for the product or are there less expensive products that would better\nserve borrower’s needs? Are the features, risks, and terms of the products offered through the referral\nprogram explained clearly and conspicuously, or are they buried in a lengthy document full of “legalese”\nthat makes it difficult for borrowers to make a truly informed choice? Finally, are the products offered\nthrough the referral partnership consistent with what would be recommended to a family member? (See\nCurran, 2013.)\n22 There are several regulatory compliance-related questions that banks should consider. For example, have\nthe loans offered or the lending platform to be partnered with been reviewed for compliance with\napplicable federal and state laws? Have the loans originated by the partnering lending platform been\nreviewed from a consumer fairness standpoint? When assessing referral partnerships, have any issues been\nidentified that would lead to disparate treatment of customers if banks selectively refer customers to online\nalternative lending partners? (See Federal Reserve System Community Banking Connections Advisory\nBoard, 2014).\n\n- 12 -\ndata sources, it will be important to ensure that this does not lead to disparate treatment or\nhave a disparate impact on a prohibited basis.\nAside from these risks, banks should consider a variety of others, including the\nimplications of credit risk stemming from the purchase of loans and reputational risk if\nreferrals to online alternative lending platforms end badly.\nThe risks I have described so far have primarily been from the perspective of\nbanks considering partnerships with online alternative lenders. Another important set of\nconcerns are focused on the small business borrowers who may be considering online\nalternative loans. Some have raised concerns about the high APRs associated with some\nonline alternative lending products. Others have raised concerns about the risk that some\nsmall business borrowers may have difficulty fully understanding the terms of the various\nloan products or the risk of becoming trapped in layered debt that poses risks to the\nsurvival of their businesses. Some industry participants have recently proposed that\nonline lenders follow a voluntary set of guidelines designed to standardize best practices\nand mitigate these risks.23 It is too soon to determine whether such efforts of industry\nparticipants to self-police will be sufficient. Even with these efforts, some have\nsuggested a need for regulators to take a more active role in defining and enforcing\nstandards that apply more broadly in this sector.\nNo doubt, ongoing technological advances and the evolving competitive lending\nlandscape will continue to present both challenges and opportunities for community\nbankers who are deeply committed to the provision of credit to small businesses. I\nremain confident that community bankers will continue to play a vital role in the small\n23 For example, see www.responsiblebusinesslending.org.\n\n- 13 -\nbusiness lending landscape as the respective business models of online platforms and\ncommunity banks evolve. The advantage that comes from close relationships with their\ncustomers and intimate knowledge of their communities that lie at the heart of\ncommunity banking will continue to provide a powerful advantage in serving the vital\nbanking needs of small businesses, even as the use of nontraditional sources of data and\nelectronic processing platforms may permit faster loan decisions, especially for smaller\nloan amounts, to a broader set of borrowers.\nThank you, again, to the conference organizers for inviting me to this important\nevent and for the opportunity to speak to you today.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nBerger, Allen N., and Gregory F.

Butler Award\nNew York Association for Business Economics\nNew York, New York\nNovember 26, 2019\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you. It is an honor to join the 45 outstanding\neconomic researchers and practitioners who are past recipients of the William F. Butler\nAward. I want to express my deep appreciation to the New York Association for\nBusiness Economics (NYABE) and NYABE President Julia Coronado.\nI will offer my preliminary views on the Federal Reserve’s review of its monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communications after first touching briefly on the economic\noutlook. These remarks represent my own views. The framework review is ongoing and\nwill extend into 2020, and no conclusions have been reached at this time.1\nOutlook and Policy\nThere are good reasons to expect the economy to grow at a pace modestly above\npotential over the next year or so, supported by strong consumers and a healthy job\nmarket, despite persistent uncertainty about trade conflict and disappointing foreign\ngrowth. Recent data provide some reassurance that consumer spending continues to\nexpand at a healthy pace despite some slowing in retail sales. Consumer sentiment\nremains solid, and the employment picture is positive. Housing seems to have turned a\ncorner and is poised for growth following several weak quarters.\nBusiness investment remains downbeat, restrained by weak growth abroad and\ntrade conflict. But there is little sign so far that the softness in trade, manufacturing, and\nbusiness investment is affecting consumer spending, and the effect on services has been\nlimited.\n1 I am grateful to Ivan Vidangos of the Federal Reserve Board for assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nEmployment remains strong. The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age\nadults has moved up to its pre-recession peak, and the three-month moving average of the\nunemployment rate is near a 50-year low.2 Monthly job gains remain above the pace\nneeded to absorb new entrants into the labor force despite some slowing since last year.\nAnd initial claims for unemployment insurance—a useful real-time indicator\nhistorically—remain very low despite some modest increases.\nData on inflation have come in about as I expected, on balance, in recent months.\nInflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent symmetric objective, which has\nbeen true for most of the past seven years. The price index for core personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE), which excludes food and energy prices and is a better\nindicator of future inflation than overall PCE prices, increased 1.7 percent over the\n12 months through September.\nForeign growth remains subdued. While there are signs that the decline in euro-\narea manufacturing is stabilizing, the latest indicators on economic activity in China\nremain sluggish, and the news in Japan and in many emerging markets has been\ndisappointing. Overall, it appears third-quarter foreign growth was weak, and the latest\nindicators point to little improvement in the fourth quarter.\nMore broadly, the balance of risks remains to the downside, although there has\nbeen some improvement in risk sentiment in recent weeks. The risk of a disorderly\nBrexit in the near future has declined significantly, and there is some hope that a U.S.–\n2 Claudia Sahm shows that a 1/2 percentage point increase in the three-month moving average of the\nunemployment rate relative to the previous year’s low is a good real-time recession indicator. See Claudia\nSahm (2019), “Direct Stimulus Payments to Individuals,” Policy Proposal, The Hamilton Project at the\nBrookings Institution (Washington: THP, May 16),\nhttps://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/Sahm_web_20190506.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nChina trade truce could avert additional tariffs. While risks remain, financial market\nindicators suggest market participants see a diminution in such risks, and probabilities of\nrecessions from models using market data have declined.\nThe baseline is for continued moderate expansion, a strong labor market, and\ninflation moving gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective. The Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) has taken significant action to provide insurance against the\nrisks associated with trade conflict and weak foreign growth against a backdrop of muted\ninflation. Since July, the Committee has lowered the target range for the federal funds\nrate by 3/4 percentage point, to the current range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. It will take\nsome time for the full effect of this accommodation to work its way through economic\nactivity, the labor market, and inflation. I will be watching the data carefully for signs of\na material change to the outlook that could prompt me to reassess the appropriate path of\npolicy.\nReview\nThe Federal Reserve is conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy,\ntools, and communications to make sure we are well positioned to advance our statutory\ngoals of maximum employment and price stability.3 Three key features of today’s new\nnormal call for a reassessment of our monetary policy strategy: the neutral rate is very\n3 Information about the review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications is available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications.htm.

This raises the risk that households and businesses could come\nto expect inflation to run persistently below our target and change their behavior in a way\nthat reinforces that expectation. Indeed, with inflation having fallen short of 2 percent for\nmost of the past seven years, inflation expectations may have declined, as suggested by\nsome survey-based measures of long-run inflation expectations and by market-based\nmeasures of inflation compensation.\nSecond, the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low. This\nis what economists mean when they say that the Phillips curve is flat. A flat Phillips\ncurve has the important advantage of allowing employment to continue expanding for\nlonger without generating inflationary pressures, thereby providing greater opportunities\nto more people. But it also makes it harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on\na sustained basis when inflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent.\nThird, the long-run neutral rate of interest is very low, which means that we are\nlikely to see more frequent and prolonged episodes when the federal funds rate is stuck at\n4 See Lael Brainard (2016), “The ‘New Normal’ and What It Means for Monetary Policy,” speech delivered\nat the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Chicago, September 12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20160912a.htm.\n5 See Lael Brainard (2017), \"Understanding the Disconnect between Employment and Inflation with a Low\nNeutral Rate,\" speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, September 5,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170905a.htm ; and James H.

A variety of forces have likely contributed to\na decline in the neutral rate, including demographic trends in many large economies,\nsome slowing in the rate of productivity growth, and increases in the demand for safe\nassets. When looking at the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP),\nit is striking that the Committee’s median projection of the longer-run federal funds rate\nhas moved down from 4-1/4 percent to 2-1/2 percent over the past seven years.7 A\nsimilar decline can be seen among private forecasts.8 This decline means the\nconventional policy buffer is likely to be only about half of the 4-1/2 to 5 percentage\npoints by which the FOMC has typically cut the federal funds rate to counter recessionary\npressures over the past five decades.\nThis large loss of policy space will tend to increase the frequency or length of\nperiods when the policy rate is pinned at the ELB, unemployment is elevated, and\ninflation is below target.9 In turn, the experience of frequent or extended periods of low\n6 See Lael Brainard (2015), “Normalizing Monetary Policy When the Neutral Interest Rate Is Low,” speech\ndelivered at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford, Calif., December 1,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151201a.htm.\n7 The projection materials for the Federal Reserve’s SEP are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n8 For example, the Blue Chip Consensus long-run projection for the three-month Treasury bill has declined\nfrom 3.6 percent in October 2012 to 2.4 percent in October 2019.

The risk is a downward spiral where conventional policy\nspace gets compressed even further, the ELB binds even more frequently, and it becomes\nincreasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target.\nWhile consumers and businesses might see very low inflation as having benefits at the\nindividual level, at the aggregate level, inflation that is too low can make it very\nchallenging for monetary policy to cut the short-term nominal interest rate sufficiently to\ncushion the economy effectively.10\nThe experience of Japan and of the euro area more recently suggests that this risk\nis real. Indeed, the fact that Japan and the euro area are struggling with this challenging\ntriad further complicates our task, because there are important potential spillovers from\nmonetary policy in other major economies to our own economy through exchange rate\nand yield curve channels.11\nIn light of the likelihood of more frequent episodes at the ELB, our monetary\npolicy review should advance two goals. First, monetary policy should achieve average\ninflation outcomes of 2 percent over time to re-anchor inflation expectations at our target.\nSecond, we need to expand policy space to buffer the economy from adverse\ndevelopments at the ELB.\nEconomics Discussion Series 2019-003 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nJanuary), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.003.\n10 The important observation that some consumers and businesses see low inflation as having benefits\nemerged from listening to a diverse range of perspectives, including representatives of consumer, labor,\nbusiness, community, and other groups during the Fed Listens events; for details, see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-fed-listens-events.htm.\n11 See Lael Brainard (2017), “Cross-Border Spillovers of Balance Sheet Normalization,” speech delivered\nat the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Monetary Economics Summer Institute, Cambridge, Mass.,\nJuly 13, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170713a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nAchieving the Inflation Target\nThe apparent slippage in trend inflation below our target calls for some\nadjustments to our monetary policy strategy and communications. In this context and as\npart of our review, my colleagues and I have been discussing how to better anchor\ninflation expectations firmly at our objective. In particular, it may be helpful to specify\nthat policy aims to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time or over\nthe cycle. Given the persistent shortfall of inflation from its target over recent years, this\nwould imply supporting inflation a bit above 2 percent for some time to compensate for\nthe period of underperformance.\nOne class of strategies that has been proposed to address this issue are formal\n“makeup” rules that seek to compensate for past inflation deviations from target. For\ninstance, under price-level targeting, policy seeks to stabilize the price level around a\nconstant growth path that is consistent with the inflation objective.12 Under average\ninflation targeting, policy seeks to return the average of inflation to the target over some\nspecified period.13\nTo be successful, formal makeup strategies require that financial market\nparticipants, households, and businesses understand in advance and believe, to some\ndegree, that policy will compensate for past misses. I suspect policymakers would find\ncommunications to be quite challenging with rigid forms of makeup strategies, because\n12 See, for example, James Bullard (2018), “A Primer on Price Level Targeting in the U.S.,” a presentation\nbefore the CFA Society of St. Louis, St. Louis, Mo., January 10,\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/bullard/remarks/2018/bullard_cfa_stlouis_10_january_2018.\npdf?la=en.\n13 See, for example, Lars Svensson (2019), “Monetary Policy Strategies for the Federal Reserve,” presented\nat “Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools and Communication Practices,” sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, June 5,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/others/events/2019/monetary-policy-conference/monetary-policy-\nstrategies-svensson-pdf.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 8 -\nof what have been called time-inconsistency problems. For example, if inflation has been\nrunning well below—or above—target for a sustained period, when the time arrives to\nmaintain inflation commensurately above—or below—2 percent for the same amount of\ntime, economic conditions will typically be inconsistent with implementing the promised\naction. Analysis also suggests it could take many years with a formal average inflation\ntargeting framework to return inflation to target following an ELB episode, although this\ndepends on difficult-to-assess modeling assumptions and the particulars of the strategy.14\nThus, while formal average inflation targeting rules have some attractive\nproperties in theory, they could be challenging to implement in practice. I prefer a more\nflexible approach that would anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent by achieving\ninflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time or over the cycle. For instance,\nfollowing five years when the public has observed inflation outcomes in the range of 1-\n1/2 to 2 percent, to avoid a decline in expectations, the Committee would target inflation\noutcomes in a range of, say, 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the subsequent five years to achieve\ninflation outcomes of 2 percent on average overall. Flexible inflation averaging could\nbring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be\nsimpler to communicate. By committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2\npercent over time, the Committee would make clear in advance that it would\n14 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, September 17–18, 2019,” press release, October 9,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20191009a.htm; and David\nReifschneider and David Wilcox (2019), “Average Inflation Targeting Would Be a Weak Tool for the Fed\nto Deal with Recession and Chronic Low Inflation,” Policy Brief PB19-16 (Washington: Peterson Institute\nfor International Economics, November), https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/documents/pb19-16.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\naccommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be\ndescribed as a process of opportunistic reflation.15\nPolicy at the ELB\nSecond, the Committee is examining what monetary policy tools are likely to be\neffective in providing accommodation when the federal funds rate is at the ELB.16 In my\nview, the review should make clear that the Committee will actively employ its full\ntoolkit so that the ELB is not an impediment to providing accommodation in the face of\nsignificant economic disruptions.\nThe importance and challenge of providing accommodation when the policy rate\nreaches the ELB should not be understated. In my own experience on the international\nresponse to the financial crisis, I was struck that the ELB proved to be a severe\nimpediment to the provision of policy accommodation initially. Once conventional\npolicy reached the ELB, the long delays necessitated for policymakers in nearly every\njurisdiction to develop consensus and take action on unconventional policy sapped\nconfidence, tightened financial conditions, and weakened recovery. Economic conditions\nin the euro area and elsewhere suffered for longer than necessary in part because of the\nlengthy process of building agreement to act decisively with a broader set of tools.\n15 See Janice C. Eberly, James H. Stock, and Jonathan H. Wright (2019), “The Federal Reserve’s Current\nFramework for Monetary Policy: A Review and Assessment,” paper presented at “Conference on\nMonetary Policy Strategy, Tools and Communication Practices,” sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago, Chicago, June 4, https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/others/events/2019/monetary-policy-\nconference/review-current-framework-eberly-stock-wright-pdf.\n16 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, July 31–August 1, 2018,” press release, August 1,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20180801.htm; and Board of Governors\n(2019), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, October 29–30, 2019,” press release, October 30,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20191030.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nDespite delays and uncertainties, the balance of evidence suggests forward\nguidance and balance sheet policies were effective in easing financial conditions and\nproviding accommodation following the global financial crisis.17 Accordingly, these\ntools should remain part of the Committee’s toolkit. However, the quantitative asset\npurchase policies that were used following the crisis proved to be lumpy both to initiate\nat the ELB and to calibrate over the course of the recovery. This lumpiness tends to\ncreate discontinuities in the provision of accommodation that can be costly. To the extent\nthat the public is uncertain about the conditions that might trigger asset purchases and\nhow long the purchases would be sustained, it undercuts the efficacy of the policy.\nSimilarly, significant frictions associated with the normalization process can arise as the\nend of the asset purchase program approaches.\nFor these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the\nspace for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our\nconventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy\nrate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on\n17 For details on purchases of securities by the Federal Reserve, see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/timeline-balance-sheet-policies.htm.

The yield curve ceilings would transmit additional accommodation through the\nlonger rates that are relevant for households and businesses in a manner that is more\ncontinuous than quantitative asset purchases. Moreover, if the horizon on the interest rate\ncaps is set so as to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate, doing so would\naugment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an\nopen-ended balance sheet commitment. In addition, once the targeted outcome is\nachieved, and the caps expire, any securities that were acquired under the program would\nroll off organically, unwinding the policy smoothly and predictably. This is important, as\nit could potentially avoid some of the tantrum dynamics that have led to premature\nsteepening at the long end of the yield curve in several jurisdictions.\nForward guidance on the policy rate will also be important in providing\naccommodation at the ELB. As we saw in the United States at the end of 2015 and again\ntoward the second half of 2016, there tends to be strong pressure to “normalize” or lift off\nfrom the ELB preemptively based on historical relationships between inflation and\nemployment. A better alternative would have been to delay liftoff until we had achieved\nour targets. Indeed, recent research suggests that forward guidance that commits to delay\n“What Tools Does The Fed Have Left? Part 2: Targeting Longer-Term Interest Rates,” blog post,\nBrookings Institution, March 24, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/03/24/what-tools-\ndoes-the-fed-have-left-part-2-targeting-longer-term-interest-rates.\n\n- 12 -\nthe liftoff from the ELB until full employment and 2 percent inflation have been achieved\non a sustained basis—say over the course of a year—could improve performance on our\ndual-mandate goals.19\nTo reinforce this commitment, the forward guidance on the policy rate could be\nimplemented in tandem with yield curve caps. For example, as the federal funds rate\napproaches the ELB, the Committee could commit to refrain from lifting off the ELB\nuntil full employment and 2 percent inflation are sustained for a year. Based on its\nassessment of how long this is likely take, the Committee would then commit to capping\nrates out the yield curve for a period consistent with the expected horizon of the outcome-\nbased forward guidance. If the outlook shifts materially, the Committee could reassess\nhow long it will take to get inflation back to 2 percent and adjust policy accordingly. One\nbenefit of this approach is that the forward guidance and the yield curve ceilings would\nreinforce each other.\nThe combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained\nachievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at\nthe same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances. For very severe\nrecessions, such as the financial crisis, such an approach could be augmented with\npurchases of 10-year Treasury securities to provide further accommodation at the long\nend of the yield curve. Presumably, the requisite scale of such purchases—when\ncombined with medium-term yield curve ceilings and forward guidance on the policy\n19 See Ben Bernanke, Michael Kiley, and John Roberts (2019), “Monetary Policy Strategies for a Low-Rate\nEnvironment,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2019-009 (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2019.009; and Chung and others, “Monetary\nPolicy Options at the Effective Lower Bound,” in note 9.\n\n- 13 -\nrate—would be relatively smaller than if the longer-term asset purchases were used\nalone.\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability\nBefore closing, it is important to recall another important lesson of the financial\ncrisis: The stability of the financial system is important to the achievement of the\nstatutory goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation. In that regard, the changes in\nthe macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review may have\nsome implications for financial stability. Historically, when the Phillips curve was\nsteeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, which prompted the Federal\nReserve to raise interest rates. In turn, the interest rate increases would have the effect of\ntightening financial conditions more broadly. With a flat Phillips curve, inflation does\nnot rise as much as resource utilization tightens, and interest rates are less likely to rise to\nrestrictive levels. The resulting lower-for-longer interest rates, along with sustained high\nrates of resource utilization, are conducive to increasing risk appetite, which could\nprompt reach-for-yield behavior and incentives to take on additional debt, leading to\nfinancial imbalances as an expansion extends.\nTo the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and\nlow underlying inflation may lead financial stability risks to become more tightly linked\nto the business cycle, it would be preferable to use tools other than tightening monetary\npolicy to temper the financial cycle. In particular, active use of macroprudential tools\nsuch as the countercyclical buffer is vital to enable monetary policy to stay focused on\nachieving maximum employment and average inflation of 2 percent on a sustained basis.\n\n- 14 -\nConclusion\nThe Federal Reserve’s commitment to adapt our monetary policy strategy to\nchanging circumstances has enabled us to support the U.S. economy throughout the\nexpansion, which is now in its 11th year. In light of the decline in the neutral rate, low\ntrend inflation, and low sensitivity of inflation to slack as well as the consequent greater\nfrequency of the policy rate being at the effective lower bound, this is an important time\nto review our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications in order to improve\nthe achievement of our statutory goals. I have offered some preliminary thoughts on how\nwe could bolster inflation expectations by achieving inflation outcomes of 2 percent on\naverage over time and, when policy is constrained by the ELB, how we could combine\nforward guidance on the policy rate with caps on the short-to-medium segment of the\nyield curve to buffer the economy against adverse developments.",

Indeed, it may be\nthat the dismal estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the annualized change in\nfirst-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), negative 0.7 percent, is principally an\nextension of the pattern, seen for several years, of significantly slower measured GDP\ngrowth in the first quarter followed by considerably stronger readings during the\nremainder of the year. In that case, it would be appropriate to minimize the importance\nof the first-quarter estimate in judging the likely path of the economy over the remainder\nof the year.\nBut there may be reasons not to ignore the recent readings entirely. First, the\nlimited data in hand pertaining to the second quarter do not suggest a significant\nbounceback in aggregate spending, which we would expect if all of the weakness in the\nfirst quarter were due to transitory factors. Private-sector forecasts of second-quarter\ngrowth are centered around 2-1/2 percent, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s\n1 As always, these remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the\nFederal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nGDPNow forecast, which was quite accurate in its prediction of the first estimate of first-\nquarter GDP growth, is projecting second-quarter GDP growth of only 0.8 percent.2\nSecond, it would not be the first time this recovery has proceeded in fits and\nstarts. The underlying momentum of the recovery has proven relatively susceptible to\nsuccessive headwinds, which have kept overall economic growth well below the average\npace of previous upturns.\nMy own reading is that earlier, more optimistic growth projections may have\nplaced too much weight on the boost to spending from lower energy prices and too little\nweight on the negative implications for aggregate demand of the significant increase in\nthe foreign exchange value of the dollar and large decline in the price of crude oil.\nTurning first to the expected positive effects, at a time when a lot of the growth\nburden is riding on U.S. consumers, consumers appear to be disinclined to spend much of\nthe gains from cheaper prices at the pump, preferring, it seems, to strengthen household\nbalance sheets instead. Relative to expectations predicated on the boost to real income\nfrom lower gas prices, consumer spending so far this year has been undeniably weak,\nespecially given a backdrop of improving labor market prospects, solid consumer\nsentiment, and improving credit availability. Consumer spending is reported to have\nincreased at an annual rate of only 1.8 percent in the first quarter--far below the\n5.3 percent increase in household real disposable income. Moreover, monthly data on\nexpenditures through April do not suggest a large bounceback going into the second\nquarter.\n2 For details on the most recent private-sector forecasts, see Aspen Publishers (2015), Blue Chip Financial\nForecasts, vol. 34, no. 6 (June 1). More information about the GDPNow forecast is available on the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s website at www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx.\n\n- 3 -\nContinuing softness in consumption this year would naturally raise some\nquestions about a more persistent change in consumer behavior. For example, the\nfinancial crisis may have altered expectations of longer-run income growth and attitudes\ntoward risk such that consumers may be more cautious about spending gains in income\nand wealth that are perceived to be temporary.\nModest growth in consumer spending would be significant because strength in\nother categories of aggregate demand remains elusive. Although the data on April\nhousing starts and permits look promising, the current level of single-family housing\npermits is little changed from the level in the fourth quarter of last year, and average\ngrowth in residential investment over the past year and a half has been tepid. Given low\ninterest rates and continued job gains, it is puzzling that housing starts have remained far\nbelow the trend levels implied by population growth. Tight credit for borrowers with\nless-than-pristine credit may explain some of the weakness. But it is also possible that\nattitudes toward homeownership have changed as a result of the financial crisis and\nrecent recession, especially among the millennial Great Recession generation.\nMeanwhile, government spending has contributed very little, on average, to GDP\ngrowth in recent quarters. With the Budget Control Act of 2011 restraining federal\noutlays and with pension and health-care obligations limiting expenditures at the state\nand local level, the public sector is not likely to contribute significantly to GDP growth\nover the next few years.\nJust as the positive effects appear to have been more muted than expected, so, too,\nthe negative effects from the substantial decline in the price of oil and appreciation of the\nexchange rate on business investment, manufacturing, and exports seem to have been\n\n- 4 -\ngreater than expected. In response to the drop in oil prices, drilling activity is reported to\nhave fallen at an annual rate of nearly 50 percent in the first quarter, and data on drilling\nrigs in operation suggest another large decline this quarter.\nAt the same time, the dollar’s rise is reducing net exports, and perhaps restraining\ninvestment in areas sensitive to foreign demand, with greater force than anticipated. Net\nexports subtracted 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter and a\nwhopping 1.9 percentage points in the first quarter. This large decline likely reflects\nmore than exchange rate appreciation alone, but some drag on net exports from exchange\nrate appreciation is likely to persist. Indicators of business equipment spending--such as\norders and shipments of capital goods, as well as business sentiment--have also been\nweak, suggesting that overall business investment will change little over the first half of\nthe year.\nOther indicators also suggest a negative effect on manufacturing activity from\nforeign headwinds. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) national manufacturing\ndiffusion index of new export orders has been in contractionary or neutral territory for\nfour of the past five months. Manufacturing production declined at an annual rate of\n1 percent in the first quarter, and the outlook for internationally oriented firms has\nworsened appreciably recently.\nOf course, there is a danger in reading too much into these data. Indicators, such\nas the ISM’s nonmanufacturing composite index, suggest that activity has remained solid\nin the private services sector, which accounts for the bulk of economic activity. It is\npossible that we will soon see the stronger trend in domestic economic activity that was\n\n- 5 -\napparent in the second half of last year reassert itself. In assessing this possibility, it is\nimportant to keep in mind the international context, which I will turn to next.\nInternational Context\nThe notable effects of recent crosscurrents from abroad should lay to rest any\nremaining lore that the United States is a closed economy. Financial linkages between\nthe United States and foreign economies are immediate and extensive. Equity prices,\nlong-term interest rates and risk spreads, and exchange rates show strong reactions to\ndevelopments abroad, and, in recent months, foreign developments have at times been the\ndominant factor driving U.S. financial conditions. Weak foreign aggregate demand, as\nwell as accompanying accommodative monetary policies in the euro area and Japan, and\ndiverging expectations have been key among the factors causing a significant 10 percent\nappreciation of the dollar since last June. To the extent that exchange rate appreciation\nexerts a tightening force on financial conditions in the United States, it delays the return\nof U.S. interest rates to more normal levels.\nWhile trade is a smaller share of the U.S. economy than in many other economies,\nexchange rate changes of the magnitude seen recently can have large effects on aggregate\ndemand.3 We have already seen a large negative contribution of net exports to U.S. GDP\ngrowth in the past two quarters. In addition, because some models estimate that\nexchange rates’ effect on net exports can last up to three years, it is possible that the drag\nfrom net exports will persist for some time. Even before the latest estimate of the first-\nquarter contribution of net exports to GDP was published, many private-sector forecasters\n3 In addition, an increase over time in import and export shares will increase the effect of exchange rate\nchanges on real GDP even if the export and import elasticities have not changed.\n\n- 6 -\n(as well as the Congressional Budget Office) expected net exports to subtract from GDP\ngrowth this year and next.\nRecently, the euro area has seen some encouraging data on retail sales, industrial\nproduction, and inflation, auguring well for some sustained improvement in aggregate\ndemand within the euro area. Nonetheless, there remain risks and uncertainties\nsurrounding foreign growth that could prolong or intensify foreign headwinds going\nforward.\nMost immediately, negotiations between Greece and its creditors are challenging,\nand the risk of further deterioration cannot be ruled out. While the euro area has\nbroadened its policy toolkit and most member states have made significant strides in\nbuilding resilience in the past couple of years, the recovery is still fragile in several\nmember states, and vulnerabilities to financial stresses remain.\nIn addition, Chinese GDP growth looks to have slowed noticeably in the first\nquarter, and there is some risk of further slowing. This development reflects in part a\nsignificant correction in the property market and the shadow banking sector following\nyears of rapid growth. But structural factors are also at work. After growing at a nearly\ndouble-digit rate for more than three decades, China has reached a transitional phase in\nwhich potential output growth is expected to slow in part because of challenging\ndemographics and the transition from heavy reliance on exports and investment toward\ngreater dependence on household demand.\nUltimately, lower interest rates abroad should boost domestic demand in the euro\narea and Japan, which could eventually be a net positive for U.S. net exports. But the\n\n- 7 -\nmost immediate effect appears to be a shift in asset demand toward countries with\nrelatively higher expected interest rates, such as the United States.\nInflation, Employment, and the Implications for Monetary Policy\nForeign headwinds also appear to be affecting U.S. inflation. Weak foreign\ndemand appears to be the dominant factor driving recent reductions in the prices of some\nnon-oil commodities and also likely played some role in last year’s decline in oil prices,\nalthough changes in supply are likely the more important driver.\nThe stronger dollar is also weighing on U.S. inflation through lower import\nprices. Non-oil import prices are reported to have declined at an annual rate of\n4-1/2 percent last quarter, and data on trade prices through April suggest a decrease of a\nsimilar magnitude this quarter. Based on the share of imports in consumption,\neconometric models imply that falling import prices might subtract about 0.3 percentage\npoint from consumer price inflation this year.\nStarting this month, with the end of calendar-based forward guidance, the\ndecisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regarding the level of the\nfederal funds rate will depend on the evolution of incoming economic data. While the\ndate of liftoff will not be predetermined, the conditions governing the decision to lift off\nhave been clearly stated. First, to have reasonable confidence that inflation will be on\ntrack to reach its target of 2 percent over the medium term, I will be looking closely at a\nvariety of indicators--in particular, signs that core inflation is firming, deflationary\npressures from abroad are abating, and both survey- and market-based measures of\ninflation expectations are stable.\n\n- 8 -\nDespite the deflationary pressures from abroad, the recent data have provided\nsome reassurance that inflation in the United States is starting to firm. Oil prices have\nnow retraced part of their decline from the middle of last year through January, and\nmonthly changes in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices have increased\nfrom the very low levels reached around the turn of the year.\nIn the face of the long period of weak overall inflation, it is reassuring that\nsurvey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations appear to have remained\nstable. In addition, market-based measures of inflation expectations have moved up\nsomewhat in the past few months after several months of decreases that appeared to have\nbeen associated with oil price declines and heightened anxiety about global deflationary\npressures. Even so, most indicators of the underlying trend in PCE inflation, such as the\n12-month change in core PCE prices or the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s 12-month\ntrimmed mean PCE inflation rate, are around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, noticeably below the\nFOMC’s 2 percent target.\nSecond, I will also want to see further improvement in the labor market with solid\nfurther employment growth and further evidence of a narrowing of resource utilization\ngaps based on various indicators, including the unemployment rate, the labor force\nparticipation rate, the percentage of employees who are working part time for economic\nreasons, and faster wage growth.\nThe robust pace of labor market improvement was perhaps the brightest part of\nthe data picture over 2014. As we have advanced into 2015, the pace of job gains has\nslowed. Average monthly nonfarm payroll employment gains in the past three months\nwere a little under 200,000, down from last year’s pace of 260,000. Even so, job gains\n\n- 9 -\nstill appear to be consistent with declining labor market slack, as do indicators such as\nunemployment insurance claims and job openings, which remain robust.\nMy judgment is that there is still room for employment and hours worked to grow\nfurther, as there are other labor market indicators that suggest slack not captured by the\nunemployment rate. For example, the labor force participation rate remains low relative\nto its declining pre-crisis trend, and the number of employees who are working less than\nthey would like is still elevated relative to pre-crisis standards. Moreover, on balance,\naggregate measures of wage growth remain soft and have not significantly strengthened\nin the past year, suggesting there is remaining slack in the labor market.\nIn addition, although the unemployment rate is now near levels commonly\nassociated with the natural rate of unemployment, there are reasons to think that the\nnatural rate may have declined over the past few years such that a gap remains between\nthe unemployment rate and its natural rate. The composition of the labor force, for\nexample, looks to be shifting toward groups with relatively low levels of unemployment.4\nIn addition, it may be that a reduction in worker bargaining power or perhaps reduced\nlevels of labor market churning are putting downward pressure on the natural rate.5\n4 For more details on the composition of the labor force, see Daniel Aaronson, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini,\nand Daniel G. Sullivan (2015), “Changing Labor Force Composition and the Natural Rate of\nUnemployment,” Chicago Fed Letter, no. 338 (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, May),\nwww.chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2015/cfl338-pdf.pdf.\n5 For a discussion of the effects of worker bargaining power on the natural rate, see Andrew Figura and\nDavid Ratner (forthcoming), “The Labor Share of Income and Equilibrium Unemployment,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). For a discussion of the effect of labor\nmarket churning on the unemployment rate, see Steven J. Davis, R. Jason Faberman, John Haltiwanger,\nRon Jarmin, and Javier Miranda (2010), “Business Volatility, Job Destruction, and Unemployment,”\nAmerican Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 2 (April), pp. 259-87; and Michael Feroli (2014),\n“U.S.: The Consequences of Economic Calcification,” J.P. Morgan Economic Research Note (New York:\nJPMorgan Chase, September), as noted in James Pethokoukis (2014), “America Suffering from ‘Economic\nCalcification’--JP Morgan,” AEIdeas (blog), September 2, www.aei.org/publication/america-suffering-\nfrom-economic-calcification-jp-morgan.\n\n- 10 -\nWith the labor market evidencing additional slack not well captured by the\nstandard unemployment rate and with inflation remaining soft, there may be additional\nroom to support further healing in the labor market, which is appropriate following the\ndeep damage from the Great Recession.\nGiven the softness in the data we have seen so far this year and some uncertainty\nabout how much to attribute to temporary or statistical factors, I think there is value to\nwatchful waiting while additional data help clarify the economy’s underlying momentum\nin the face of the headwinds from abroad. If continued labor market strengthening is\nconfirmed and inflation readings continue to improve, liftoff could come before the end\nof the year.\nIt is important to underscore, however, that the date of liftoff is only one in an\nongoing series of decisions the FOMC will be making in response to incoming data. Just\nas no previous recovery has proceeded as this one has, so, too, there is no reason to\nexpect monetary policy to follow previous tightening cycles. Given the unique\nconditions in the labor market and the economy more broadly, I will want to move step\nby step--observing how the markets and the economy respond before gauging the\nappropriate next step in the policy path.\nThe divergence in conditions here and abroad also injects an element of\nuncertainty with regard to the path of policy. While, as noted earlier, the dollar’s\nappreciation is generally transmitted into somewhat tighter financial conditions, the\nadvent of quantitative easing in Europe appeared to have led to some compression in term\npremiums not only in European bond markets, but also in the United States. Although\nlonger-dated yields have recently moved somewhat higher, it is nonetheless difficult to\n\n- 11 -\nknow in advance how term premiums will respond when U.S. normalization gets under\nway. To the extent that the commencement of normalization leads to relatively greater\ndemand for U.S. assets, we could see echoes of the so-called conundrum in the period\nfrom 2004 to 2005, when rising short-term rates were accompanied by falling forward\nrates. But the reverse is also possible, with term premiums moving more steeply than\nappropriate for underlying economic conditions, which we saw in the so-called taper\ntantrum episode in 2013.\nCertainly, my colleagues and I are mindful of recent episodes in which we have\nseen unusually sharp spikes in market volatility. Accordingly, I expect that the FOMC\nwill continue proceeding to the greatest extent possible in a very deliberate manner,\naiming to provide clear communications about Committee members’ assessments of the\neconomic and policy outlook.\nBased on today’s picture of moderate underlying momentum in the domestic\neconomy and the likelihood of continued crosscurrents from abroad, the process of\nnormalizing monetary policy is likely to be gradual. It is also important to remember that\nthe stance of monetary policy will remain highly accommodative even after the federal\nfunds rate moves off the effective lower bound, because the real federal funds rate will\ninitially still be low and because of the elevated size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\nsheet and the associated downward pressure on long-term rates. Moreover, the FOMC\nhas stated clearly that it will reduce the size of the balance sheet in a gradual and\npredictable manner starting at an appropriate time after liftoff, which will depend on how\neconomic and financial conditions evolve.\n\n- 12 -\nIn summary, the string of soft data in the first quarter raises some questions about\nthe contours of the outlook. While it is possible that residual seasonality and temporary\nfactors were responsible, it would be difficult, based on the data available today, to\ndismiss the possibility of a more significant drag on the economy than anticipated from\nforeign crosscurrents and the negative effects of the oil price decline, along with a more\ncautious U.S. consumer. This possibility argues for giving the data some more time to\nconfirm further improvement in the labor market and firming of inflation toward our\n2 percent target. But while the case for liftoff may not be immediate, it is coming into\nclearer view. When that time comes, the policy path will be highly attuned to incoming\ndata and not on a preset course, and it is important to be mindful of the possibility of\nvolatility as markets adjust to a change in the stance of policy. Thus, the FOMC will\ncontinue communicating as clearly as possible regarding the outlook and the factors\nunderlying its policy determinations.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT (3:00 p.m. local time)\nJuly 1, 2015\nRecent Changes in the Resilience of Market Liquidity\nRemarks by\nLael Brainard\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPolicy Makers’ Panel on Financial Intermediation: Complexities and Risks\nfor “The Future of Financial Intermediation:\nBanking, Securities Markets, or Something New?”\nSalzburg Global Forum on Finance in a Changing World\nSalzburg Global Seminar\nSalzburg, Austria\nJuly 1, 2015\n\nRecent events and commentary raise concerns about a possible deterioration in\nliquidity at times of market stress, particularly in fixed income markets.1 These concerns\nare highlighted by several episodes of unusually large intraday price movements that are\ndifficult to ascribe to any particular news event, which suggest a deterioration in the\nresilience of market liquidity. For example, on the morning of October 15, 2014, 10-year\nU.S. Treasury yields gyrated wildly, and the intraday movement in Treasury prices was\n6 standard deviations above the mean. In addition, after 4 p.m. on March 18 EDT of this\nyear, a meeting day for the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. dollar depreciated\nagainst the euro by 1.75 percent in less than three minutes, an unusually large drop in\nsuch a short interval. A few weeks later, markets experienced some very large intraday\nmovements in the price of German bunds during times of little market news.\nIn contrast, there have been a few notable episodes where market volatility was\nclearly attributable to significant news but nonetheless appeared to evidence some\ndeterioration in the resilience of liquidity. For example, on January 15 of this year, the\nannouncement by the Swiss National Bank regarding the floor of the exchange rate\nbetween the euro and the Swiss franc led to severe disruptions in foreign exchange\nmarkets. Separately, the rise in bond yields in May and June 2013, the so-called taper\ntantrum, also appeared to many observers to have been out of proportion to the news that\nprompted it.2\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Tobias Adrian, Michael Fleming, Jonathan Goldberg, Morgan Lewis, Fabio Natalucci, and Jason Wu\n(2013), “Dealer Balance Sheet Capacity and Market Liquidity during the 2013 Selloff in Fixed Income\nMarkets,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October 16),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2013/dealer-balance-sheet-capacity-and-market-\nliquidity-during-the-2013-selloff-in-fixed-income-markets-20131016.html.\n\n- 2 -\nA reduction in the resilience of liquidity at times of stress could be significant if it\nacted as an amplification mechanism, impeded price discovery, or interfered with market\nfunctioning. For instance, during episodes of financial turmoil, reduced liquidity can lead\nto outsized liquidity premiums as well as an amplification of adverse shocks on financial\nmarkets, leading prices for financial assets to fall more than they otherwise would. The\nresulting reductions in asset values could then have second-round effects, as highly\nleveraged holders of financial assets may be forced to liquidate, pushing asset prices\ndown further and threatening the stability of the financial system.3\nAlthough anecdotes of diminished liquidity abound, statistical evidence is harder\nto come by. Indeed, there is relatively little evidence of any deterioration in day-to-day\nliquidity. Traditional measures of liquidity, such as bid-asked spreads, are generally no\nhigher than they were pre-crisis. Turnover, an alternative measure of day-to-day\nliquidity, is lower, but it is unclear whether this reflects changes in liquidity or perhaps\nchanges in the composition of investors. The share of bonds owned by entities that tend\nto hold securities until maturity, such as mutual funds and insurance companies, has\nincreased in recent years, which would lead turnover to decline even with no change in\nmarket liquidity. In some markets, the number of large trades has declined in frequency,\nwhich could signal reduced market depth and liquidity, but could also reflect a shift in\nmarket participants’ preferences toward smaller trade sizes.\nFinding a high-fidelity gauge of liquidity resilience is difficult, but there are a few\nmeasures that could be indicative, such as the frequency of spikes in bid-asked spreads,\nthe one-month relative to the three-month swaption implied volatility, the volatility of\n3 Of course, if the sharp reductions in asset values are fleeting, these second-round effects could be quite\nlimited.\n\n- 3 -\nvolatility, and the size of the tails of price-change distributions for certain assets. We see\nsome increases in the values of these indicators, which provide some evidence that\nliquidity may be less resilient than it had been previously. But this evidence is not\nparticularly robust, and, given the limitations of the existing data, it is difficult to know\nthe extent to which liquidity resilience may have declined.\nAs we continue to investigate quantitative evidence of the deterioration in the\nresilience of liquidity in some of the financial markets, we are also trying to tease out the\nvarious drivers of liquidity conditions, such as changes in regulation, trading strategies,\nand market structure. Regulatory changes are often cited as a contributing factor.\nTrading financial assets is a balance-sheet-intensive activity, and the Dodd-Frank Act,\nhas created incentives for institutions to carefully assess the risks of such activity through\nstricter requirements on leverage, liquidity, and proprietary trading, raising the cost of\nmarket making and possibly affecting market liquidity. Indeed, there is evidence of\nreductions in broker-dealer bond inventories in recent years. Nonetheless, since not all\nbroker-dealer inventories are used for market-making activities, the extent to which lower\ninventories are affecting liquidity is unclear. Moreover, reductions in broker-dealer\ninventories occurred prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, suggesting that factors\nother than regulation may also be contributing. In assessing the role of regulation as a\npossible contributor to reduced liquidity, it is important to recognize that those\nregulations were put in place to reduce the concentration of liquidity risk on the balance\nsheets of the large, highly interconnected institutions that proved to be a major amplifier\nof financial instability at the height of the crisis.\n\n- 4 -\nA second possible contributor may be the growing role of electronic execution of\ntrades across equity, Treasury, and foreign exchange markets and the associated\nincreasing role of high-frequency trading. Competition from high-frequency trading in a\nparticular market may reduce the attractiveness of that market for traditional (manual)\ntraders or slower automated traders, leading to a progressive shift in the composition of\nmarket participants toward high-frequency traders (HFTs) over time. This shift could be\nimportant to the extent that HFTs may have more limited capacity to support liquidity\nresilience since, on average, HFTs appear to trade with smaller inventories and lower\ncapital than traditional traders. Although having less inventory and capital reduces the\ncost of trading, it also means that markets increasingly dominated by HFTs may be less\nable to absorb large shocks. Thus, liquidity may be sufficient and relatively cheap on\nnormal trading days, but it may not be deep enough to prevent large price swings when\ndemand for liquidity is significantly above the norm. This consideration would be most\nrelevant in the markets that are amenable to high-frequency trading, and automated\ntrading more generally, where assets are fairly standardized, such as equities and U.S.\nTreasury securities, and less relevant in markets where securities are more idiosyncratic,\nsuch as corporate bonds. It is also possible that markets that more readily lend\nthemselves to high-speed trading may be characterized by relatively greater concentration\nover time. Achieving the speed necessary for high-frequency trading requires large\ntechnology investments that necessarily may support a relatively more limited number of\nmarket participants. Greater concentration in turn might be associated with lower\nresilience at times of stress. The possible effect of HFTs on the resilience of market\nliquidity is an important topic for future research.\n\n- 5 -\nOf course, other developments may be affecting liquidity in financial markets.\nFor example, market participants have indicated that changes in participants’ risk-\nmanagement practices may be contributing to reduced market liquidity. In particular, the\nexperience of the financial crisis may have led many participants to reevaluate the risk of\ntheir market-making activities and either reduce their exposure to that risk, become more\nselective, or charge more for it, thereby reducing liquidity.4\nIt is also worth noting the increased role of asset managers on the buy side of the\nfixed income markets. During normal market conditions, the demand for liquidity from\nthis group of bond holders is likely relatively small, since asset managers acting on behalf\nof retail investors generally buy bonds to hold them for some period. Moreover,\nmanagers of open-end funds hold liquidity buffers that enable them to respond smoothly\nto normal redemption demands. However, because the large increase in bond fund\nholdings is relatively recent, little is known about how these funds will react to periods of\nmarket stress or to abrupt changes in financial conditions and the adequacy of their\nliquidity buffers for such situations. Because funds potentially allow daily redemptions\neven against illiquid assets, it is possible that redemptions could be magnified in stressed\nconditions as individuals try to redeem early, which in turn could lead to liquidations of\nrelatively less liquid assets, thereby amplifying price volatility and reducing market\nliquidity.\nIf in fact liquidity resilience has declined recently, it may be a transitional\ndevelopment that will be corrected going forward as participants adjust their risk\n4 Another potentially important change in markets has been the increased prevalence of dark pools or\nproprietary trading sites housed inside broker-dealers, which provide no information to the public about the\nvolume or prices of trades. It is possible this activity might be changing price discovery, although there is\ndebate over the net effect.\n\n- 6 -\nmanagement practices, and the structure of these markets continues to evolve. For\nexample, if traditional providers of liquidity scale back their activity in response to\nchanges in regulation and market structure, over time, this shift may create incentives for\nother providers, which are not similarly constrained, to step in.\nStress tests, such as those announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) offer one way to help ensure that market participants are prepared for sharper\nspikes in market volatility. For instance, in the Federal Reserve Board’s most recent\nstress test, the severely adverse scenario featured a large decrease in the prices of\ncorporate bonds.\nWe are in the early stages of data-based analysis of possible recent changes in the\nresilience of market liquidity. An upcoming study of the October 15 event will shine\nsome light on the functioning of the U.S. Treasury market, but there is still much we need\nto learn. More broadly, at the Board, we will closely monitor and investigate the extent\nof changes in the resilience of liquidity in important markets, while deepening our\nunderstanding of different contributors and how market participants are adapting.",

In light of the potential importance of AI, we\nare seeking to learn from industry, banks, consumer advocates, researchers, and others, including\nthrough today’s conference. I am pleased to take part in this timely discussion of how\ntechnology is changing the financial landscape.1\nThe Growing Use of Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services\nMy focus today is the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, which\nis the basis of many recent advances and commercial applications.2 Modern machine learning\napplies and refines, or “trains,” a series of algorithms on a large data set by optimizing iteratively\nas it learns in order to identify patterns and make predictions for new data.3 Machine learning\nessentially imposes much less structure on how data is interpreted compared to conventional\napproaches in which programmers impose ex ante rule sets to make decisions.\n1 I am grateful to Kelvin Chen and Carol Evans for their assistance in preparing this text.

Due to an early commitment to open-source principles, AI algorithms\nfrom some of the largest companies are available to even nascent startups.4 As for processing\npower, continuing innovation by public cloud providers means that with only a laptop and a\ncredit card, it is possible to tap into some of the world’s most powerful computing systems by\npaying only for usage time, without having to build out substantial hardware infrastructure.\nVendors have made it easy to use these tools for even small businesses and non-technology\nfirms, including in the financial sector. Public cloud companies provide access to pre-trained AI\nmodels via developer-friendly application programming interfaces or even “drop and drag” tools\nfor creating sophisticated AI models.5 Most notably, the world is creating data to feed those\nmodels at an ever-increasing rate. Whereas in 2013 it was estimated that 90 percent of the\nworld’s data had been created in the prior two years, by 2016, IBM estimated that 90 percent of\nglobal data had been created in the prior year alone.6\nThe pace and ubiquity of AI innovation have surprised even experts. The best AI result\non a popular image recognition challenge improved from a 26 percent error rate to 3.5 percent in\njust four years. That is lower than the human error rate of 5 percent.7 In one study, a\ncombination AI-human approach brought the error rate down even further--to 0.5 percent.\n4 See, e.g., Lael Brainard, “Where Do Consumers Fit in the Fintech Stack?” (speech at the FinTech Risks and\nOpportunities Conference, Ann Arbor, MI, November 16, 2017),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20171116a.pdf.\n5 See, e.g., Brandon Vigliarolo, “Amazon AI: The Smart Person’s Guide,” TechRepublic, August 21, 2017,\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/amazon-ai-the-smart-persons-guide/; and Fei-Fei Li and Jia Li, “Cloud\nAutoML: Making AI Accessible to Every Business,” The Keyword (Google blog), January 17, 2018,\nhttps://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/cloud-automl-making-ai-accessible-every-business/.\n6 SINTEF, “Big Data, for Better or Worse: 90% of World’s Data Generated over Last Two Years,”\nScienceDaily.com, May 22, 2013, https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm; and IBM,\n“10 Key Marketing Trends for 2017” (2017) (on file with author).\n7 Executive Office of the President, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n-3-\nSo it is no surprise that many financial services firms are devoting so much money,\nattention, and time to developing and using AI approaches. Broadly, there is particular interest\nin at least five capabilities.8 First, firms view AI approaches as potentially having superior\nability for pattern recognition, such as identifying relationships among variables that are not\nintuitive or not revealed by more traditional modeling. Second, firms see potential cost\nefficiencies where AI approaches may be able to arrive at outcomes more cheaply with no\nreduction in performance. Third, AI approaches might have greater accuracy in processing\nbecause of their greater automation compared to approaches that have more human input and\nhigher “operator error.” Fourth, firms may see better predictive power with AI compared to\nmore traditional approaches--for instance, in improving investment performance or expanding\ncredit access. Finally, AI approaches are better than conventional approaches at accommodating\nvery large and less-structured data sets and processing those data more efficiently and\neffectively. Some machine learning approaches can be “let loose” on data sets to identify\npatterns or develop predictions without the need to specify a functional form ex ante.\nWhat do those capabilities mean in terms of how we bank? The Financial Stability Board\nhighlighted four areas where AI could impact banking.9 First, customer-facing uses could\ncombine expanded consumer data sets with new algorithms to assess credit quality or price\ninsurance policies. And chatbots could provide help and even financial advice to consumers,\n8 AI tools are also likely to be useful for central banks and regulators in their responsibilities for supervision,\nfinancial stability, and monetary policy, although this is not addressed here. The 2017 Financial Stability Board\nreport highlighted the potential use of AI tools by central banks and prudential authorities for applications ranging\nfrom systemic risk identification to detecting fraud and money laundering (Financial Stability Board, Artificial\nIntelligence and Machine Learning).\n9 See Financial Stability Board, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. See also, e.g., U.S. Department of the\nTreasury, A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities (Washington: U.S. Department of the Treasury,\nJune 3, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/A-Financial-System-that-Creates-Economic-\nOpportunities---Nonbank-Financi....pdf; Brainard, “Where Do Consumers Fit in the Fintech Stack?”; and American\nBankers Association, “Understanding Artificial Intelligence.”\n\n-4-\nsaving them the waiting time to speak with a live operator. Second, there is the potential for\nstrengthening back-office operations, such as advanced models for capital optimization, model\nrisk management, stress testing, and market impact analysis. Third, AI approaches could be\napplied to trading and investment strategies, from identifying new signals on price movements to\nusing past trading behavior to anticipate a client’s next order. Finally, there are likely to be AI\nadvancements in compliance and risk mitigation by banks. AI solutions are already being used\nby some firms in areas like fraud detection, capital optimization, and portfolio management.\nCurrent Regulatory and Supervisory Approaches\nThe potential breadth and power of these new AI applications inevitably raise questions\nabout potential risks to bank safety and soundness, consumer protection, or the financial\nsystem.10 The question, then, is how should we approach regulation and supervision? It is\nincumbent on regulators to review the potential consequences of AI, including the possible risks,\nand take a balanced view about its use by supervised firms.\nRegulation and supervision need to be thoughtfully designed so that they ensure risks are\nappropriately mitigated but do not stand in the way of responsible innovations that might expand\naccess and convenience for consumers and small businesses or bring greater efficiency, risk\ndetection, and accuracy. Likewise, it is important not to drive responsible innovation away from\n10 See, e.g., Financial Stability Board, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and National Consumers Law\nCenter (on behalf of its low-income clients), California Reinvestment Coalition Consumer Action, Consumers\nUnion, National Association of Consumer Advocates, U.S. PIRG, Woodstock Institute, World Privacy Forum,\n“Comments in Response to Request for Information Regarding Use of Alternative Data and Modeling Techniques in\nthe Credit Process,” Docket No. CFPB-2017-0005 (May 19, 2017); U.S. Department of the Treasury, A Financial\nSystem That Creates Economic Opportunities; and Carol A. Evans, “Keeping Fintech Fair: Thinking about Fair\nLending and UDAP Risks,” Consumer Compliance Outlook (Second Issue 2017),\nhttps://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/2017/second-issue/keeping-fintech-fair-thinking-about-fair-lending-\nand-udap-risks/.\n\n-5-\nsupervised institutions and toward less regulated and more opaque spaces in the financial\nsystem.11\nOur existing regulatory and supervisory guardrails are a good place to start as we assess\nthe appropriate approach for AI processes. The National Science and Technology Council, in an\nextensive study addressing regulatory activity generally, concludes that if an AI-related risk\n“falls within the bounds of an existing regulatory regime, . . . the policy discussion should start\nby considering whether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether\nthey need to be adapted to the addition of AI.”12 A recent report by the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury reaches a similar conclusion with regard to financial services.13\nWith respect to banking services, a few generally applicable laws, regulations, guidance,\nand supervisory approaches appear particularly relevant to the use of AI tools. First, the Federal\nReserve’s “Guidance on Model Risk Management” (SR Letter 11-7) highlights the importance to\nsafety and soundness of embedding critical analysis throughout the development,\nimplementation, and use of models, which include complex algorithms like AI.14 It also\nunderscores “effective challenge” of models by a “second set of eyes”--unbiased, qualified\nindividuals separated from the model’s development, implementation, and use. It describes\nsupervisory expectations for sound independent review of a firm’s own models to confirm they\nare fit for purpose and functioning as intended. If the reviewers are unable to evaluate a model\nin full or if they identify issues, they might recommend the model be used with greater caution or\n11 Lael Brainard, “Where Do Banks Fit in the Fintech Stack?” (speech at the Northwestern Kellogg Public-Private\nInterface Conference, April 28, 2017), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170428a.htm.\n12 Executive Office of the President, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence.\n13 U.S. Department of the Treasury, A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities.\n14 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidance on Model Risk Management,” Supervision and\nRegulation Letter SR Letter 11-7 (April 4, 2011),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm. See also Andrew Burt, “Leave A.I. Alone,”\nNew York Times, January 4, 2018, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/opinion/leave-artificial-intelligence.html.\n\n-6-\nwith compensating controls. Similarly, when our own examiners evaluate model risk, they\ngenerally begin with an evaluation of the processes firms have for developing and reviewing\nmodels, as well as the response to any shortcomings in a model or the ability to review it.\nImportantly, the guidance recognizes that not all aspects of a model may be fully transparent, as\nwith proprietary vendor models, for instance. Banks can use such models, but the guidance\nhighlights the importance of using other tools to cabin or otherwise mitigate the risk of an\nunexplained or opaque model. Risks may be offset by mitigating external controls like “circuit-\nbreakers” or other mechanisms. And importantly, models should always be interpreted in\ncontext.\nSecond, our guidance on vendor risk management (SR 13-19/CA 13-21), along with the\nprudential regulators’ guidance on technology service providers, highlights considerations firms\nshould weigh when outsourcing business functions or activities--and could be expected to apply\nas well to AI-based tools or services that are externally sourced.15 The vast majority of the banks\nthat we supervise will have to rely on the expertise, data, and off-the-shelf AI tools of nonbank\nvendors to take advantage of AI-powered processes. Whether these tools are chatbots, anti-\nmoney-laundering/know your customer compliance products, or new credit evaluation tools, it\nseems likely that they would be classified as services to the bank. The vendor risk-management\nguidance discusses best practices for supervised firms regarding due diligence, selection, and\ncontracting processes in selecting an outside vendor. It also describes ways that firms can\nprovide oversight and monitoring throughout the relationship with the vendor, and considerations\n15 See, e.g., FFIEC Outsourcing Technology Services Booklet (June 2004), http://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-\nbooklets/outsourcing-technology-services.aspx; and Board of Governors, “Guidance on Managing Outsourcing\nRisk,” Supervision and Regulation Letter SR 13-19/Consumer Affairs Letter CA 13-21 (December 5, 2013),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1319.htm.\n\n-7-\nabout business continuity and contingencies for a firm to consider before the termination of any\nsuch relationship.\nThird, it is important to emphasize that guidance has to be read in the context of the\nrelative risk and importance of the specific use-case in question. We have long taken a risk-\nfocused supervisory approach--the level of scrutiny should be commensurate with the potential\nrisk posed by the approach, tool, model, or process used.16 That principle also applies generally\nto the attention that supervised firms devote to the different approaches they use: firms should\napply more care and caution to a tool they use for major decisions or that could have a material\nimpact on consumers, compliance, or safety and soundness.\nFor its part, AI is likely to present some challenges in the areas of opacity and\nexplainability. Recognizing there are likely to be circumstances when using an AI tool is\nbeneficial, even though it may be unexplainable or opaque, the AI tool should be subject to\nappropriate controls, as with any other tool or process, including how the AI tool is used in\npractice and not just how it is built. This is especially true for any new application that has not\nbeen fully tested in a variety of conditions. Given the large data sets involved with most AI\napproaches, it is vital to have controls around the various aspects of data--including data quality\nas well as data suitability. Just as with conventional models, problems with the input data can\nlead to cascading problems down the line. Accordingly, we would expect firms to apply robust\nanalysis and prudent risk management and controls to AI tools, as they do in other areas, as well\nas to monitor potential changes and ongoing developments.\n16 Board of Governors, “Risk-Focused Safety and Soundness Examinations and Inspections,” Supervision and\nRegulation Letter SR 96-14 (May 24, 1996), https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/1996/SR9614.htm.\n\n-8-\nFor example, let’s take the areas of fraud prevention and cybersecurity, where\nsupervised institutions may need their own AI tools to identify and combat outside AI-powered\nthreats. The wide availability of AI’s building blocks means that phishers and fraudsters have\naccess to best-in-class technologies to build AI tools that are powerful and adaptable.\nSupervised institutions will likely need tools that are just as powerful and adaptable as the threats\nthat they are designed to face, which likely entails some degree of opacity. While so far, most\nphishing attacks against consumers have relied on standard-form emails, likely due to the high\ncost of personalization, in the future, AI tools could be used to make internet fraud and phishing\nhighly personalized.17 By accessing data sets with consumers’ personally identifiable\ninformation and applying open-source AI tools, a phisher may be able to churn out highly\ntargeted emails to millions of consumers at relatively low cost, containing personalized\ninformation such as their bank account number and logo, along with past transactions.18 In cases\nsuch as this, where large data sets and AI tools may be used for malevolent purposes, it may be\nthat AI is the best tool to fight AI.\nLet’s turn to the related issue of the proverbial “black box”--the potential lack of\nexplainability associated with some AI approaches. In the banking sector, it is not uncommon\nfor there to be questions as to what level of understanding a bank should have of its vendors’\nmodels, due to the balancing of risk management, on the one hand, and protection of proprietary\n17 See, e.g., Eric Lipton, David E. Sanger, and Scott Shane, “The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower\nInvaded the U.S.,” New York Times, December 13, 2016, https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-\nhack-election-dnc.html; and Cormac Herley, “Why Do Nigerian Scammers Say They Are from Nigeria?” Microsoft\nResearch, June 1, 2012, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/02/WhyFromNigeria.pdf. (“A less outlandish wording that did not mention Nigeria would\nalmost certainly gather more total responses and more viable responses, but would yield lower overall profit. Recall,\nthat viability requires that the scammer actually extract money from the victim: those who are fooled for a while, but\nthen figure it out, or who balk at the last hurdle are precisely the expensive false positives that the scammer must\ndeter.”)\n18 Brian Krebs, “The Year Targeted Phishing Went Mainstream,” Krebs on Security, (August 18, 2018),\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/08/the-year-targeted-phishing-went-mainstream/.\n\n-9-\ninformation, on the other. To some degree, the opacity of AI products can be seen as an\nextension of this balancing. But AI can introduce additional complexity because many AI tools\nand models develop analysis, arrive at conclusions, or recommend decisions that may be hard to\nexplain. For instance, some AI approaches are able to identify patterns that were previously\nunidentified and are intuitively quite hard to grasp. Depending on what algorithms are used, it is\npossible that no one, including the algorithm’s creators, can easily explain why the model\ngenerated the results that it did.\nThe challenge of explainability can translate into a higher level of uncertainty about the\nsuitability of an AI approach, all else equal. So how does, or even can, a firm assess the use of\nan approach it might not fully understand? To a large degree, this will depend on the capacity in\nwhich AI is used and the risks presented. One area where the risks may be particularly acute is\nthe consumer space generally, and consumer lending in particular, where transparency is integral\nto avoiding discrimination and other unfair outcomes, as well as meeting disclosure\nobligations.19 Let me turn briefly to this topic.\nThe potential for the application of AI tools to result in new benefits to consumers is\ngarnering a lot of attention. The opportunity to access services through innovative channels or\nprocesses can be a potent way to advance financial inclusion.20 Consider, for instance, consumer\ncredit scoring. There are longstanding and well-documented concerns that many consumers are\n19 In a 2017 request for public comment, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection noted that alternative\nmodeling techniques may offer consumer benefits, such as greater credit access, enhanced creditworthiness\npredictions, lower costs, and better service and convenience, but also highlighted consumer risks, such as privacy\nconcerns, data quality issues, loss of the ability to correct errors, and discrimination. See Bureau of Consumer\nFinancial Protection, “Request for Information Regarding Use of Alternative Data and Modeling Techniques in the\nCredit Process,” (Washington: Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, February 14, 2017),\nhttps://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/20170214_cfpb_Alt-Data-RFI.pdf\n20 See, e.g., Lael Brainard, “FinTech and the Search for Full Stack Financial Inclusion,” (speech at the Conference\non FinTech, Financial Inclusion, and the Potential to Transform Financial Services at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston, Boston, October 17, 2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20181017a.htm.\n\n-10-\nburdened by material errors on their credit reports, lack sufficient credit reporting information\nnecessary for a score, or have credit reports that are unscorable.21 As noted earlier, banks and\nother financial service providers are using AI to develop credit-scoring models that take into\naccount factors beyond the usual metrics. There is substantial interest in the potential for those\nnew models to allow more consumers on the margins of the current credit system to improve\ntheir credit standing, at potentially lower cost. As noted earlier, AI also has the potential to allow\ncreditors to more accurately model and price risk, and to bring greater speed to decisions.\nAI may offer new consumer benefits, but it is not immune from fair lending and other\nconsumer protection risks, and compliance with fair lending and other consumer protection laws\nis important.22 Of course, it should not be assumed that AI approaches are free of bias simply\nbecause they are automated and rely less on direct human intervention. Algorithms and models\nreflect the goals and perspectives of those who develop them as well as the data that trains them\nand, as a result, AI tools can reflect or “learn” the biases of the society in which they were\ncreated. A 2016 Treasury Department report noted that while “data-driven algorithms may\nexpedite credit assessments and reduce costs, they also carry the risk of disparate impact in credit\noutcomes and the potential for fair lending violations.”23\n21 Federal Trade Commission, “In FTC Study, Five Percent of Consumers Had Errors on Their Credit Reports That\nCould Result in Less Favorable Terms for Loans,” news release, (February 11, 2013), https://www.ftc.gov/news-\nevents/press-releases/2013/02/ftc-study-five-percent-consumers-had-errors-their-credit-reports; Federal Trade\nCommission, “FTC Issues Follow-Up Study on Credit Report Accuracy,” news release, (January 21, 2015),\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/01/ftc-issues-follow-study-credit-report-accuracy; and Bureau\nof Consumer Financial Protection, Data Point: Credit Invisibles (Washington: Bureau of Consumer Financial\nProtection, May 2015), https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201505_cfpb_data-point-credit-invisibles.pdf.\n22 The primary federal statutes governing fair lending are the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair\nHousing Act (FHA). See, also Lael Brainard, “Where Do Consumers Fit in the Fintech Stack?” (speech at the\nFinTech Risks and Opportunities Conference, Ann Arbor, MI, November 16, 2017),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20171116a.pdf.\n23 U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Opportunities and Challenges in Online Marketplace Lending” (Washington:\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, May 2016), https://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Documents/Opportunities_\nand_Challenges_in_Online_Marketplace_Lending_white_paper.pdf.\n\n-11-\nA recent example illustrates the risk of unwittingly introducing bias into an AI model. It\nwas recently reported that a large employer attempted to develop an AI hiring tool for software\ndevelopers that was trained with a data set of the resumes of past successful hires, which it later\nabandoned. Because the pool of previously hired software developers in the training data set was\noverwhelmingly male, the AI developed a bias against female applicants, going so far as to\nexclude resumes of graduates from two women’s colleges.24\nImportantly, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act\n(FCRA) include requirements for creditors to provide notice of the factors involved in taking\nactions that are adverse or unfavorable for the consumer.25 These requirements help provide\ntransparency in the underwriting process, promote fair lending by requiring creditors to explain\nwhy they reached their decisions, and provide consumers with actionable information to improve\ntheir credit standing. Compliance with these requirements implies finding a way to explain AI\ndecisions. However, the opacity of some AI tools may make it challenging to explain credit\ndecisions to consumers, which would make it harder for consumers to improve their credit score\nby changing their behavior. Fortunately, AI itself may play a role in the solution: The AI\ncommunity is responding with important advances in developing “explainable” AI tools with a\nfocus on expanding consumer access to credit.26 I am pleased that this is one of the topics on\nyour agenda today.\n24 Jeffrey Dastin, “Amazon Scraps Secret AI Recruiting Tool That Showed Bias against Women,” Reuters, October\n9, 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-\nrecruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G.\n25 See generally ECOA section 701, 15 USC 1691; 12 CFR § 1002.9; FCRA section 615, 15 USC 1681m; and 12\nCFR §§ 1022.70-75.\n26 See, e.g., Nanette Byrnes, “An AI-Fueled Credit Formula Might Help You Get a Loan,” MIT Technology Review\n(February 14, 2017), https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603604/an-ai-fueled-credit-formula-might-help-you-get-\na-loan/.\n\n-12-\nLooking Ahead\nPerhaps one of the most important early lessons is that not all potential consequences are\nknowable now--firms should be continually vigilant for new issues in the rapidly evolving area\nof AI. Throughout the history of banking, new products and processes have been an area where\nproblems can arise. Further, firms should not assume that AI approaches are less susceptible to\nproblems because they are purported to be able to “learn” or less prone to human error. There\nare plenty of examples of AI approaches not functioning as expected--a reminder that things can\ngo wrong. It is important for firms to recognize the possible pitfalls and employ sound controls\nnow to prevent and mitigate possible future problems.\nFor our part, we are still learning how AI tools can be used in the banking sector. We\nwelcome discussion about what use cases banks and other financial services firms are exploring\nwith AI approaches and other innovations, and how our existing laws, regulations, guidance, and\npolicy interests may intersect with these new approaches. 27 When considering financial\ninnovation of any type, our task is to facilitate an environment in which socially beneficial,\nresponsible innovation can progress with appropriate mitigation of risk and consistent with\napplicable statutes and regulations.\nAs with other technological advances, AI presents regulators with a responsibility to act\nwith thoughtfulness and perspective in carrying out their mandates, learning from the experience\nin other areas. As we move ahead in exploring the policy and regulatory issues related to\nartificial intelligence, we look forward to collaborating with a broad array of stakeholders.\n27 See, e.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities; Brainard,\n“Where Do Banks Fit in the Fintech Stack?”; and Lael Brainard, “The Opportunities and Challenges of Fintech”\n(speech at the Conference on Financial Innovation at the Board of Governors, Washington, December 2, 2016),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20161202a.htm.",

The confidence that\npayments will be timely and dependable is a cornerstone of America’s dynamic and resilient\neconomy.1\nToday, Americans take the reliability and safety of their payments for granted. But that\nwas not always the case. The nation’s first 150 years were frequently disrupted by panics in the\nfinancial system that extended into the payment system, which was highly fragmented and\ninefficient. Before the Federal Reserve took on a role in the payment system, a check recipient\ncould not count on receiving the full value written on the check and faced long and unpredictable\ndelays in getting access to the funds. As a result of banks’ efforts to avoid excessive clearance\nfees, it could take days, weeks, or more to clear checks. The Federal Reserve’s second\nChairman, William P.G. Harding, described the circuitous, opaque, and costly route one payment\nmade: “…a bank in Rochester, N.Y., sent a check drawn on a Birmingham, Ala., account to a\ncorrespondent bank in New York, which sent it along to a bank in Jacksonville, Fla. From there,\nit traveled to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cincinnati before it finally reached the originating\nbank in Birmingham.”2 The fragmentation of the payment system imposed costs on American\nmerchants, households, community banks, and, ultimately, on the overall U.S. economy.\nEnsuring a reliable nationwide payment infrastructure was one of the motivations that led\nthe Congress to create the Federal Reserve after the severe financial panic of 1907. Fostering a\n1 I am grateful to Susan Foley, John Maggs, Mark Manuszak, and Anjana Ravi of the Federal Reserve Board for\ntheir assistance in preparing this text. These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent\nthose of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Noted by Federal Reserve Chairman W.P.G. Harding in Robert Kramer and W. Putnam Livingston, “Cashing in on\nthe Checkless Society,” Harvard Business Review, September/October 1967, p. 143; Bill Medley, Highways of\nCommerce: Central Banking and the U.S. Payments System (Kansas City: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,\n2017), p. 23, www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/highwasyofcommer/highwaysofcommerce.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 2 -\nsafe, efficient, and widely accessible payment infrastructure has been a crucial aspect of the\nFed’s mission from its founding in 1913. By creating a new core infrastructure for clearing and\nsettling checks, the Fed was able to boost confidence in banks and America’s payment system,\nensure Americans received the full value of their checks, and speed up payments.\nThat was the first, but not the last, time that the Fed played a central role in transforming\nAmerica’s retail payment system. By the 1970s, the payment system was staggering under the\nweight of paper checks. In 1973, Governor Jeffrey Bucher of the Federal Reserve Board\ndescribed the exponential growth in check volume and the time-consuming and expensive\nprocess to clear paper checks as a “time bomb.”3 The Federal Reserve and payment system\nstakeholders faced a choice: continue making incremental changes to manage the growing\navalanche of checks, or look to technology to facilitate transformational change.\nWorking with the private sector, the Federal Reserve chose transformation, and the effect\nwas dramatic. In partnership with the private sector, the Federal Reserve supported the\nimplementation of the automated clearinghouse, or ACH system, to process payroll payments for\nindividuals, bill payments for households, and vendor payments for businesses. Before the\nadvent of the ACH, it would typically take a week for an employee to be able to access the funds\nfrom a paycheck. It would require first a trip to the bank during business hours to deposit the\npaycheck and then several business days for that bank to complete the time-consuming process\nof collecting the funds from the employer’s bank.4 With the advent of ACH, an employee could\nexpect to access their pay from their bank on the same day it was deposited electronically by\n3 Jeffrey Bucher, “The Check,” (remarks at the Annual Meeting, Bank Stationers Association, Colorado Springs,\nCO, June 4, 1973), https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/931/item/36180.\n4 Andre Pollack, “The New Look to Bankers’ Hours,” New York Times, April 8, 1989,\nwww.nytimes.com/1989/04/08/business/the-new-look-to-bankers-hours.html.\n\n- 3 -\ntheir employer. Today, the ACH operates with important roles for the private sector and the Fed,\nis available nationwide, and constitutes a vital piece of infrastructure supporting earlier access to\nfunds and reliable settlement of payments.5\nMoving to 24/7 Real-Time Settlement\nToday, our payment system is again at a crossroads. There is a growing gap between the\ntransaction capabilities we need and expect in the digital economy--fast, convenient, and\naccessible to all--and the underlying settlement capabilities.\nConsumers and businesses increasingly expect to complete transactions with a simple\nkeystroke, swipe, or tap. If I want to split a restaurant tab with my friends, I can use an app on\nmy smartphone. But my friends have to be signed up for the same app to receive the payment,\nand they may have to wait for confirmation that the funds have moved from the app into their\nbank accounts before they can use the funds outside the app. Similarly, if I want to make a\npurchase from a vendor online, all I have to do is upload my payment information and touch a\nscreen to complete the purchase immediately. But that payment in turn may not be immediately\navailable to the seller.\nWhile we are seeing a growing demand for payments to be as instantaneous as the apps\non our smartphones, in reality, under the hood, these payments currently rely on a patchwork of\nsystems that can result in inefficiencies and delays, as well as uneven access. To meet the\nexpectations of our 24/7 app economy, there is a growing demand for broadly and nationally\naccessible faster payments that make funds available immediately. Faster payments would allow\n5 According to the Federal Reserve Payments Study 2016, in 2015, the ACH system was used for 23.5 billion\npayments, totaling $145.3 trillion in value. See www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/files/2016-payments-\nstudy-20161222.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nconsumers and businesses to send and immediately receive payments at any time of the day, any\nday of the year, and provide recipients the ability to use their funds anywhere they choose.6\nNascent faster payment services are emerging to address this demand from individuals\nand businesses for the capability to manage their finances more efficiently in real time. These\nfaster payment innovations are striving to keep up with this demand, but gaps in the underlying\ninfrastructure pose challenges associated with safety, efficiency, and accessibility. In many\ncircumstances, the underlying infrastructure in place today cannot ensure that a fast payment is\nfully complete before the recipient seeks to use the funds. To complete a payment, the banks\nbehind the transaction need to transfer funds between each other. Until this happens, the\npayment between them is like an “IOU.”\nToday’s systems that transfer funds between banks are not set up to work in a 24/7, real-\ntime world. Instead, most faster payments settle funds between banks on a deferred basis.\nDeferred settlement entails a buildup of obligations--like IOUs between banks--that could\npresent real risks to the financial system in times of stress. Although faster payment systems that\nrely on deferred settlements can incorporate certain measures to mitigate these risks, these\nmeasures may be appropriate for a nascent faster payment market only for a limited time. As we\nsaw with the avalanche of paper checks prior to ACH, as the volume and value of faster\npayments grow over time, the potential risks of deferred settlement to the financial system are\nalso likely to grow.\nTo fully deliver on the promise of faster payments into the future, we need an\ninfrastructure that can support continued growth and innovation, with a goal of settlement on a\n6 The Faster Payments Task Force viewed 24x7x365 service availability and final funds provided to the recipient\nwithin one minute as characteristics of a “very effective” faster payment service.

To ensure the robustness of the payment system into the future, banks\nand other providers acting as their agents should have access to a settlement system that operates\n24/7 and settles each payment as soon as an individual sends it.\nWhile everyone stands to benefit from faster payments, the benefits could be especially\nimportant for households and small business owners who face cash flow constraints. We know\nfrom the Fed’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking that four in 10 adults say\nthey would need to cover an unexpected expense of $400 by borrowing or selling something, or\nsimply be unable to pay. A forthcoming Fed research note estimates that a quarter of households\nhave less than $400 combined in their bank accounts.7 For these households, the difference\nbetween waiting for a payment to clear and receiving a payment in real time is not merely an\ninconvenience; it could tip the balance toward overdraft fees, bounced checks, or collections\nfees. To be clear, faster payments would not address the root causes of these households’\nfinancial fragility. Even so, faster payments could help reduce the strain on some.\nSimilarly, many small businesses cite immediate access to working capital to finance\ninventories or pay employees as their number one constraint on growth.8 Smaller businesses and\nmerchants would benefit from faster payments because of their need to tightly manage how\nmuch of their capital is tied up in unused material or inventory. If a small business could count\non its customers’ payments being immediately accessible in its bank account, it could reduce its\nneed for short-term financing to cover the costs of ordering materials and goods well in advance.\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in\n2017 (Washington: Board of Governors, May 2018), www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm;\nNeil Bhutta and Lisa Dettling, “Money in the Bank? Assessing Families’ Liquid Savings Using the Survey of\nConsumer Finances,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, forthcoming).\n8 For example, in 2015, 22 percent of small businesses reported cash flow (for example, meeting payroll or paying\nfor inventory) as their top business challenge. See 2015 Small Business Credit Survey: Report on Employer Firms,\nMarch 2016, www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2015/Report-SBCS-2015.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nThe Role of the Federal Reserve in Faster Payments\nSo what is our role at this moment of opportunity for the payment system? In keeping\nwith the Fed’s historical role in payments, five years ago we launched a collaborative effort with\na broad array of stakeholders to catalyze a safe, efficient, and accessible faster payment system\nfor the United States. As part of that effort, 300 organizations representing consumers,\nbusinesses, banks, card companies, and technology providers, including many represented here\ntoday, came together to define expectations for the future of the retail payment system and to\nmake recommendations on how to implement those expectations. The members of the task force\ntold us that the Federal Reserve needed to develop a 24/7 settlement system.9 The U.S. Treasury\nechoed this theme in a recent report.10\nOver the past year, we have undertaken an assessment of what the Federal Reserve could\ndo to modernize its infrastructure to support interbank settlement of faster payments. That\nassessment found that 24/7 payment-by-payment interbank settlement in real-time--what we\nrefer to as real-time gross settlement (RTGS)--offers clear benefits in minimizing risk and\nmaximizing efficiency. A 24/7 economy with 24/7 real-time payments needs 24/7 real-time\nsettlement, and RTGS is the way to achieve this. That is where we believe that the Federal\nReserve and the private sector together need to make investments for the future. In this regard,\nthe U.S. retail payment system lags behind some other countries: the Reserve Bank of Australia\nand the European Central Bank have already implemented or are on the cusp of implementing\nRTGS systems to support private-sector faster payment services.\n9 Faster Payments Task Force, Final Report Part Two: A Call to Action, July 2017,\nhttps://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/.\n10 U.S. Department of the Treasury, A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities: Nonbank Financials,\nFintech, and Innovation (Washington: Department of the Treasury, July 2018),\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/A-Financial-System-that-Creates-Economic-Opportunities---\nNonbank-Financi....pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nThe Federal Reserve and payment system stakeholders have an opportunity to upgrade\nAmerica’s payment system to meet the needs of households, businesses, and banks in the app\neconomy. Today, we are publishing a Federal Register notice that seeks public comment on\npotential steps the Federal Reserve could take to support the vision of RTGS of faster payments.\nThe Reserve Banks could develop a service for RTGS that is available on a 24/7 basis to provide\npayment-by-payment interbank settlement in real time and at any time, on any day, including\nweekends and holidays. The Reserve Banks currently provide payment services to more than\n11,000 banks across the country. A 24/7 RTGS service provided by the Reserve Banks could\nsignificantly improve the prospect that banks of all sizes will have equitable access to a real-time\ninterbank settlement infrastructure for faster payments in the long term.\nThis common infrastructure would support connections across banks, and faster payment\nservice providers acting as their agents, with the potential to weave together the current\npatchwork of systems. As a result, we would also expect the overall safety of faster payments to\nincrease. The capability to finalize interbank settlement before funds are made available to the\nrecipient would avoid an undesirable buildup of risk in the system. The more banks that have\naccess to real-time as opposed to deferred settlement mechanisms, the lower the risk would be\nfrom deferring settlement to the payment system as a whole. Although RTGS may be\noperationally demanding, it offers clear benefits from a risk and efficiency perspective over the\nlong term.\nThe development of a nationwide real-time interbank settlement infrastructure could also\nsupport the development of private-sector faster payment services, thereby increasing innovation\nand choice in the market. Banks and technology providers of all sizes may be able to develop\nnew services or enhance existing services by capitalizing on the underlying interbank settlement\n\n- 8 -\ninfrastructure. This could ultimately benefit all consumers by lowering costs, increasing choice,\nand improving quality.\nIn that regard, we are also seeking comment on whether the Reserve Banks should\nconsider developing a liquidity management tool that would operate 24/7 in support of services\nfor real-time interbank settlement of faster payments. The tool could support settlement services\nprovided by the private sector or the Reserve Banks.\nThe Federal Reserve has a responsibility to promote a payment system that serves the\nevolving needs of the public. We hope to solicit as wide a range of views as possible as we\nconsider these and possibly other options to support prompt, secure, and resilient settlement in a\n24/7 world. To that end, the Federal Register notice poses a series of questions related to\nwhether an RTGS is the appropriate strategic foundation for interbank settlement of faster\npayments. We also solicit views on the appropriate role for the Federal Reserve in such a\nsystem. We look forward to hearing from, and learning from, a broad array of stakeholders,\nincluding those who are actively involved in the provision of payment and banking services, as\nwell as representatives of the consumers, households, and businesses who rely on the ability to\nmake and receive payments every day.\nThe future of payments will be determined by the actions we take today. We can wait\nand watch how these issues evolve on their own. But this will likely result in a fragmented\npatchwork of systems that entails inefficiencies and risks and could leave behind many\nhouseholds, small businesses, and smaller banks. Alternatively, we can work with other\nstakeholders to embrace innovation and design a faster payments infrastructure for the future to\npromote broad access and resilience.\n\n- 9 -\nAs technological change continues to drive payments innovation, we continue to focus on\nthe same basic objective that motivated our initial engagement in the payment system a century\nago: promoting a safe, efficient, and accessible payment system that serves the interests of all\nAmericans. The Fed has the unique ability to provide the infrastructure to reliably settle\nobligations between banks using balances at the central bank. As such, we have a responsibility\nto serve the broad public interest by providing a flexible and robust payment infrastructure on\nwhich the private sector can innovate. We look forward to hearing from you on the important\nchoices before us as we work to safeguard the integrity and efficiency of our payment system.",

I am pleased to be here at the Urban Institute to discuss how to\nstrengthen the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which is a key priority for the Federal\nReserve. The CRA plays a vital role in bringing banks together with community members, small\nbusinesses, local officials, and community groups to make investments in their community’s\nfuture.1 That is why we are committed to getting CRA reform done right.\nThe Origins and Purpose of the CRA\nAny successful reform must be grounded in the origins of the CRA and its ongoing\nimportance to low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. The CRA was one of several\nlandmark pieces of legislation enacted in the wake of the civil rights movement intended to\naddress inequities in the credit markets. By passing the CRA, Congress aimed to reverse the\ndisinvestment associated with years of government policies and market actions that deprived\nlower-income areas of credit by redlining—using red-inked lines to separate neighborhoods\ndeemed too risky.2 By conferring an affirmative and continuing obligation on banks to help\nmeet the credit needs in all of the neighborhoods they serve, the CRA has not only prompted\nbanks to be more active lenders in LMI areas, but also important participants in multisector\nefforts to revitalize communities across the country.\n1 I want to express my appreciation to Carrie Johnson and Theresa Stark for assistance in preparing this text and to\nTheresa Stark for her dedication to strengthening the CRA throughout her service at the Federal Reserve Board. The\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board.\n2 See Richard Rothstein, The Color of Law: The Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America\n(New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2017). See “Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America” (2016),\nhttps://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58, for a compilation of the maps and notes created by\nthe federal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in the 1930s that designated areas considered too risky for mortgage\nlending and were used to determine eligibility for Federal Housing Administration guarantees.\n\n-2 -\nPursuant to guidance from the Board of Governors, each of our Federal Reserve Banks\nhouses a group of dedicated community development professionals and CRA examiners to help\nbanks meet their CRA obligations. We are proud of our work in familiarizing banks with the\nCRA’s provisions, introducing banks to potential partners in their communities, and convening\nconferences to disseminate research and best practices.3\nThe CRA plays a vital role in the ecosystem supporting economic opportunity in LMI\ncommunities in both rural and urban areas. Rather than direct funds to specific projects, the\nCRA encourages banks to engage on the priorities identified by local leaders and more broadly\nserve credit needs of small businesses and residents of these communities. By being inclusive in\ntheir lending and investing, banks help their local communities to thrive, which in turn benefits\ntheir core business. The recognition of this mutually beneficial relationship between banks and\ntheir local communities is one of the core strengths of the CRA and the reason our effort to\nrevise the CRA regulations must focus on local needs and stakeholder input.\nWhat Have We Learned from Stakeholders?\nFor several years, the federal banking regulators have been asking stakeholders for input\non strengthening the CRA regulations to help banks better meet the credit needs of the local LMI\ncommunities they serve and more closely align with changes in the ways financial products and\nservices are delivered. We also have heard calls from banking and community organizations for\nthe use of metrics to provide greater upfront clarity about evaluation standards. We have heard\n3 Lael Brainard, “Community Development in Baltimore and A Few Observations on Community Reinvestment Act\nModernization,” (remarks delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Baltimore Community Development\nGathering, Baltimore, Maryland, April 17, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180417a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nthat branches remain as important as ever to their local communities, even as the growth of\nmobile and online services has extended the geographic area that banks are serving.4 The one\nmessage we have heard most consistently is that banks and community organizations alike value\nthe activities they undertake under the auspices of the CRA and have invested considerable time\nand effort in the associated processes and reporting.5 For that reason, stakeholders have asked\nthe regulators to take care as we contemplate changes to the CRA.6\nIf the past is any guide, major updates to the CRA regulations happen once every few\ndecades. So it is much more important to get reform right than to do it quickly. If we only have\none opportunity for a few decades, I want to make sure CRA reform is based on the best analysis\nand ideas and the broadest input available. It is critical to analyze carefully the likely effects of\nany proposed changes on credit access and community development in LMI communities, as\nwell as any additional reporting and procedural burdens for banks.\nLast year, we set out several principles to guide our work on CRA reform.7 Revisions to\nthe CRA regulations should reflect the credit needs of local communities and work consistently\n4 In 2010, the three banking agencies held hearings on how to modernize the CRA regulations and subsequently\nissued revisions to the interagency guidance. In 2017, the agencies published additional findings on the CRA as part\nof the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 2017 Joint Report to Congress, Economic Growth and\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Review, March 2017. In 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\npublished an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) asking for comments on a ratio-based approach to\nrating performance. The Federal Reserve reviewed the more than 1,500 comments on the ANPR and subsequently\nheld about 30 outreach meetings with representatives of banks and community organizations, and the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia hosted a research symposium.\n5 Lael Brainard, “Community Investment in Denver,” (remarks delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas\nCity, Denver Branch, Denver, Colorado, October 15, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20181015a.htm.\n6 Lael Brainard, “Strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act: What Are We Learning?” (remarks delivered at\nthe Research Symposium on the Community Reinvestment Act hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, February 1, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20190201a.htm.\n7\nLael Brainard,“Keeping Community at the Heart of the Community Reinvestment Act,” (remarks delivered at the\nAssociation of Neighborhood and Housing Development Eighth Annual Community Development Conference\nBuild.Community.Power, New York, New York, May 18, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20180518a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nthrough the business cycle. They should be tailored to banks of different sizes and business\nstrategies. They should provide greater clarity in advance about how activities will be evaluated.\nThey should encourage banks to seek opportunities in distressed and underserved areas. And\nthey should recognize that the CRA is one of several related laws to promote an inclusive\nfinancial sector.\nGrounding Metrics in Analysis Based on Data\nGuided by stakeholder input, we evaluated how to strengthen the regulation by using\nmetrics to provide greater certainty about how activities will be evaluated, while remaining\nfaithful to the core purpose of the CRA to make credit and retail banking services available in\nlocal LMI communities. Proposed changes to the CRA regulation must be grounded in analysis\nand data to avoid unintended consequences.\nBecause consistent data on CRA-eligible activity were not readily available, our research\nstaff set about creating a database based on over 6,000 written public CRA evaluations from a\nsample of some 3,700 banks of varying asset sizes, business models, geographic areas, and bank\nregulators.8 The database includes the location, number, and amount of CRA-eligible loans and\ninvestments and the ratings associated with each bank’s performance. The data go back to 2005\nin order to assess how CRA performance and the associated ratings vary across the economic\ncycle.\nMetrics that Make Sense\nSo how can we use metrics to provide greater clarity about evaluations? I will sketch out\na proposed approach that uses a set of tailored thresholds that are calibrated for local conditions.\n8 The importance of constructing a consistent and comparable CRA database was a key theme at the Research\nSymposium on the Community Reinvestment Act hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on\nFebruary 1, 2019.\n\n- 5 -\nIt starts by creating two tests: a retail test and community development test (figure 1). Broadly\nspeaking, all retail banks would be evaluated under a retail test, which would assess a bank’s\nrecord of providing retail loans and retail banking services in its assessment areas. Large banks,\nas well as wholesale and limited-purpose banks, would also be evaluated under a separate\ncommunity development test that would evaluate a bank’s record of providing community\ndevelopment loans, qualified investments, and services.\nUsing bank and other publicly available data, we would be able to provide a bank with a\ndashboard indicating how its retail lending activity compares to thresholds for presumptive\nsatisfactory performance that reflect the activity of other lenders and credit demand in the local\narea. Separate metrics reflecting a bank’s assessment area can be provided related to the\nevaluation of its community development performance.\nDividing evaluations into separate retail and community development tests is important.\nFirst, evaluating all retail banks under a stand-alone retail test is important to stay true to the\nCRA’s core focus on providing credit in underserved communities in an assessment area. In\ncontrast, an approach that combines all activity together runs the risk of encouraging some\ninstitutions to meet expectations primarily through a few large community development loans or\ninvestments rather than meeting local needs.\nSecond, having separate tests ensures that expectations are tailored for banks of different\nsizes and business models. Only larger banks would be expected to meet the community\ndevelopment test along with the full retail test. Similar to today, smaller banks would have the\noption of having their retail banking services and community development activities evaluated in\norder to achieve an “Outstanding” rating, but it would not be required. Moreover, small banks\nbelow some threshold might have the option to be evaluated under the existing methodology.\n\n- 6 -\nThird, separate retail and community development tests provide greater scope to calibrate\nthe evaluation metrics to the opportunities available in the market, which can differ for retail\nlending and community development financing.\nAfter analyzing ways to use metrics across the board, we concluded that the value of\nretail services and community development services to a local community do not lend\nthemselves easily to a monetary value metric comparable to the monetary value of loans and\ninvestments. The value of these services may vary greatly from community to community. It is\ndifficult to monetize this value in a consistent way relative to the value of lending and\ninvestment, thus introducing the risk of skewing incentives inadvertently. For example, the\nservices and leadership provided by a small bank located in a rural community may be vital to\nthe success of that community, even if the dollar value of those services is small compared with a\nbranch in a large city. Because of this concern, we are inclined to propose a set of qualitative\nstandards to evaluate retail services within the retail test, and a separate set of qualitative\nstandards to assess community development services within the community development test.\nRetail Test—Metrics for Retail Lending\nThe core of the retail lending test would be to use widely available data to assess two\nclear objectives: how well a bank is serving LMI borrowers, small businesses, and small farms in\nits assessment area, and how well a bank is serving LMI neighborhoods in its assessment area.\nThe metrics used to evaluate these two questions would rely on loan counts rather than dollar\nvalue in order to avoid inadvertent biases in favor of fewer, higher-dollar value loans.9 The\n9 In order for the retail lending metrics to provide a meaningful evaluation, a bank would also need to meet a\nminimum percentage of retail loans in its local community relative to its deposits. The bank’s ratio would be\ncompared to a minimum activity threshold based on the performance of all reporting banks in that same assessment\narea, with the goal of screening out the lowest performers who would need to undergo a full review from an\n\n- 7 -\nmetrics would be evaluated separately for each major product line in a bank’s assessment area,\nwhich is important to tailor the use of metrics to a bank’s business model.\nThe proposed approach measures a bank’s performance in serving the needs of both low-\nand moderate-income borrowers (and small businesses and small farms) and LMI places in the\ncommunity. For mortgage loans, an LMI borrower distribution metric would calculate the\npercentage of a bank’s number of loans made to LMI borrowers relative to its overall mortgage\noriginations, and assess this percentage against an assessment area threshold determined by local\ndemographics and the aggregate lending of other in-market competitors. A separate LMI\nneighborhood distribution metric would evaluate the percentage of a bank’s number of loans in\nLMI tracts to its overall loan count and assess this against a threshold determined by local\ndemographics and the aggregate lending of other in-market competitors.\nA bank that meets or exceeds both the LMI borrower and LMI neighborhood thresholds\nfor each of its major product lines would be presumed to have a satisfactory-or-better level of\nretail lending performance in that assessment area. Using a customized dashboard, each bank\ncould track its own activity against the threshold on an ongoing basis reflecting recent data,\neliminating the lengthy uncertainty associated with the current evaluation methodology, which\nmany banks have highlighted as the most important area for reform (figure 2).\nImportantly, the CRA database we have constructed confirms that the proposed retail\nlending metrics correlate well with past ratings of bank performance (figure 3). The specific\nthresholds that would establish a presumption of satisfactory performance could be informed by\nexaminer. The minimum activity threshold would be calibrated for geographies and different market conditions\nover time.\n\n- 8 -\ncurrent evaluation procedures but need not be set at the same level, and public input will be\nimportant.\nThe retail lending metrics would be tailored to the needs of the local community. This\ntailoring is not possible with a uniform benchmark that applies to all banks and all communities.\nThe large differences between assessment areas illustrate the importance of tailoring thresholds.\nFor example, in Morgan County, Ohio, LMI families are 49 percent of the population, compared\nwith 31 percent in O’Brien County, Iowa (figure 4). We believe this tailored approach is\nempirically sound and avoids imposing arbitrary CRA performance measures on a bank and its\ncommunity. In order to ensure it meets standards of safety and soundness, CRA lending must be\nevaluated in the context of the characteristics of the bank and its community.\nAdditionally, the proposed retail lending metric would automatically adjust to changes in\nthe business cycle. As many commenters noted in response to the ANPR, a uniform ratio that\ndoes not adjust with the local business cycle could provide too little incentive to make good\nloans during an expansion and incentives to make unsound loans during a downturn, which could\nbe inconsistent with the safe and sound practices mandated by the CRA statute. Industry\ncommenters also expressed concern that discretionary adjustments to the uniform metric are\nlikely to lag behind the economic cycle and undermine the certainty a metric purports to provide.\nBy contrast, the proposed retail lending metrics are calibrated to contemporaneous changes in\nmarket conditions, thereby reducing the risk of providing unsound incentives (figure 5).\nFinally, the proposed approach would continue to recognize local context in assessing a\nbank’s CRA performance. If a bank receives the presumption of satisfactory by meeting or\nexceeding the thresholds, an examiner could consider performance context information,\nincluding the bank’s responsiveness to the community’s needs, in determining whether the\n\n- 9 -\nbank’s performance is outstanding at the assessment area level. Likewise, if a bank does not\nmeet or exceed the thresholds, it would undergo a full examination, as it would currently, and\ncould receive any level of rating, including possibly Outstanding, based on the full range of\nperformance context considerations and clear qualitative criteria. The metrics would be designed\nto provide greater certainty, while avoiding rigidity.\nRetail Test—Evaluating Retail Services\nRetail services can be extremely important to LMI communities, although they do not\neasily lend themselves to consistent, comparable metrics. It makes sense to use qualitative\ncriteria related to the responsiveness of a bank’s products and services and its delivery systems,\nwhich stakeholders highlighted as being particularly important in LMI areas.\nIn terms of delivery systems, we recognize the unique and important role that branches\nplay in providing essential financial services to customers, particularly in underserved areas.\nBanks would be evaluated on their branch and ATM locations and how well they serve\ncustomers using online and mobile access channels. Providing a meaningful evaluation of all\ncustomer access channels is essential to ensuring that the CRA remains relevant as more banks\nadopt digital technology.\nRecognizing that branches are important community assets, the proposed retail service\ntest would compare a bank’s distribution of branches, including any openings or closures, to\nbroader patterns of activity in the region. A recent report on branch access in rural areas found\nthat just over 40 percent of rural counties lost bank branches between 2012 and 2017, with 39\nrural communities being “deeply affected” by the loss of more than half of their bank branches.10\n10 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Perspectives from Main Street: Bank Branch Access in\nRural Communities,” (Washington: Board of Governors, November 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/bank-branch-access-in-rural-communities.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nIn addition to the challenges associated with higher cost and less convenient access to banking\nservices, community leaders described how branch closures diminished their access to important\nleadership from branch personnel that was important to their community’s success.\nCommunity Development Test—Measuring Lending and Investment\nNext, let’s turn to the community development test for large retail banks, as well as\nwholesale and limited-purpose banks. The establishment of a separate community development\ntest reflects stakeholder feedback emphasizing that the value of community development finance\nis distinct and not directly comparable to retail activity. A separate test also allows for a broader\narea to be taken into account for purposes of community development relative to retail lending.\nOur analysis suggests there are a set of metrics that can be compared to appropriately\ntailored benchmarks to provide greater certainty regarding community development lending and\ninvestment. The proposed metric would aggregate loan and investment dollars that are\noriginated or purchased during the evaluation period with the book value of all other community\ndevelopment loans and investments that are held on the bank’s balance sheet (figure 6).\nReflecting input from banks and community organizations that patient, committed funding has\nthe greatest effect, this approach avoids the incentives under current practice to provide financing\nin the form of short-term renewable loans in order to receive CRA credit.11\nThe proposed test would compare the combined measure of a bank’s community\ndevelopment financing relative to deposits in its local assessment area to a national average, set\ndifferently for rural and urban areas, and a local average in the bank’s assessment area. The\n11 Lael Brainard, “The Community Reinvestment Act: How Can We Preserve What Works and Make it Better?,”\nremarks delivered at the 2019 Just Economy Conference, National Community Reinvestment Coalition,\nWashington, D.C., March 12, 2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20190312a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nnational comparator would be set differently for metropolitan statistical areas and rural areas to\nreflect the comparatively lower average levels of financial infrastructure in rural communities\n(figure 7). The use of a national rural/metro comparator in addition to an assessment area\ncomparator is intended to avoid skewing incentives toward financially dense areas that are\nalready hotly competitive and to reflect the value of community development in underserved\nareas. The use of these comparators would help provide consistency across evaluations and\nclarity regarding community development expectations for both banks and communities.\nIt is also important to recognize that community development financing is often provided\nin areas that do not neatly fit within a bank’s assessment area. Community development\nfinancing opportunities are not always easy for banks to identify and often depend on working\nwith local nonprofits or governments to help identify projects and put together the complex\nfinancing required to bring them to fruition. Stakeholder feedback emphasized banks’ unique\nadvantages in evaluating community development projects in the states and territories where they\noperate and providing the smaller-scale, more complex, and often more impactful, investments\noverlooked by institutional investors. For this reason, and to encourage more activity in\nunderserved areas, it makes sense to give consideration to all of a bank’s community\ndevelopment activities in a state or territory where it has an assessment area.12\nBanks want to know in advance that they will get the benefit of CRA consideration in\norder to invest the time and effort necessary to evaluate and structure community development\nloans and investments. For that reason, we are sympathetic to requests for a timely process by\n12 Statewide activity outside of a bank’s local assessment area would factor into its statewide community\ndevelopment rating, and regional activities would be considered at the institution level.\n\n- 12 -\nwhich banks can seek conditional examiner review of particular activities before making\nfinancial commitments, particularly for activities that revitalize and stabilize targeted areas.\nOur analysis suggests a community development finance metric along the lines outlined\nhere will help to ensure greater predictability and consistency in achieving a Satisfactory rating.\nHowever, we also want to make sure that these metrics are supplemented with clear, qualitative\nstandards to ensure that small-scale, high-impact community development activities are\nrewarded, along with a bank’s responsiveness to local needs and priorities.\nCommunity Development Test—Evaluating Services\nIt is also important to evaluate services qualitatively at the assessment-area level as part\nof the overall community development test. Volunteer and other services provided by banks can\nprovide meaningful support to communities whose value is unlikely to be adequately captured on\na comparable basis using aggregative dollar value metrics. In areas with a low density of\nfinancial services, a bank officer on the board of local community organizations could provide\nconsiderable value to the community that is not accurately reflected by monetizing volunteer\nhours based on their compensation.\nTailoring\nThis approach to assessing CRA performance would tailor performance metrics to bank\nsize and business strategy, as well as to local and cyclical conditions. The approach would tailor\nto banks’ business models by establishing separate thresholds for substantially different lending\nproducts, such as mortgage loans and small business, small farm, and consumer loans, as well as\nseparate retail lending and community development financing metrics.\n\n- 13 -\nThe proposed metrics would also be tailored for different bank sizes. This is facilitated in\npart by allowing very small banks to retain the current evaluation procedures and in part by\ncreating a separate community development test that would apply only to large banks. Tailoring\nis also an important consideration in data collection and reporting requirements. The proposed\nretail lending approach is designed so that it can be implemented in significant part with data that\nare readily available. In designing the community development approach, we have been mindful\nof burden as we consider any additional data that might be required to implement certain metrics.\nFinally, as previously noted, the metrics are tailored for local conditions and cyclical\nconsiderations. The proposed threshold for each type of activity is calibrated to local conditions\nas they evolve over the cycle, and the community development finance metric uses an additional\ntime-varying national rural or urban comparator.\nThe Path Ahead\nStaff across the Federal Reserve System have devoted substantial time and effort to\nengaging with the other banking agencies in the CRA reform process. The analysis, data, and\nproposals I have discussed today have all been shared in greater detail with our counterparts at\nthe other banking agencies in an effort to forge a common approach. We were hopeful our\nproposed approach could be incorporated into the proposed rulemaking that was released last\nmonth in order to seek public comment on a range of options.\nBased on the best available data, we concluded that CRA metrics tailored to local\nconditions and the different sizes and business models of banks would best serve the credit needs\nof the communities that are at the heart of the statute. This tailored approach using targeted\nmetrics also yielded more consistent and predictable overall ratings than any comprehensive\nuniform metric. Our analysis did not find a consistent relationship between CRA ratings and a\n\n- 14 -\nuniform comprehensive ratio that adds together all of a bank’s CRA-eligible activities in an area.\nMoreover, we want to be attentive to possible unintended consequences: Because a uniform\ncomprehensive ratio would not reflect local conditions, which can vary greatly between\ncommunities and over the cycle, a bank could exert the same amount of effort in different areas\nor different points in the economic cycle with very different outcomes.\nWe continue to believe that a strong common set of interagency standards is the best\noutcome. By sharing our work publicly, we hope to solicit public input on a broader set of\noptions for reform and find a way toward interagency agreement on the best approach. The\nprocess of sharing the data and analysis informing regulatory proposals and seeking public\nfeedback on them is critical to the regulatory process. Given that reforms to the CRA regulations\nare likely to set expectations for a few decades, it is more important to get the reforms done right\nthan to do them quickly. That requires giving external stakeholders sufficient time and analysis\nto provide meaningful feedback on a range of options for modernizing the regulations.\nI will conclude by noting that the high level of engagement and commitment on the part\nof banks, community organizations, and other important stakeholders give me confidence that we\nwill succeed in strengthening the CRA’s core purpose of helping banks affirmatively meet the\ncredit needs of their local LMI communities.\n\nFigure 1: Separate Retail and Community Development Tests\nRetail Test Community Development (CD) Test\nCD Financing Metric\nRetail Services\nRetail Lending Metrics CD Services\nCD Lending\n& Investments\nRetail Test would not apply to wholesale banks CD Test would not apply to small retail banks\nRetail Services subtest would not apply to small retail banks\nBOARD OF GOVERNORS of theFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 1\n\nFigure 2: Each Bank Could Track Retail Lending with a Dashboard\nABC Bank\nAssessment Area: Example County\nProduct: Home Mortgage Lending\nEvaluation Period: 2015 to 2018\nBorrower Distribution + Geographic Distribution\nBOARD OF GOVERNORS of theFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 2\n\nFigure 3: Retail Lending Metric Correlates Well with Ratings\nDistribution of Performance on Retail Lending Metrics by Actual\nAssessment Area Level Conclusion On Past Lending Test\nActual Conclusion\nOutstanding\nSatisfactory\nNeeds to Improve\nLower Performance Higher Performance\nNote: Bubble size represents the fraction of individual assessment areas in the Board’s database that reached a given level of performance on the retail lending metric.

I greatly appreciate this opportunity to participate in\nthe virtual Investment Connection. As many of you are aware, the Federal Reserve Bank\nof Kansas City started this initiative in 2011 with a goal of helping funders find\ncommunity and economic development opportunities in the 10th District. Investment\nConnection has attracted a wide range of proposals to meet community development\nneeds, including asset building and financial education, community facilities, small\nbusiness development/microlending, neighborhood stabilization/affordable housing, and\nworkforce development. Since its inception, seven additional Reserve Banks have held or\nplan to hold Investment Connection events in their respective districts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created an economic and public health crisis, which\nhas caused tremendous hardship, in particular for our most vulnerable communities. The\ndevastation is demanding that government, nonprofits, and other organizations think\nbroadly and creatively to address the growing needs of households and businesses across\nthe nation. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a powerful tool to bring\nstakeholders together to find solutions that serve the needs of low- and moderate-income\ncommunities. As we collectively pursue efforts to address the challenges of this crisis,\nour work on CRA modernization also reminds us how critical it is to take into account the\nunique needs and opportunities in different communities.\nTo better understand what is happening on the ground, and how the Federal\nReserve can use its full range of tools to address this crisis, it is important to hear from\ndirect service providers. That is why I join you here today.\nI would like to thank you for your commitment to meeting the needs of low- and\nmoderate-income communities, especially in these extraordinary times.

The Federal Open Market Committee (the Committee) has\nlong recognized the connection between stable, low inflation and maximum employment.\nForty years ago, Paul Volcker noted that the dual mandate isn’t an either-or proposition\nand that runaway inflation “would be the greatest threat to the continuing growth of the\neconomy… and ultimately, to employment.”2\nMaximum employment and stable, low inflation benefit all Americans, but are\nparticularly important for low- and moderate-income families. The combination of good\njob opportunities and stable, low inflation provides purchasing power to fill up gas tanks\nand grocery carts and pay housing and medical costs, leaving room to build emergency\ncushions and invest in education; retirement; and, for some, small businesses. Indeed, the\nEmployment Act of 1946 called on the federal government to promote “maximum\nemployment, production, and purchasing power.”3\nWhile national data do not directly disaggregate the differential effects of\ninflation by household income groups, a variety of evidence suggests that lower-income\nhouseholds disproportionately feel the burden of high inflation. Lower-income families\nexpend a greater share of their income on necessities; have smaller financial cushions;\n1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nviews are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n2 Paul Volcker (1979), interview on “The MacNeil/Lehrer Report,” PBS, October 10, p. 10,\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/volcker/Volcker_19791010.pdf.\n3 See the Declaration of Policy on page 1 of the Employment Act of 1946, available at\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/congressional/employment-act-1946.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nand may have less ability to switch to lower-priced alternatives. Arthur Burns noted in\nthe late 1960s that “there can be little doubt that poor people…are the chief sufferers of\ninflation.”4\nToday, inflation is very high, particularly for food and gasoline. All Americans\nare confronting higher prices, but the burden is particularly great for households with\nmore limited resources. That is why getting inflation down is our most important task,\nwhile sustaining a recovery that includes everyone. This is vital to sustaining the\npurchasing power of American families.\nWhose Cost of Living?\nIn assessing inflation faced by American consumers, economists and\npolicymakers generally rely on the change in the consumer price index (CPI) or the\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5 Since January\n2012, the Committee’s price-stability goal has been specified as a longer-run goal of 2\npercent in terms of annual PCE inflation.6 Both CPI and PCE inflation metrics are\n4 Quoted in John Palmer (1973), Inflation, Unemployment, and Poverty (Lexington, Mass.: Lexington\nBooks), as referenced in Alan Blinder and Howard Esaki (1978), “Macroeconomic Activity and Income\nDistribution in the Postwar United States,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 60 (November), pp.\n604–9.\n5 CPI and PCE inflation generally move together but vary in important ways, including variations generated\nby differences in the scope of the purchases considered in the households’ baskets, differences in the\nweights assigned to different categories of spending, and different formulas used to aggregate the\nunderlying weighted price changes. For a recent comparison of CPI and PCE measures, see Noah Johnson\n(2017), “A Comparison of PCE and CPI: Methodological Differences in U.S. Inflation Calculation and\ntheir Implications,” BLS Statistical Survey Paper (Washington: Bureau of Labor Statistics, November),\nhttps://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2017/pdf/st170010.pdf.\n6 The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting. For more information, see the current version of that statement at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf as well as Chair\nBernanke’s discussion of the decision at the January 24, 2012, press conference:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20120125.pdf. For additional\ninformation regarding the FOMC’s preference for using a PCE-based measure of inflation, see the\ndiscussion of the change from CPI to PCE inflation projections in the February 2000 Monetary Policy\nReport at https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/hh/2000/february/fullreport.pdf#page=7.\n\n- 3 -\nassembled from a collection of underlying elementary price indexes for narrow subsets of\ngoods and services.7 The price changes each month for the goods and services in these\nsubsets are combined into measures of overall inflation by calculating a weighted average\nof all these subindexes, where the weights are based on average aggregate consumer\nexpenditures in each category.\nUsing a national average of consumer expenditures to weight the categories has\nintuitive appeal. This measure is particularly useful, for example, in adjusting measures\nof overall expenditure for changes in prices to determine how much real growth has\noccurred between two periods. However, using a national average of expenditures to\nweight the categories has limitations when it comes to representing the true cost of living\nexperienced by different types of households.\nU.S. Households Have Different Inflation Experiences\nEach household in the United States has a particular consumption bundle whose\nprices and quantities combine to make up that household’s cost of living. If we could\nstart with each individual household’s cost of living and aggregate across households by\ngiving equal weight to each household, it would create an economy-wide cost-of-living\nindex. The change in such a cost-of-living index would represent the average inflation\nexperienced by U.S. households. Instead, because the CPI and PCE indexes weight every\ndollar of expenditure equally, these indexes implicitly weight each household’s cost of\n7 According to the CPI section of the Handbook of Methods, the CPI survey collects about 94,000 prices\nper month to find prices in 243 basic item categories in 32 geographic areas, facilitating the creation of\nbasic indexes for each of the resulting 7,776 item-area combinations that compose the CPI. See Bureau of\nLabor Statistics (2020), “Consumer Price Index,” Handbook of Methods (Washington: BLS, November),\nhttps://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cpi/home.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nliving proportionally to their total expenditure.8 Since lower-income households\nrepresent a relatively smaller share of overall expenditure, the inflation associated with\ntheir consumption baskets is underrepresented in the official consumer price indexes.\nIt would be useful to have data about consumer inflation broken out by\ndemographic groups, similar to labor market and personal-income data, in order to assess\nthe differential effect of inflation across different groups of households.9 U.S. statistical\nagencies do not collect the information needed to accurately assess inflation at a\nhousehold level, and it would require a large change in the way these agencies go about\ntheir work to do so. Nonetheless, recent research has begun to assess variation in the\nways different households experience inflation.\nHouseholds at different income levels could experience differential inflation\neffects for several reasons: Consumption shares could differ systematically for low- and\nhigh-income households; the goods and services within each consumption category could\ndiffer; the ability to substitute for lower-priced alternatives of the same item could differ;\nand prices paid for the same good could differ systematically due to differences in access.\nI will briefly touch on these four reasons.\nFirst, low- and moderate-income households could experience inflation that\ndiverges from the average because their consumption baskets differ systematically from\nthe average. 10 Lower-income households spend 77 percent of their income on\n8 These two approaches are referred to as the democratic and plutocratic indexes, respectively. For more\ninformation on the literature of cost-of-living measurement and plutocratic and democratic indexes, see\nRobert A. Pollak (1998), “The Consumer Price Index: A Research Agenda and Three Proposals,” Journal\nof Economic Perspectives, vol. 12 (1), pp. 69–78.\n9 See Austan Goolsbee (2021), “The Missing Data in the Inflation Debate,” New York Times, December 30,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/opinion/inflation-economy-biden-inequality.html.\n10 See Pew Charitable Trusts (2016), Household Expenditures and Income, Issue Brief (Washington: Pew,\nMarch), https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2016/03/household-expenditures-\nand-income.\n\n- 5 -\nnecessities—more than double the 31 percent of income spent by higher-income\nhouseholds on these categories.11\nSeveral studies have found that the consumption baskets of lower-income\nhouseholds have experienced higher-than-average inflation rates over time. Research\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has examined the effect of different\nconsumption baskets by using the same elementary price indexes as used in the official\nCPI but assigning the weights of these components to reflect the consumption bundles of\ndifferent types of households. A 2021 working paper by BLS staff based on data from\n2003 to 2018 found that a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in\nthe lowest-income quartile grew faster than the overall CPI, while a price index reflecting\nthe consumption basket for households in the highest-income quartile grew more slowly\nthan the overall CPI.12 A 2015 BLS study found a similar result using data from 1982 to\n2014.13 Of course, the recent sharp increases in inflation may have affected the\n11 The values for the share of income spent in each category were constructed using microdata from the\n2020 Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CEX). For full-income reporters with strictly positive\nvalues for total expenditure and income after tax, the income share of expenditure in a given category is the\nratio of expenditure in a given category to income after tax. The numbers reported are the sum of the\nmedian income share from each of the four categories, where each is defined as the weighted median of\nthese ratios for households in the bottom and top quintiles of the income distribution. Consumption\ncategories are defined as in the CEX.\n12 The study used data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey to construct a consumption basket for\nhouseholds in the lowest quartile of income as well as in the highest quartile of income. The authors\ncalculated a Laspeyres index for the consumption basket of households in the lowest and highest income\nquartiles. From December 2003 to December 2018, the annualized percent change in the index for the\nlowest income quartile was 2.25 percent, and the annualized percent change in the index for the highest\nincome quartile was 1.97 percent; the CPI-U had an annualized percentage change of 2.07 percent over that\nperiod. See Josh Klick and Anya Stockburger (2021), “Experimental CPI for Lower and Higher Income\nHouseholds,” BLS Working Paper 537 (Washington: Bureau of Labor Statistics, March),\nhttps://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2021/pdf/ec210030.pdf.\n13 Three different baskets of “basic necessities” were considered in this study. The base experimental index\nincluded food, shelter, and clothing, and the additional two baskets included the components of the base\nindex and added energy, and then both energy and medical care, respectively. During the period examined,\nthe rate of overall consumer inflation was 2.78 percent, as measured by the regular CPI-U for All Items. In\ncomparison, the base experimental index rose at an average annual rate of 2.91 percent from December\n1982 to December 2014. The base-plus-energy experimental index increased at an average annual rate of\n\n- 6 -\nconsumption bundles of lower-income households relative to the average differently than\nin previous cycles.\nWhile these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across\ndifferent income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for\nsubcategories of goods and services. As a result, they may miss additional sources of\nvariation in the inflation rates experienced by households at different income levels.\nThis consideration brings us to the second point: Households with different levels\nof income may purchase significantly different items even within the same elementary\nindex categories for goods and services. To take an extreme example, caviar and canned\ntuna are both in the same elementary index. The demand and supply dynamics for those\nproducts are likely quite different, meaning that their relative price dynamics are poorly\ndescribed by a single index.\nThird, households at different income levels may have differing abilities to\nsubstitute for lower-priced alternatives within an elementary category. Consider a price\nincrease for a breakfast cereal that increases the prices of both the brand-name cereal and\nthe corresponding lower-priced store-brand cereal but maintains a differential between\nthem. A household that had been purchasing brand-name cereal could save money by\npurchasing store-brand cereal instead, perhaps even eliminating any effect of the price\nincrease on their actual spending while purchasing the same quantity of cereal in that\n2.75 percent over the same period. The base-plus-energy-and-medical-care experimental index rose at an\naverage annual rate of 2.99 percent during the same timeframe. See Jonathan Church (2015), “The Cost of\n‘Basic Necessities’ Has Risen Slightly More than Inflation over the Last 30 Years,” Beyond the Numbers:\nPrices & Spending, vol. 4 (June), no. 10, https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-4/the-cost-of-basic-\nnecessities-has-risen-slightly-more-than-inflation-over-the-last-30-years.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nnarrow category. However, a household that was already purchasing the store brand\nwould have to either absorb the increase in cost or consume less within that category.\nFinally, beyond the variation in inflation that comes from households buying\ndifferent goods, research also shows that differences in inflation can result from\nhouseholds paying different prices for identical goods. Using transaction-level data,\nresearchers found that almost two-thirds of the variation in inflation across households\ncomes from differences in prices paid for identical goods, with only about one-third\ncoming from differences in the mix of goods within broad categories.14 As a result of\nthese differences, households with lower incomes, more household members, or older\nhousehold heads experienced higher inflation on average. Variations in the prices paid\nfor identical goods could reflect differences in the ability of some households to stock up\nwhen prices are discounted or to buy in bulk and save—options only available to\nhouseholds with the means to buy in larger quantities, adequate capacity to store larger\nquantities, or the flexibility to delay purchases if there is an opportunity to save in the\nfuture.\nIn addition, evidence suggests that inflation could be lower for items purchased\nonline rather than from brick-and-mortar stores, suggesting that households who do not\nhave full access to online shopping options could face a higher cost of living. One study\n14 See Greg Kaplan and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl (2017), “Inflation at the Household Level,” Journal of\nMonetary Economics, vol. 91 (November), pp. 19–38. For a sample of 500 million transactions by about\n50,000 U.S. households from 2004 to 2013, the authors found that over the nine years from the third\nquarter of 2004 through the third quarter of 2013, average inflation cumulates to 33 percent for households\nwith incomes below $20,000 but to just 25 percent for households with incomes above $100,000.\nThis finding does not hold for housing, where a recent study found that housing inflation tends to\nbe relatively similar across income quintiles, even though the share of income spent on housing varies\nconsiderably by income group. See table 2 and the related discussion in Daryl Larsen and Raven Malloy\n(2021), “Differences in Rent Growth by Income 1985-2019 and Implications for Real Income Inequality,”\nFEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 5),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3006.\n\n- 8 -\nof online transactions made between 2014 and 2017 found that online inflation averaged\nmore than 1 percentage point per year lower than the equivalent CPI measure of the\nrelevant product categories.15\nWe are only beginning to understand the ways in which inflation experiences vary\nfrom household to household, how this variation correlates with income and demographic\ninformation, and how these divergent inflation experiences change over time.16 This\ndeveloping area of research will benefit from conferences like this one that help expand\nthe frontier of our knowledge about the heterogeneity of experienced inflation.\nImplications for the Outlook and Policy\nHigh inflation places a burden on working families who are concerned about how\nfar their paychecks will stretch as well as seniors living on fixed incomes. So now let me\nturn briefly to what we are seeing on inflation and the outlook for jobs and growth.\nHeadline PCE inflation for February came in at 6.4 percent on a 12-month basis.\nFood and energy account for an outsized one-fourth share of this high level of inflation\nand also constitute an outsized share of expenditure for lower-income Americans, who\n15 The study used a matched set of entry-level item categories to create a digital price index (DPI) to\ncompare with the equivalent CPI measure and found that overall DPI inflation is more than 1 percentage\npoint per year lower than CPI inflation in those categories. Broken out by major groups, inflation was lower\nin the DPI than in the equivalent CPI in every category other than medicine and medical supplies. See\nAustan Goolsbee and Peter Klenow (2018), “Internet Rising, Prices Falling: Measuring Inflation in a\nWorld of E-Commerce,” AEA Papers and Proceedings, vol. 108 (May), pp. 488–92.\n16 For example, a recent study also suggests that the differential rates of inflation between low- and high-\nincome households varies over the cycle: The gap between the inflation associated with goods purchased\nby lower-income households relative to higher-income households rises during recessions and narrows\nduring recoveries. See David Argente and Munseob Lee (2021), “Cost of Living Inequality During the\nGreat Recession,” Journal of the European Economic Association, vol. 19 (April), pp. 913–52,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaa018. Another recent working paper documents that prices rise more for\nproducts purchased relatively more by low-income households (necessities) during recessions and that the\naggregate share of spending devoted to necessities is countercyclical. See also Jacob Orchard (2022),\n“Cyclical Demand Shifts and Cost of Living Inequality,” SSRN Working Paper (Rochester, NY: SSRN,\nFebruary 12), https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4033572.\n\n- 9 -\nspend 26 percent of their income on food at home and transportation, compared with 9\npercent for high-income Americans.17\nCore inflation is also elevated, and inflationary pressures have been broadening\nout. Housing contributed about one-tenth of total PCE inflation in February and is the\nsingle greatest category of expenditures by far for lower-income Americans, who spend\n45 percent of their income on housing, compared to 18 percent for high-income\nAmericans.18 Durable goods inflation, particularly in autos, accounted for slightly more\nthan one-fifth of total PCE inflation in February, representing a much greater contribution\nto inflation than was the case pre-pandemic. High durable goods inflation reflects\npandemic-related supply constraints as well as persistently elevated demand associated\nwith the pandemic. I will be carefully monitoring the extent to which demand rotates\nback to services and away from durable goods, where it has remained consistently above\npre-pandemic levels, and the extent to which the services sector is able to absorb higher\ndemand without generating undue inflationary pressure.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is a human tragedy and a seismic geopolitical event.\nThe global commodity supply shock associated with Russia’s actions skews inflation\nrisks to the upside and is expected to exacerbate high prices for gasoline and food as well\nas supply chain bottlenecks in goods sectors. The recent COVID lockdowns in China are\nalso likely to extend bottlenecks.\n17 These statistics are based on the median income share in each category, defined as the weighted median\nof these ratios for households in the bottom and top quintiles of the income distribution; see footnote 11\nfor additional detail.\n18 These statistics are based on the median income share in each category, defined as the weighted median\nof these ratios for households in the bottom and top quintiles of the income distribution; see footnote 11\nfor additional detail.\n\n- 10 -\nThese geopolitical events also pose downside risks to growth. That said, the U.S.\neconomy entered this period of uncertainty with considerable momentum in demand and\na strong labor market. As of the March labor report, payroll employment has increased at\na pace of 600,000 jobs per month over the past six months, and the unemployment rate\nhas fallen by a percentage point over that period and is now close to its pre-pandemic\nlevel. In contrast, until recently, the recovery in labor force participation was lagging far\nbehind. So it is particularly noteworthy to see that the pandemic constraints on labor\nsupply are diminishing for the prime-age workforce: The prime-age participation rate\njumped 0.7 percentage points for women in March, following a similar-sized jump for\nmen in February. An increase in labor supply associated with diminishing pandemic\nconstraints combined with a moderation in demand associated with tightening financial\nconditions, slowing foreign growth, and a large decrease in fiscal support could be\nexpected to reduce imbalances later in the year.\nAgainst that backdrop, I will turn to policy. It is of paramount importance to get\ninflation down. Accordingly, the Committee will continue tightening monetary policy\nmethodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the\nbalance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting. Given that the recovery has\nbeen considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance\nsheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with\nsignificantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps\ncompared with 2017–19. The reduction in the balance sheet will contribute to monetary\npolicy tightening over and above the expected increases in the policy rate reflected in\nmarket pricing and the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections. I expect the\n\n- 11 -\ncombined effect of rate increases and balance sheet reduction to bring the stance of policy\nto a more neutral position later this year, with the full extent of additional tightening over\ntime dependent on how the outlook for inflation and employment evolves.\nOur communications have resulted in broad market expectations for an\nexpeditious increase in the policy rate toward a neutral level and a more rapid reduction\nin the balance sheet compared with 2017–19. Consistent with these expectations, we\nhave already seen significant tightening in market financing conditions at longer\nmaturities, which tend to be most relevant for household and business decisionmaking.\nFor instance, 30-year mortgage rates have increased more than 100 basis points in just a\nfew months and are now at levels last seen in late 2018.\nLooking forward, at every meeting, we will have the opportunity to calibrate the\nappropriate pace of firming through the policy rate to reflect what the incoming data tell\nus about the outlook and the balance of risks. For today, every indicator of longer-term\ninflation expectations lies within the range of historical values consistent with our 2\npercent target. On the other side, I am attentive to signals from the yield curve at\ndifferent horizons and from other data that might suggest increased downside risks to\nactivity. Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks. The\nCommittee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation\nexpectations indicate that such action is warranted. We are committed to bringing\ninflation back down to its 2 percent target, recognizing that stable low inflation is vital to\nmaintaining a strong economy and a labor market that works for everyone.",

I’d like to begin by\nremembering our Federal Reserve colleague Teresa Curran--executive vice president and\ndirector of Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco--who recently\npassed away after a long illness. Teresa’s leadership on fintech was one of her many\nextraordinary contributions to the System. With her characteristic enthusiasm, Teresa\nhelped us prioritize this topic early on and had a strong influence in helping shape our\nwork program--with an emphasis on assessing the opportunities and challenges of fintech\nin a balanced way. We already miss her wise counsel here. I’m sure Teresa would have\nappreciated this conference’s gathering of academics, industry participants, and\npolicymakers to exchange information and discuss current research related to financial\ninnovation.\nWhy Is Fintech Important?\nIn my remarks today, I’d like to share a few thoughts about emerging financial\ntechnologies and their relevance to our work.1 Fintech has the potential to transform the\nway that financial services are delivered and designed as well as the underlying processes\nof payments, clearing, and settlement.2 The past few years have seen a proliferation of\nnew digitally enabled financial products and services, in addition to new processes and\nplatforms. Just as smartphones revolutionized the way in which we interact with one\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n2 For a review of the potential of distributed ledger technologies to change payment, settlement, and\nclearance processes, see the forthcoming Federal Reserve Board Finance and Economics Discussion Series\npaper titled “Distributed Ledger Technology in Payments, Clearing and Settlement.”\n\n- 2 -\nanother to communicate and share information, fintech may impact nearly every aspect of\nhow we interact with each other financially, from payments and credit to savings and\nfinancial planning. In our continuously connected, on-demand world, consumers,\nbusinesses, and financial institutions are all eager to find new ways to engage in financial\ntransactions that are more convenient, timely, secure, and efficient.\nIn many cases, fintech puts financial change at consumers’ fingertips--literally.\nToday’s consumers, particularly millennials, are accustomed to having a wide range of\napplications, options, and information immediately accessible to them. Almost every\ntype of consumer transaction--ordering groceries, downloading a movie, buying furniture,\nor arranging childcare, to name a few--can be done on a mobile device, and there are\noften multiple different applications that consumers can choose for each of these tasks\nbased on their preferences. It seems inevitable for this kind of convenience, immediacy,\nand customization to extend to financial services. Indeed, according to the Federal\nReserve Board’s most recent survey of mobile financial services, fully two-thirds of\nconsumers between the ages of 18 and 29 having a mobile phone and a bank account use\nmobile banking.3\nNew fintech platforms are giving consumers and small businesses more real-time\ncontrol over their finances. Once broad adoption is achieved, it is technologically quite\nsimple to conduct cashless person-to-person fund transfers, enabling, among other things,\nthe splitting of a check after a meal out with friends or the sending of remittances quickly\nand cheaply to friends or family in other countries. Financial management tools are\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016\n(Washington: Board of Governors), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-\nservices-report-201603.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nautomating savings decisions based on what consumers can afford, and they are helping\nconsumers set financial goals and providing feedback on expenditures that are\ninconsistent with those goals. In some cases, fintech applications are automatically\ntransferring spare account balances into savings, based on monthly spending and income\npatterns, effectively making savings the default choice. Other applications are providing\nconsumers with more real-time access to earnings as they are accrued rather than waiting\nfor their regular payday. This service may be particularly valuable to the nearly 50\npercent of adults with extremely limited liquid savings.4 It is too early to know what the\noverall impact of these innovations will be, but they offer the potential to empower\nconsumers to better manage cash flow to reduce the need for more expensive credit\nproducts to cover short-term cash needs.5\nOne particularly promising aspect of fintech is the potential to expand access to\ncredit and other financial services for consumers and small businesses. By reducing loan\nprocessing and underwriting costs, online origination platforms may enable financial\nservices providers to more cost effectively offer smaller-balance loans to households and\nsmall businesses than had previously been feasible.6 In addition, broader analysis of data\nmay allow lenders to better assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, facilitating\n4 The Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking finds that 46 percent\nof households report that they would need to borrow money or sell something in order to pay an\nunexpected expense of $400. The report of survey findings is available on the Board’s website at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/shed.htm.\n5 Robo-advisors are making investing and retirement planning cheaper and more accessible, filling a\nparticular need as the coverage of employer-provided retirement plans has declined. According to Insider\nNewsletter published by Willis Towers Watson (vol. 26, no. 2, February 2016), only 20 percent of Fortune\n500 companies offered a defined-benefit plan to salaried new hires in 2015, down from 59 percent among\nthe same employers in 1998.\n6 For more information on fintech and small business lending, see Karen Gordon Mills and Brayden\nMcCarthy, “The State of Small Business Lending: Innovation and Technology and the Implications for\nRegulation,” Harvard Business School Working Paper (2016),\nwww.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/17-042_30393d52-3c61-41cb-a78a-ebbe3e040e55.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nthe responsible provision of loans to some individuals and firms that otherwise would not\nhave access to such credit. In recent years, some innovative Community Development\nFinancial Institutions (CDFIs) have developed partnerships with online alternative\nlenders, with the goal of expanding credit access to underserved small businesses.7\nThe challenge will be to foster socially beneficial innovation that responsibly\nexpands access to credit for underserved consumers and small businesses, and those who\notherwise would qualify only for high-cost alternatives. It would be a lost opportunity if,\ninstead of expanding access in a socially beneficial way, some fintech products merely\nprovided a vehicle to market high-cost loans to the underserved, or resulted in the digital\nequivalent of redlining, exacerbating rather than ameliorating financial access inequities.\nWe are also monitoring a growing fintech segment called “regtech” that aims to\nhelp banks achieve regulatory compliance more effectively. Regtech firms are designing\nnew tools to assist banks and other financial institutions in addressing regulatory\ncompliance issues ranging from onboarding new customers to consumer protection to\npayments and governance. Many of the current solutions are focused on Bank Secrecy\nAct (BSA) regulatory requirements, including know-your-customer (KYC) and\nsuspicious activity reporting requirements. The solutions utilize new technologies and\ndata-analytic techniques that may reduce the costs and time needed for banks to identify\nand assess customers’ money-laundering and terrorist-financing risks. However, it is too\n7 Most recently, Regions Bank announced a partnership with Fundation, an online lender, and TruFund, a\nCDFI, to provide small-dollar loans to underserved small businesses (for more information, see\nhttp://ir.regions.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=989068). In 2015, Lending Club and the Opportunity\nFund, a California-based CDFI, announced a partnership intended to provide $10 million in loans over a\nperiod of five months to 400 small businesses in underserved areas of California (for more information, see\nwww.opportunityfund.org/media/blog/clinton-announces-partnership-between-opportunity-fund-and-\nlending-club).\n\n- 5 -\nearly to tell the degree to which innovative approaches to customer due diligence, such as\nKYC utilities, will deliver efficiency gains such as those outlined in the recent Bank for\nInternational Settlements Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures report on\ncorrespondent banking.8\nEnsuring Risks Are Managed and Consumers Are Protected\nWhile financial innovation holds promise, it is crucial that financial firms,\ncustomers, regulators, and other stakeholders understand and mitigate associated risks.\nThere is a tension between the lightning pace of development of new products and\nservices being brought to market--sometimes by firms that are new or have not\nhistorically specialized in consumer finance--and the duty to ensure that important risks\naround financial services and payments are addressed. Firms need to ensure that they are\nappropriately controlling and mitigating both risks that are unique to fintech as well as\nrisks that exist independently of new technologies.\nFor example, some fintech firms are exploring the use of nontraditional data in\nunderwriting and pricing credit products. While nontraditional data may have the\npotential to help evaluate consumers who lack credit histories, some data may raise\nconsumer protection concerns. Nontraditional data, such as the level of education and\nsocial media usage, may not necessarily have a broadly agreed upon or empirically\nestablished nexus with creditworthiness and may be correlated with characteristics\nprotected by fair lending laws. To the extent that the use of this type of data could result\nin unfairly disadvantaging some groups of consumers, it requires careful review to ensure\nlegal compliance. In addition, while consumers generally have some sense of how their\n8 See www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d147.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nfinancial behavior affects their traditional credit scores, alternative credit scoring methods\npresent new challenges that could raise questions of fairness and transparency. It may\nnot always be readily apparent to consumers, or even to regulators, what specific\ninformation is utilized by certain alternative credit scoring systems, how such use impacts\na consumer’s ability to secure a loan or its pricing, and what behavioral changes\nconsumers might take to improve their credit access and pricing.\nSimilarly, fintech innovations that rely on data sharing may create security,\nprivacy, and data-ownership risks, even as they provide increased convenience to\nconsumers. Recent examples of large-scale fraud and cybersecurity breaches have\nillustrated the significance of possible security risks. As the data sets that financial\ninstitutions utilize expand beyond traditional consumer credit histories, data privacy will\nbecome a growing concern, as will data ownership and whether or not the consumer has\nany say over how these data are used and shared or whether he or she can review it for\naccuracy. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently issued a request for\ninformation to better understand the benefits and risks associated with new financial services\nthat rely on access to consumer financial accounts and account-related information.9\nIn addition to the risks I have outlined that are specific to new financial\ntechnologies, firms also must control for risks that have always been present, even in\nbrick-and-mortar financial institutions. For example, risks around the BSA and Anti-\nMoney Laundering rules cut across all segments and all portfolios. Similarly, firms must\n9 See\nhttp://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/112016_cfpb_Request_for_Information_Regarding_Consum\ner_Access_to_Financial_Records.pdf. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau believes that\n“consumers should be able to use their financial records and account information and securely share access\nin an electronic format.”\n\n- 7 -\nmonitor credit and liquidity risks of loans acquired or processed via fintech platforms,\nespecially given that these products have not been tested over an economic cycle.\nFurthermore, as a general rule, the introduction of new products or services\ntypically involves heightened risks as a financial institution enters into new areas with\nwhich it may not have experience or that may not be consistent with its overall business\nstrategy and risk tolerance. Banks collaborating with fintech firms must control for the\nrisks associated with the associated new products, services, and third-party relationships.\nWhen incorporating innovation that is consistent with a bank’s goals and risk tolerance,\nbankers will need to consider which model of engagement is most appropriate in light of\ntheir business model and risk-management infrastructure, manage any outsourced\nrelationships consistent with supervisory expectations,10 ensure that regulatory\ncompliance considerations are included in the development of new products and services,\nand have strong fallback plans in place to limit the risks associated with products and\npartners that may not survive.\nWith the growing number of partnerships between banks and fintech companies,\nwe often receive questions about the applicability of our vendor risk-management\nguidance. We are actively reviewing our guidance to determine whether any adjustments\nor clarifications may become appropriate in the context of these arrangements. We hear\nconcerns from community bankers in particular about their internal capacity to undertake\nthe requisite due diligence and ongoing vendor management on their own, especially with\nmuch larger vendors, and questions about whether the interagency service providers\nsupervision program might be relevant in this context. We are thinking about whether\n10 See Supervision and Regulation Letter 13-19/Consumer Affairs Letter 13-21, “Guidance on Managing\nOutsourcing Risk,” www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1319.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nchanges brought about by fintech and fintech partnerships may warrant consideration of\nany changes to the interagency supervision program for service providers.\nRegulatory Engagement\nI believe that the Federal Reserve is well-positioned to help shape this innovation\nas it develops, and it is important that we be clear about our expectations and mindful of\nthe possible effects of our actions. The policy, regulatory, and supervisory decisions\nmade by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators can impact the ways in which\nnew financial technologies are developed and implemented, and ultimately how effective\nthey are. It is critical that fintech firms and financial institutions comply with all\napplicable legal protections and obligations. At the same time, it is important that\nregulators and supervisors not impose undue burdens on financial innovations that would\nprovide broad social benefits responsibly. An unduly rigid regulatory or supervisory\nposture could lead to unintended consequences, such as the movement of innovations\noutside of the regulated banking industry, potentially creating greater risks and less\ntransparency.\nThe rapid pace of change and the large number of actors--both banks and\nnonbanks--in fintech raise questions about how to effectively conduct our regulatory and\nsupervisory activities. In one sense, regulators’ approach to fintech should be no\ndifferent than for conventional financial products or services. The same basic principles\nregarding fairness and transparency should apply regardless of whether a consumer\nobtains a product through a brick-and-mortar bank branch or an online portal using a\nsmartphone. Indeed, the same consumer laws and regulations that apply to products\noffered by banks generally apply to nonbank fintech firms as well, even though their\n\n- 9 -\nbusiness models may differ. However, the application of laws and regulations that were\ndesigned based on traditional financial products and delivery channels may give rise to\ncomplex or novel issues when applied to new products or new delivery channels. As a\nresult, we are committed to regularly engage with firms and the technology to develop a\nshared understanding of these issues as they evolve.\nFundamentally, financial institutions themselves are responsible for providing\ninnovative financial services safely. Financial services firms must pair technological\nknow-how and innovative services with a strong compliance culture and a thorough\nknowledge of the important legal and compliance guardrails. While “run fast and break\nthings” may be a popular mantra in the technology space, it is ill-suited to an arena that\ndepends on trust and confidence. New entrants need to understand that the financial\narena is a carefully regulated space with a compelling rationale underlying the various\nrules at play, even if these are likely to evolve over time. There is more at stake in the\nrealm of financial services than in some other areas of technological innovation. There\nare more serious and lasting consequences for a consumer who gets, for instance, an\nunsustainable loan on his or her smartphone than for a consumer who downloads the\nwrong movie or listens to a bad podcast. At the same time, regulators may need to revisit\nprocesses designed for a brick-and-mortar world when approaching digital finance. To\nensure that fintech realizes its positive potential, regulators and firms alike should take a\nlong view, with thoughtful engagement on both sides.\nWhen we look back at times of financial crisis or missteps, we frequently find that\na key cause was elevating short-term profitability over long-term sustainability and\nconsumer welfare. It was not long ago that so-called exotic mortgages originally\n\n- 10 -\ndesigned for niche borrowers became increasingly marketed to low- and moderate-\nincome borrowers who could not sustain them, ultimately with disastrous results. In\naddition to the financial consequences for individual consumers, the drive for\nunsustainable profit can contribute to distrust in the financial system, which is\ndetrimental to the broader economy. It is critical that firms providing financial services\nconsider the long-term social benefit of the products and services they offer. Concerns\nregarding long-term sustainability are magnified in situations where banks may bear\ncredit or other longer-term operational risks related to products delivered by a fintech\nfirm. One useful question to ask is whether a product’s success depends on consumers\nmaking ill-informed choices; if so, or if the product otherwise fails to provide sufficient\nvalue to consumers, it is not going to be seen as responsible and may not prove\nsustainable over time.\nThe key challenge for regulatory agencies is to create the right balance.\nUltimately, regulators should be prepared to appropriately tailor regulatory or supervisory\nexpectations, to the extent possible within our respective authorities, to facilitate fintech\ninnovations that produce benefits for consumers, businesses, and the financial system. At\nthe same time, any contemplated adjustments must also appropriately manage\ncorresponding risks.\nFederal Reserve Fintech Engagement\nTo better understand technological changes in lending, payments, and other areas,\nthe Federal Reserve has been engaging with a wide range of market participants to\nunderstand barriers to socially beneficial innovations. Our unique structure, with Board\nand Reserve Bank staff in over 30 locations, allows us to tap expertise in markets and\n\n- 11 -\ninnovation centers across the country to help establish channels of communication,\nincluding with nonbank participants with whom we may not otherwise have regular\ncontact.\nThe Federal Reserve also engages in ongoing communication with other\nregulators to promote, to the greatest extent possible, consistency in approaches and\nalignment of supervisory requirements. Exchanging ideas and discussing fintech\ninnovations with other regulators is critical to understanding and vetting risks and, where\nappropriate, reaching consistent views regarding the application of laws, regulations, or\nguidance.\nFinally, we recognize the value of technical expertise. With fintech, as with any\nother emerging financial product or service, the Federal Reserve is learning as much as\nwe can to ensure that we have a robust understanding of the technologies and activities in\nwhich banks and other financial firms are engaging, and to inform the development of\nour policy and supervisory approaches. To that end, the Federal Reserve Board has\nestablished a multidisciplinary working group that is engaged in a 360-degree analysis of\nfintech innovation. We are bringing together the best thinking across the Federal Reserve\nSystem, spanning key areas of responsibility--from supervision to community\ndevelopment, from financial stability to payments--to assess the impact of technological\ndevelopment on the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities. As part of this effort, Federal\nReserve senior officials and staff have been closely watching developments in fintech,\nevaluating its impact on financial services delivery, and assessing the policy and\nsupervisory implications in this arena.\n\n- 12 -\nConclusion\nCurrent developments in the digitization of finance, including the establishment\nof new business models, are important and deserving of serious engagement on the part\nof policymakers and regulators. As policymakers, we want to facilitate innovation where\nit has the potential to yield broad social benefit, while ensuring that risks are thoroughly\nmanaged. In safeguarding the public interest, the first line of analysis and protection will\nalways rest with the market participants closest to the new technologies and product\ninnovations and to the organizations that consider adopting them. But regulators also\nshould seek to analyze the implications of technology developments through constructive\nand timely engagement. We should be attentive to the potential social benefits of these\nnew technologies, prepared to make the necessary regulatory adjustments if their safety\nand integrity are proven and their potential benefits found to be in the public interest, and\nvigilant to ensure risks are well understood and managed.",

The past year\nhas been marked by heartache and hardship, especially for vulnerable communities, as well as by\nthe resilience and extraordinary efforts of Americans everywhere, particularly those on the front\nlines. The past year has also seen determined efforts on the part of policymakers—public health,\nfiscal, and monetary—to do what is necessary and stay the course until we return to full\nstrength.1\nThese determined efforts have contributed to a considerably brighter economic outlook.\nA comparison between the median of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP) and the first projection following the onset of the\npandemic, in June of last year, highlights the improvement in the outlook. The change in the\nSEP median suggests an improvement in the projected level of gross domestic product of 6\npercent at the end of 2021 and 2022, a decline in the unemployment rate of 2 percentage points\nat the end of 2021 and 1-1/2 percentage points at the end of 2022, and an upward revision to the\nheadline inflation rate of 0.8 percentage point at the end of 2021 that narrows to a 0.3 percentage\npoint upward revision at the end of 2022.2 The expected improvements in the outlook reflect\nprogress on controlling the virus, nearly $3 trillion in additional fiscal support, and forceful and\ntimely support from monetary policy.\nAlthough the outlook has brightened considerably, the fog of uncertainty associated with\nthe virus has yet to lift completely, and current employment and inflation outcomes remain far\nfrom our goals. The focus on achieved outcomes rather than the anticipated outlook is central to\nthe Committee’s guidance regarding both asset purchases and the policy rate. The emphasis on\n1 I am grateful to Kurt Lewis of the Federal Reserve for his assistance in preparing this text. These are my own\nviews and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Both the June 2020 and the most recent SEP are available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 2 -\noutcomes rather than the outlook corresponds to the shift in our monetary policy approach that\nsuggests policy should be patient rather than preemptive at this stage in the recovery.\nOutcomes\nRecent data indicate that activity has picked up this year. After a dip in the final months\nof 2020, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) stepped up considerably so far this year, and\nspending on durable goods has been particularly strong. This pattern appears consistent with a\nquick spend-out from the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) stimulus checks at the turn of\nthe year, particularly among lower-income households that may have previously exhausted the\nfunds provided in the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act).3\nLike the spending data, the labor market data turned more positive in January and\nFebruary following weakness at the end of 2020. Although the unemployment rate has moved\ndown 1/2 a percentage point since December, the K-shaped labor market recovery remains\nuneven across racial groups, industries, and wage levels.4 The employment-to-population\n(EPOP) ratio for Black prime-age workers is 7.2 percentage points lower than for white workers,\nwhile the EPOP ratio is 6.2 percentage points lower for Hispanic workers than for white\nworkers—an increase in each gap of about 3 percentage points from pre-crisis lows in October\n2019.\n3 See, for example, the difference in high-frequency indicators of consumer spending between measures of total\nspending and spending in low-income Zip codes in the weeks following the payment of stimulus under the CAA.\nData are available from Opportunity Insights at https://www.tracktherecovery.org. For further discussion of\ndiffering spend-out of COVID stimulus payments for different levels of household wealth, see, for example, Ezra\nKarger and Aastha Rajan, “Heterogeneity in the Marginal Propensity to Consume: Evidence from COVID-19\nStimulus Payments,” Working Paper No 2020-15 (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, May, revised\nOctober), https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/working-papers/2020/2020-15.\n4 See Lael Brainard (2021), “Full Employment in the New Monetary Policy Framework,” speech delivered at the\nInaugural Mike McCracken Lecture on Full Employment, sponsored by the Canadian Association for Business\nEconomics (via webcast), January 13, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210113a.htm;\nand Lael Brainard (2021), “How Should We Think about Full Employment in the Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate?”\nspeech delivered at the Ec10, Principles of Economics, Lecture, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University,\nCambridge, Mass.

This sector accounts for more than 40 percent of the net decline in private payrolls since\nFebruary 2020. Overall, with 9.5 million fewer jobs than pre-COVID levels, we are far from our\nbroad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal.\nInflation similarly remains far from the goal of 2 percent inflation on average over time.\nBoth headline and core PCE inflation were below 2 percent on a 12-month basis throughout\n2020 and came in at 1.5 percent in January.\nFinally, while vaccinations are continuing at an accelerating pace, over two-thirds of the\nadult population have yet to receive their first dose, and there are risks from more contagious\nstrains of the virus, social-distancing fatigue, and vaccine hesitancy.6\nOutlook\nAs the economy reopens, the potential release of pent-up demand could drive stronger\ngrowth in 2021 than we have seen in decades. However, it is uncertain how much pent-up\nconsumption will be unleashed when social distancing completely lifts, and how much\nhousehold spending will result from the new stimulus and accumulated savings. With PCE\naccounting for roughly 70 percent of the economy, this uncertainty about consumption spending\ncontributes to uncertainty about activity, employment, and inflation.\n5 For more information on this analysis, see the box “Disparities in Job Loss during the Pandemic” in Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of Governors,\nFebruary), pp. 12–14, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20210219_mprfullreport.pdf.\n6 For more information, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker, which is available\nat https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker.\n\n- 4 -\nIn part, the outcome will hinge on distributive questions that are imperfectly understood.\nHouseholds accrued considerable additional savings that led to a $2.1 trillion increase in liquid\nassets by the end of last year.7 Higher-income households appear to have cut back on\ndiscretionary services spending over the past year and increased their purchases of durable\ngoods, which may see some satiation going forward. For moderate-income households that are\nnot cash constrained, it is possible there will be a lower near-term spend-out from the American\nRescue Plan payments relative to the CAA payments, given that less than 75 days elapsed\nbetween the two rounds of payments. Households whose cash flows were improved by the CAA\nstimulus may save more of the most recent stimulus for precautionary reasons. That said, there\nis upside risk if a substantial fraction of stimulus payments and accumulated savings are spent in\n2021 rather than more slowly over a longer time period.\nOn the other side, there is potential for some leakage abroad if, as anticipated, foreign\ndemand growth in some regions is weaker than in the United States. Imports soared during the\nsecond half of last year and grew further in January, even with worsening backlogs at U.S. ports.\nAs port congestion and supply chain bottlenecks ease, international spillovers could lead to some\nslippage between the increase in domestic demand and resource utilization, which has\nimplications for employment and inflation.\nIn the labor market, as vaccinations continue and social distancing eases, businesses in\nhard-hit services sectors will increase hiring, accelerating the pace at which workers find\nemployment. The strong and timely support from fiscal as well as monetary policy likely\n7 According to the Financial Accounts of the United States, liquid assets—defined as the sum of currency, checkable\nand time and saving deposits, and money market funds—increased by about $2.1 trillion from 2020:Q1 to 2020:Q4.\nThe 2020:Q4 release of the Financial Accounts of the United States is available on the Board’s website at:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1.\n\n- 5 -\nreduced the extent of scarring during the pandemic, which should aid the pace of hiring at in-\nperson services establishments once the virus is well controlled.\nThe speed of further improvement in the labor market following the initial rush of\nreopening is less clear, however. Some employers may be cautious about significantly\nincreasing payrolls before post-COVID consumption patterns are more firmly established.\nOthers may be implementing measures to stay lean and contain costs. In the December Duke\nCFO survey, roughly one-half of CFOs from large firms and about one-third of those from small\nfirms reported “using, or planning to use, automation or technology to reduce reliance on\nlabor.”8\nIn addition to greater use of technology, there is likely a significant amount of slack on\nthe participation and part-time margins. The EPOP ratio among workers ages 25 to 54 is still a\nfull 4 percentage points below its pre-COVID level, and the number of workers working part\ntime because they cannot find a full-time job is 1.7 million higher than pre-COVID.\nAlthough core and headline PCE inflation came in at 1.5 percent on a 12-month basis in\nJanuary, the well-anticipated base effects from price declines in March and April of last year will\ncause inflation to move above 2 percent in April and May. It also seems likely that a surge of\ndemand may be met by some transitory supply bottlenecks amid a rapid reopening of the\neconomy, leading PCE inflation to rise somewhat above 2 percent on a transitory basis by the\nend of 2021.\nEntrenched inflation dynamics are likely to take over following the transitory pressures\nassociated with reopening. Underlying trend inflation has been running persistently below 2\n8 Details on the CFO survey, which is a partnership of Duke University, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, can be found on the Richmond Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.richmondfed.org/research/national_economy/cfo_survey.\n\n- 6 -\npercent for many years.9 In addition, research suggests that although increasing labor market\ntightness may show through to wage inflation, the pass-through to price inflation has become\nhighly attenuated.10 These results suggest that businesses tend to respond to increased labor\ncosts by reducing margins rather than increasing prices later in the cycle. Thus, as resource\nutilization continues to tighten over coming years, recent decades provide little evidence to\nsuggest there will be a material nonlinear effect on price inflation.\nPolicy\nThe FOMC has communicated its reaction function under the new framework and\nprovided powerful forward guidance that is conditioned on employment and inflation outcomes.\nThis approach implies resolute patience while the gap closes between current conditions and the\nmaximum-employment and average inflation outcomes in the guidance.\nBy focusing on eliminating shortfalls from maximum employment rather than deviations\nin either direction and on the achievement of inflation that averages 2 percent over time,\nmonetary policy can take a patient approach rather than a preemptive approach. The preemptive\napproach that calls for a reduction of accommodation when the unemployment rate nears\nestimates of its neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation risks an unwarranted loss of\nopportunity for many of the most economically vulnerable Americans and entrenching inflation\n9 Statistical models estimate that underlying core PCE inflation ranges from one- to four-tenths of 1 percentage point\nbelow the 2 percent longer-run target. See the point estimates for 2019:Q2 in table 1 in Jeremy B. Rudd (2020),\n“Underlying Inflation: Its Measurement and Significance,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, September 18), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/underlying-\ninflation-its-measurement-and-significance-20200918.htm.\n10 See, for example, slide 5 of Ekaterina Peneva (2019) “It’s All about the Labor Market,” presentation at the\nBrookings Institution (Washington: Brookings, October 3), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Ekaterina-Peneva.pdf.

This shift is suggested by a comparison of\nthe surveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York in the most recently available surveys, in January 2021, and under the prior policy\nframework, in March 2015. In the January 2021 surveys, the median respondent expected the\nunemployment rate to be a bit below 4 percent at the time of liftoff, as compared with 5.3 percent\nin the March 2015 surveys. Similarly, in the January 2021 surveys, the median respondent\nexpected a 12-month headline PCE inflation rate of 2.2 to 2.3 percent at the time of liftoff, as\ncompared to roughly 0.5 percent in the March 2015 surveys. The most recently available\nsurveys suggest that market participants expect policy to look through the rolling off of base\neffects as well as possible transitory price increases due to short-term supply-demand\nimbalances.\nThe FOMC has stated that in order to anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent, it seeks\nto achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This language recognizes that the public’s\nexpectations of inflation are linked to the experience of inflation outcomes. In the nine years\nsince the Committee formally defined price stability as annual PCE inflation of 2 percent, the\naverage 12-month PCE inflation reading has been 1.4 percent. Persistently low inflation creates\n11 See Stephanie R. Aaronson, Mary C. Daly, William L. Wascher, and David W.

These indicators include survey and market-\nbased measures, along with composite measures like the staff’s Index of Common Inflation\nExpectations.13 Survey measures have picked up a little but remain around pre-COVID levels.\nMeanwhile, five- and 10-year TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)-based measures of\ninflation compensation have moved up almost 1 percentage point since last summer and are now\nat levels last seen in 2013 and 2014. These changes likely reflect both the improvement in the\nanticipated outlook and market participants’ understanding of the Committee’s new reaction\nfunction.14\nThe overall price-stability objective of achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over\ntime provides an important guidepost for assessing the path of inflation.

By taking a patient\napproach based on outcomes rather than a preemptive approach based on the outlook, policy will\nbe more effective in achieving broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and inflation\nthat averages 2 percent over time. The combination of patient monetary policy, together with\naccelerating progress on vaccinations and substantial fiscal stimulus, should support a strong and\ninclusive recovery as the economy reopens fully.\n15 For instance, even with the strongest SEP inflation projection since the Committee established its 2 percent\ninflation objective, the median projection from the current SEP is not quite strong enough to generate inflation that\naverages 2 percent from the time the federal funds rate moved to the lower bound through the end of the forecast\nhorizon, which is a key consideration under a Temporary Price Level Targeting framework.

I am delighted to be here in Denver for a few days to visit with\ncommunity leaders working to support affordable housing, workforce development, and\nsmall businesses across the Mile High City. So far, I have had a chance to hear firsthand\nabout the housing affordability challenges facing many Denver families, which are\nrequiring some families to make difficult choices between paying rent and paying for\nother necessities, and the associated challenges of homelessness. I have also had the\nopportunity to see the incredible work underway in Denver to ensure that individuals and\nfamilies in need have access to safe, affordable shelter and the healthcare and case\nmanagement services they need to get back on their feet.\nNot only is Denver’s approach to service delivery a national model, but your use\nof Social Impact Bonds to fund those programs is also at the forefront of innovation in\nthe community development sector. I can see there is a lot of pride in what you are\naccomplishing locally, and I look forward to seeing more groundbreaking work during\nthe remainder of my time here.\nEvery few months, I try to make a visit such as this one to better understand how\ndifferent communities across the country are experiencing the economy. Promoting\ncommunity development is one of the key purposes and functions of the Federal Reserve,\nand it requires that we have a strong understanding of the impacts of financial policies\nand practices in communities in all of our Districts.1\nI have heard about the important role the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)\nhas played in strengthening community investment, so I am happy to have this\nopportunity to learn about your perspectives, as bankers here in Denver, on opportunities\n1 See The Federal Reserve System Purposes & Functions at www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/pf.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nfor further improvement. This roundtable is the first of several that the Federal Reserve\nSystem will host in the next several months to hear directly from bankers, community\nmembers, practitioners, researchers, and others about improving the CRA’s effectiveness\nin making credit available to lower-income areas. We are inviting representatives of\nother banking regulatory agencies to join us so that we can all benefit from learning from\ndifferent local experiences with the CRA. Our hosts at the Reserve Banks will be taking\nnotes, and a summary of the findings from this outreach initiative will be made public.\nBefore we get started, I want to say a few words about the interagency process for\nrevising CRA regulations and the Federal Reserve’s priorities. As you know, the Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency recently published an Advance Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking (ANPR) to solicit public comment on a variety of questions related to\nrevising CRA regulations. Comments are due by November 19.\nLast week, the Board heard from members of the Fed’s Community Advisory\nCouncil that there may be some confusion about commenting on the ANPR because it\nwas not published on an interagency basis. Even though the Federal Reserve did not join\nin the publication of the ANPR, we will be reading the comment letters in anticipation of\nworking with the Comptroller and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on a joint\nproposal. We understand the importance of having the agencies work toward one set of\nCRA regulations that are clear and consistently applied and will do everything we can to\nmake that possible. CRA regulations are complicated, and the regulators will benefit\nfrom perspectives from a variety of channels, so I encourage you all to submit comments.\nThe CRA is too important to the financial well-being of communities across this country\nfor banks and community members to disengage in any part of this process.\n\n- 3 -\nThe CRA has not only made more credit available in lower-income areas, but it\nhas also helped to create a valuable community and economic development\ninfrastructure. Revising the regulations will require careful consideration in order to\nstrengthen that infrastructure. All of the agencies share the stated purpose of revising the\nregulations, which is to promote more, not less, CRA activity in underserved areas, as the\nComptroller stated in recent testimony.2 Properly balancing the goals of simplifying and\nclarifying the regulations, with the goal of promoting more CRA activity through\nstronger local community engagement, will require careful consideration.\nI want to emphasize the Board’s commitment to regulatory revisions that\nstrengthen the CRA’s purpose, which is to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs\nof the communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. In that regard, there are a few principles that will guide our work.\nFirst, we should update the area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA\nactivities while retaining the core focus on place. I look forward to hearing your\nsuggestions about how we can broaden our evaluation of banks’ CRA performances to\ntake into account the technological advances that have made it possible for banks to serve\ncustomers remotely, while retaining the focus on local credit needs that vary from place\nto place. The Federal Reserve’s research, surveys, and outreach point to an economy that\nis very strong on an aggregate level but significantly more varied at the community level,\nwith many neighborhoods still struggling.\nSecond, the CRA regulations should be tailored to banks of different sizes and\nbusiness models. Currently, the evaluation methods are tailored to banks of different\n2 U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n- 4 -\nsizes and business models. We should consider whether assessment areas also should be\ntailored to the business models employed by banks.\nThird, any redesign of CRA regulations should be done with the goal of\nencouraging banks to seek out opportunities in underserved areas. This is not simply a\nquestion of expanding a bank’s assessment area, but of providing more incentives for\nbanks to more effectively address the needs in neighborhoods that they may already be\nserving with branches. For example, there are concerns that distortions may lead some\nareas to become credit hot spots, while others become credit deserts. Investments, such\nas Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, are in such high demand in some areas that there is\nlittle return on investment, while it is difficult to find investors in other areas. We believe\nthat it is important for revisions to CRA regulations to address this type of market\ndistortion to promote more lending and investment in smaller markets within a bank’s\nfootprint.\nFourth, the Federal Reserve is interested in promoting greater consistency and\npredictability in CRA evaluations and ratings. We see the value of clearer definitions and\nmetrics that use publicly available information to identify local credit needs and\nopportunities.\nFinally, it is important to recognize that the CRA is one of several mutually\nreinforcing laws. The central thrust of the CRA is to encourage banks to ensure that all\ncreditworthy borrowers have fair access to credit. For banks to be successful in meeting\nthe credit needs of their entire community, it has long been recognized that they must\nguard against discriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices.\n\n- 5 -\nWith these principles in mind, I look forward to hearing your ideas on how we\ncan make the CRA a more effective tool for bringing credit and capital to underserved\ncommunities.",

I want to thank my colleague, Loretta Mester,\nfor inviting me to participate today, and it is a pleasure to participate in the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland’s Policy Summit.1\nToday’s session is part of a series called Fed Listens. The Federal Reserve is\nreaching out to communities around the country to hear how Americans are experiencing\nthe economy day to day and to make sure we are carrying out the monetary policy goals\nassigned to us by the Congress in the most effective way we can.2\nThe Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve\nmaximum employment and price stability. These two goals are what we refer to as our\ndual mandate. By price stability, we mean moderate and stable inflation. The Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC)—the group at the Fed responsible for determining\nmonetary policy—has announced that our goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent over\ntime. The maximum-employment part of our dual mandate means that the Congress has\ndirected us to achieve the highest level of employment that is consistent with\nprice stability.\nThe Outlook\nEarlier this week, President Mester and I participated in the meeting of the\nFOMC, where we had the opportunity to share our views on the economy and policy.\n1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text. These\nremarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Richard H. Clarida (2019), “The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools,\nand Communication Practices,” speech delivered at the 2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by\nthe Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New\nYork, February 22, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20190222a.htm; and Jerome\nH. Powell (2019), “Monetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead,” speech delivered at the 2019\nSIEPR Economic Summit, Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research, Stanford, California, March 8,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190308a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nMy own assessment is that the most likely path for the economy remains solid. The latest\ndata suggest that consumer spending is robust, and consumer confidence is high.\nAlthough the pace of payroll gains has moderated recently, unemployment is at a 50-year\nlow, wages are growing, participation in the labor force has expanded, and\nunemployment insurance claims are at cycle lows. Despite recent volatility, financial\nconditions overall remain supportive.\nRecent weeks, however, have seen important downside risks. Crosscurrents from\npolicy uncertainty have risen since early May, crimping business investment plans,\nraising concerns in some financial market segments, and weighing on global growth\nprospects. Foreign authorities are seeking additional policy space to address growth and\ninflation shortfalls. In addition, recent indicators of inflation and inflation expectations\nhave been disappointing, making it all the more important to sustain the economy’s\nmomentum.\nThe downside risks, if they materialize, could weigh on economic activity. Basic\nprinciples of risk management in a low neutral rate environment with compressed\nconventional policy space would argue for softening the expected path of policy when\nrisks shift to the downside.3\nOur Review\nWith recent indicators suggesting the expansion is continuing at a solid pace and\nunemployment at a 50-year low, inflation has not yet moved to our goal on a sustained\n3\nOne reason for caution is the risk of building financial market imbalances, such as currently elevated\nlevels of risky corporate debt. In my view, it is better to address such financial imbalances by activation of\nour countercyclical capital buffer, rigorous use of stress tests, and beefed-up monitoring of leveraged\nlending than by monetary policy.\n\n- 3 -\nbasis. In many ways, that can be viewed as an opportunity, with the sustained expansion\nproviding critical job opportunities to a broader set of applicants. In parallel, it is also\nvital that a central bank meets its inflation target on a sustained basis, which will provide\nmore capacity to buffer the economy if it encounters headwinds.\nWe are undertaking our review to ensure we are well positioned to meet our goals\nfor many years to come, especially in light of the way the economy is changing, which I\nhave been referring to as the “new normal.”4 There are a few key features of that new\nnormal. First, interest rates have stayed very low in recent years in the United States and\nin many other advanced economies, and it seems likely that equilibrium interest rates will\nremain low in the future. Low interest rates present a challenge for traditional monetary\npolicy in recessions. In the past, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates 4 to 5\npercentage points in order to support household spending and business investment.\nHowever, when equilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates\nand less room to buffer the economy using our conventional tool.\nAnother big change in the economy is that inflation does not move as much with\neconomic activity and employment as it has in the past, which is what economists mean\nwhen they say the Phillips curve is very flat. A flat Phillips curve has important\nadvantages: The labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers who may have\nbeen sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation,\nunlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s.\n4 See Lael Brainard (2016), “The ‘New Normal’ and What It Means for Monetary Policy,” speech delivered\nat the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Chicago, Illinois, September 12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20160912a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nOn the other hand, today’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack, along with the\nlimited ability to cut interest rates in a recession, means it can be more difficult to achieve\nour 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis. The limited ability to cut interest\nrates could provide less ability to buffer the economy in a downturn, while the very flat\nPhillips curve could make it harder to boost inflation during an expansion. And that\ncould further compress policy space in a negative spiral.\nAs we have seen in other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the\ncentral bank’s objective, consumers, workers, and businesses start to expect lower\ninflation to continue. Expectations of low inflation can create a self-fulfilling dynamic\nwith actual inflation, making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation.\nAnd because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates, that, in turn, can reduce the\namount of policy space the central bank has available to prevent the economy from\nslipping into recession. In fact, in recent years, central banks around the world have had\nto use a larger variety of policy tools than they have traditionally used to support the\nrecovery.\nSome Issues to Explore\nGiven the new normal of low equilibrium interest rates and low sensitivity of\ninflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here\nand around the world, with a view to identifying the best ways to promote the goals the\nCongress assigned to us. Earlier this month, we held a conference in Chicago where we\nheard from experts as well as community organizations, small businesses, labor\norganizations, and retirees. We are looking at our tools and strategies, assessing not just\n\n- 5 -\nthe various approaches that were undertaken, but also approaches that have been\nproposed but not tried.\nOne of the ideas discussed in Chicago is that the Federal Reserve should\nexplicitly promise to “make up” for misses on inflation during a downturn. The Federal\nReserve could hold interest rates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by promising not\nto raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached particular\nlevels.5 A related idea discussed in Chicago is average inflation targeting, meaning the\nFederal Reserve would aim to achieve its inflation objective, on average, over a longer\nperiod of time—perhaps over the business cycle.6 This approach could also have aspects\nof a makeup policy, depending on how it is designed. While such approaches sound\nquite appealing on their face, they have not yet been implemented in practice. There is\nsome skepticism that a central bank would in fact prove able to support above-target\ninflation over a sustained period without becoming concerned that inflation might\naccelerate, and inflation expectations might rise too high.\nAt the Chicago conference, we also heard how difficult it can be to estimate with\nany precision the “maximum employment” leg of our dual mandate.7 There is no fixed\ndestination point for maximum employment—no single number where we can be sure we\n5 See Sharon Kozicki (2019), “Monetary Policy Strategies for the Federal Reserve: Discussion of Practical\nConsiderations,” presentation at the Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications\nPractices, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, June 5,\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/others/events/2019/monetary-policy-conference/2-kozicki-comments-\nstrategies-pdf.pdf.\n6 See Lars E.O.

Abraham and John C. Haltiwanger (2019), “How Tight is the Labor Market?” paper\nprepared for the Conference on Monetary Policy Strategies, Tools, and Communications Practices, Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago, June 5, https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/others/events/2019/monetary-\npolicy-conference/how-tight-labor-market-abraham-haltiwanger-pdf.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nare “there.” Maximum employment is something that we must learn about by seeing how\nthe job market is operating. That is very different from the longer-run level of inflation,\nwhich central banks are presumed able to determine over time.\nAt our conference in Chicago, we also asked the panelists about our\ncommunications with the public, and the responses were humbling. The Federal Reserve\ncommunicates with the public about monetary policy through a variety of channels. At\neach of our policy-setting meetings, the FOMC issues a statement, and Chair Jerome\nPowell holds a press conference. Three weeks after the meeting, the minutes of the\nmeeting are published. Twice a year, the Federal Reserve submits a Monetary Policy\nReport to the Congress.\nWe heard in Chicago that most members of the public care a lot about the job\nmarket and the cost of credit, but they are not aware of our communications about\nmonetary policy.8 Of course, the media plays an important role in communicating our\nmonetary policy actions and how they affect the economy.

Four years ago, the Treasury “flash rally” served as a wake-up\ncall for regulators and market participants alike that the structure of the Treasury market\nhad changed radically from the conventional view. Since the surprising sharp spike in\nTreasury prices on October 15, 2014, the public sector has devoted significant effort and\nresources to monitoring the ongoing changes in the Treasury market. The interagency\nworking group’s (IAWG) Joint Staff Report on the events of October 15, the Treasury\nDepartment’s request for information on the report’s recommendations, and the\nsubsequent collection of transactions data by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\n(FINRA) through its Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) system have\noffered us a much better understanding of this market.1\nBut the market is not resting, and neither can we. Even in the past year, much has\nchanged in the Treasury market, and technology is continuing to drive rapid\ntransformation in the competitive landscape. I would like to talk about the changes we\nare seeing, what we are learning from the TRACE data, and emerging developments that\nare important to monitor. In particular, I want to highlight an initiative that the Federal\nReserve is considering to expand the public sector’s access to transactions data in order to\nhelp ensure the IAWG is able to keep up with the market.\n1 I am grateful to David Bowman, Dobrislav Dobrev, Peter Johansson, and Michael Puglia for assistance in\npreparing these remarks. These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those\nof the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nStill Changing\nAt the first Treasury conference in 2015, market participants were still processing\nthe results of the Joint Staff Report.2 It came as a surprise to many that the high-\nfrequency trading activity conducted by “proprietary trading firms,” or PTFs, accounted\nfor a majority of trading in the interdealer platforms that are so central to the Treasury\nmarket. Indeed, the names of the largest proprietary trading firms were new even to\nsome seasoned professionals. At that time, the discussion often drew a very bright line\nbetween traditional dealers and proprietary trading firms and, in particular, the trading\nactivities associated with each.\nThe distinction between broker-dealers and proprietary trading firms remains\nimportant today with regard to why they are trading, but less and less with regard to how\nthey are trading. Now, as then, broker-dealers intermediate financial transactions\nprimarily to serve their clients’ needs, and, for this reason, they are required to register\nwith FINRA. Conversely, the hallmark of proprietary trading firm activity was and still\nis high-frequency proprietary trading. Proprietary trading firms trade for their own\naccount rather than that of a client, which places them outside of FINRA’s jurisdiction\nand many other forms of oversight. This distinction remains important today.\nBut the distinction in how broker-dealers and proprietary trading firms trade was\nalready starting to blur by the time of the first conference. For example, some of the\nlarger dealers had already invested heavily in electronic trading systems by 2015. Since\n2 See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission (2015), Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014\n(Washington: Treasury, Board of Governors, FRBNY, SEC, and CFTC, July),\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-\n2015.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nthat time, the distinctions have blurred considerably further. Almost all midsize and large\ndealers now possess autoquoting capabilities and deploy them on Treasury trading\nplatforms. Several primary dealers have even entered direct partnerships with proprietary\ntrading firms, effectively outsourcing some parts of their market-making operations.\nThe evolution of the dealer business model to incorporate advanced technology is\nnot limited only to trading activity. A number of developers of emerging financial\ntechnologies, or fintech, have arisen in recent years to provide dealers and other market\nparticipants with back-office tools that reduce costs by automating routine processes,\nstreamlining regulatory reporting, and more efficiently allocating capital, collateral, and\nmargin among competing uses. On the front end, dealers are increasingly offering their\ncustomers web-based research and analytic tools, trading and execution engines, and\neven apps that allow clients access to internal software for pricing and structuring\ntransactions.\nThe landscape for proprietary trading firms has changed considerably in recent\nyears, too. Since 2015, we have witnessed the first initial public offering by a proprietary\ntrading firm, as well as a few high-profile mergers and acquisitions.3 The industry is\ncontending with declining revenue growth and diminished returns by expanding\noperations into new asset classes and geographies. Proprietary trading firms are also\nadapting in other ways. Some have begun to offer broker-dealer services themselves or\nappear to be contemplating such a business model change. Still others have entered joint\n3 These developments include the mergers and acquisitions between Virtu and KCG and between Teza and\nQuantlab. See CNBC (2017), “Trading Firm Virtu Financial to Buy KCG for about $1.4 Billion,” CNBC,\nApril 20, https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/20/two-high-speed-trading-firms-merge-in-1-4-billion-deal.html;\nand Gregory Meyer (2017), “Teza Sells High-Speed Trading as Lucrative Business Sours,” Financial\nTimes, March 21.\n\n- 4 -\nventures with one another to finance new investment in faster microwave\ncommunications and defray the high costs of that infrastructure.4 Third-party providers\nare also offering high-speed links to firms that wish to engage in high-frequency trading\nwithout investing directly in microwave tower infrastructure.\nWe have seen important recent changes among infrastructure providers as well.\nCME Group’s acquisition of NEX and the BrokerTec platform has recently been\nfinalized, with direct implications for the structure of the Treasury market.5 We have\nalso witnessed the conclusion of J.P. Morgan’s exit from broker-dealer settlement\nservices in the triparty Treasury repo market and the transition to BNY Mellon\nGovernment Securities Services Corp. as a subsidiary offering Treasury market\nsettlement services. Beyond these changes, some new trading platforms are\nexperimenting with the very structure of the market.6 These platforms are promoting\nnew trading models such as all-to-all trading, in which many buy-side and sell-side\nparticipants transact directly, and direct streaming, in which live continuous, executable\nprices are delivered electronically under bilaterally or multilaterally negotiated terms.\nThese services can potentially bridge all of the venues of the Treasury market, connecting\nnot just dealers and proprietary trading firms, but also those entities with buy-side clients.\nAnd, finally, the macroeconomic landscape has undergone some significant\nchanges that have important implications for the Treasury market. At the time of the\nflash rally in October 2014, the Federal Reserve was still actively purchasing Treasury\n4 One example is the Go West Consortium. See Gregory Meyer, Nicole Bullock, and Joe Rennison (2018),\n“How High-Frequency Trading Hit a Speed Bump,” Financial Times, January 1.\n5 See CMG Group (2018), “CME Group Completes Acquisition of NEX, Creating a Leading Global\nMarkets Company across Futures, Cash and OTC,” press release, November 2,\nhttps://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-\nreleases/2018/11/02/cme_group_completesacquisitionofnexcreatingaleadingglobalmarkets.html.\n6 LiquidityEdge and OpenDoor, LLC, are two examples of trading platforms offering new models.\n\n- 5 -\nsecurities, and the federal funds rate was still at the effective lower bound. With the\neconomy now at or beyond full employment and inflation around target, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee has since gradually increased its target for the federal funds rate\nto between 2 and 2-1/4 percent, and normalization of the balance sheet is well under way.\nSince October 2017, the portfolio of the System Open Market Account has decreased in\nsize from $4.2 trillion to about $3.9 trillion.\nWhat Have We Learned So Far?\nAgainst this changed backdrop and with more than a year’s worth of information\nfrom the TRACE data available, it is a good time to ask what we have learned since the\ninitial market event and what questions remain. First, the initiation of policy\nnormalization and the ongoing reduction of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet do not\nappear to have sparked a deterioration in Treasury market liquidity. Standard metrics\nsuch as bid-ask spreads have not materially changed for benchmark securities since 2014.\nMarket functioning has also been orderly during a number of recent events that were\ncharacterized by high trading volume and elevated price volatility, such as in early\nFebruary of this year.\nSecond, some segments of the market seem much more active than observers may\nhave feared before the collection of TRACE data. In particular, according to the TRACE\ndata as shown in figure 1, off-the-run trading accounts for 27 percent of overall trading\nvolume, while deep off-the-run notes and bonds--seasoned securities older than the first\nor second off-the-run--account for 14 percent of all coupon activity.7 Likewise, the data\n7 See Doug Brain, Michiel De Pooter, Dobrislav Dobrev, Michael Fleming, Peter Johansson, Frank Keane,\nMichael Puglia, Tony Rodrigues, and Or Shachar (2018). \"Breaking Down TRACE Volumes Further,\"\nFEDS Notes. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 29, 2018,\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2299.\n\n- 6 -\nshow that Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) trade in significant volumes as\nwell.\nDue to the TRACE data, we are now able to measure with reasonable precision\nthe transaction volumes in these securities. Off-the-run and TIPS activity is largely\nconcentrated in the dealer-to-client (DTC) and voice venues of the market, segments into\nwhich the public sector had only limited insight before the TRACE data. While\nsubstantial analysis with respect to pricing and liquidity remains to be done in these\nmarket segments, the early results allow us to conclude that these securities do trade in\nmeaningful amounts.\nThird, although there was speculation that proprietary trading firms had already\neclipsed bank dealers in benchmark Treasury trading or would come to threaten the\ndealer business model more broadly, neither has occurred.8 Based on the TRACE data,\nas shown in figure 2, we can now state with a reasonable amount of confidence that\ndealers generally--and primary dealers particularly--still intermediate the majority of\nactivity in all Treasury securities.9 In the market for Treasury bills in particular, primary\ndealers play an important role in allocating issuance to investors. This can be seen where\nmost activity in bills occurs, as shown in figure 3, which depicts the share of trading\nvolume of bills in the DTC, interdealer broker (IDB), and interdealer segments of the\n8 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2015), “Conference Summary: The Evolving Structure of the\nU.S. Treasury Market (October 20-21, 2015),”\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/newsevents/events/markets/2015/Conference-\nSummary.pdf.\n9 TRACE data do not currently identify PTF firms. We estimate the activity by assuming PTFs account for\n92 percent of nondealer trading volume on the electronic and automated interdealer brokers, which is the\nshare of nondealer activity accounted for by PTFs on electronic IDBs reported in the Joint Staff Report\nfrom 2014. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved a rule change proposed by\nFINRA to require some reporters in TRACE to identify non-FINRA member activity. Once in effect, this\nchange will enhance regulators’ ability to identify trades with PTFs on IDBs and to more accurately\nidentify the share of overall trading activity attributable to PTFs.\n\n- 7 -\nmarket. Federal Reserve staff analysis of the TRACE data reveals that nearly three-\nfourths of total trading volume of bills is in the DTC market, where dealers are, of course,\nthe main intermediary. From this and other analysis, there is substantial evidence that the\ndealer business model plays a central role in this market and will continue to do so into\nthe future.10\nThat said, proprietary trading firms do occupy an important space in the Treasury\nmarket alongside dealers, and it is clear that they, too, are here to stay. When it comes to\nareas where speed is paramount--for instance, in trading across and between asset classes\nand trading venues--proprietary trading firms are deploying technology and infrastructure\nin ways that are having lasting effects. This is evident in the Treasury market in the\nintervals following economic data releases. Again turning to the TRACE data, we see in\nfigure 4 a depiction of average trading volumes of all Treasury securities across five-\nminute intervals on days in which the Employment Situation report, gross domestic\nproduct data, or consumer price index data are announced. The TRACE volume data\nindicate that the immediate surge in trading activity following these announcements\noccurs mainly in the electronic IDB venue, where proprietary trading firms dominate.\nIn short, the TRACE data are enabling us to put some old puzzles to rest. Our\nanalysis makes clear that the Treasury market has adapted well to the post-crisis\nregulatory regime, the normalization of monetary policy, and technological changes in\ntrading processes, and that both broker-dealers and proprietary trading firms play\nimportant, often complementary, roles in the market structure that has emerged.\n10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), Supervision and Regulation Report\n(Washington: Board of Governors, November), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2018-\nnovember-supervision-and-regulation-report-preface.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nLooking Ahead\nOf course, the structure of the Treasury market will continue to evolve, along with\nchanges in technology and the broader financial environment. Looking forward, we will\nneed to ask more of the data as we seek to understand what is next for the structure of the\nTreasury market. As I mentioned earlier, experimentation with new protocols is\noccurring now. Although all-to-all trading in the Treasury market was contemplated at\nthe first conference, direct streaming largely was not, which might prompt us to ask what\nelse is on the horizon.\nIn addition to direct streaming, another development that bears watching is the\nbatch auction platforms that have arisen in the voice IDB market, something that has not\nreceived as much attention from market participants. Started after the financial crisis,\nbatch auctions are now conducted by a number of IDB firms at regular intervals\nthroughout the trading day. Like any closed auction, the IDB collects anonymous bids\nand offers for a specific security in specific amounts during a relatively short window of\ntime, generally on the order of a few minutes. After the batch auction closes, the orders\nare matched, and participants are notified of their awards.11 Figure 5, based on TRACE\ndata, depicts average trading volumes of TIPS securities in the IDB venue of the market\nacross five-minute intervals. As you can see, the level of activity rises significantly at\nintervals, which correspond to the timing of the auctions. While it is not a large part of\nthe overall market, this activity appears to be an important innovation for segments often\ndeemed to be less liquid--in particular, for off-the-run and TIPS trading on voice IDBs.\n11 Note that these auctions differ from proposed high-frequency batch auctions in that they are held at much\nless frequent intervals, typically separated by hours and, in some cases, occurring only once a day or a\nweek.\n\n- 9 -\nBefore the collection of the TRACE data, there was limited insight into this area of the\nmarket, which made it difficult to assess the significance of such innovations.\nNo doubt there are other innovations that have yet to be assessed. Recently, the\ndebate over liquidity has turned toward the participation of proprietary trading firms in\nthe off-the-run segment of the market, an area outside of their traditional domain. All-to-\nall and direct-streaming platforms are also attempting to establish a foothold in the off-\nthe-run segment by offering new services. I look forward to further analysis as the\nstructure of the market continues to evolve.\nKeeping Up\nAs the Treasury market has evolved, the public sector has had to evolve as well in\norder to keep up. Many of the recommendations in the Joint Staff Report have now been\nimplemented. Our colleagues at Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and\nFINRA deserve credit for the work to begin collecting Treasury transaction data on\nFINRA’s TRACE system. My hope is that you will take away from my remarks, along\nwith those of my colleagues from other agencies, a comprehensive picture of how all of\nthe IAWG agencies are using the data to work through the many issues that intersect with\nour various policy missions and mandates.\nAs the market continues to innovate and the broader financial environment\ncontinues to shift, we will maintain our focus on the resilience of the Treasury market\nspecifically and the financial system more broadly.12 In this regard, the staff at the\nFederal Reserve continues to work on important issues raised by the events of October\n12 Flash events that have occurred in recent years include, but are not limited to, the first “flash crash” in\nU.S. equity markets on May 6, 2010; the Treasury flash rally of October 15, 2014, the flash event in U.S.\nequity markets on August 24, 2015; the pound flash crash on October 7, 2016; and the turbulence in U.S.\nequity and VIX markets on February 5, 2018.\n\n- 10 -\n15, 2014. Markets have been able to weather several episodes of short-lived market\nturbulence well in the past few years. But the fact that sharp market movements--some\non the order of seven or eight standard deviations outside the norm--can occur even in the\nabsence of clear news drivers remains a concern and highlights the potential risks to\nfinancial stability posed by the high-speed transmission of price and liquidity shocks\nacross multiple markets and trading venues.\nThe TRACE data now allow us to monitor events when equity and bond markets\nmove sharply. For instance, take the turbulence in equity and bond markets on February\n5, 2018. While trading volumes in both the electronic IDB and DTC market segments\nwere markedly higher than average, some metrics of liquidity, such as market depth near\nthe top of the order book on major electronic IDB platforms, deteriorated and remained\nlow through the week. The pattern of a spike in trading volumes followed by a persistent\ndecline in market depth has been characteristic of three recent market turmoil episodes:\n(1) the Treasury flash rally on October 15, 2014; (2) the flash crash in the British pound\non October 7, 2016; and (3) the spike in the VIX on February 5, 2018.13 Figure 6 shows\nthis pattern for February 5, 2018. These seemingly contradictory dynamics are easier to\nreconcile if the prevalent role played by high-speed electronic trading in the Treasury\nmarket is taken into account, particularly under stressed conditions. As previously noted\nin the Joint Staff Report, high-speed market makers are able to manage perceived risks\nfrom sudden adverse price moves by greatly reducing the sizes of orders placed on\nelectronic execution venues while, at the same time, increasing order placement rates as\n13 See also Ernst Schaumburg and Ron Yang (2015), “Liquidity during Flash Events,” Federal Reserve\nBank of New York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), August 18,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/08/liquidity-during-flash-events.html.\n\n- 11 -\nmuch as needed to accommodate increased trading volumes without the need to widen\nbid-ask spreads.\nThat said, the ability of high-speed market makers to nearly simultaneously adjust\nliquidity provision across multiple closely linked markets can create potential challenges\nfor large institutional investors seeking to reliably aggregate posted liquidity among\notherwise distinct trading venues.14 The dynamic nature of liquidity provision by high-\nspeed market makers makes static measures of liquidity, such as posted bid-ask spreads\nand market depth, less useful. For the purposes of improving our assessment of financial\nstability, it is therefore necessary to look for alternative ways of gauging liquidity and\ntransaction costs in these markets. For example, measures such as implementation\nshortfall aim to account directly for the difference between the original decision price and\nthe final execution price for a trade split into multiple smaller transactions.15 As IAWG\nstaff members continue to refine the TRACE data to assess market resilience more\naccurately in light of changes in structure and speed, it will be important to incorporate\nalternative measures of liquidity and transaction costs.\nSeparately, the increased role of managed funds is also having an effect on the\nTreasury market. TRACE data can help us keep up with that development as well. As in\nother asset classes, 3 p.m. has become an important liquidity point during the trading day\nfor Treasury securities. There is a regular spike in trading activity around 3 p.m., as can\nbe seen in figure 7, which depicts average trading volumes across five-minute intervals.\n14 See Dobrislav Dobrev and Ernst Schaumburg (2015), “The Liquidity Mirage,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), October 9,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/10/the-liquidity-mirage-.html.\n15 See Bank for International Settlements, Markets Committee (2018), Monitoring of Fast-Paced Electronic\nMarkets (Basel, Switzerland: BIS, September), https://www.bis.org/publ/mktc10.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nFederal Reserve staff analysis reveals that the 3 p.m. spike in trading volumes tends to be\nfairly evenly divided between the DTC and IDB market segments, suggesting that both\ndealers and proprietary trading firms play an important role during this narrow window of\nactivity. In the DTC market, the increase around 3 p.m. would be consistent with trading\nrelated to mutual fund daily and end-of-month portfolio rebalancing. In the electronic\nIDB market, the increase around 3 p.m. would be consistent with the increased role of\nproprietary trading firms in intraday intermediation and the possible closeout of positions\ntoward the end of the main part of the trading day. From a market resilience perspective,\nit would be valuable to analyze these systematic intraday spikes in trading volumes,\nparticularly as they may influence price formation and liquidity provision in the Treasury\nmarket.\nThe large spike in flows toward the end of the trading day points to a financial\nstability consideration that is worth flagging. The Treasury Market Practices Group\n(TMPG) has done valuable work in mapping out clearing and settlement patterns in the\nTreasury market. One issue that this analysis highlights is the currently limited potential\nfor same day, or T+0, settlement on transactions conducted near the end of the day. The\nflash events we have seen in the Treasury market so far have occurred early enough in the\nday to allow time for prices to recover before market close, and they have not been\naccompanied by any participant’s failure to perform, let alone a major participant,\nplatform, or exchange.\nAs the TMPG’s work shows, most transactions in the Treasury market settle the\nnext day, or T+1. As can be seen in figure 8, Federal Reserve staff analysis based on the\ntransactions recorded in TRACE shows that same-day settlement volumes, on average,\n\n- 13 -\nrepresent only about 4 percent of total daily volume, with the rest concentrated primarily\non one-day settlement. Same-day settlement volumes since the inception of TRACE\nhave never exceeded roughly 10 percent of the daily total. Fortunately, we have not\nrecently observed a large liquidation of Treasury holdings for cash at the end of the same\nday. But we cannot rule out that this will always be the case. It is not clear from the\nTRACE data whether the market could accommodate a large sale of Treasury securities\nlater in the day, perhaps associated with a need to raise cash quickly to settle outstanding\npositions, without causing a substantial move in prices. It will be important to follow\nclosely how the market evolves in light of the potential risks and resilience issues\nidentified in the recent TMPG white paper on clearing and settlement in the secondary\nmarket for U.S. Treasury securities.16\nBefore I conclude, let me discuss one other step the Board is planning to take to\nhelp us keep up with the changing nature of markets. The TRACE data are indispensable\nin the IAWG’s ability to track and understand this market. However, FINRA’s\ncollections are limited only to its members. The Federal Reserve is close to finalizing an\nagreement with FINRA to act as our agent in expanding the collection of Treasury\ntransactions to key banks that are also active in this market. In addition, in light of recent\nchanges in the market, the Board has decided to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to\nseek public comment on collecting agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt\ntransactions as well. This collection will help round out the IAWG’s view of these\n16 See Treasury Market Practices Group (2018), “White Paper on Clearing and Settlement in the Secondary\nMarket for U.S. Treasury Securities,” consultative white paper (New York: TMPG, July),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Microsites/tmpg/files/CS-DraftPaper-071218.pdf; and Treasury\nMarket Practices Group (2018), Clearing and Settlement in the Secondary Market for U.S. Treasury\nSecurities: Trade Flow Mapping, consultative report (New York: TMPG, July),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Microsites/tmpg/files/CS-Maps-071218.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\nmarkets and ensure continuous coverage in circumstances where trading moves between\nthe bank and the broker-dealer within a firm. It is important that reporting thresholds be\nappropriately tailored to avoid imposing undue burden on smaller firms, and we will be\nparticularly attentive to public comments on this matter.\nI see important potential benefits of transparency under appropriate\ncircumstances. The Treasury Department is currently considering these issues, and we\nwould seek to harmonize our approach with any future decisions by the Treasury\nDepartment and the IAWG in making Treasury transactions data available to the public.\nOur expectation is also that Federal Reserve policy would be harmonized with FINRA’s\npractices in making anonymized agency MBS and debt transactions publicly available,\ntaking into account what we learn from the comment process.\nConclusion\nIn sum, we recognize it is vitally important for the Federal Reserve and other\nagencies to keep up with the rapid changes we are seeing in the Treasury market. The\nTreasury market is a cornerstone of the global financial system: Treasury securities are\nused to finance the federal government, represent a store of value for investors and\nhouseholds alike, and serve as the primary reserve asset for the global financial system.\nThe Treasury market is also vital to the Federal Reserve: It is central to the transmission\nof our monetary policy, provides key signals on market expectations for inflation and\nfuture interest rates, and is a key source of high-quality liquid assets for the banking\nsystem. Given the centrality of the Treasury market, it is all the more notable that access\nto data on Treasury market transactions on par with those available for futures, equity,\nand corporate bond markets is a very recent development. The recent collection of these\n\n- 15 -\ndata has provided crucial insights into the resilience and structure of the Treasury market.\nRecognizing that the market will continue to evolve, we are committed to doing our part\nto make sure the scope of our data and their availability evolve commensurately.\n\nThe Structure of the Treasury\nMarket: What Are We Learning?\nLael Brainard\n\nFigure 1\nDaily Volume for On-the-Run and Seasoned Securities by Security Type\nOn-the-Run / Off-the- Coupons Bills TIPS FRNs\nRun Split $ billion $ billion $ billion $ billion\nOn-the-Run 362 25 7.0 0.5\nFirst Off-the-Run 31 8.3 1.2 0.1\nSecond Off-the-Run 7.7 7.6 0.0 0.0\nDeep Off-the-Run 64 28 5.5 0.9\nNote: TIPS is Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities; FRNs is Floating Rate Notes.\nSource: Board staff calculations, based on Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) data from the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

M. Alexander Conference for Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 23, 2019\n\nIt is an honor to be a part of the inaugural Sadie T. M. Alexander conference in\neconomics and related fields. I want to thank each of you in this room and those of you\nlivestreaming who form the Sadie Collective. Special thanks go to Mykelle Richburg,\nKayla Jones, Olusayo Adeleye, George-Ann Ryan, Jada Houser, Fanta Traore, and Anna\nGifty Opoku-Agyeman for taking the initiative and launching this organization and this\nconference to increase the representation of black women in the field of economics. I\napplaud your efforts, and I support your mission.1\nThe story of Dr. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander is an inspiration for us all. A\nwoman of firsts--the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in economics and the first\nwoman to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania--she was a pioneer\nwho knocked down some daunting doors. The question for the women in this room here\ntoday is whether you will follow her through those doors and maybe knock down a few\nof your own.\nThe Need for Greater Diversity\nLet me start by making two observations about economics. First, the field of\neconomics is rooted in evidence and research. The second observation follows strongly\nfrom the research and the evidence: Economics has a diversity challenge.\nThere is a stubbornly persistent lack of diversity in the economics profession.2\nYear after year, minorities and women are underrepresented in the pool of individuals\n1 I want to thank Fanta Traore and Nancy Riley for their assistance in preparing this text.\n2 “Between 1995 and 2014, the share of women obtaining a doctorate in economics held roughly steady in\nthe neighborhood of 30 percent. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents earning doctorates, the\nrepresentation of those identifying as black, Hispanic, or Native American among the pool of doctorate\nrecipients improved from 6 percent in 1995 to 11 percent in 2007. But the improvement has since\nunwound and the underrepresented minority share stood at about 7 percent in 2014.” See Lael Brainard,\n“Strengthening Diversity in Economics” (speech at the Conference for the 2017 Summer Training and\nScholarship Program, East Lansing, MI, July 28, 2017),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170728a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nawarded a doctorate in economics in the United States relative to their share in the\nbroader population, and the gap is especially acute for women of color. The American\nEconomic Association reports that in the 2016–17 academic year, seven black/African\nAmerican women were awarded a doctorate in economics in the United States, along\nwith eight black/African American men, out of a total pool of 1,150 economics Ph.D.’s\nawarded overall.\nThe economics diversity gap starts even earlier.3 As Amanda Bayer and David\nWilcox have documented, women and minorities are also underrepresented in\nundergraduate economics programs. From 2011 to 2015, women accounted for only 31\npercent of undergraduate degrees in economics--substantially below their 57 percent\nshare of all four-year undergraduate degrees. For black women, the gap is even bigger:\nthey accounted for 1.5 percent of undergraduate economics degrees compared with a 6.2\npercent share of all undergraduate degrees.4\nA growing body of research and evidence makes clear that the quality of the\neconomics profession and its contribution to society will be greater when a broader range\nof people are engaged.5 Research shows that greater diversity results in better outcomes-\n-it broadens the range of ideas and perspectives brought to bear on solving problems, and\nit brings important insights to the analysis of our economy. As Amanda Bayer and Cecilia\n3 See Rhonda Vonshay Sharpe, “We’ve to Build the Pipeline. What’s the Problem? What’s Next? The\nRemix,” The Review of Black Political Economy, January 15, 2019,\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0034644618822500\n4 Amanda Bayer and David Wilcox, “The Unequal Distribution of Economic Education: A Report on the\nRace, Ethnicity, and Gender of Economics Majors at U.S. Colleges and Universities,” Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series 2017-105 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017105pap.pdf.\n5 See Lael Brainard, “Strengthening Diversity in Economics” (speech at the Conference for the 2017\nSummer Training and Scholarship Program, East Lansing, MI, July 28, 2017),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170728a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nRouse have documented, microeconomic experiments and other research demonstrate the\nbenefits of diversity for group deliberations and decisionmaking. For instance, one well-\nknown experiment found that racially diverse groups of students outperformed other\ngroups in solving problems, and another found similar benefits from gender diversity.6\nTurning to my own institution, it is notable that when the Congress established the\nFederal Reserve System, it took great care to ensure there would be a diversity of\nperspectives around the decisionmaking table in terms of regional representation. That is\nwhy we have 12 Reserve Bank Districts represented on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee. But we have not lived up to that standard on other dimensions of diversity.\nFor instance, it was not until 2017, more than 100 years after the creation of the Federal\nReserve, that the first African American, Raphael Bostic, was chosen to lead a Reserve\nBank. We need to do better than that, and we will continue our efforts until the group of\npeople around that table is more like America.\nTo achieve our goals, we will need to improve the diversity of the economics\necosystem more broadly. Of course, the Federal Reserve System hires people with all\nkinds of expertise--from lawyers to law enforcement, from financial analysts to data\nscientists. But our footprint is especially large in the economics job market, where as a\nSystem we routinely hire one of every 25 newly minted economics Ph.D.’s each year. In\nshort, we have a significant stake in the diversity and vibrancy of the economics\nprofession overall.\n6\nAmanda Bayer and Cecilia Elena Rouse, “Diversity in the Economics Profession: A New Attack on an\nOld Problem,” Journal of Economic Perspectives 30 (Fall 2016): 221-42,\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.30.4.221.\n\n- 4 -\nWhy Consider a Career in Economics?\nI have discussed why it is important for the Federal Reserve and for our economy\nto see more women of color embracing the field of economics. But what’s in it for you?\nThere are many ways your career may unfold where economics might fit in it. Some of\nyou may decide your passion lies elsewhere as an undergraduate, and later find that\nadvanced studies in economics align with your career interests. Others may already feel\nthat economics is your calling. And just as there are a variety of reasons that people\ndecide to deepen their studies in economics, so too there are many career fields where a\ndegree in economics can be a powerful enabler.\nIn my case, although I did not have an undergraduate economics degree, I later\ndecided to pursue advanced study in economics because it provided a rigorous analytical\nframework and approach to data to address important problems facing America.\nGrowing up, I saw how every family’s well-being is affected by their financial resilience\nand their economic opportunities. I decided to study economics because it provides\npowerful tools to help promote a better future for many Americans. I have found\ndifferent ways to approach that throughout my career--from teaching the next generation\nof problem solvers, to assessing the challenges facing American manufacturers, to seeing\nthe potential of microfinance for financial inclusion, to promoting maximum employment\nand stable inflation in my current job.\nI recognize that it is challenging to look around a classroom or conference room\nand not see colleagues who you can relate to. It is humbling to imagine how that first\neconomics class looked to Dr. Sadie Alexander. But now there are a number of leading\nscholars and practitioners in the field to provide inspiration and serve as role models.\n\n- 5 -\nToday, you will hear from several, including Dr. Julianne Malveaux, Dr. Willene\nJohnson, and Dr. Lisa Cook, who will share with you their perspectives and discuss their\nimportant and interesting work.\nSo what might you find by pursuing economics? As I have noted, you can\ninfluence people’s lives for the better. You can craft policy to change our world. You\ncan teach and help shape the next generation. You can find the answers to questions that\nmatter most to you. You can develop the intellectual framework and tools that will\nenable you to pursue a range of opportunities, not just in economics, but also in business,\nfinance, policy, and nonprofits.\nConclusion\nI hope you will take away the message that the field of economics would be the\nricher from your engagement and has much to offer as you decide how to make your\ncontribution. There are many opportunities for you in the field of economics, both here\nand abroad, in government, academia, and the private sector. Dr. Sadie Alexander\nknocked down the door, and I hope you will consider following her through it.",

I want to especially thank Lisa Cook for giving me the opportunity to be here\ntoday.1\nI am particularly pleased to be able to speak with students participating in the\nAEA’s Summer and Mentoring Programs. At the Fed, we share the goal of making sure\nthe group of students who go on to practice economics look more like America. So if\nyou are interested in pursuing economics, we want to make sure you have an opportunity\nto contribute to the field.\nPerhaps more than any other profession, it is in the DNA of economists to believe\nthat equality of opportunity is important not only as a matter of fairness, but also to our\ncountry’s vitality. In addition, economists like to base conclusions on hard numbers.\nThe numbers make clear there is a persistent lack of diversity in the economics\nprofession, which indicates we are falling short of our ideals.\nThe quality of the economics profession and its contributions to society will be\nstronger when a broader range of people are engaged. We now have substantial\nempirical evidence documenting the benefits of diversity in broadening the range of ideas\nand perspectives that are brought to bear on solving problems, and thereby contributing to\n1 I am grateful to John Maggs for his assistance in preparing this text. The remarks represent my own\nviews, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n\n- 2 -\nbetter outcomes, both in research and in policy. Studies suggest that increased diversity\nalters group dynamics and decisionmaking in positive ways.\nAs Amanda Bayer and Cecilia Rouse have noted, microeconomic experiments\nand other research have confirmed these ideas. One experiment found that greater racial\ndiversity helped groups of business students outperform other students in solving\nproblems. And another found similar benefits from gender diversity. A study of 2.5\nmillion research papers across the sciences found that those written by ethnically diverse\nresearch teams received more citations and had a greater impact than papers by authors\nwith the same ethnicity.2\nDiversity in the economics profession will bring important insights into the\nanalysis of our economy and financial system and help policymakers make better\ndecisions in promoting a healthier economy. So given that diversity in the economics\nprofession is an important goal, how have we been doing? Unfortunately, by any\nmeasure, we are still falling short. Between 1995 and 2014, the share of women\nobtaining a doctorate in economics held roughly steady in the neighborhood of 30\npercent. Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents earning doctorates, the\nrepresentation of those identifying as black, Hispanic, or Native American among the\npool of doctorate recipients improved from 6 percent in 1995 to 11 percent in 2007. But\nthe improvement has since unwound and the underrepresented minority share stood at\nabout 7 percent in 2014.\nI respectfully defer to others who have more closely studied the mix of possible\nreasons for why progress has not been greater, but I will defer to no one in expressing my\n2 Amanda Bayer and Cecilia Elena Rouse, (2016) “Diversity in the Economics Profession: A New Attack\non an Old Problem,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 30, no. 4 (Fall), pp. 221-42.\n\n- 3 -\nview that the status quo is not good enough. I’ve laid out a number of arguments why\npolicy and society at large would be better off if there were more women and minorities\nin the economics profession. But a more important question for the students here today\nmight reasonably be, what’s in it for me? One answer is that there are a ton of interesting\nquestions out there for you to solve. Another is the considerable premium in earnings\nover other academic fields.\nEven for those students here who are not convinced that a career in economics is\nultimately the goal for you, the intellectual framework associated with the study of\neconomics is extremely powerful and applicable to a host of other areas. And who can\nsay now how your career will unfold? I would encourage you to think expansively about\nyour career trajectory. Some of you may already feel that economics is your calling and\nyou may choose to go directly into graduate school with the aim of pursuing doctoral\nstudies. Others may decide to work for a few years and then make a choice about\ngraduate studies once you know more about what kind of job is likely to be most\nappealing and hopefully have made a dent in your student debt. Just as many people\nchoose to leave the field of economics and pursue other interests at different junctures in\ntheir careers, so too there may be multiple points of entry. There are many stories of\nsuccessful careers in economics that began only after other avenues had been explored. I\nwant to make sure you know that even if you have not specialized in economics as an\nundergraduate, it is not too late to join. We need economists with diverse experiences\nand backgrounds, just as we need other sources of diversity.\nFor what it is worth, I did not major in economics as an undergraduate, and I\nworked for several years in the private sector before I decided to pursue a doctorate in\n\n- 4 -\neconomics. I am glad I did. I enormously value the intellectual framework associated\nwith economics, and my career has provided terrific opportunities both to range far afield\nand to work within the field. In short, I hope you will think of economics not as shutting\ndoors on other opportunities, but rather as equipping you to pursue a whole new set of\nopportunities.\nGiven the benefits I have described to the profession and society from increasing\ndiversity in the ranks of economists, as well as the opportunity a degree in economics\naffords to individuals who pursue the field, it makes sense to look closely, as the AEA\nand others continue to do, at the reasons more women and minorities do not concentrate\nin economics in college or depart from economics as they move toward graduation. To\nthe undergraduates in the audience today who are participating in the Summer Program, I\nwould be interested to hear what you believe may be discouraging women and minorities\nfrom choosing economics in school and careers, so that we can take steps to reduce any\nbarriers.\nThe AEA and other groups are rightly focused on what universities and other\ninstitutions can do to promote diversity in economics. Let me now direct my attention to\ndiversity at my institution, the Federal Reserve, because it is both one of the largest\nemployers of PhD economists in the country and a prominent public institution. The\nshare of women and minorities among economists at the Fed is similar to the numbers for\nthe profession at large, and these numbers have likewise improved fairly little since 2009.\nSomething that has changed over that time, however, is the elevation in importance of\ndiversity efforts, including recruitment. The Board of Governors is making considerable\neffort to recruit and retain economists who are women and minorities.\n\n- 5 -\nWe are working hard at recruitment at the earliest stages of the career-formation\nprocess. Every year the Board hires 50 to 60 research assistants (RAs) for two-year\nterms; the 12 Reserve Banks together hire roughly an equal number. Our research\nassistant program is to some extent an apprenticeship program for economists and also\nfor financial analysts and those in related fields. Our research assistants are typically\nrecent college graduates and most are at least considering further study of economics.\nThese are sought-after positions because our RAs have the opportunity to work with the\nBoard’s leading economists on both research and work that directly supports\npolicymaking.\nFor the Summer Program students here today, I would encourage you to explore\nthe RA program. Serving as an RA either at the Federal Reserve Board or at one of the\nReserve Banks has proven to be a good way to learn more about the profession and\nprepare for graduate school. I can report that five graduates of last year’s program are\nnow working at the Board as RAs and several are working at Reserve Banks.\nFor the Federal Reserve System, our recruitment of RAs is a great opportunity to\ngive a wide range of potential newcomers some exposure to what the career pathway of\neconomics looks like. While not all RAs go on to further economics education and\ntraining, a considerable share do, and thus our diversity efforts have the potential to\nsignificantly affect career pathways later on. Indeed, at the highest levels of that process,\nthe Federal Reserve under Chair Janet Yellen and with the strong support of the\nGovernors and Reserve Bank Presidents is committed to increasing diversity among the\ntop-ranking staff at the Board and among leaders of the Reserve Banks.\n\n- 6 -\nIn the tradition of the discipline of economics, I have cited empirical support for\nthe argument that diversity is good for economics. I know from my own personal\nexperience we can and must do better, and in that spirit I want to tell you about one of my\nexperiences that might resonate with some of you here. When I served at the Treasury\nDepartment for President Obama, one of my responsibilities was to represent the United\nStates in the Group of 20 (G-20) deputy ministers of finance and central bank officials.\nAt one of our negotiating meetings, the nearly 50 officials gathered for a group photo.\nWhen this photo was distributed to each of us as a memento, it caused a bit of a stir. I\nremember a colleague from another delegation doing a double take when he looked at the\nphoto. He turned to me and said “Did you realize you are the only woman in this\ngroup?” I had indeed already noticed that. And I am happy to say that his delegation\nadded a woman after that.\nSince that time, we have seen some particularly noteworthy milestones. At the\ntime, there had been only one woman among the G-20 countries serving as head of a\ncentral bank, in South Africa, and none among the G-7 advanced economies. Since then,\ntwo other women have led G-20 central banks, and now I have the honor of serving with\nthe first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen.\nSo what’s my take away from that experience? It was a good reminder to me that\nwe have to see the challenges that are right in front of our eyes if we want to address\nthem and we should not be satisfied until the people sitting around every decisionmaking\ntable look like America in all its rich diversity.\nEarlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta hired Raphael Bostic as its\npresident and chief executive officer, the first African-American to lead a Reserve Bank.\n\n- 7 -\nI look forward to the day when we have moved far beyond all the firsts, when we can see\nwith satisfaction that the people of the Federal Reserve fully reflect the characteristics of\nthe American people. We are working hard to get there, but we still have a long way to\ngo.\nOf course, getting to that point in the future starts with people like you and the\npaths you choose today. You should choose the path where you feel you will make your\ngreatest contribution--the one that is right for you. But if economics seems like a great\nfit, then choose it with the confidence that you have the capacity to make an important\ncontribution that will be valued.\nSo with that, I will be glad to respond to your questions.",

Global\nsupply chains have eased significantly, but by some measures they are still more\nconstrained than at nearly any time since the late 1990s.2 High inflation places a burden\non all Americans, but especially lower-income families, who spend three-fourths of their\nincome on necessities—more than twice the share spent by higher-income families. The\nFederal Reserve has tightened policy strongly to bring inflation down, and U.S.\ntightening is being amplified by concurrent foreign tightening. We are starting to see the\neffects in some areas, but it will take some time for the cumulative tightening to transmit\nthroughout the economy and to bring inflation down. Uncertainty remains high, and I am\npaying close attention to the evolution of the outlook as well as global risks.\nHigher interest rates are working to temper demand and bring it into better\nalignment with supply, which is still constrained. Output has decelerated so far this year\nby more than anticipated, suggesting that policy tightening is having some effect. Real\ngross domestic product (GDP) declined at an annual rate of roughly 1 percent in the first\nhalf. Real private domestic final purchases stepped down from a 6.4 percent pace last\nyear to an annual rate of only 1.3 percent during the first half of this year.\nRecent revisions to national income and product accounts data imply that the\ncurrent stock of excess savings held by households is lower and has been drawn down\n1 I want to thank Kurt Lewis and Daniel Villar of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance on these\nremarks. These views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, September 2022.\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/gscpi#/interactive\n\n- 2 -\nmore rapidly in recent quarters than had been previously estimated. Indeed, by Board\nstaff estimates, the revisions imply that the stock of excess savings held by households is\nabout 25 percent lower, which may imply a more subdued pace of consumer spending\ngoing forward than had been projected.\nMarket expectations for the level of the policy rate at the end of the year are now\nmore than twice as high as they were just seven months ago. As a result of the significant\nincrease in interest rates and associated tightening in broader financial conditions, I now\nexpect that the second-half rebound will be limited, and that real GDP growth will be\nessentially flat this year.3\nThe moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly\nrealized so far. The transmission of tighter policy is most evident in highly interest-\nsensitive sectors like housing, where mortgage rates have more than doubled year to date\nand house price appreciation has fallen sharply over recent months and is on track to soon\nbe flat. In other sectors, lags in transmission mean that policy actions to date will have\ntheir full effect on activity in coming quarters, and the effect on price setting may take\nlonger. The moderation in demand should be reinforced by the concurrent rapid global\ntightening of monetary policy.\nAgainst the backdrop of slower output growth, we are seeing some tentative signs\nof rebalancing in the labor market. Anecdotal reports suggest the availability and\n3 Both the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and private forecasters showed expectations of above-\ntrend 2022 growth early this year. The March SEP showed a median projection of 2.8 percent GDP growth\nin 2022 and a policy rate path that almost reached 2 percent by year-end. In the March 2022 Blue Chip\nEconomic Indicators, the consensus projection for Q4/Q4 real GDP growth in 2022 was 2.6 percent, and\npolicy expectations for year-end 2022 in the Blue Chip Financial Forecast for the same month were 1.3\npercent. On a Q4-over-Q4 basis, the September Blue Chip consensus for 2022 real GDP growth was a\ndecline of 0.1 percent. The median expectations for real GDP growth on a Q4-over-Q4 basis in the\nSeptember SEP were 0.2 percent.\n\n- 3 -\nretention of workers are improving.4 For the second month in a row, growth in monthly\npayroll employment stepped down, slowing from 315,0000 in August to 263,000 in\nSeptember. There was a sharp 1.1 million decline in job openings from July to August in\nthe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The ratio of job openings to job\nseekers declined to 1.7; for purposes of comparison, this ratio was 1.2 prior to the\npandemic.5 The sharp fall in vacancies at a time when initial claims held steady at low\nlevels provides support for the possibility that businesses that faced significant challenges\nfinding and retaining qualified workers following the pandemic may be more inclined\nthan in past cycles to retain rather than lay off their workers as demand weakens. In\nparticular, there is still a sizable 1.2 million shortfall in employment levels relative to pre-\npandemic levels in the in-person services sectors that accounted for the majority of\nSeptember payroll gains, suggesting businesses in those sectors may still be trying to\nnarrow that gap.6\nThat said, a variety of indicators suggest labor demand remains strong, while\nlabor supply remains below pre-pandemic conditions. The unemployment rate is now at\nthe very low level that prevailed pre-pandemic, and the volume of quits remains\n4 For example, the discussion in the September Beige Book notes that “overall labor market conditions\nremained tight, although nearly all Districts highlighted some improvement in labor availability,\nparticularly among manufacturing, construction, and financial services contacts. Moreover, employers\nnoted improved worker retention, on balance.” See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(2022), Beige Book (Washington: Board of Governors, September 7),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202209.htm.\n5 The current ratio is calculated as the number of job openings at the end of August in the most recent\nJOLTS release, divided by the number of unemployed persons reported in the September 2022 Current\nPopulation Survey.\n6 The total shortfall in the level of employment in September 2022 relative to the level in February 2020\nfrom the retail trade, educational services, local government education, health care and social assistance,\nand leisure and hospitality sectors was 1.16 million.\n\n- 4 -\nelevated.7 This supply–demand imbalance in the labor market is reflected in strong wage\ngrowth. The employment cost index increased by an annual rate of 6.3 percent over the\nsecond quarter—its highest level in decades. A more-timely data source, average hourly\nearnings, decelerated slightly to a 4.4 percent annual rate over the third quarter, down\nfrom 4.6 percent annual growth in the second quarter. Although it is well above levels\nconsistent with 2 percent inflation, wage growth has been running below current\ninflation.\nStrong wage growth along with high rental and housing costs mean that inflation\nfrom core services is expected to ease only slowly from currently elevated levels. In\ncontrast, core goods have been expected to return to something closer to the pre-\npandemic trend of modest disinflation as a result of demand rotation away from goods to\nservices, coupled with the healing of supply chains and declining core import prices.\nDisinflation in core goods would help to offset the inflationary pressures in services.\nDuring the five years before the crisis, core goods made a small negative contribution to\ninflation. The contribution of core goods to inflation swung sharply into positive territory\nin 2021, and had started to step down somewhat in the middle part of 2022.8 So the\nsurprise in the August inflation data was the large contribution of core goods inflation to\noverall inflation at a point in the post-pandemic recovery when many forecasts\nanticipated this contribution would continue moderating.\n7 As shown by the data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker, through August\nthe 12-month moving average of median wage growth among job switchers was nearly 2 percentage points\nhigher than those who remained in their same role, with 6.9 percent growth for job switchers as opposed to\n5.0 percent growth for those who remained in the same role. For more information, see\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.\n8 Expressed on an annualized basis, the average monthly contribution from core goods to total PCE\ninflation in 2021 would be 1.6 percent. For data going back to 1987, the contribution of core goods to total\nPCE inflation on a 12-month basis reached its peak in February 2022 at 1.8 percentage points and came in\nat 1.3 percentage points in August 2022.\n\n- 5 -\nSince the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided\nwith large increases in retail trade margins in several sectors. In some sectors, the\nincrease in the retail trade margin exceeds the contemporaneous increase in wages paid to\nthe workers engaged in retail trade, although this is not true in food and apparel. The\nreturn of retail margins to more normal levels could meaningfully help reduce\ninflationary pressures in some consumer goods, considering that gross retail margins are\nabout 30 percent of total sales dollars overall.\nFor instance, among general merchandise retailers, where the real inventory-to-\nsales ratio is 20 percent above its pre-pandemic level, retail margins have increased 20\npercent since the onset of the pandemic, roughly double the 9 percent increase in average\nhourly earnings by employees in that sector.9 In the auto sector, where the real\ninventory-to-sales ratio is 20 percent below its pre-pandemic level, the retail margin for\nmotor vehicles sold at dealerships has increased by more than 180 percent since February\n2020, 10 times the rise in average hourly earnings within that sector.10 So there is ample\nroom for margin recompression to help reduce goods inflation as demand cools, supply\nconstraints ease, and inventories increase.\nDespite the higher prices for a broad set of goods and services, market- and\nsurvey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are within ranges consistent\nwith expectations that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term.11 Treasury\n9 See, for example, Josh Ulick and Suzanne Kapner (2022) “From Walmart to Gap, Which Retailers Have\nthe Most Excess Inventory?” Wall Street Journal, June 9, https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-walmart-to-\ngap-which-retailers-have-the-most-excess-inventory-11654776000.\n10 For additional information, see Alana Semuels (2022), “I Paid $3,000 Above Sticker Price for My New\nCar. You Probably Will Too,” Time, September 29, https://time.com/6218046/new-car-prices-over-msrp.\n11 Although the Survey of Professional Forecasters saw large increases in expected inflation for 2022 and\n2023 between the first- and third-quarter surveys, reflecting the shocks to inflation between the periods in\nFebruary and August when those surveys were conducted, the implied 5-to-10-year inflation expectation\n\n- 6 -\nInflation-Protected Securities–based measures of five-year, five-year-forward breakeven\ninflation compensation are currently at 2.15 percent, roughly 10 basis points below their\nlevel at the start of the year. The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10\nyears in the Michigan survey ticked down in September to 2.7 percent, below the 2.9 to\n3.1 percent range in which it had been fluctuating since July 2021 and back within the\nrange that was common before the 2015 decline in this metric.12 Currently, there is a\ngreater dispersion than usual of views about future inflation in survey responses.\nPreviously this reflected a rise in expectations for significantly above-target inflation, but\nnow that dispersion also reflects expectations on the part of one quarter of respondents\nthat prices are likely be the same or below their current level 5 to 10 years in the future.\nIn order to bring inflation down and to keep inflation expectations solidly\nanchored at 2 percent, the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate target\nrange by 300 basis points in the past seven months, and both market and policymaker\nsurveys indicate additional increases through the end of this year and into next year. In\naddition, balance sheet shrinkage is now proceeding at its maximum rate, reinforcing the\nmove to a restrictive stance. Broader U.S. financial conditions have tightened rapidly in\nresponse: The two-year Treasury yield has moved above 4 percent for the first time since\n2007, and the 10-year yield is near its highest level in over a decade at 3.9 percent.\nCorporate bond yields have risen even more, as investment- and speculative-grade\ncorporate bond spreads have increased about 80 basis points and 170 basis points,\nremained at 2 percent throughout the surveys conducted thus far in 2022. See\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/survey-of-professional-\nforecasters.\n12 For additional information, see https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu.\n\n- 7 -\nrespectively, over the year. Mortgage rates have more than doubled since the beginning\nof the year. The Board’s broad dollar index has appreciated 11 percent year to date.13\nMonetary policy tightening is also proceeding rapidly abroad. Many central\nbanks in large economies have raised rates by 125 basis points or more in the past six\nmonths, and yields on 10-year sovereign debt in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the\nlargest euro area economies have seen increases on the order of 190 to 360 basis points\nthis year.14\nThe combined effect of concurrent global tightening is larger than the sum of its\nparts. The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a\nstronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as\nwell as in the reverse direction. We are attentive to the risk of further adverse shocks—\nfor instance, from Russia’s war against Ukraine, the pandemic, or China’s zero-COVID\npolicies. And we are also very aware that the cross-border effects of unexpected\nmovements in interest rates and exchange rates, as well as worsening external\nimbalances, in some cases could interact with financial vulnerabilities. In this\nenvironment, a sharp decrease in risk sentiment or other risk event that may be difficult to\nanticipate could be amplified, especially given fragile liquidity in core financial markets.\nIn some countries, the realization of these risks could pose challenging tradeoffs for\npolicy.\n13 The Federal Reserve’s broad trade-weighted dollar index is based on 26 currencies of major U.S. trading\npartners. It is published in Statistical Release H.10, “Foreign Exchange Rates,” available on the Board’s\nwebsite at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/current/default.htm.\n14 The central banks of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the euro area, Australia, New\nZealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland together account for 49 percent of nominal global GDP\nmeasured in dollars at market exchange rates. Each of these central banks has raised its policy rate by at\nleast 125 basis points in the past six months.\n\n- 8 -\nThat said, the real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very\nshortest maturities, and the entire real curve will soon move into positive territory with\nthe additional tightening and deceleration in inflation that are expected over coming\nquarters. Monetary policy will be restrictive for some time to ensure that inflation moves\nback to target over time. It will take time for the cumulative effect of tighter monetary\npolicy to work through the economy broadly and to bring inflation down. In light of\nelevated global economic and financial uncertainty, moving forward deliberately and in a\ndata-dependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity, employment, and\ninflation are adjusting to cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessments of the\npath of the policy rate.",

I appreciate the opportunity to listen and learn about the\nimportant work that you do.1\nOne of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities is to understand how communities across\nAmerica are experiencing the economy. That is why Congress established a network of Federal\nReserve Banks and Branches across the country. Our local presence gives us valuable\nopportunities to engage with communities across a broad spectrum--from those who are thriving\nto those who are confronting challenges, and from inner-city neighborhoods to rural towns.\nOne of the lessons that our community engagement has taught us is that there is an\nimportant connection between the strength of regional food systems and community health.\nToday’s meeting is one in a series that Federal Reserve Banks are holding across the country to\ntalk about local efforts to support regional food systems, and how such efforts can advance\ncommunities’ goals. These meetings build on the Federal Reserve Board’s release last August of\nHarvesting Opportunity, a publication that explores the community and economic development\npotential of investing in regional food systems.2 Through this collaborative research effort, we\nlearned several important lessons about what works to strengthen regional food systems.\nFirst, we learned that appropriately tailored investments in regional food systems have\nthe potential to support the creation of new jobs and small businesses in local communities, as\nwell as to improve farm profitability and financial resilience.\nSecond, we learned that in order to take advantage of new business opportunities in the\nregional food sector, entrepreneurs need access to capital, specialized knowledge, and general\n1 I am grateful to Andrew Dumont for his assistance in preparing these remarks.

Cheeks Wilson, J. Barham, and D.

Unfortunately, one or more of these is often missing from historically\nmarginalized communities.\nWe also learned that organizations across the country are filling these gaps and\nempowering communities to take advantage of opportunities. I understand that many of you in\nthis room are engaged in this important work; for that I thank you and hope that this meeting will\nhelp advance your efforts.\nAs a result of an intentional focus on equity and inclusiveness, these investments can\ncreate new access to economic opportunity for segments of communities that have often faced\nchallenges, such as people of color, recent immigrants, the formerly homeless, and the\npreviously incarcerated.\nLastly, we learned that no organization has all of the resources or expertise necessary to\neffectively carry out this work alone. As such, long-term partnerships and collaboration are\nnecessary for success in implementing regional food strategies. Because of the critical role of\nmulti-sectoral partnerships, I am heartened to see so many of you here today to talk about the\ncurrent state of regional food system investment in New England, to build new relationships, and\nto strengthen existing ones. It is this ongoing commitment to working together that will carry\nyou through to the next stage of regional food systems development.\nLater today, I will be meeting with several local organizations that not only bring\nimportant resources and expertise to their communities, but also exemplify this important\ndedication to partnership and cross-sector collaboration.\nThe Urban Farming Institute of Boston demonstrates dedication to cross-sector\ncollaboration through their Farmer Training Program, many of whose graduates go on to work\nfor or start up regional food enterprises. They also advance the broader regional food system by\n\n- 3 -\nco-hosting an annual conference that brings together farmers, policymakers, investors, and other\nstakeholders.\nLikewise, CommonWealth Kitchen has emerged as an important hub where farmers,\nentrepreneurs, universities, investors, and other stakeholders come together in ways that not only\nadvance regional food systems, but also increase access to economic opportunity for people\nimpacted by racial, social, or economic inequality. In this way, CommonWealth Kitchen is\ndedicated to addressing Greater Boston’s growing wealth divide by promoting inclusive\nentrepreneurship through an integrated approach that links education, training, and\nmanufacturing to a strong network of industry partners, including anchor institutions.\nThese are just two examples of the great work going on in New England, and I look\nforward to visiting both organizations later today. This morning, I am eager to learn about the\nwork of the many organizations represented here, especially the barriers and opportunities you\nface when trying to invest in this sector, and how your investments are linking more families and\ncommunities to meaningful economic opportunities.\nAttending events like this and visiting communities around the country provide me with\nopportunities to speak with families, farmers, small business owners, investors, bankers, and\nother community members about their experiences in the economy. These conversations help\nme to develop a granular and very human understanding of the economy that, when combined\nwith the information provided by our traditional research and data collection efforts, are\nimportant considerations informing judgments about policy.\nA community-level understanding of the economy is especially important in today’s\neconomy, where we see welcome strength in the aggregate statistics coexisting side-by-side with\nimportant disparities at the community and family levels. In addition to disparities based on the\n\n- 4 -\ncommunity where a family lives and significant and persistent racial disparities, I have been\nstruck while traveling around the country by the widening gulf between the economic fortunes of\nour large metropolitan areas and those of our small cities, towns, and rural areas.\nThe statistics bear this out: the convergence in income across regions of the country has\nslowed dramatically over recent decades.3 Much of the gains in employment, income, and\nwealth since the end of the recession--and more broadly over the past few decades--have accrued\nto workers and families in larger cities. If some workers and families find it difficult to move,\nthis concentration of economic opportunities in larger cities may have adverse implications for\nthe well-being of these households and, potentially, the economy overall.\nIn my visits, I have also been heartened by the efforts of local partners to address these\ndisparities and improve their communities, including those aimed at capitalizing on local food-\nbased assets to advance economic opportunity and address food insecurity. For instance, in El\nPaso, I visited with several vibrant community organizations that were running community\ngardens, local nutrition and farming educational outreach programs, a commercial kitchen, and a\nfood pantry to improve nutrition and access to fresh food in an area that lacked full-scale grocery\nstores. In the Mississippi Delta, I met with people involved in an interesting collaboration\nbetween a local entrepreneur, a community development financial institution, the engineering\ndepartment of a local community college, local farmers, and local food organizations--the aim of\nwhich was to produce biofuels from food waste.\nOf course, pockets of both opportunity and persistent poverty are found in large metro\nand rural areas alike. In fact, a recent report found Boston to have one of the highest rates of\nincome inequality among the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, despite the\n3 P. Ganong, and D.W.

Some localities have fared better than others in this\nrespect, and their successes can provide us with actionable lessons. For instance, the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston undertook an in-depth study of 25 medium-sized cities nationwide that\nhad experienced a post-industrial decline and identified 10 that experienced an economic\nresurgence. The study found that the critical determinant of success was the ability of leaders in\nthose cities to collaborate across sectors around a long-term vision for revitalization.5 To\nencourage such collaboration, the Boston Fed has facilitated Working Cities Challenges in\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut that reward effective public–private collaboration\nto reach communitywide goals. For instance, one of the winning cities, Lawrence,\nMassachusetts, set goals of increasing the income of parents with children in the Lawrence\nPublic School system by 15 percent, dramatically increasing parental engagement in the schools\nand tracking the impact of these efforts on student achievement. A cross-section of partners\nfrom the public, private, nonprofit, and philanthropic sectors sought to achieve this, in part, by\nembedding Family Resource Centers within the Lawrence Public Schools.

This new Institute is another great example of how individual Reserve Banks are\ntaking the initiative in illuminating key dimensions of our work and shaping the agenda\nof the Federal Reserve System.1\nWhile it has long been understood that opportunity is central to the strength of\nAmerica’s social fabric, it is now increasingly clear that opportunity and inclusion are\ncentral to the strength of America’s economy. I will touch on the key ways that\nopportunity and inclusion matter for policymaking at the Federal Reserve, ranging from\nour dual-mandate goal of maximum employment to our monitoring of household\nfinancial health to our engagement in low- and moderate-income communities all over\nthe country. I will focus on how our work intersects with the groundbreaking work of the\naccomplished group of researchers assembled here.\nIn the original design of the Federal Reserve, it was recognized that the American\neconomy is not monolithic; that is why the Congress created our system of 12 Federal\nReserve Districts. We are present in communities all across America through our\nReserve Banks and Branches and their boards and advisory councils. This local\npresence, by design, gives us valuable perspectives on how Americans are experiencing\nthe economy in different communities around the country and critical insights about the\nvaried challenges that lie beneath the aggregate numbers. In turn, our local engagement\nI am grateful to David Buchholz, Jeff Larrimore, Amanda Roberts, Claudia Sahm, and Jenny Schuetz for\ntheir assistance in preparing this text.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nhelps stakeholders in these communities partner to improve opportunity and inclusive\ngrowth.\nInclusion and Maximum Employment\nInclusion is an enduring goal of public policy that is embodied in our maximum-\nemployment mandate. The Employment Act of 1946 charges the federal government\nwith creating “conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those\nable, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, production,\nand purchasing power.”2 Maximum employment is inherently an inclusive goal. In\n1977, the Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to make achieving maximum\nemployment an explicit objective of monetary policy, along with stable prices. In\nfulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target\nof 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum\nemployment. That is because the level of maximum employment depends on\n“nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,” which\ncan change in important ways over time.3\nThe recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes\nin the economic landscape serves us well. It puts the onus on members of the FOMC to\nanalyze the changing features of the labor market and develop a nuanced understanding\nof the different margins of slack. This approach to maximum employment has allowed\n2 See the Employment Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-304, § 2, 60 Stat. 23, 23 (1946).\n3 The FOMC’s inflation target was adopted in January 2012 in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy. It was amended in January 2017 to clarify that the target is symmetric around\n2 percent; the most recent Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (in which the\nquoted text appears in paragraph 3) is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf. For the interim period,\nThornton (2012) and Steelman (2011) document the evolution of views among FOMC members on the\ndual mandate.\n\n- 3 -\nthe FOMC to navigate the current recovery in a way that has likely brought more people\nback into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed, aggregate\nunemployment-rate target based on pre-crisis norms, in effect, achieving more inclusive\ngrowth. This is especially true at a time when the traditional Phillips curve relationship\nbetween unemployment and inflation is extremely flat for reasons we do not fully\nunderstand.\nWhen we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we often find\nsignificant and persistent racial disparities.4 For many decades, the unemployment rate\nof African Americans has been nearly double the national unemployment rate, with little\nindication that the relative difference is narrowing or that it can be fully accounted for by\neducation or sectoral mix; the unemployment rate for Hispanics also has consistently\nbeen higher than the national unemployment rate.5 Similarly, during the Great\nRecession, the unemployment rates of African Americans and Hispanics rose more\nsharply and rapidly than for workers as a whole.6 Even though the unemployment rates\nof these groups are back around their pre-recession levels, they remain higher than the\nnational average. We can also see persistent disparities by gender, such as the well-\nknown wage premium earned by men relative to women with similar experience and\nexpertise.7 With its focus on inclusive growth, this Institute could give us important\ninsights on how far the overall economy is from full employment, as well as the barriers\n4 Board of Governors (2016) discusses some recent trends. See also Altonji and Blank (1999) and\nreferences therein for research on racial and gender differences in the labor market.\n5 Cajner and others (2017) find that the higher, more cyclical unemployment of African Americans than\nwhites cannot be fully accounted for by differences in education, age, marital status, and state of residence.\n6 See the box “Have the Gains of the Economic Expansion Been Widely Shared?” in Board of Governors\n(2016).\n7 See Yellen (2017a) and the studies referenced therein.\n\n- 4 -\nthat could be limiting the economy’s potential, by studying labor market outcomes of\nmen and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in more depth.8\nResearch on the drivers of disparities in labor market outcomes can also help the\nFederal Reserve better assess potential tradeoffs in monetary policy. In meetings with\ncommunity groups, we often hear from advocates who point to the stark discrepancy they\nsee between the economy’s aggregate U-3 unemployment rate, which many forecasters\nestimate to be at or approaching full employment, and the much higher rates of\nunemployment among the people in their neighborhoods. For instance, Rod Adams, a\nneighborhood advocate here in Minneapolis, noted the unemployment rate for African\nAmericans locally was still almost 9 percent late last summer and observed that “if the\nlabor market were truly healthy, people in my community would all be able to find full-\ntime jobs at decent wages.”9 While the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are\nnot well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in the\nlabor market outcomes of different groups, understanding these barriers and efforts to\naddress them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth.\nThe Federal Reserve’s community development work is invaluable in supporting\nour efforts to understand and improve the labor market experiences of different groups.10\nFor instance, during the Great Recession, workforce development organizations in\n8 Aaronson and others (2014) and Barnichon and Mesters (2016) are examples of using details from\ndemographic groups to assess overall labor market trends. In September, the Board of Governors is hosting\na conference, “Disparities in the Labor Market: What Are We Missing?’\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/disparities-in-the-labor-market-about-2017.htm.\n9 On August 25, 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosted a listening session with the Center\nfor Popular Democracy for members of the Federal Reserve; a video of the session is available at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp/symposiums/escp-event.\n10 See Yellen (2017b) for an overview. In October, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas will host a\nconference, “Investing in America’s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and Employers.”\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/cd/events/2017/17workforce.aspx.\n\n- 5 -\nAtlanta found themselves overwhelmed by the sharp rise in unemployment, which\nhighlighted the need for a better connected and stronger network of job training and\nplacement services. I recently spent time with these organizations, along with\ncommunity members and some of our Atlanta staff, who have been working on the\ncreation of the Metro Atlanta eXchange (or MAX) for Workforce Solutions, the region’s\nonly comprehensive directory for workforce development services.\nJust as there is a connection between maximum employment and inclusive\ngrowth, so, too, there is an important connection between potential output and\nopportunity. If there are large disparities in opportunity based on geography or race or\ngender, such that households’ enterprise, exertion, and investments are not rewarded\ncommensurately, then families and small businesses will invest less in the future and\npotential growth will fall short.11 Indeed, one worrisome trend is the decline in the labor\nforce participation of prime-age workers with less education, a trend that has been going\non for decades among men and that has more recently begun to be mirrored in the\nparticipation rate of women.12 Understanding this growing detachment from work is\nimportant to improving both opportunity and potential growth.\nIn visits to Detroit, Milwaukee, North St. Louis, and Baltimore, I have heard from\nresidents and community organizations about the challenging barriers standing between\nthe many workers seeking jobs and the many jobs seeking workers. The local barriers\nseparating jobs from job seekers can be as concrete as the physical isolation created by\nmajor traffic arteries or poorly designed transit systems.13 I have visited Los Angeles,\n11 See Marrero and Rodriquez (2013).\n12 See Council of Economic Advisers (2016) and the studies cited therein.\n13 The information is from community development visits in 2015 (Baltimore and North St. Louis) and\n2016 (Detroit and Milwaukee).\n\n- 6 -\nwhere our staff have been actively engaged with businesses, transit authorities, and\ncommunity groups in efforts around “equitable transit-oriented development” so that\npublic transit systems are designed to enhance access for low- and moderate-income\nresidents.14\nHousehold Financial Health\nInclusion and opportunity also figure prominently in our work on financial\nresilience. While the resilience of the financial system has long been central to Federal\nReserve policy, in recent years we have come to more fully appreciate that a resilient\nfinancial system rests on the foundations of financially resilient households and\nbusinesses.\nThe ability to manage the ups and downs in family income and expenses without\nhardship and the ability to make sound investments for the future are both crucial to\nfinancial health. Yet we see from the latest edition of the Federal Reserve’s Survey of\nHousehold Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) that a strikingly high 40 percent of\nAmerican households with high school degrees or less report that they are struggling\nfinancially.15 And the in-depth research in the U.S. Financial Diaries Project provides\ninsights into the large amount of time and effort these families with thin financial buffers\nmust devote to managing their volatile cash flows.16\nA seemingly modest mismatch between income and expenses can threaten to send\nthe finances of some families into a downward spiral from which it can be expensive and\n14 The information is from community development visits in 2014.\n15 The SHED is an annual survey, representative of the U.S. population, conducted at the Board of\nGovernors since 2013. It is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm.\n16 The U.S. Financial Diaries project, led by Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, is a detailed,\nethnographic study of financial conditions among low- and moderate-income households. More\ninformation is available on the project’s website at www.usfinancialdiaries.org.\n\n- 7 -\ndifficult to recover. The results of the 2016 SHED show that nearly one-fourth of all\nhouseholds are unable to pay their current month’s bills in full, nearly one-third would\nrely on borrowing or selling something to cover a $400 emergency expense, and one in\neight would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense by any means. Over half of\nhouseholds lack savings to cover three months’ expenses if they lost their main source of\nincome.17 This finding corroborates the evidence found in the financial diaries of low- to\nmoderate-income families that show it is all too common for households to have no short-\nterm savings to cover emergencies. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, on\naverage from 1989 to 2013, about 80 percent of households in the bottom quintile of the\nincome distribution had less than $3,000 adjusted for inflation in liquid assets (cash,\nchecking, or savings accounts). Even among households in the middle quintile of\nincome, about half do not meet this threshold for liquid assets.\nIn addition, the financial crisis demonstrated that household financial imbalances\ncan have important consequences for overall financial stability in extreme circumstances.\nThe rapid and widespread rise in poorly underwritten mortgage debt prior to the Great\nRecession is widely viewed as a key contributor to the financial crisis.18 This suggests\nthe potential value of better understanding the specific patterns in household finances that\nwould give an early warning of a crisis. In carrying out our responsibilities to monitor\nand safeguard the stability of the financial system, although much of the work has\n17 See Board of Governors (2017).\n18 See, for example, Rajan (2010); Dynan (2012); and Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) on how high levels of\nmortgage debt may have made the Great Recession more severe and slowed the recovery. While low-\nincome households were particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the collapse in house prices, rise in\nunemployment, and tightening of credit in the Great Recession, the preceding rise in mortgage debt was\nwidespread, also including higher-income households, as documented by Bhutta (2015) and Adelino,\nSchoar, and Severino (2016).\n\n- 8 -\nfocused on marketwide risks, core financial institutions, and macro-level shocks, we are\nalso developing a more granular understanding of the distribution and strength of\nhousehold balance sheets.19 Progress on this frontier is being aided by greater access to\ntimely, account-level, and geographically specific data on consumer credit, mortgages,\nand spending, although more research in this area would be valuable.\nSlower income growth, as well as substantial volatility in income, has raised the\nfinancial stress faced by low- and moderate-income families and may be limiting absolute\nmobility across generations. Over time, the “American Dream” that each generation can\nexpect to be better off than their parents’ generation has gone from being widespread to\nincreasingly out of reach for much of the population.20 Researchers have found that the\nreduction in economic mobility has been driven primarily by a more unequal distribution\nof economic growth, with slower overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth a\nsecondary factor.21\nMany households had been contending with volatile incomes even before the\nlarge negative shocks of the Great Recession and the increase in contingent work\n19 See, for example, Parker (2014) and Sufi (2014) for useful, research-founded ideas for assessing and\nmonitoring the potential for financial fragility among households in the context of the financial system; see\nalso Palumbo (forthcoming) for a particular application. The Quarterly Report on Household Debt and\nCredit from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which draws on its Consumer Credit Panel, is another\nexample of new monitoring efforts on household finances in the Federal Reserve System. More\ninformation is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html.\n20 Chetty and others (2017) estimate that rates of absolute mobility fell from about 90 percent for children\nborn in 1940 to 50 percent for children born in the 1980s. Some research, such as Winship (2017), reaches\ndifferent conclusions on the magnitude of the change, although not on the direction.\n21 Chetty and others (2017) estimate that the slower overall GDP growth experienced by the 1980 birth\ncohort relative to the 1940 birth cohort can account for about 10 percentage points of the decline in\nabsolute mobility, while the less equal distribution of income can account for about 30 percentage points of\nthe decline. Commenting on this work, Katz and Krueger (2017) underscore that stagnant growth of\nmedian household income since the 1970s has been central to the decline in absolute mobility.\n\n- 9 -\narrangements (and the “gig” economy).22 23 Unpredictable income and dangerously low\nemergency savings raise the strain on households and, over time, have pushed them to\nrely on other means, such as borrowing and government transfers, to try to meet their\nspending needs.24\nEducation and homeownership have long been key paths to opportunity, but the\nGreat Recession has raised some important questions about asset building strategies. The\nsharp decline in house prices and the substantial rise in student loan debt have made it\nclear that investments in homeownership and education are not without risk, and the\npayoff can vary depending on the circumstances.25\nHomeownership for many has been a way to turn a regular expense into an asset-\nbuilding investment in the future, which is especially important given the wide and\npersistent disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity. But the experience of the past\ndecade suggests that owning a home can, in some circumstances, exacerbate financial\ndifficulties for vulnerable families in a downturn. The lesson that even a moderate\ndecline in house prices can erase home equity applies broadly, along with the importance\nof sound underwriting and servicing, but the painful consequences in the recession were\ngreater among minority and low-income homeowners.26 The fact, discussed earlier, that\n22 See Brainard (2016) on the gig economy and the growth of contingent work.\n23 Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2012) documented a rise in household income volatility from the early\n1970s to late 2008. In contrast, studies such as Celik and others (2012) do not find a rise in household\nincome volatility in the 2000s. Koo (2016) shows a rise in earnings volatility in the Great Recession.\nStudies of annual income may even understate the volatility, as the financial diaries showed considerable\nmonth-to-month fluctuations in income among low- and middle-income households.\n24 See Gorbachev (2011).\n25 See Brainard (2015).\n26 Bhutta and Ringo (2015) and the studies discussed therein argue that the Community Reinvestment Act,\nand its encouragement of lending in low- and moderate-income communities, was not a significant\ncontributor to the financial crisis. Well-serviced and correctly-structured mortgages performed well for\nlow-income borrowers even during a decline in house prices.\n\n- 10 -\nAfrican American and Hispanic homeowners households are more likely to lose their\njobs in a recession and are also more likely to live in neighborhoods with concentrated\njob loss led to even larger house price declines and more foreclosures among these\nhouseholds.27 Indeed, there are many low-income neighborhoods in which many\nhomeowners remain “underwater” on their mortgages even today.\nCommunity development organizations are putting this more nuanced view of\nasset building into practice and thereby increasing opportunities for individuals to make\nsmart investments in their future. Better Family Life, a community group I visited in\nNorth St. Louis, provides would-be homebuyers with education and counseling on how to\nmanage the costs of homeownership, tools to navigate real estate markets, and\ninformation on lending.28 There is ample research demonstrating that housing counseling\nmakes a notable improvement in the likelihood that asset building through\nhomeownership will pay off for first-time buyers in low- to moderate-income\ncommunities.29\nSimilarly, under the right circumstances, education can be a critical investment in\nthe future and a path to opportunity, leading to higher wages and improved financial\noutcomes. Over the past several decades, the earnings premium for those with a college\ndegree relative to those with a high school education has risen substantially, making\nhigher education, on average, even more valuable.30\n27 See research by Emmons and Noeth (2015) and the related symposium; more information is available on\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s website at https://www.stlouisfed.org/household-financial-\nstability/events/past-events/does-college-level-the-playing-field. Boshara (2017) provides an overview of\nthe conference findings.\n28 The information is from community development visits in 2015.\n29 See, for example, Collins and Schmeiser (2013) and Smith, Hochberg, and Greene (2014).\n30 See Autor (2014).\n\n- 11 -\nNonetheless, even though education is a sound investment for most students, the\nbenefits can vary with the quality and type of education received.31 The SHED finds that\nfewer than 40 percent of nongraduates or graduates from for-profit institutions say their\neducation was “worth the cost,” compared with two-thirds of graduates from public or\nnonprofit institutions.32 The downsides from such low-return education are compounded\nfor those who took out student loans, in some cases leaving them worse off than before.\nAs an indication of this problem, nearly three-fourths of recent borrowers who attended\nfor-profit schools failed to make progress on paying off their student loans in the first few\nyears, and almost half were in default within five years.33 Investments in education that\ndo not pay off can set these individuals back on asset building as well as on other life\ngoals they may have. To advance more inclusive growth and opportunity, it is essential\nto help people, especially first-time and nontraditional college students, access smarter\neducational investments with more reliable and better returns.34\nCommunities of Opportunity\nThe connection between the conditions in a community and individual\nopportunity has been demonstrated in powerful research that many of you have\npioneered, and we see this connection every day in our work in communities around the\ncountry. The neighborhood where a family lives can have profound implications for their\neconomic opportunities and their children’s prospects. Families living in neighborhoods\nwith high concentrations of poverty and low economic or demographic diversity are more\n31 See Brainard (2015).\n32 See Board of Governors (2017).\n33 See Looney and Yannelis (2015).\n34 See Chou, Looney, and Watson (2017) as an example of research on policy tools that could improve\neducational choices.\n\n- 12 -\nlikely to experience a range of negative outcomes, including exposure to crime and\nviolence, physical and mental health problems, and weak academic performance.35 Low-\nskilled workers who live far from potential employers or accessible transportation\nnetworks have more difficulty finding and keeping jobs.36\nThese effects of geography on opportunity can stretch from one generation to the\nnext. Raj Chetty and his collaborators have shown that upward mobility varies\nimmensely across the country and even within a single metro area.37 Taken together, this\nresearch underscores the urgency of understanding how we can make communities work\nbetter for all their members. Since communities play a central role in determining\nopportunity, policy to promote inclusion often focuses on improving local conditions.\nWith our presence in communities around the country and our efforts under the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve is a source of high-quality research\nand region-specific expertise as well as a trusted convener and catalyst on community\ndevelopment approaches for lenders, community groups, and local and regional\ngovernments.\nOne important area of focus is housing, which connects families concretely to\nplace and can be a source of strength or fragility. Last year, I met with Milwaukee\ncommunity development groups and residents in one of the more racially segregated\n35\nIn an early evaluation of the Moving to Opportunity program, Katz, Kling, and Liebman (2001) find\nimprovements of better neighborhoods on children’s health and safety. Sampson (2016) summarizes much\nof the recent evidence.\n36 Kain (1968) first advanced the “spatial mismatch” hypothesis. More recently, Hellerstein, Neumark, and\nMcInerney (2008) find evidence for a “spatial-racial mismatch”--namely, that employment among low-\nskilled black men depends on proximity to employers who hire black workers.\n37 In one of many studies on opportunity, Chetty and others (2014) use Internal Revenue Service tax return\ndata from 40 million adult children to estimate the relative upward mobility across the 741 commuting\nzones (both metro and rural) in the United States.\n\n- 13 -\nresidential markets in the country. They highlighted the challenges facing the highly\ninsecure rental population in Milwaukee, which were brought alive by Matthew\nDesmond’s careful research.38 Other communities across the nation face similar\nchallenges. In the recently released SHED, we found that among renters who had\nrecently moved, 12 percent of African Americans, 16 percent of Hispanics, and 8 percent\nof whites had moved because of eviction or the threat of eviction.39\nThe barriers to safe and affordable housing often take on a different form in rural\nareas, where ownership of manufactured housing is often coupled with insecure land\nownership. The geographic footprint of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts gives us a\nvaluable presence in rural America as well as in towns and cities of all sizes and\neconomic fortunes. Near El Paso, our team has developed important analysis of housing\nchallenges in the colonias neighborhoods, where the lack of basic infrastructure and\ncostly financing of warranty deeds pose special hurdles for local families.40 We have\nalso seen successful models of providing affordable and safe housing when community\ndevelopment organizations and financial institutions, along with banks and local\nresidents, work together collaboratively. On a recent visit in El Paso, I saw the value of\nthese approaches, as a single mother with significant health challenges received the keys\nto a new home in a stable community, after many long years. While the densely wooded\nhills and hollers of Eastern Kentucky are a sharp contrast to the desert and floodplain\nexpanses of the southwest, the keys to affordable housing in a healthy community can\nbring just as great an improvement in opportunity. These successes would not be\n38 See Desmond (2016).\n39 See Board of Governors (2017).\n40 See Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Community Development Department (2015).\n\n- 14 -\npossible without the ingenuity and collaboration of community development financial\ninstitutions, local officials, banks, and community members. As I have witnessed,\nwhether it be for a retiree in Helena, Arkansas; a single mom in El Paso, Texas; or a dad\non disability in Emlyn, Kentucky, the keys to affordable housing in a stable community\ncan unlock opportunity for future generations.41\nIn some parts of the country, rural residents and small businesses also face\nincreasing challenges in accessing financial services as small community banks close and\nlarger banks close branches in low-population areas. Consequently, as I learned from the\nMayors of Itta Bena and Moorhead, Mississippi, some rural residents, small businesses,\nand even municipalities have to drive long distances to reach a bank.42 In the Mississippi\nDelta, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) such as HOPE Credit\nUnion and Southern Bancorp are acquiring bank branches earmarked for closing in order\nto maintain financial services for some rural communities.43\nAlthough both pockets of opportunity and of persistent poverty are found in large\nmetro and rural areas alike, 44 a greater share of the new jobs and business establishments\ncreated in the recovery following the Great Recession have been in larger metro areas\nthan was the case in previous recoveries.45 In countless communities, especially in rural\ntowns and small to midsize cities, we have seen how a deep setback can leave a profound\nand long-lasting mark. These experiences challenge common assumptions about the\nability of the economy to recover from an economic setback. This could be the legacy of\n41 Community visits in El Paso (2016), Mississippi Delta (2016), and Eastern Kentucky (2017),\n42 Discussions with Mayor Collins of Itta Bena, Mississippi and Mayor Holland of Moorhead, Mississippi\n(2016).\n43 Community Development visit in Mississippi Delta (2016).\n44 See Goetz, Partridge, and Stephens (2017).\n45 See Economic Innovation Group (2016).\n\n- 15 -\nconcentrated reliance on an industry that experiences decline due to trade or technology\nor the byproduct of lack of connectivity-whether by highways or broadband.\nTechnological change, globalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to\nthe U.S. economy, but there are troubling signs that less diversified or more isolated\nlocalities have diminished ability to recover. And there is increasing evidence that such\nconcentrated economic shocks can also lead to severe labor market stress, as well as\nbroader consequences for health and mortality.46 Over the past 30 years, the convergence\nin income across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.47\nEven so, some localities fare better than others in establishing new paths to\nopportunity and inclusive growth, and their successes provide actionable lessons. The\nBoston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge undertook an in depth study of 25 medium-sized\ncities nationwide that had experienced a post-industrial decline and identified 10 that\nexperienced an economic resurgence. The critical determinant of success was the ability\nof leaders in those cities to collaborate across sectors around a long-term vision for\nrevitalization. To encourage such collaboration in other cities, the Boston Fed facilitated\ncompetitions that reward effective public-private collaboration in developing plans to\nreach community-wide goals. For example, Holyoke, Massachusetts, proposed a plan to\nsimplify the city’s permitting and licensing systems in order to raise the presence of\nLatino-owned businesses. On economic revitalization, as in other areas of community\ndevelopment, effective solutions start with the community setting its own goals, are\npowered by broad collaboration, and rely on evidence to drive results.\n46 See Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016).\n47 See Ganong and Shoag (2015) and references therein.\n\n- 16 -\nConclusion\nWe all have our work cut out for us in helping to understand the state of\nopportunity and inclusion for different groups and communities across our country, and\nensuring that policy is informed by those important insights. At the Federal Reserve, we\nwill continue to navigate the recovery to ensure we reach and sustain our long-term goals\nof maximum employment and price stability. We will remain attentive to the financial\nhealth of vulnerable households. And we will remain committed to helping illuminate\nthe specific challenges faced by low- and moderate-income communities around the\ncountry and to supporting banks and other financial institutions as they partner in\nstrengthening these communities. In all of these efforts, our work will be greatly\nstrengthened by the cutting-edge research and policy insights of the outstanding group\ngathered here tonight.\n\n- 17 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G.

The subject we are tackling today--the evolution of work--is a\nparticular interest of mine and is a matter of great importance to the Federal Reserve.\nThe Congress has mandated the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy so as to\npromote maximum employment and stable prices. Our dual mandate recognizes the\nimportance of work in enabling people to contribute to the financial security of their\nfamily and the prosperity of their community and the country overall. Moreover, there is\na long-standing recognition that secure and dignified work provides a key sense of\npurpose and worth. Understanding the changing nature of employment in today’s\neconomy is not only central to the mission of the Federal Reserve, but also goes to the\ncore of who we are as providers for our families and productive members of society.1\nIn contrast to traditional work arrangements, in which an employee has a durable\nemployment relationship with a single primary employer, a large and growing proportion\nof the workforce is working through contracting, temporary arrangements, on-call\narrangements, or as freelancers being hired for episodic “gigs.” Broadly speaking,\ncontingent arrangements are more transitory than traditional arrangements, in the extreme\nconsisting of a single transaction or gig. They often provide considerably greater\nflexibility than long-term employment contracts, allowing workers and employers to\nmove in and out of work relationships easily. Depending on the nature of the\nemployment relationship, this enhanced flexibility could have benefits and costs that\naccrue to workers and employers very differently.\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nAlthough they have always been a feature of the American economic landscape,\nthere has been a sharp increase in the prevalence of contingent working arrangements\nover the past decade, and it is too early to tell how much of this acceleration is a cyclical\nphenomenon associated with the Great Recession or reflects a structural trend. The\ngrowing share and variety of contingent work has important implications for policy and\nputs a premium on data and research exploring this topic. For monetary policy, the\ngrowth of contingent work affects the way we assess maximum employment and the way\nwe interpret important labor market outcomes, such as the level of part-time employment\nand aggregate hours worked. Depending on the contractual arrangements, it may also\nhave important implications for economic security and the behavior of households as\nconsumers and savers. Richer and timely data and analysis could help guide employers,\nworkers, and public officials toward outcomes where benefits and risks are better\nunderstood and managed.\nWhat Do We Know about Contingent Work?\nOfficial measures of the changing nature of work have not kept pace with the\nevolution of the economy. But thanks to some cutting-edge researchers, several of whom\nare present today, there is a growing foundation of analysis.\nLast year, Larry Katz and Alan Krueger conducted a version of the Contingent\nWorker Survey (CWS) to track alternative and nonstandard work arrangements using the\nRAND American Life Panel.2 Their findings are striking: Over the past decade,\ncontingent workers have increased by roughly one-half and now make up 16 percent of\nthe workforce. This rapid increase is in marked contrast to the preceding decade, when\n2 The Contingent Worker Survey is the main survey used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for tracking\nalternative and nonstandard work. The survey was last fielded in 2005.\n\n- 3 -\ncontingent workers remained at a relatively stable 10 percent of the workforce, according\nto the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) CWS.3 They conclude that all of the net growth\nin aggregate employment in the decade leading up to 2015 can be accounted for by\ncontingent work arrangements, which means there has been no net employment growth in\ntraditional work arrangements. Given that this period spanned the Great Recession and\nthe first five years of a slow recovery, it naturally raises the question of how much of the\nlarge recent shift toward contingent work is attributable to cyclical factors, as opposed to\nstructural forces that may be here to stay.4\nLong before the advent of firms such as Uber and TaskRabbit, many individuals\nworked in contingent arrangements, such as freelancing and contracting, and it is these\ngroups that have increased their share of the workforce most notably over the past\ndecade. The largest increase in contingent work over this time has been among workers\nwhose services are contracted out by another company, which rose from 0.6 percent to\n3.1 percent of the workforce. There was also a large increase in workers who are\nindependent contractors, consultants, or freelancers, whose share grew from 6.9 percent\nin 2005 to 8.4 percent in 2015. On-call workers expanded from 1.7 percent to 2.6 percent\nof the workforce.5\n3 See Katz and Krueger (2016).\n4 The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) study of the contingent workforce shows an increase\nof 5 percentage points in the share of contingent work arrangements, although this shift took place from\n2006 to 2010. The GAO’s definition of contingent work covers a much larger share of the workforce,\n40.4 percent in 2010, than the CWS. See U.S. Government Accountability Office (2015).\nIn the same vein, a 2014 survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that roughly 44 percent of\nits survey’s respondents participated in some informal paid work activity during the previous two years.\nSee Bracha and Burke (2014).\n5 See Katz and Krueger (2016).\n\n- 4 -\nOver this same period, technological platforms have emerged that are\ntransforming the way people identify, schedule, and engage in contingent work and are\nalso helping people to monetize their assets to generate income. These developments,\nunder the rubric of the “gig,” “on-demand,” “platform,” or “sharing” economy, have the\npotential to be transformative. Although the data are still relatively sparse, it appears that\nthe number of workers using online platforms to secure gigs is still small but is growing\nquickly.6 Katz and Krueger found that workers who provide services through three\nonline intermediaries accounted for only 0.5 percent of all workers in 2015. Diana\nFarrell and Fiona Greig (2016) reach a similar conclusion, using a unique and rich data\nset.7\nThe Federal Reserve Board fielded a survey to better understand the many ways\nadults are generating income, regardless of their employment status and the frequency of\nthese activities. The survey uses an expansive concept of contingent work, capturing all\nof the activity individuals are undertaking to generate income. The Enterprising and\nInformal Work Activity survey, or EIWA, suggests that more than a third--36 percent--of\nthe adult population undertook informal paid work activity either as a complement to, or\nas a substitute for, more traditional and formal work arrangements.8 Similarly, a survey\n6 See Harris and Krueger (2015).\n7 By contrast, studies conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 2013 and 2015 found that\napproximately one in four respondents--or more than half of informal work participants--say they earned\nmoney through informal work activities conducted online. See Bracha, Burke, and Khachiyan (2015).\n8 See Robles and McGee (2016).\nSome informal workers in the EIWA would not meet the definition of employment in the Current\nPopulation Survey (CPS) either because they did not do work in the CPS reference week (the EIWA asks\nabout activities over the past six months, not during the reference week) or because they would not\ncategorize the covered activities (such as the occasional selling of goods or renting of property) as work.\n\n- 5 -\nundertaken by Upwork and the Freelancers Union that also uses an expansive definition\nof contingent work finds that 35 percent of the labor force engages in freelance work.9\nThe Upwork survey provides further insight by subdividing the 35 percent of the\nlabor force who have done some form of informal work over the past 12 months into five\ncategories. In the categories most comparable with the Katz and Krueger CWS\ncategories, roughly 12 percent of the workforce identify as independent contractors who\ndo not have an employer and engage in project-by-project work, whereas between 2 and\n3 percent are traditional contract or temporary workers who have a single employer or\nproject at a time and whose work status is temporary. By contrast, roughly half of the\nUpwork respondents do informal work in addition to traditional employment\nrelationships; almost 10 percent derive their income from multiple different types of\narrangements, including both traditional employment relationships and freelancing, while\nabout 9 percent report having a full-time traditional job and “moonlighting” to gain\nadditional income on top of that. The group that derives income from multiple different\ntypes of jobs has evidenced the fastest growth over the last few years covered by the\nsurvey. In addition, 2.5 percent identify as business owners.\nFinally, the EIWA survey provides valuable insights into the use of recent\ntechnologies in informal work. The EIWA survey suggests that over the previous six\nmonths, roughly 11 percent of adults in the United States have engaged in paid services\n9 The Upwork survey encompasses an expansive set of contingent work arrangements, even if only\nintermittent, over the past 12 months, and the EIWA encompasses a similar scope over the past 6 months,\nwhile Katz and Krueger confine their focus to the Current Population Survey reference week, similar to the\nBLS CWS. In addition, the Upwork definition is similar to the EIWA in counting as informal workers\nthose individuals with traditional full- or part-time work who also engage in some informal work, in\ncontrast to Katz and Krueger and the BLS CWS, which try to differentiate those workers who\npredominantly engage in contingent work.\n\n- 6 -\nusing an online platform, such as arranging transportation activities with companies such\nas Uber, arranging work opportunities on sites like Care.com, Amazon Mechanical Turk,\nor TaskRabbit, generating projects through companies such as Fiverr, selling goods and\ncrafts on sites such as eBay and Etsy, and renting rooms or homes through services like\nAirbnb, among others.10 This figure is much larger than the Katz and Krueger finding of\n0.5 percent, partly because the EIWA survey was fielded to all adults regardless of their\nformal employment status, asked about all online paid services, and used a six-month\nlook-back period, rather than the past week.\nWho Is Engaging in Contingent Work and Why?\nTogether, these recent surveys of informal work paint a varied picture of the\nuniverse of informal work arrangements, along with participants’ motivations for\nengaging in them. Nineteen percent of informal workers in the EIWA survey, for\nexample, were engaged in three or more online and/or offline informal paid work\nactivities in the prior six months, and 25 percent indicated that informal and contingent\nwork activities have been “very much” or “somewhat” a regular and consistent source of\ntheir monthly income.\nResults regarding the ages of workers attracted to nontraditional work vary: Katz\nand Krueger find that the share of contingent work arrangements increases with age,\nwhile the Upwork study finds that freelancing is more prevalent among the young. The\nearnings experiences of contingent workers appear to span a wide range. Katz and\nKrueger find that those engaged in contingent work tend to be concentrated in the highest\n10 A study by the McKinsey Global Institute suggests that 15 percent of independent workers in the United\nStates and the European Union participate in online informal work activities. See Manyika and\nothers (2016).\n\n- 7 -\nincome quintiles. But while independent contractors and contract workers earn relatively\nhigh wages, on-call and temporary-help work tends to occur among workers in lower\nwage quintiles.\nOne common theme that emerges is the desire to earn extra money, which is a\nprimary motivation for 74 percent of part-time, and 68 percent of full-time, freelancers in\nthe Upwork survey. Similarly, in the EIWA survey, 65 percent of informal workers\nreported that earning income was their main reason for engaging in informal and\ncontingent work, and the EIWA provides many examples that corroborate this result.11 A\nfull-time restaurant cook in his 50s, reports that he does yard work and sells items both\nonline and offline to earn extra income and to help family members. He averages 60\nhours per month from side and gig work and reported that these earnings constitute 75\npercent of his household’s monthly earnings. Similarly, a respondent in her 20s works\npart time as a dental hygienist and supplements this employment with about 8 hours per\nmonth of additional gig work. She said that the gig work somewhat mitigated the effect\nof the Great Recession, which found her working fewer hours, with stagnant wages and a\nloss of benefits.\nFor others, work-life balance considerations seem to play a significant role in\nchoosing contingent work arrangements. For example, a mother in her 20s reported\nspending 12 hours per month selling self-crafted items online, babysitting, and\ncompleting online tasks, collectively providing about 20 percent of her family’s income.\nShe reported that her main reason for participating in the gig economy is to be home with\nher daughter.\n11 The responses to the survey were anonymous and confidential.\n\n- 8 -\nMany others find themselves in highly variable work arrangements not by\npreference but because of the requirements of their employers. As employers have\noutsourced noncore tasks to contract firms and moved to technologically enabled “just-\nin-time” scheduling of employees, contract workers and on-call workers have had to\nadjust to variable and sometimes unpredictable hours.\nAs these stories indicate, there are a variety of reasons workers engage in\nalternative and nonstandard work arrangements. Many individuals use the flexibility and\nenhanced connectivity of new technology-enabled platforms to pursue expanded\nopportunities. While some supplement their traditional job, using their free time to earn\nextra income, others cobble together contingent work arrangements or gigs to generate\nnecessary income in the absence of traditional work opportunities. Still others move into\ncontingent work arrangements due to their employers’ work requirements. While some\nworkers seem to appreciate the greater opportunities contingent work arrangements\nprovide, others engage in this work out of necessity because they appear unable to obtain\na full-time traditional work arrangement that meets their needs. Overall, the Upwork\nstudy finds that 63 percent of freelancers say they are pursuing this type of work by\nchoice, while 37 percent do it out of necessity. It is unclear whether this outcome would\nhold true of the more tightly defined population in the Katz and Krueger survey.\nImplications of a Growing Gig Economy\nIf market forces and technology are driving the growing prevalence of gig work,\nthese trends will likely continue, and policymakers must better understand these changes.\nA natural starting point is measurement. There is some good news on this front, as the\nBLS is preparing to field a CWS in May 2017 for the first time since 2005.\n\n- 9 -\nBetter data should help deepen our understanding of how the growth of contingent\nwork is changing the behavior of workers and employers and what these developments\nimply for the overall economy and household welfare. From a macroeconomic\nperspective, we should be attuned to the possibility that the growth in flexible work\narrangements may alter the natural rate of employment and how the labor market reacts\nto shocks as we assess the cyclical behavior of important aggregates--such as labor force\nparticipation, employment, hours worked, and underemployment.\nOne possibility is that new technologies, by lowering the barriers to workforce\nentry, could raise employment and labor force participation. Because there are fixed\ncosts to obtaining and maintaining a job--such as searching for the job, learning about the\njob, and traveling to the job site every workday--the traditional work arrangement\nembeds incentives for individuals to work only one job, thus minimizing these fixed\ncosts. And for those individuals who desire to work relatively few hours, these fixed\ncosts in the past may have led to a decision to remain out of the labor force. But if\ntechnology makes it less costly for individuals to find work, manage multiple work\nrelationships, and flexibly work more or fewer hours as their schedule permits, this could\nsignificantly increase workers’ options and have important effects on labor market\nbehavior. Importantly, any such increases in participation and employment would likely\nbe structural, not cyclical, enabling the economy to run at a sustainably higher level.\nNew technologies could also make it easier for individuals’ actual hours to match\ntheir desired hours of work in a day or a week. Instead of seeing hours per week bunched\naround 40, we may see greater variation in the hours that individuals work. Lower\nbarriers to workforce entry may make it more attractive for more individuals to work only\n\n- 10 -\na few hours a week if they desire--and can afford--to do so. At the same time, by making\nit easier to find additional work, new technologies may lead to more individuals working\ngreater-than-full-time hours every week. In addition, we may see individuals changing\nthe number of hours they work more frequently, as these changes become less costly.\nBoth the EIWA and Upwork surveys confirm that gig work does, indeed, lower barriers\nto workforce entry and increase hours and flexibility for some individuals.\nThe increasing prevalence of gig work may also affect the unemployment rate and\nproductivity. To the extent that gigs provide an easy entryway to employment,\nunemployment may decrease. However, if gig work is less stable, it may increase job\nloss. The net effect on unemployment is, thus, unclear. Regarding productivity, gig\nwork could lower aggregate productivity to the extent that it requires less human capital\nor specialized knowledge than traditional jobs, or if it primarily increases hours worked\nby lower-skilled individuals. That said, gig work, especially when enabled by new\ntechnologies, may allow hours to respond more flexibly to changes in demand and\nindividuals to more easily connect with many different clients or employers. As a result,\nworkers’ downtime and the time required to acquire new clients and manage existing\nclients may decrease, in which case resource utilization and productivity may increase.\nIt is also possible that the increasing prevalence of gig work will cause the\ncyclical behavior of unemployment, participation, and the workweek to change, with\nimplications for how we assess the amount of slack. We know that contingent work\nincreases when the economy worsens. If new technologies make it easier to find gig\nwork, then we could see unemployment rise less in recessions, to the extent that gig\nworkers are counted as employed. However, it could be that individuals who are able to\n\n- 11 -\navoid unemployment through contingent work would still be underemployed if it is\ndifficult to cobble together enough gigs to achieve full-time employment. This would\nlikely show up as lower average workweeks and higher levels of involuntary part-time\nemployment during downturns. As a result, cyclical changes in resource utilization could\nbe reflected less in movements in the unemployment rate and more in variation in hours\nper worker.\nBeyond the behavior of macroeconomic variables, it is unclear how the growth of\ndifferent types of gig work affects the welfare of workers. Welfare should increase in\ncases where gig work meets the needs of workers by providing a low-barrier means of\naccessing employment and by allowing workers to better match actual hours worked with\ndesired hours of work, especially if the gig work is available at times and in places where\ntraditional work opportunities are in short supply.\nThere is some evidence that this has, indeed, been the case. For example,\n24 percent of informal workers in the EIWA survey indicated that contingent work had\noffset their spells of unemployment, loss of working hours, loss of benefits, or frozen\nwages in their formal employment “very much” or “somewhat.” In addition, three-\nfourths of Uber drivers say that the greater control over their work schedules that Uber\nallows has made their lives better.12\nHowever, there are likely many workers who would prefer regular full-time\ntraditional work to contingent work, particularly if much of the power in determining\nhours worked in alternative work arrangements belongs to the employer. Technological\nadvances have enabled firms to use just-in-time strategies for their employees, making\n12 See Hall and Krueger (2015).\n\n- 12 -\nthem in effect on-call workers. This is a rising trend in industries such as retail and food\npreparation. Several recent articles describe the challenges faced by these just-in-time\nworkers, who must conform their hours to the daily and even hourly ebbs and flows of\nbusiness, often not knowing whether they will have work on a given day until they call in\nthat morning to inquire.13 These arrangements can leave workers scrambling to patch\ntogether child care, elder care, and transportation to meet the often unpredictable\ndemands of their workplace, while making it difficult to engage in regularly scheduled\nactivities to enhance their income and opportunities, such as a second job or career\ntraining. While such workers often are not given full-time work, they often must make\nthemselves available to work full-time hours. According to one survey, 71 percent of\nretail workers in New York stated that their hours fluctuated from week to week, while\nhalf said their employers could change their hours at will.14 It is also notable that the\nincrease in contingent work over the past decade has coincided with an increase of\none-third in the share of employees working part time but who would prefer to work full\ntime from 3 percent prior to the Great Recession to close to 4 percent today.\nIn addition, contingent workers may receive lower wages, less training, and fewer\nbenefits than their counterparts with traditional jobs. Typically, the wages of low-skilled\nemployees within a company are boosted by social norms regarding pay equity, and\nnonpecuniary benefits are often equalized across a company’s employees, in certain cases\nas mandated by law.15 However, the wages that contractors receive are unlikely to reflect\nthe same equity considerations. Moreover, contingent work generally does not offer\n13 See Ansel (2015) and Carrillo and others (2016).\n14\nThe 2011 survey was conducted by the Retail Action Project, cited in Wessler (2014).\n15 Regulations stipulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Affordable Care Act\ngenerally mandate equal benefits provision of pension and health insurance plans across employees.\n\n- 13 -\nemployer-based benefits and workplace protections that come with traditional\nemployment opportunities, like overtime compensation, minimum wage protections,\nhealth insurance, family leave, employer-sponsored retirement plans, workers’\ncompensation, and paid sick leave.\nAs a result, for some, contingent work may entail greater risks than in traditional\nfull-time employment, with more variable and less predictable hours and earnings. The\nUpwork study notes that one of freelancers’ biggest concerns is managing income\nvariability and benefits. For lower-income workers, unpredictable fluctuations in income\ncan lead to severe hardship. The Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household\nEconomics and Decisionmaking, for example, finds that 46 percent of households report\nthat they would need to borrow money or sell something in order to pay an unexpected\nexpense of $400.16\nThese findings suggest that employers, policymakers, and workers should seek\nways to help individuals better manage the risks inherent in most forms of contingent\nwork. For example, we may need to enhance social safety net programs, such as\nunemployment and disability insurance, to better support some types of contingent work.\nAnother possibility is to make benefits, such as health insurance and retirement saving,\nportable across different employers. We may also want to encourage the additional\nsaving that many contingent workers need to ensure that their basic consumption needs\nare not sacrificed when demand for their work declines, perhaps by providing monetary\nor other types of incentives.\n16 The survey is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/shed.htm.\n\n- 14 -\nClosing Thoughts\nThe apparent trend toward contingent work has recently coincided with new\nadvances in technology that can potentially amplify this trend and push it in new\ndirections. We are still at an early stage in these developments, and it is too soon to say\nhow these changes will play out. But the effects on the labor market could be long\nlasting and significant. Taking into account the potentially varied effects of the rising\nprevalence of gig work on household welfare, public policy should strive to maximize the\nbenefits of the greater flexibility and lower entry barriers provided by advances in\ntechnology, while addressing the risks that currently accompany many forms of gig\nemployment. Going forward, better data will be necessary, along with detailed research\nand analysis, in order to enable workers, employers, and policymakers to guide these\nchanges in the labor market in a direction that ensures the benefits are broadly shared and\nthe risks are well understood and well managed.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nAnsel, Bridget (2015). “The Pitfalls of Just-in-Time Scheduling,” Washington Center for\nEquitable Growth, January 27, http://equitablegrowth.org/equitablog/pitfalls-just-\ntime-scheduling.\nBracha, Anat, and Mary A.

    "text": "December 01, 2020\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt The Chicago Community Trust, Chicago, Illinois\n\nGood morning. I want to thank Dr. Helene Gayle for inviting me to join this conversation, along with the staff, grantees, and partners of the Chicago Community Trust and President Charlie Evans of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss economic inclusion and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and learn more about the Trust's work with its partners in Chicago. 1\n\nThe effect of COVID-19 has underscored the importance and urgency of your work. This year the Chicago Community COVID-19 Response Fund has helped many of the nonprofits and communities hardest hit by the pandemic, and I know you have been thinking critically about doing this work in a way that supports an equitable recovery for Black and Latinx communities. 2 I commend the Trust for your leadership on these principles.\n\nThe disproportionate effects of the pandemic on low-income and minority households and the importance of an equitable recovery are also a key focus of the Federal Reserve. While creating hardship for all, the pandemic has inflicted disproportionate economic pain on vulnerable businesses, sectors, and demographic groups, which risks entrenching a K-shaped recovery that is weaker overall. Small businesses in consumer-facing sectors, along with many low-income workers, women workers, and Black and Hispanic workers, are at a precarious stage of the pandemic. Even as we are buoyed by news that effective vaccines may be widely available by next summer, COVID case counts are resurgent, and many low- and moderate-income households are facing the exhaustion of unemployment benefits, the depletion of savings from CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) programs, and the fear that eviction moratoriums and forbearance for mortgages and student loans will soon end. While the Paycheck Protection Program provided some relief to many small businesses earlier in the year, that sector remains under pressure, and many small businesses in sectors hit hard by virus restrictions are facing dwindling cash buffers. In addition, states and localities are confronting difficult choices as they respond to increased needs in the face of reduced revenues. The combination of highly supportive fiscal policy and monetary policy was critical in driving the initial strong bounceback from the first wave of the pandemic. 3 Similarly today, it is vitally important to provide a lifeline to hard-hit households and businesses facing the harsh reality of a resurgent COVID second wave as a bridge to the time an effective vaccine will be widely available.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to providing sustained accommodation through its forward rate guidance and continued asset purchases to achieve our maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation goals. In parallel, additional fiscal support is essential to bridge past COVID's second wave in order to avoid labor market scarring, reductions in crucial state and local services, and bankruptcies. Such additional support is critical to turn this K-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery that is stronger overall.\n\nAs we support a broad-based and inclusive recovery, the Board is focused on updating and strengthening CRA regulations to better meet their core purpose. You know the associated challenges well, given the Trust's mission to close the racial and ethnic wealth gap and the role you play in fostering opportunity and inclusion in communities across Chicago. The CRA was enacted in response to inequities in access to credit for communities that were redlined as a result of discriminatory government policies and market practices. Now, in light of the persistence of systemic credit disparities and in response to changes in the banking landscape, it is time to strengthen and modernize the CRA.\n\nIn September, we proposed a framework for reforming the CRA that would advance the following principles. 4 First and foremost, the CRA should focus on addressing credit disparities and financial inclusion in low- and moderate-income and minority communities to fulfill its core purpose. One way our proposal addresses this first principle is by emphasizing minority depository institutions and community development finance institutions, and we are continuing to look for more ways to achieve this goal. Our proposal also makes a special effort to address the challenges of underserved rural communities.\n\nA related goal is to ensure that the CRA encourages banks to meet the broad spectrum of credit needs of communities. Our proposal considers how to evaluate banks across a number of areas, such as a bank's retail lending, which includes their home mortgages and small business loans. It also focuses on essential banking products and services like low-cost checking accounts. Community development activities are another point of emphasis, including financing for affordable housing and other needs, or volunteer activities, such as financial counseling, and providing clearer and stronger incentives to invest in the areas of need that lie outside of existing branch-based assessment areas.\n\nAnother key objective is to provide greater certainty; tailor regulations based on local community needs, bank size, and business model; and minimize burden. Ultimately, we hope that our proposal provides a foundation for the three banking agencies to converge on a consistent approach that has broad support among stakeholders.\n\nThe next step for us is to continue to gather feedback on our proposal from a wide range of stakeholders, including local communities. In addition to participating in conversations like this one today, we hope to receive as many comments as possible through our formal comment process, which has a deadline of February 16, 2021. We value this feedback tremendously, and our proposal includes specific questions where we are especially interested in input. Given the expertise and leadership of the Trust on racial equity, we will be particularly interested in your comments on the second question in our proposal: \"In considering how the CRA's history and purpose relate to the nation's current challenges, how can we strengthen the CRA to address ongoing systemic inequity in credit access for minority individuals and communities?\"\n\nI thank you for your valuable engagement in this process thus far and look forward to hearing your ideas today and in the months to come. With your continued engagement, I am confident we can come together on a stronger approach to the CRA that will benefit communities across the country.\n\n1.

Recent research indicates that the government's response offset what could have been a surge in income poverty. Han, Meyer, and Sullivan (2020) found that income poverty declined about 1.5 percentage points, and that government programs, including the regular unemployment insurance program, the expanded unemployment insurance programs, and the Economic Impact Payments, account for more than the entire decline in poverty, which would have risen over 2.5 percentage points in the absence of these programs.

    "text": "May 11, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt \"The Road to Recovery and What's Next,\" a virtual conference sponsored by the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing (via webcast)\n\nI want to thank Heather Long and the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing for inviting me to join you today. 1\n\nStrong fiscal support and increasing vaccination rates drove a strong rebound in activity in the first quarter, and the second quarter looks to be even stronger. The outlook is bright, but uncertainty remains, and employment and inflation are far from our goals. While more balanced than earlier this year, risks remain from vaccine hesitancy, deadlier variants, and a resurgence of cases in some foreign countries. The latest jobs report is a reminder that the path of reopening and recoveryâlike the shutdownâis likely to be uneven and difficult to predict, so basing monetary policy on outcomes rather than the outlook will serve us well.\n\nWith the renewal of fiscal support, real disposable personal income surged 61 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter after a decline of 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) jumped 10.7 percent, supporting a robust 6.4 percent growth rate in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, despite a large runoff of inventories amid supply chain bottlenecks.\n\nThe second quarter appears primed to exceed the strong first quarter as progress on vaccinations continues, and more consumers return to the sectors adversely affected by COVID-19. 2 The combination of fiscal support and depressed discretionary services spending during the shutdown have enabled households to accumulate considerable savings that could continue to fuel spending. Personal savings rose to 21 percent in the first quarter, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data, on top of the $2.1 trillion increase in household liquid assets reflected at the end of last year. 3\n\nWhile the incoming spending data, elevated household savings, and progress on vaccinations point to a very strong modal outlook, there is greater than usual uncertainty about the economy's path. For instance, the strength of domestic demand this year relative to next will depend on how quickly or slowly a large share of accumulated household savings is spent out. This, in turn, hinges in part on the distribution of household savings and how much is concentrated among households who are less likely to spend, perhaps because their services consumption returns only to pre-COVID levels or their near-term demand for durable goods has largely been satiated. 4\n\nThere is also uncertainty about how much of the strong domestic aggregate demand will leak abroad rather than translating into domestic output. As supply chain and shipping bottlenecks ease, international spillovers could lead to some slippage between the increase in domestic demand and domestic resource utilization.\n\nIn addition, some of this year's tailwinds are likely to become next year's headwinds. While the fiscal support provided to households is raising consumer spending and GDP this year, the absence of similar transfers will lower the growth rate of spending next year relative to this year. The boost to spending from pent up demand this year as the economy reopens is also unlikely to be repeated next year.\n\nThe latest jobs report reminds us that while there are good reasons to expect the number of jobs and the number of people wanting to work will make a full recovery, it is unlikely they will recover at the same pace. Over the past few months, the demand for workers has strengthened as COVID-affected sectors have reopened. Labor supply has also improved, with many people coming back into the labor force and others extending their hours of work, but there are indications that many other workers still face virus-related impediments. Although the fraction of the population ages 25 to 54 that is employed has improved in each month of this year, the current prime-age employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio of 76.9 percent is still far from the 80 percent level reached during both of the past two expansions. 5\n\nOn the demand side, we saw a welcome increase of 331,000 jobs in the hard-hit leisure and hospitality sector in April following a 206,000 increase in March. But bottlenecks on inputs such as semiconductors appear to be limiting production and hiring in industries such as motor vehicles, contributing to a decline of 18,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector. The increase in average hours worked and the reduction in people who are working part time but would prefer full-time work suggest some employers are responding to the increase in demand by lengthening workweeks.\n\nOn the supply side, the number of people entering the labor force strengthened for the second month in a row in a welcome sign that more people are actively seeking work as job opportunities and vaccinations increase. But we are also hearing anecdotal accounts that many people face virus-related impediments in returning to full-time work, and many businesses face hiring challenges. With less than one-in-four individuals ages 18 to 64 fully vaccinated at the end of the survey period for the April jobs report, health and safety concerns remain important for in-person work and for people relying on public transport, and childcare remains a challenge for many parents. 6\n\nChildcare remains an impediment for many parents because the return to fully in-person school is still incomplete and childcare options are still limited in many areas. 7 At the time of the April jobs report, nearly two-thirds of students had yet to return to fully in-person schooling, and this share had only increased by 8 percentage points since March. 8 Consistent with this, the labor force participation rate of women ages 25 to 45 was unchanged in April, after an increase in March that coincided with a surge in education hiring and school reopening. Similarly, April saw a small increase in the number of women who reported that they wanted a job but were out of the labor force for family responsibilities, following a large decline in March. 9 Recent research shows that the pandemic has taken a particularly significant toll on the labor market status of many Black and Hispanic mothers and mothers with lower incomes. 10\n\nAggregate average hourly earnings increased by 0.7 percent in April in a positive development for workers. Wage increases were broadly distributed across sectors, including an increase of more than 1-1/2 percent, month over month, in hourly earnings in the leisure and hospitality sector.\n\nWhile labor market conditions have improved in aggregate, significant disparities persist. Although the prime-age EPOP ratio has increased for all racial groups over the past four months, the ratio for Black prime-age workers, at 72.1 percent, is still over 6 percentage points lower than the white prime-age EPOP ratio, while the gap for Hispanic prime-age workers relative to white workers is almost 5 percentage points.\n\nJob losses are disproportionately concentrated in low-wage, high-contact sectors, suggesting that the workers least able to shoulder the economic effect of job loss have faced the greatest challenges. Despite the more than 900,000 jobs gained in the leisure and hospitality sector in the first four months of 2021, jobs in this sector remain nearly 3 million below their pre-COVID level. The leisure and hospitality sector alone accounts for 41 percent of the net loss in private payrolls since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThere is good reason to expect a strong rebound in employment over coming quarters, although the different forces affecting demand and supply may lead to uneven rates of progress. But today, by any measure, employment remains far from our goals. The unemployment rate remains elevated at 8.9 percent when we adjust the narrow 6.1 percent U-3 measure of unemployment to also reflect workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started and those who are misclassified. As of the latest reading, there is an employment shortfall of 8.2 million relative to the pre-pandemic level, and the employment shortfall is over 10 million if we take into account the secular job growth that would have occurred over the period since February 2020 in normal circumstances. 11\n\nThe path of inflation is also difficult to predict, although there are a variety of reasons to expect an increase in inflation associated with reopening that is largely transitory. Most immediately, base effects are likely to contribute substantially to the 12-month readings of headline and core PCE inflation in April and May as the price declines of March and April 2020 roll out of the 12-month calculation. I also anticipate that the recent surge in energy prices, which contributed about 1/2 percentage point to the March 12-month headline PCE reading, will fade over time, although recent pipeline disruptions add some uncertainty.\n\nIt is much more difficult to predict the size and duration of supply-side bottlenecks and how these will interact with the pattern of demand to feed through into inflation. The production of certain semiconductors may take some time to ramp up, and the feedback effects between shipping delays and container shortages appear to be only slowly working themselves out. In contrast, the manufacturing capacity taken offline by the harsh weather in Texas in February is coming back online rapidly. If past experience is any guide, production will rise to meet the level of goods demand before too long. The supplyâdemand imbalances in the in-person services sector are expected to be resolved within a few quarters with progress on virus control and the return of in-person schooling. And demand growth itself is expected to moderate after a reopening surge, broadly coinciding with the time when some of the current tailwinds from fiscal support and makeup consumption turn to headwinds. Of course, there may be additional demand and supply surprises that could further complicate the inflation picture.\n\nTo the extent that supply chain congestion and other reopening frictions are transitory, they are unlikely to generate persistently higher inflation on their own. A persistent material increase in inflation would require not just that wages or prices increase for a period after reopening, but also a broad expectation that they will continue to increase at a persistently higher pace. A limited period of pandemic-related price increases is unlikely to durably change inflation dynamics. Past experience suggests many businesses are likely to compress margins and to rely on automation to reduce costs rather than fully passing on price increases. 12 In the December Duke CFO Survey, roughly one-half of chief financial officers from large firms and about one-third of those from small firms reported \"using, or planning to use, automation or technology to reduce reliance on labor.\" 13 The pandemic-induced shift to virtual, or contactless, versions of many previously in-person interactions is likely to lead to some durable shifts in the use of technology.\n\nThus, there are compelling reasons to expect the well-entrenched inflation dynamics that prevailed for a quarter-century to reassert themselves next year as imbalances associated with reopening are resolved, work and consumption patterns settle into a post-pandemic \"new normal,\" and some of the current tailwinds shift to headwinds. 14\n\nI will be carefully monitoring measures of longer-term inflation expectations to ensure they are well anchored at 2 percent. To date, various measures suggest inflation expectations remain well anchored and broadly consistent with our new framework. The Index of Common Inflation Expectations moved back to 2 percent in the first quarter, returning to its level in 2018, which is lower than its level prior to 2014. 15 In addition, the term structure of market-based measures of inflation compensation is consistent with market participants expecting a limited period of inflation above 2 percent. A straight read of the difference between the forward nominal Treasury curve and the forward Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities curve implies inflation compensation is expected to be higher for the next two years and to decline subsequently and remain stable 5 and 10 years into the future.\n\nI will remain attentive to the risk that what seem like transitory inflationary pressures could prove persistent as I closely monitor the incoming data. Should this risk manifest, we have the tools and the experience to gently guide inflation back to our target. No one should doubt our commitment to do so.\n\nBut recent experience suggests we should not lightly dismiss the risk on the other side. Achieving our inflation goal requires firmly anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent. Following the reopening, there will need to be strong underlying momentum to reach the outcomes in our forward guidance. Remaining patient through the transitory surge associated with reopening will help ensure that the underlying economic momentum that will be needed to reach our goals as some current tailwinds shift to headwinds is not curtailed by a premature tightening of financial conditions.\n\nThe outlook is bright, but risks remain, and we are far from our goals. The latest employment report reminds us that realized outcomes can diverge from forward projections and underscores the value of patience. As the economy reopens fully and the recovery gathers momentum, it will be important to remain patiently focused on achieving the maximum-employment and inflation outcomes in our guidance.\n\n1.

    "text": "May 24, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt the Consensus by CoinDesk 2021 Conference, Washington, D.C. (via webcast)\n\nTechnology is driving dramatic change in the U.S. payments system, which is a vital infrastructure that touches everyone. 1 The pandemic accelerated the migration to contactless transactions and highlighted the importance of access to safe, timely, and low-cost payments for all. With technology platforms introducing digital private money into the U.S. payments system, and foreign authorities exploring the potential for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in cross-border payments, the Federal Reserve is stepping up its research and public engagement on CBDCs. As Chair Powell discussed last week, an important early step on public engagement is a plan to publish a discussion paper this summer to lay out the Federal Reserve Board's current thinking on digital payments, with a particular focus on the benefits and risks associated with CBDC in the U.S. context. 2\n\nSharpening the Focus on CBDCs Four developmentsâthe growing role of digital private money, the migration to digital payments, plans for the use of foreign CBDCs in cross-border payments, and concerns about financial exclusionâare sharpening the focus on CBDCs.\n\nFirst, some technology platforms are developing stablecoins for use in payments networks. 3 A stablecoin is a type of digital asset whose value is tied in some way to traditional stores of value, such as government-issued, or fiat, currencies or gold. Stablecoins vary widely in the assets they are linked to, the ability of users to redeem the stablecoin claims for the reference assets, whether they allow unhosted wallets, and the extent to which a central issuer is liable for making good on redemption rights. Unlike central bank fiat currencies, stablecoins do not have legal tender status. Depending on underlying arrangements, some may expose consumers and businesses to risk. If widely adopted, stablecoins could serve as the basis of an alternative payments system oriented around new private forms of money. Given the network externalities associated with achieving scale in payments, there is a risk that the widespread use of private monies for consumer payments could fragment parts of the U.S. payment system in ways that impose burdens and raise costs for households and businesses. A predominance of private monies may introduce consumer protection and financial stability risks because of their potential volatility and the risk of run-like behavior. Indeed, the period in the nineteenth century when there was active competition among issuers of private paper banknotes in the United States is now notorious for inefficiency, fraud, and instability in the payments system. 4 It led to the need for a uniform form of money backed by the national government.\n\nSecond, the pandemic accelerated the migration to digital payments. Even before the pandemic, some countries, like Sweden, were seeing a pronounced migration from cash to digital payments. 5 To the extent that digital payments crowd out the use of cash, this raises questions about how to ensure that consumers retain access to a form of safe central bank money. In the United States, the pandemic led to an acceleration of the migration to digital payments as well as increased demand for cash. While the use of cash spiked at certain times, there was a pronounced shift by consumers and businesses to contactless transactions facilitated by electronic payments. 6 The Federal Reserve remains committed to ensuring that the public has access to safe, reliable, and secure means of payment, including cash. As part of this commitment, we must exploreâand try to anticipateâthe extent to which households' and businesses' needs and preferences may migrate further to digital payments over time.\n\nThird, some foreign countries have chosen to develop and, in some cases, deploy their own CBDC. Although each country will decide whether to issue a CBDC based on its unique domestic conditions, the issuance of a CBDC in one jurisdiction, along with its prominent use in cross-border payments, could have significant effects across the globe. Given the potential for CBDCs to gain prominence in cross-border payments and the reserve currency role of the dollar, it is vital for the United States to be at the table in the development of cross-border standards.\n\nFinally, the pandemic underscored the importance of access to timely, safe, efficient, and affordable payments for all Americans and the high cost associated with being unbanked and underbanked. While the large majority of pandemic relief payments moved quickly via direct deposits to bank accounts, it took weeks to distribute relief payments in the form of prepaid debit cards and checks to households who did not have up-to-date bank account information with the Internal Revenue Service. The challenges of getting relief payments to these households highlighted the benefits of delivering payments more quickly, cheaply, and seamlessly through digital means.\n\nPolicy Considerations In any assessment of a CBDC, it is important to be clear about what benefits a CBDC would offer over and above current and emerging payments options, what costs and risks a CBDC might entail, and how it might affect broader policy objectives. I will briefly discuss several of the most prominent considerations.\n\nPreserve general access to safe central bank money Central bank money is important for payment systems because it represents a safe settlement asset, allowing users to exchange central bank liabilities without concern about liquidity and credit risk. Consumers and businesses don't generally consider whether the money they are using is a liability of the central bank, as with cash, or of a commercial bank, as with bank deposits. This is largely because the two are seamlessly interchangeable for most purposes owing to the provision of federal deposit insurance and banking supervision, which provide protection for consumers and businesses alike. It is not obvious that new forms of private money that reference fiat currency, like stablecoins, can carry the same level of protection as bank deposits or fiat currency. Although various federal and state laws establish protections for users, nonbank issuers of private money are not regulated to the same extent as banks, the value stored in these systems is not insured directly by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and consumers may be at risk that the issuer will not be able to honor its liabilities. New forms of private money may introduce counterparty risk into the payments system in new ways that could lead to consumer protection threats or, at large scale, broader financial stability risks.\n\nIn contrast, a digital dollar would be a new type of central bank money issued in digital form for use by the general public. By introducing safe central bank money that is accessible to households and businesses in digital payments systems, a CBDC would reduce counterparty risk and the associated consumer protection and financial stability risks.\n\nImprove efficiency One expected benefit is that a CBDC would reduce or even eliminate operational and financial inefficiencies, or other frictions, in payments, clearing, and settlement. Today, the speed by which consumers and businesses can access the funds following a payment can vary significantly, up to a few days when relying on certain instruments, such as a check, to a few seconds in a real-time payments system. Advances in technology, including the use of distributed ledgers and smart contracts, may have the potential to fundamentally change the way in which payment activities are conducted and the roles of financial intermediaries and infrastructures. The introduction of a CBDC may provide an important foundation for beneficial innovation and competition in retail payments in the United States.\n\nMost immediately, we are taking a critical step to build a strong foundation with the introduction of the FedNow SM Service, a new instant payments infrastructure that is scheduled to go into production in two years. The FedNow Service will enable banks of every size and in every community across America to provide safe and efficient instant payment services around the clock, every day of the year. Through the banks using the service, consumers and businesses will be able to send and receive payments conveniently, such as on a mobile device, and recipients will have full access to funds immediately.\n\nPromote competition and diversity and lower transactions costs Today, the costs of certain retail payments transactions are high and not always transparent to end users. 7 Competition among a diversity of payment providers and payment types has the potential to increase the choices available to businesses and consumers, reduce transactions costs, and foster innovation in end-user services, although it could also contribute to fragmentation of the current payments system. By providing access to a digital form of safe central bank money, a CBDC could provide an important foundation on which private-sector competition could flourish.\n\nReduce cross-border frictions Cross-border payments, such as remittances, represent one of the most compelling use cases for digital currencies. The intermediation chains for cross-border payments are notoriously long, complex, costly, and opaque. Digitalization, along with a reduction in the number of intermediaries, holds considerable promise to reduce the cost, opacity, and time required for cross-border payments. While the introduction of CBDCs may be part of the solution, international collaboration on standard setting and protections against illicit activity will be required in order to achieve material improvements in cost, timeliness, and transparency. 8\n\nWe are collaborating with international colleagues through the Bank for International Settlements, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, and the G7 to ensure the U.S. stays abreast of developments related to CBDC abroad. We are engaging in several international efforts to improve the transparency, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of cross-border payments. It will be important to be engaged at the outset on the development of any international standards that may apply to CBDCs, given the dollar's important role as a reserve currency.\n\nComplement currency and bank deposits A guiding principle for any payments innovation is that it should improve upon the existing payments system. Consumers have access to reliable money in the forms of private bank accounts and central bank issued currency, which form the underpinnings of the current retail payments system. The design of any CBDC should complement and not replace currency and bank accounts.\n\nPreserve financial stability and monetary policy transmission The introduction of a CBDC has the potential to have wide-reaching effects, and there are open questions about how CBDC could affect financial stability and monetary policy transmission. Some research indicates that the introduction of a CBDC might raise the risk of a flight out of deposits at weak banks in favor of CBDC holdings at moments of financial stress. 9 Other research indicates that the increase in competition could result in more attractive terms on transactions accounts and an overall increase in banking system deposits. 10 Banks play a critical role in credit intermediation and monetary policy transmission, as well as in payments. Thus, the design of any CBDC would need to include safeguards to protect against disintermediation of banks and to preserve monetary policy transmission more broadly. While it is critical to consider the ways in which a CBDC could introduce risks relative to the current payments system, it may increase resilience relative to a payments system where private money is prominent.\n\nProtect privacy and safeguard financial integrity The design of any CBDC would need to both safeguard the privacy of households' payments transactions and prevent and trace illicit activity to maintain the integrity of the financial system, which will require the digital verification of identities. There are a variety of approaches to safeguarding the privacy of payments transactions while also identifying and preventing illicit activity and verifying digital identities. Addressing these critical objectives will require working across government agencies to assign roles and responsibilities for preventing illicit transactions and clearly establishing how consumer financial data would be protected.\n\nIncrease financial inclusion Today 5.4 percent of American households lack access to bank accounts and the associated payment options they offer, and a further 18.7 percent were underbanked as of 2017. 11 The lack of access to bank accounts imposes high burdens on these households, whose financial resilience is often fragile. At the height of the pandemic, the challenges associated with getting relief payments to hard-to-reach households highlighted that it is important for all households to have transactions accounts. The Federal Reserve's proposals for strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act emphasize the value of banks providing cost-free, low-balance accounts and other banking services targeted to underbanked and unbanked communities. 12 And a core goal of FedNow is to provide ubiquitous access to an instant payments system via depository institutions.\n\nCBDC may be one part of a broader solution to the challenge of achieving ubiquitous account access. 13 Depending on the design, CBDC may have the ability to lower transaction costs and increase access to digital payments. In emergencies, CBDC may offer a mechanism for the swift and direct transfer of funds, providing rapid relief to those most in need. A broader solution to financial inclusion would also need to address any perceived barriers to maintaining a transaction account, along with the need to maintain up-to-date records on active accounts to reach a large segment of the population. 14\n\nTo explore these broader issues, the Federal Reserve is undertaking research on financial inclusion. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is launching a publicâprivate sector collaboration as a Special Committee on Payments Inclusion to ensure that cash-based and vulnerable populations can safely access and benefit from digital payments. 15 This work is complemented by a new Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland initiative to explore the prospects for CBDC to increase financial inclusion. The initiative will identify CBDC design features and delivery approaches focused on expanding access to individuals who do not currently use traditional financial services.\n\nTechnology Considerations Multidisciplinary teams at the Federal Reserve are investigating the technological and policy issues associated with digital innovations in payments, clearing, and settlement, including the benefits and risks associated with a potential U.S. CBDC. For example, the TechLab group at the Federal Reserve Board is performing hands-on research and experimentation on potential future states of money, payments, and digital currencies. A second group, the Digital Innovations Policy program, is considering a broad range of policy issues associated with the rise of digital payments, including the potential benefits and risks associated with CBDC.\n\nTo deepen our research on the technological design of a CBDC, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is partnering with Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Digital Currency Initiative on Project Hamilton to build and test a hypothetical digital currency platform using leading edge technology design options. 16 This work aims to research the feasibility of the core processing of a CBDC, while remaining agnostic about a range of policy decisions. MIT and the Boston Fed plan to release a white paper next quarter that will document the ability to meet goals on throughput of geographically dispersed transactions with core processing and create an open source license for the code. Subsequent work will explore how addressing additional requirements, including resiliency, privacy, and anti-money-laundering features, will impact core processing performance and design.\n\nBanking Activities Research and experimentation are also occurring at supervised banking institutions to explore new technology to enhance their own operations and in response to demands from their clients for services such as custody of digital assets. While distributed ledger technology may have the potential to improve efficiencies, increase competition, and lower costs, digital assets pose heightened risks such as those related to Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering, cybersecurity, price volatility, privacy, and consumer compliance. The Federal Reserve is actively monitoring developments in this area, engaging with the industry and other regulators, and working to identify any regulatory, supervisory, and oversight framework gaps. Given that decisions at one banking agency can have implications for the other agencies, it is important that regulators work together to develop common approaches to ensure that banks are appropriately identifying, monitoring, and managing risks associated with digital assets.\n\nPublic Engagement In light of the growing role of digital private money in the broader migration to digital payments, the potential use of foreign CBDCs in cross-border payments, and the importance of financial inclusion, the Federal Reserve is stepping up its research and public engagement on a digital version of the U.S. dollar. Members of Congress and executive agencies are similarly exploring this important issue. As noted above, to help inform these efforts, the Federal Reserve plans to issue a discussion paper to solicit public comment on a range of questions related to payments, financial inclusion, data privacy, and information security, with regard to a CBDC in the U.S. context. 17 The Federal Reserve remains committed to ensuring a safe, inclusive, efficient, and innovative payments system that works for all Americans.\n\n1.

    "text": "February 24, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt the Ec10, Principles of Economics, Lecture, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (via webcast)\n\nI want to thank Jason Furman and David Laibson for inviting me to join your economics class. I often found it difficult in introductory economics to connect the abstract concepts in the textbooks to the real-world issues I cared about. So the one message I hope you remember from today is that economics provides powerful tools to enable you to analyze and affect the issues that matter most to you. 1\n\nWith jobs down by 10 million relative to pre-pandemic levels, one issue that matters fundamentally to all of us is achieving full employment. So today I want to talk about both the Federal Reserve's responsibilities with regard to full employment and different approaches to assessing where we are relative to that goal.\n\nThe belief that the federal government has a responsibility for full employment has its roots in the Great Depression. It was given statutory expression at the end of the Second World War when policymakers and legislators feared that the millions of American soldiers returning to the labor market would face Depression-era conditions. 2 In the Employment Act of 1946, the Congress directed the federal government as a whole to pursue \"conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\" 3\n\nThe postwar policy discussion raised important issues surrounding the definition and measurement of full employment. In 1950, the Review of Economics and Statistics published a symposium titled \"How Much Unemployment?\" which debated the accuracy of the Census Bureau's value for unemployment. 4 Dr. Palmer was a critical contributor to the symposium. Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards. 5 She argued that \"a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs. Inherent in the phenomena being measured are so many degrees and kinds of labor force activity that no single definition or classification can adequately summate them.\" 6\n\nWith concerns about employment again on the rise, in 1976, Senator Hubert Humphrey joined with Congressman Augustus Hawkins to sponsor legislation promoting full employment. 7 An amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 specifically assigned monetary policy responsibility for promoting \"the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" commonly referred to as the dual mandate. 8 This amendment was followed by the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act, passed in 1978, requiring that the Federal Reserve regularly report to the Congress on how monetary policy was supporting the goals of the act. 9\n\nCongressman Hawkins was a prominent advocate of full employment, emphasizing its importance not only for providing a job to every American seeking work, but also for reducing poverty, inequality, discrimination, and crime and improving the quality of life of all people. 10 A congressman from southern California, Hawkins was one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus and played a major role in the drafting of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was also an undergraduate economics major.\n\nHawkins's views were influenced by his experience representing the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles, where depression levels of joblessness persisted even when the nation overall was experiencing good times. He was also influenced by the work of economists such as Robert Browne and Bernard Anderson, which highlighted the persistent disparity between Black and white employment and the connection between elevated Black unemployment and economic challenges facing Black communities. 11 Hawkins emphasized that \"without genuine full employment it would be impossible to eliminate racial discrimination in the provision of job opportunities.\" 12 The Humphrey-Hawkins Act noted that \"increasing job opportunities and full employment would greatly contribute to the elimination of discrimination based upon sex, age, race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, or other improper factors.\" 13\n\nThe centrality of achieving full employment for all Americans is as pressing today as it was in 1930, 1946, and 1977. The measurement challenges highlighted by Dr. Gladys Palmer and the racial disparities highlighted by Robert Browne and Bernard Anderson are just as relevant in today's economy. And the statutory dual mandate assigned to monetary policy has ensured an unwavering, strong focus on maximum employment as well as price stability at the Federal Reserve in research and measurement no less than policymaking.\n\nThe Federal Reserve recently concluded a review of our monetary policy framework, which included extensive outreach to a broad range of people over the course of 2019. In 14 Fed Listens events in communities around the country, we heard testimonials that would have sounded strikingly familiar to Congressman Hawkins. At a time when the national headline unemployment rate was at a multidecade low, community and labor representatives and educators noted \"it's always a recession\" in their communities. 14 They challenged whether the overall economy could be characterized as at \"full employment\" while unemployment remained in the double digits in their communities.\n\nReflecting this input, and in light of persistently below-target inflation, low equilibrium interest rates, and low sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization, we made several important changes to the monetary policy framework. Two changes have particular relevance for the employment leg of the dual mandate. 15 The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations when employment is too high as well as too low. The new framework also defines the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal assessed through a wide range of indicators.\n\nSo how should we assess this broad-based and inclusive concept of maximum employment? When discussing aggregate indicators about the labor market, people tend to focus on the headline U-3 measure of the unemployment rate. 16 Although the unemployment rate is a very informative aggregate indicator, it provides only one narrow measure of where the labor market is relative to maximum employment. Recalling Gladys Palmer's dictum, I would not recommend relying on any single indicator, but rather consulting a variety of indicators that together provide a holistic picture of where we are relative to full employment.\n\nSo let us start by seeing what insights we gain by disaggregating the unemployment data into different groups of workers. The unemployment rate has improved very rapidly from its peak of 14.8 percent last April to 6.3 percent today. But this number is closer to 6.8 percent when taking into account a substantial number of people on temporary layoff, who have been misclassified as \"employed but on unpaid absence\" but instead should be counted as unemployed.\" 17\n\nDisaggregating the overall unemployment rate reveals that workers in the lowest wage quartile face Depression-era rates of unemployment of around 23 percent. 18 In part, this rate likely reflects the concentration of lower-wage jobs in service industries that are strongly reliant on in-person contact, or at least in-person work, while a larger proportion of higher-wage jobs are currently being performed remotely or with reduced levels of in-person contact.\n\nThere is also important information in the disaggregation of unemployment by different racial and ethnic groups. Figure 1 shows the prime-age unemployment rate overall and on a disaggregated basis. 19 There are notable persistent gaps between different racial and ethnic groups, and the sizes of those gaps tend to vary over the business cycle.\n\nFor example, historically, the ratio of the Black unemployment rate to the white unemployment rate is around 2 for prime-age workers. On average, a 1 percentage point increase in the white unemployment rate is accompanied by a 2 percentage point increase in the Black unemployment rate. This gap narrows considerably the longer an expansion progresses. At the beginning of 2015, a time when many economists believed the overall unemployment rate had reached its \"normal\" rate, the gap between the Black and white prime-age unemployment rates stood just under 5 percentage points, roughly at its average level since 1972. By September 2019, that gap had reached a historical minimum of 1.7 percentage points, and the gap between the Hispanic and white prime-age unemployment rates had fallen to 0.3 percentage point.\n\nThe unemployment gaps between racial and ethnic groups widened again during the pandemic. Currently, for prime-age individuals, the gaps between the white unemployment rate and the Black and Hispanic unemployment rates are roughly 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively.\n\nThe unemployment rate obscures important information about people leaving and entering the workforce. Each adult in the population is classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. The unemployment rate is the number of individuals who are not currently working but are actively looking for a job, divided by the size of the labor force, which includes only those people who are either working or actively seeking work:\n\n$$ U = {Unemployed \\over Labor Force}.$$\n\nChanges in labor force participation contain important information about the strength of the labor market that is not captured in the unemployment rate. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is the number of individuals who are either working or are seeking work, divided by the working-age population:\n\n$$ LFPR = {Labor Force \\over Population}.$$\n\nWhen we take into consideration the more than 4 million workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started, as well as misclassification, the unemployment rate is close to 10 percent currentlyâmuch higher than the headline unemployment rate of 6.3 percentâand similar to the peak unemployment rate following the financial crisis. This is shown in Figure 2 .\n\nA decline in participation by prime-age women is an important contributor to the overall participation decline. Some portion of the decline reflects the increase in caregiving work at home with the shutdown of schools and daycare due to COVID-19. On average over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age respondents with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving was about 14 percent, up 1-3/4 percentage points from a year earlier. For mothers, the fraction who were out of the labor force for caregiving was 22.8 percent, an increase of 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for fathers the fraction was 2.2 percent, an increase of about 0.6 percentage point. 20 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâage women could have longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth. 21\n\nWhile there are long-term structural trends in participation, such as population aging, there are also cyclical dynamics that are important for our assessment of maximum employment. The two panels in figure 3 show prime-age unemployment and labor force participation over the previous recession and recovery. Following the onset of the global financial crisis, as the number of unemployed people was rising, the size of the labor force was also contracting, pushing the numerator of the unemployment rate up and the denominator down. When the unemployment rate started to decline at the end of 2010, this decline in part reflected unemployed people dropping out of the labor force through 2013. As the labor market healed further, prime-age LFPR leveled out and started to increase at the end of 2015. The subsequent seemingly modest decline in the unemployment rate from 4.3 at the end of 2015 to 3 percent at the end of 2019 was much more significant, taking into account that more than 3-1/2 million prime-age workers joined or rejoined the labor force during that period.\n\nThis brings me to figure 4 and the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, which is the number of individuals employed divided by the working-age population:\n\n$$ EPOP = {Employed \\over Population}.$$\n\nThe EPOP ratio synthesizes the information contained in the unemployment rate and LFPR. For instance, as you can see in figure 4, a decline in participation almost entirely offset the decline in unemployment in 2010 and 2011, leaving the prime-age EPOP ratio essentially flat at 75 percent. The EPOP ratio then improved steadily over the subsequent seven years, moving up to 80.4 percent in late 2019.\n\nAs the effects of the virus and measures to combat it took hold of the economy, the EPOP ratio plummeted last April, and, after staging a sharp but partial recovery, improvements in the prime-age EPOP ratio have moderated in recent months. A glance back at figure 3 shows that the reductions in employment last spring were accompanied by many prime-age workers leaving the labor force, and the participation rate among prime-age workers has declined further since last May. The prime-age EPOP ratio currently stands at 76.4 percent, well below the 80 percent level that was reached during each of the past two expansions.\n\nFigure 5 shows the patterns in the EPOP ratio for prime-age workers in different racial and ethnic groups. 22 Following the Global Financial Crisis, the Blackâwhite EPOP gap opened to more than 10 percentage points in mid-2011 before shrinking to under 5 percentage points as labor markets tightened further during 2018 and 2019. In contrast, the Hispanicâwhite EPOP gap was smaller than the Blackâwhite gap, and it fluctuated in a much narrower range over the business cycle.\n\nDuring the pandemic, labor market performance as shown by the EPOP measure has been fairly similar for Black and Hispanic prime-age workers and markedly worse than for white workers. Research indicates that Black and Hispanic workers are overrepresented in industries particularly hard hit by the pandemic, such as hotels and restaurants. 23 It also shows that Black and Hispanic workers are overrepresented in essential industries at lower pay, and that they are significantly less likely to be able to telework. 24\n\nFigure 6 shows one more EPOP snapshot, this time for prime-age women overall, as well as for Black and white subgroups. Following the financial crisis, a gap opened up between the prime-age EPOP ratios for Black and white women. That gap closed in 2015, and employment for both groups surged over the next four years. Between January 2015 and February 2020, the EPOP ratios for white and Black prime-age women each increased roughly 5 percentage points, reaching historical highs in the months just before the onset of the pandemic. As the pandemic took hold in the subsequent months, once again a gap opened up between the EPOP ratios for white and Black women, though the current gap of roughly 2 percentage points is not as large as in the previous downturn.\n\nWhile the EPOP ratio is a strong indicator of the extensive margin in the labor market, or how many people are working, there is also important information in the intensive marginâthat is, how much work each person is doing. The part-time for economic reasons (PTER) indicator shown in figure 7 measures those who are working part time because they are unable to find a full-time job or whose hours have been reduced and who would prefer full-time employment. 25 This indicator is an important measure of labor market slack, which tends to jump rapidly during recessions and improve more slowly than headline unemployment during recoveries. PTER jumped during the financial crisis as workers who were unable to secure full-time employment moved to part-time work, accounting for more than half of the increase in involuntary part-time work during 2008. 26\n\nToday there are 6.0 million people working part time who would prefer full-time work, up 1.6 million relative to the pre-COVID level. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has six alternative measures of labor underutilization, the most expansive of which is the U-6 measures, which adds to the headline unemployment rate those employed part time for economic reasons, along with all persons marginally attached to the labor force as a percentage of the civilian labor force. The U-6 measure stood at 11.1 percent in January. 27\n\nFigure 8 shows the large amount of cyclical variation across PTER for several racial and ethnic groups. The incidence of involuntary part-time work was especially notable for Hispanic workers at the trough of the Great Recession, nearing 12 percent of employment and almost double its rate before the recession. This gap between Hispanic and white PTER narrowed substantially during the recovery and fell to just above 1 percentage point in the summer of 2019. Research indicates that gaps in involuntary part-time employment rates remain for Blacks, as well as Hispanics, relative to whites after controlling for age, education, marital status, and state of residence, although education and occupation can explain a portion of the gap for Hispanics. 28\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to point to two other labor market indicators that provide useful evidence of the extent of labor market slack. The quits rate, shown in figure 9 , is a measure of voluntary separations that provides information about how confident people are that they will be successful in finding a new job they prefer and, relatedly, of how aggressively firms are pursuing talent. 29 Research indicates that the quits rate and wage growth are highly correlated, suggesting that these voluntary job-to-job transitions reflect individuals moving up a \"job ladder\" to higher-paying jobs. 30 The quits rate fell rapidly during the 2008 recession as workers' options became more limited, then recovered slowly, only surpassing its preâfinancial crisis level of roughly 2.5 percent in 2018. In contrast, the bounceback from the pandemic trough has been much more robust, with quits already reaching 2.6 percent in December. As undergraduates, the quits rate may soon become relevant to you, as research indicates that job-to-job transitions are most frequent for young workers and that this measure has trended down in recent decades. 31\n\nFinally, measures of compensation are closely monitored for evidence on labor market slack. Figure 10 shows the 12-month growth rate of the employment cost index for total compensation for private industry workers (ECI). Just as quits fell during the Great Recession, so did the ECI. About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015. There was a pickup of the ECI at the end of 2015, which coincided with the turning point in the prime-age LFPR. Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008.\n\nUnlike the other indicators I have discussed, the pandemic appears to have made fairly little imprint on the ECI. The ECI declined slightly over the second and third quarters of 2020 and moved up in the fourth quarter. It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from these developments; while the ECI is not as susceptible to composition effects as some other measures, smaller composition effects are still possible. 32\n\nSo, what conclusions can we draw from this high-level overview of a variety of labor market indicators, their current readings, and their performance in the previous expansion? First, the headline unemployment rate by itself can obscure important dimensions of labor market slack, so it is important to heed Dr. Palmer's dictum and consult a broad set of aggregated and disaggregated measures. Second, groups that have faced the greatest challenges often make important labor market gains late in an expansion, consistent with Augustus Hawkins's emphasis on the importance of full employment for all Americans.\n\nSo where does this leave us today? Jobs are still down by 10 million relative to pre-COVID levels, and COVID has disproportionately harmed certain sectors, groups of workers, businesses, and states and localities, leading to a K-shaped recovery. The fiscal support that is enacted and expected will provide assistance to vulnerable households, small businesses, and localities and a significant boost to activity when vaccinations are sufficiently widespread to support a reopening of in-person services. Monetary policy will continue to provide support by keeping borrowing costs for households and businesses low.\n\nThe assessment of shortfalls from broad-based and inclusive maximum employment will be a critical guidepost for monetary policy, alongside indicators of realized and expected inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee has said it expects the policy rate to remain in the current target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. It has noted that asset purchases will continue at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the maximum-employment and inflation goals.\n\nIn assessing substantial further progress, I will be looking for sustained improvements in realized and expected inflation and examining a range of indicators to assess shortfalls from maximum employment. I will be looking for indicators that show the healing in the labor market is broad based, rather than focusing on the narrow aggregate U-3 unemployment rate, in light of the significant decline in labor force participation since the spread of COVID and the extremely elevated unemployment rate for workers in the lowest wage quartile.\n\nFor nearly four decades, monetary policy was guided by a strong presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears its normal rate in anticipation that high inflation would otherwise soon follow. But changes in economic relationships over the past decade have led trend inflation to run persistently somewhat below target and inflation to be relatively insensitive to resource utilization. With these changes, our new monetary policy framework recognizes that removing accommodation preemptively as headline unemployment reaches low levels in anticipation of inflationary pressures that may not materialize may result in an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans. It may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges in the labor force, which is particularly salient in light of recent research indicating that additional labor market tightening is especially beneficial for these groups when it occurs in already tight labor markets, compared with earlier in the labor market cycle. 33 Instead, the shortfalls approach means that the labor market will be able to continue to improve absent high inflationary pressures or an unmooring of inflation expectations to the upside.\n\nInflation remains very low, and although various measures of inflation expectations have picked up recently, they remain within their recent historical ranges. PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation may temporarily rise to or above 2 percent on a 12-month basis in a few months when the low March and April price readings from last year fall out of the 12-month calculation, and we could see transitory inflationary pressures reflecting imbalances if there is a surge of demand that outstrips supply in certain sectors when the economy opens back up. While I will carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to see a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal.\n\nToday the economy remains far from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation, and it will take some time to achieve substantial further progress. I look forward to the time when this K-shaped recovery becomes a broad-based and inclusive recovery and when vaccinations are widespread, the services sector springs back to life, and all Americans enjoy the benefits of full employment. I cannot think of a more meaningful time to be studying economics or a more important time to be thinking about the different ways to assess our shared goal of full employment.\n\n1.

A few other central banks have an explicit employment mandate that has the same weight as their price-stability mandate, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

    "text": "November 17, 2020\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt \"Exploring Careers in Economics,\" Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C. (via webcast)\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here today to talk about the future of economics with the next generation of economists who will shape it. I hope you will take away from what you hear today that a rigorous grounding in economic analysis can help you succeed in whatever field you choose. I will share a few thoughts on what economics can do for you and what you can do for the field of economics. 1\n\nLet me start with what economics can do for you. Just as there are a variety of reasons that people decide to pursue economics, so too there are many career fields where a degree in economics can be a powerful enabler. I have to admit I had some reservations that led me not to major in economics as an undergraduate. That changed during my first job out of college, when I recognized that economics can provide powerful tools to analyze and design programs to improve opportunities and financial security for workers and their families.\n\nEconomics can give you a powerful framework to explore the questions that matter most to you. Let me give a few examples of some important questions and the economic practitioners who made a big impact in addressing them.\n\nSo here's one: How can we help protect working women and men and their families from the financial devastation of job loss due to forces beyond their control? Frances Perkins first began thinking about that question as a young White girl in the manufacturing hub of Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1880s. When Frances asked her father why nice people could fall into poverty, he replied that this was a question little girls should not concern themselves with. Fortunately, Frances did not listen to him. In college, Perkins took an economics class where she started exploring the impact of rapid industrialization on the lives of working people. Her professor encouraged students to visit local factories to see firsthand some of the brutal working conditions facing women and children. That early field research sparked Perkins' determination to bring about improved working conditions and established her careful attention to gathering data. 2\n\nPerkins went on to become a key author of the New Deal, and served as Labor Secretary for a record 12 years, despite considerable opposition to the appointment of the first woman Cabinet secretary. She persuaded Roosevelt to put in place a system of unemployment insurance and built the Labor Department's capability to compile the necessary employment statistics. She worked hard to secure legislation codifying core labor rights, and she played a key role in designing and implementing Social Security. 3\n\nAs Perkins was advocating for policies to improve working conditions facing women and children, another young economist was gathering evidence on the lives of Black working people. In her doctoral dissertation, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander examined the living standards of Black families who were migrating to Philadelphia to meet the demand for labor brought about by World War I. 4 Alexander would become the first Black American to earn a PhD in economics. She would subsequently become the first woman to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania because of the barriers she encountered in the field of economics.\n\nBlack workers were fleeing the South, Alexander explained in her dissertation, because of poor wages, segregation, lynching and disenfranchisement, seeking higher wages, better education, \"the ballot,\" and \"greater justice\" in the North. And what did those Black workers migrating to Philadelphia find? Alexander's path-breaking research showed that one-third of Black families earned less than what she defined and calculated to be a fair standard of living. About one-quarter of the Black families she studied were underfed. Keep in mind Alexander wrote this in 1921, almost 50 years before the U.S. government adopted a formal definition of the poverty level. Alexander decried the systemic discrimination in housing, education, and so much more that held Black people back in Philadelphia. And yet, Alexander was optimistic that Black workers moving North for better paying jobs would eventually attain the education and standard of living of what she called the \"Great American Middle Class.\"\n\nSince that time, a college degree has become more important for financial security. That raises the vitally important question of how to make college more affordable for low-income students. It turns out Lois Dickson Rice spent much of her career addressing that question. As the daughter of a janitor and a maid determined to send their five children to college, Rice was inspired by her parents' dedication to education. 5 Denied an alumni club state scholarship because she was Black, Lois, with the help of her high school teachers, secured a better scholarship directly from Radcliffe. 6 From there, she went on to a career at the College Board, becoming widely known as the \"mother of the Pell grant.\" Originally called the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, over almost half a century later, the program Rice designed and her tireless work to make college accessible to all, have helped around 200 million Americans afford a college education. 7\n\nEconomics can also provide powerful answers to questions such as, \"What is the cost of discrimination?\" This question was explored extensively by Andrew Brimmer, a child of sharecroppers who earned his PhD in economics at Harvard. Brimmer served with great distinction as the first Black governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 1966 to 1974, where he contributed to decision-making on monetary policy, and went on to publish research on systemic risk in capital markets and the Fed's lender of last resort function. 8 Brimmer estimated that discrimination cost the U.S. economy 3.8 percent of gross domestic product in 1993. 9 In case you are wondering about the cost in today's economy, Dana Peterson, who is the chief economist of the Conference Board and served as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board, estimated closing racial gaps could add roughly $5 trillion to the economy over the next five years. 10\n\nI wanted to share these examples of pathbreaking economic scholar-practitioners who overcame daunting barriers to make important contributions on economic questions that touch the lives of working people all around our country. We created Exploring Careers in Economics to help you answer the question of whether economics is right for you. Today you will hear from my colleagues about why they chose economics, and you will learn about the many rewarding career opportunities available to you. Through our partnership with Howard University, you will see how students there are working with our economists to take a hands-on approach to research. 11 I want to thank our colleagues in Federal Reserve Education for cohosting and helping to make this event available to students, educators, and groups across the nation. 12\n\nSo that should give you a sense of what economics can do for you. What can you do for economics? You can bring your diverse backgrounds and life experiences and unique talents and interesting questions to strengthen the study and practice of economics. Economics is a powerful field that influences public policy and the economic opportunities facing all Americans. We should not be satisfied until the people in our field and those sitting around every economic decisionmaking table represent America in all its strength and diversity.\n\nA growing body of research and evidence makes clear that the quality of the economics profession and its contribution to society will be greater when it reflects a broader range of people and perspectives. Research shows that greater diversity results in better outcomesâit broadens the range of ideas and perspectives brought to bear on solving problems, and it brings important insights to the analysis of our economy. As Amanda Bayer and Cecilia Rouse have documented, microeconomic experiments and other research demonstrate the benefits of diversity for group deliberations and decisionmaking. For instance, one well-known experiment found that racially diverse groups of students outperformed other groups in solving problems, and another found similar benefits from gender diversity. 13 A review of 2.5 million research papers across the sciences found that those written by ethnically diverse research teams received more citations and had a greater impact than papers by authors with the same ethnicity. 14\n\nIt is notable that when Congress established the Federal Reserve System, it took great care to ensure that there would be a diversity of perspectives around the decisionmaking table with regard to regional representation. That is why we have 12 Reserve Bank Districts represented on the Federal Open Market Committee. But we have not yet lived up to that standard on racial and ethnic diversity. For instance, it was not until 2017, more than 100 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve, that the first African American, Raphael Bostic, was chosen to lead a Reserve Bank.\n\nWe need to address the stubbornly persistent gap in the awarding of economics degrees. 15 Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents earning a doctorate in economics from U.S. universities, the representation of those identifying as Black, Hispanic, or Native American was 10 percent in 2018. The share of women overall obtaining a doctorate in economics was slightly above 30 percent in 2018, little changed from 1994. By contrast, Blacks and Hispanics make up 13 percent of medical students and women overall make up just over half of all medical students in the country. 16 Economics also lags behind law as well as science and engineering in the share of underrepresented minorities and women receiving advanced degrees. But the gap starts at the undergraduate level, as highlighted by Rhonda Sharpe. 17 From 2011 to 2015, Black women accounted for only 1.5 percent of undergraduate economics degrees, compared with their 6.2 percent share of all undergraduate degrees. 18\n\nDiversity and inclusion need to be priorities for every economics department around the countryâand for the think tanks, governments, businesses, and many other organizations that train and employ economists. Many of my colleagues in economics and education are working hard to make progress, including by developing programs to support and mentor diverse talent interested in this consequential discipline. We need to make it a national goal to catch up to medicine, science, engineering, and other fields in developing robust programs, conducting ongoing evaluation, and constantly adapting to improve the inclusivity of economics and our ability to recruit and retain diverse talent. We want to be known within the profession as a place where minorities and women are confident they have the opportunity to make an impact and feel they are respected and heard by leadership.\n\nWe must continue to make progress towards a more just society, and I am hopeful that economists will contribute to that progress. Studying economics will provide you with a powerful, intellectual framework for asking and answering questions that matter to you. It will enable you to influence people's lives for the better. It will enable you to craft policy to change our world. It will enable you to teach and help shape the next generation. It will enable you to pursue a range of opportunities, not just in economics, but also in business, finance, policy, and nonprofits. I wish you good luck and success in your studies, and I trust that I will soon be reading about the questionsâand answersâthat matter most to you.\n\n1.

    "text": "March 01, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt the 2021 Annual Washington Conference, Institute of International Bankers (via webcast)\n\nIt has now been one year since the devastating effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit our shores, a year marked by heartbreak and hardship. 1 We look forward to a brighter time ahead, when vaccinations are widespread, the recovery is broad based and inclusive, and the economy fully springs back to life. But we should not miss the opportunity to distill lessons from the COVID shock and institute reforms so our system is more resilient and better able to withstand a variety of possible shocks in the future, including those emanating from outside the financial system.\n\nThe Dash for Cash Investor sentiment shifted dramatically in the early days of March 2020 with the realization that COVID would disrupt the entire global economy. Short-term funding markets became severely stressed as market participants reacted to the advent of this low-probability catastrophic event. The abrupt repositioning and repricing of portfolios led to a dash for cash, as even relatively safe Treasury holdings were liquidated, volatility spiked, and spreads in Treasury and offshore dollar funding markets widened sharply. Forceful and timely action by the Federal Reserve and other financial authorities was vital to stabilize markets and restore orderly market functioning.\n\nAlthough some parts of the financial system that had undergone significant reform in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis remained resilient, the COVID stress test highlighted significant financial vulnerabilities that suggest an agenda for further financial reform. I will briefly comment on these areas of vulnerability as well as areas where earlier reforms led to greater resilience.\n\nShort-Term Funding Market Vulnerabilities The COVID shock brought to the fore important vulnerabilities in the systemically important short-term funding markets that had previously surfaced in the Global Financial Crisis. Signs of acute stress were readily apparent in intermediaries and vehicles with structural funding risk, particularly in prime money market funds (MMFs). Indeed, it appears these vulnerabilities had increased, as assets held in prime MMFs doubled in the three years preceding last March. When the COVID shock hit, investors rapidly moved toward cash and the safest, most liquid financial instruments available to them. Over the worst two weeks in mid-March, net redemptions at publicly offered institutional prime MMFs amounted to 30 percent of assets. This rush of outflows as a share of assets was faster than in the run in 2008, and it appears some features of the money funds may have contributed to the severity of the run. 2\n\nThe run in March forced MMFs to rapidly reduce their commercial paper holdings, which worsened stress in short-term funding markets. Funding costs for borrowers shot up, and the availability of short-term credit at maturities beyond overnight plunged. These markets provide the short-term credit many businesses need to keep operating and meet payrolls. So when short-term funding markets shut down, it can imperil many businesses, too.\n\nFor the second time in 12 years, a run on MMFs triggered the need for policy intervention to mitigate the effect on financial conditions and the wider economy. To head off the risk of widespread business failures and layoffs, the Federal Reserve took a number of actions, including announcing the Commercial Paper Funding Facility on March 17 and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility on March 18, 2020. Following the announcement of these facilities, prime MMF redemptions slowed almost immediately, and other measures of stress in short-term funding markets began to ease.\n\nThe March 2020 turmoil highlights the need for reforms to reduce the risk of runs on prime money market funds that create stresses in short-term funding markets. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets has outlined several potential reforms to address this risk, and the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested comment on these options. 3 If properly calibrated, capital buffers or reforms that address the first-mover advantage to investors that redeem early, such as swing pricing or a minimum balance at risk, could significantly reduce the run risk associated with money funds. Currently, when some investors redeem early, remaining investors bear the costs of the early redemptions. In contrast, with swing pricing, when a fund's redemptions rise above a certain level, the investors who are redeeming receive a lower price for their shares, reducing their incentive to run. 4 Similarly, a minimum balance at risk, which would be available for redemption only with a time delay, could provide some protection to investors who do not run by sharing the costs of early redemptions with those who do. Capital buffers can provide dedicated resources within or alongside a fund to absorb losses and reduce the incentive for investors to exit the fund early.\n\nTo be sure, domestic money market funds are not the only vulnerable cash-management investment vehicles active in U.S. short-term funding markets. For example, offshore prime money funds, ultrashort bond funds, and other short-term investment funds also experienced stress and heavy redemptions last March. The runs on offshore MMFs that hold dollar-denominated assets like commercial paper underscore the importance of working with international counterparts to increase the resilience of short-term funding markets. We are supporting the work of the Financial Stability Board to assess options for mitigating the vulnerabilities of MMFs globally and report on them later this year.\n\nThe COVID shock also highlighted the structural vulnerabilities associated with the funding risk of other investment vehicles that offer daily liquidity while investing in less-liquid assets, such as corporate bonds, bank loans, and municipal debt. Open-end funds held about one-sixth of all outstanding U.S. corporate bonds prior to the crisis. i Bond mutual funds, including those specializing in corporate and municipal bonds, had an unprecedented $250 billion in outflows last March, far larger than their outflows at any time during the 2007â09 financial crisis. The associated forced sales of fund assets contributed to a sharp deterioration in fixed-income market liquidity that necessitated additional emergency interventions by the Federal Reserve. In assessing possible reforms to address this run risk, swing pricing could be helpful, because it reduces the first-mover advantage for running from a fund by imposing a cost when redemptions are high. Swing pricing has been used for more than a decade in European mutual funds, where it has been shown to slow redemptions in stress events. 5 In the United States, mutual funds have not adopted swing pricing, in part because of technical obstacles.\n\nTreasury Market Functioning The COVID shock also revealed vulnerabilities in the market for U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. Treasury market is one of the most important and liquid securities markets in the world, and many companies and investors treat Treasury securities as risk-free assets and expect to be able to sell them quickly to raise money to meet any need for liquidity. Trading conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second week of March as a wide range of investors sought to raise cash by liquidating the Treasury securities they held. Measures of trading costs widened as daily trading volumes for both on- and off-the-run securities surged. Indicative bid-ask spreads widened by as much as 30-fold for off-the-run securities. Market depth for the on-the-run 10-year Treasury security dropped to about 10 percent of its previous level, and daily volumes spiked to more than $1.2 trillion at one point, roughly four standard deviations above the 2019 average daily trading volume. Stresses were also evident in a breakdown of the usually tight link between Treasury cash and futures prices, with the Treasury cashâfutures basisâthe difference between prices of Treasury futures contracts and prices of Treasury cash securities eligible for delivery into those futures contractsâwidening notably.\n\nSelling pressures were widespread, reflecting sales by foreign official institutions, rebalancing by asset managers, a rapid unwinding of levered positions, and precautionary liquidity raising. Available data suggest that foreign institutions liquidated about $400 billion in Treasury securities in March, with more than half from official institutions and the remainder from private foreign investors, at a time when offshore dollar funding markets also experienced acute stress. Domestic mutual funds sold about $200 billion during the first quarter, selling their less-liquid Treasury securities in order to raise cash to meet investor redemptions. Hedge funds reduced long cash Treasury positions by an estimated $35 billion. 6\n\nDealers play a central role in the Treasury market by buying and selling securities and providing financing to investors. Their capacity or willingness to intermediate these flows was strained amid the elevated uncertainty and intense and widespread selling pressure in mid-March. Operational adjustments associated with the rapid move to remote work may also have inhibited intermediation.\n\nThe acute stresses in the Treasury market necessitated emergency intervention by the Federal Reserve at an unprecedented scale. The Federal Open Market Committee authorized purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) \"in the amounts needed\" to support smooth market functioning of these markets. 7 Between March 12 and April 15, the Federal Reserve increased its holdings of Treasury securities by about $1.2 trillion and agency MBS by about $200 billion. The Federal Reserve provided overnight and term repurchase agreement (repo) operations to address disruptions in Treasury financing markets. These actions rapidly restored market functioning, and a variety of indicators had returned to pre-COVID levels by the summer. 8\n\nWhile the scale and speed of flows associated with the COVID shock are likely pretty far out in the tail of the probability distribution, the crisis highlighted vulnerabilities in the critically important Treasury market that warrant careful analysis. A number of possible reforms have been suggested to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market. For instance, further improvements in data collection and availability have been recommended to enhance transparency related to market participants, such as broker-dealers and hedge funds. Some have suggested that the Federal Reserve could provide standing facilities to backstop repos in stress conditions, possibly creating a domestic standing facility or converting the temporary Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility to a standing facility. 9 Other possible avenues to explore include the potential for wider access to platforms that promote forms of \"all to all\" trading less dependent on dealers and, relatedly, greater use of central clearing in Treasury cash markets. 10 These measures involve complex tradeoffs and merit thoughtful analysis in advancing the important goal of ensuring Treasury market resilience.\n\nOffshore Dollar Funding Markets The global dash for cash also led to severe stress in offshore dollar funding markets, where foreign exchange swap basis spreads increased sharply to levels last seen in the Global Financial Crisis. Foreign banking organizations serve as key conduits of dollar funding for foreign governments, central banks, businesses, nonbank financial institutions, and households. 11 They hold $14 trillion in dollar-denominated claimsâabout half of the total global dollar claims of banks. The Federal Reserve and several other central banks responded swiftly to distress in the offshore dollar funding markets by announcing the expansion and enhancement of dollar liquidity swap lines on March 15, followed on March 19 by the reopening of temporary swap lines with the nine central banks that had temporary agreements during the Global Financial Crisis. On March 30, the Federal Reserve introduced a new temporary FIMA Repo Facility to support the liquidity of Treasury securities held by foreign monetary authorities, an important innovation. Following these interventions, foreign exchange swap basis spreads started moving down almost immediately and within a few weeks reached their levels before the COVID shock.\n\nCentral Clearing The reforms put in place pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in response to the previous crisis appear to have supported the resilience of the financial system as it absorbed the COVID shock. Importantly, regulators instituted global reforms to encourage and, in some cases, mandate central clearing after observing the loss of confidence in key banking intermediaries during the Global Financial Crisis associated with the opaque web of bilateral derivatives contracts. As a result, during the COVID turmoil, the greatly expanded scope of central clearing, with the attendant reduction in counterparty and settlement risks, supported the orderly functioning of critical securities and derivatives markets amid sharply increased trading volumes and spiking volatility. Moreover, several central clearing platforms (CCPs) successfully handled problems that emerged at a few smaller market participants, without noticeable spillovers to other markets and institutions.\n\nHowever, as part of the risk controls that are inherent in central clearing, the COVID market turmoil generated exceptionally large flows of cash through CCPs from market participants with mark-to-market losses to those participants with corresponding gains. Furthermore, during the March COVID turmoil, a number of CCPs collected significantly higher financial resources from their members to protect against increased risk as captured by their risk models. These demands for liquidity were met adequately, and the markets operated efficiently and effectively, although the sudden spikes in CCP requirements may have stressed the liquidity positions of some trading firms. And while CCPs performed well during this period of stress, forceful public emergency interventions and the strong capitalization of banks likely mitigated the risks of large clearing member defaults.\n\nThe COVID-19 shock presents an important opportunity to reflect on lessons learned about central clearing by the public and private sectors. CCPs could consider the effects of the market dysfunction on their liquidity risk-management plans, including their assumptions regarding the ability to raise cash from noncash assets or securities. In addition to reassessing their liquidity planning, CCPs could also assess the tradeoffs between their own risk-management decisions and broader financial stability concerns, particularly in light of how CCPs may have contributed to deleveraging by some market participants in March by the magnitude of the increases in financial resources they collected when trading and volatility spiked. CCPs could assess their margin models, consider improvements to reduce pro-cyclicality, and consider increased transparency to help clearing members anticipate margin calls during periods of volatility. The holistic review by the Financial Stability Board, in which we participate, could provide important insights into these issues. 12\n\nBank Capital and Liquidity The resilience of the banking sector in response to the COVID shock underscores the importance of guarding against erosion of the strong capital and liquidity buffers and risk-management, resolution, and stress-testing programs put in place pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Banks entered the pandemic with strong capital and liquidity buffers, especially those banks whose size and complexity are systemically important. Strong capital and liquidity buffers allowed the banking system to accommodate the unprecedented demand for short-term credit from many businesses that sought to bridge the pandemic-related shortfalls in revenues. Banks' capital positions initially declined because of this new lending and strong provisioning for loan losses but have since risen above their pre-pandemic levels, reflecting better-than-expected loan performance and a reduction in credit provision as well as caps on dividends and restrictions on share repurchases in the past several quarters.\n\nStrong capital and liquidity positions will remain important, as banks still face significant challengesâincluding an environment of higher-than-normal uncertainty. For instance, some sectors of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are more vulnerable than before the crisis. Similarly, net interest margins could remain in the lower part of their historical ranges for some time. Although losses and delinquency rates on bank loans are currently low, performance could deteriorate as borrowers exit forbearance, with particularly hard-hit businesses and households facing arrears on rent and mortgage payments. 13 Recent developments have been encouraging, but downside risks remain, which could delay recovery and lead to higher losses.\n\nBank resilience benefited from the emergency interventions that calmed short-term funding markets and from the range of emergency facilities that helped support credit flows to businesses and households. While the results of our latest stress test released in December 2020 show that the largest banks are sufficiently capitalized to withstand a renewed downturn in coming years, the projected losses take some large banks close to their regulatory minimums. 14 According to past experience, banks that approach their regulatory capital minimums are much less likely to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers. It is important for banks to remain strongly capitalized in order to guard against a tightening of credit conditions that could impair the recovery.\n\nCyclical Vulnerabilities Structural vulnerabilities such as those discussed earlier could interact with cyclical vulnerabilities in the financial system, potentially magnifying the associated risks. Valuations are elevated in a number of asset classes relative to historical norms. After plunging as the pandemic unfolded last spring, broad stock price indexes rebounded to levels well above pre-pandemic levels. Some observers also point to the potential for stretched equity valuations and elevated volatility due to retail investor herd behavior facilitated by free online trading platforms. Risk appetite in credit markets is also elevated, with high-quality investment-grade (IG) corporate debt trading at slightly negative real yields and issuance of leveraged loans returning to 2019 levels. While financial markets are inherently forward-looking, taking into account the prospects of widespread vaccinations and substantial fiscal support, a variety of risks related to the virus could result in a sudden change in investor risk sentiment. This could, for instance, trigger outflows from corporate bond mutual funds and other managed funds with an investor base that is sensitive to fund performance. Commercial real estate prices are susceptible to declines if the pace of distressed transactions picks up or if the pandemic leads to permanent changes in patterns of useâfor instance, a decline in demand for office space due to higher rates of remote work or for retail space due to a permanent shift toward online shopping.\n\nDebt loads at large nonfinancial firms were high coming into the pandemic and remain so. Measures of leverage at large firms remain near the historical highs reached at the beginning of 2020, with the aggregate book value of debt exceeding 35 percent of assets in the third quarter. A large portion of IG debt is currently at the lowest IG rating, making this debt vulnerable to downgrades. Such downgrades may bring insurers, mutual funds, and other regulated institutional investors closer to internal or statutory thresholds on their holdings of non-IG securities, potentially forcing these institutions to shed assets.\n\nOver a longer horizon, changes in the economic environment associated with low equilibrium interest rates, persistently below-target trend inflation, and low sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization could be expected to contribute to a low-for-long interest rate environment and reach-for-yield behavior. In these kinds of environments, it is valuable to deploy macroprudential tools, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, to mitigate potential increases in financial imbalances.\n\nThe Path Ahead The COVID shock subjected the financial system to an acute stress that necessitated emergency interventions on a massive scale by financial authorities around the world. The COVID turmoil underscores the importance of ensuring the financial system is resilient to a wide range of shocks, including those emanating from outside the financial system. Regulators and international standard-setting bodies have an opportunity to draw important lessons from the COVID shock about where fragilities remain, such as in prime MMFs and other vehicles with structural funding risk. A number of common-sense reforms are needed to address the unresolved structural vulnerabilities in nonbank financial intermediation and short-term funding markets.\n\n1.

    "text": "May 11, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt \"The Road to Recovery and What's Next,\" a virtual conference sponsored by the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing (via webcast)\n\nI want to thank Heather Long and the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing for inviting me to join you today. 1\n\nStrong fiscal support and increasing vaccination rates drove a strong rebound in activity in the first quarter, and the second quarter looks to be even stronger. The outlook is bright, but uncertainty remains, and employment and inflation are far from our goals. While more balanced than earlier this year, risks remain from vaccine hesitancy, deadlier variants, and a resurgence of cases in some foreign countries. The latest jobs report is a reminder that the path of reopening and recoveryâlike the shutdownâis likely to be uneven and difficult to predict, so basing monetary policy on outcomes rather than the outlook will serve us well.\n\nWith the renewal of fiscal support, real disposable personal income surged 61 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter after a decline of 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) jumped 10.7 percent, supporting a robust 6.4 percent growth rate in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, despite a large runoff of inventories amid supply chain bottlenecks.\n\nThe second quarter appears primed to exceed the strong first quarter as progress on vaccinations continues, and more consumers return to the sectors adversely affected by COVID-19. 2 The combination of fiscal support and depressed discretionary services spending during the shutdown have enabled households to accumulate considerable savings that could continue to fuel spending. Personal savings rose to 21 percent in the first quarter, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data, on top of the $2.1 trillion increase in household liquid assets reflected at the end of last year. 3\n\nWhile the incoming spending data, elevated household savings, and progress on vaccinations point to a very strong modal outlook, there is greater than usual uncertainty about the economy's path. For instance, the strength of domestic demand this year relative to next will depend on how quickly or slowly a large share of accumulated household savings is spent out. This, in turn, hinges in part on the distribution of household savings and how much is concentrated among households who are less likely to spend, perhaps because their services consumption returns only to pre-COVID levels or their near-term demand for durable goods has largely been satiated. 4\n\nThere is also uncertainty about how much of the strong domestic aggregate demand will leak abroad rather than translating into domestic output. As supply chain and shipping bottlenecks ease, international spillovers could lead to some slippage between the increase in domestic demand and domestic resource utilization.\n\nIn addition, some of this year's tailwinds are likely to become next year's headwinds. While the fiscal support provided to households is raising consumer spending and GDP this year, the absence of similar transfers will lower the growth rate of spending next year relative to this year. The boost to spending from pent up demand this year as the economy reopens is also unlikely to be repeated next year.\n\nThe latest jobs report reminds us that while there are good reasons to expect the number of jobs and the number of people wanting to work will make a full recovery, it is unlikely they will recover at the same pace. Over the past few months, the demand for workers has strengthened as COVID-affected sectors have reopened. Labor supply has also improved, with many people coming back into the labor force and others extending their hours of work, but there are indications that many other workers still face virus-related impediments. Although the fraction of the population ages 25 to 54 that is employed has improved in each month of this year, the current prime-age employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio of 76.9 percent is still far from the 80 percent level reached during both of the past two expansions. 5\n\nOn the demand side, we saw a welcome increase of 331,000 jobs in the hard-hit leisure and hospitality sector in April following a 206,000 increase in March. But bottlenecks on inputs such as semiconductors appear to be limiting production and hiring in industries such as motor vehicles, contributing to a decline of 18,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector. The increase in average hours worked and the reduction in people who are working part time but would prefer full-time work suggest some employers are responding to the increase in demand by lengthening workweeks.\n\nOn the supply side, the number of people entering the labor force strengthened for the second month in a row in a welcome sign that more people are actively seeking work as job opportunities and vaccinations increase. But we are also hearing anecdotal accounts that many people face virus-related impediments in returning to full-time work, and many businesses face hiring challenges. With less than one-in-four individuals ages 18 to 64 fully vaccinated at the end of the survey period for the April jobs report, health and safety concerns remain important for in-person work and for people relying on public transport, and childcare remains a challenge for many parents. 6\n\nChildcare remains an impediment for many parents because the return to fully in-person school is still incomplete and childcare options are still limited in many areas. 7 At the time of the April jobs report, nearly two-thirds of students had yet to return to fully in-person schooling, and this share had only increased by 8 percentage points since March. 8 Consistent with this, the labor force participation rate of women ages 25 to 45 was unchanged in April, after an increase in March that coincided with a surge in education hiring and school reopening. Similarly, April saw a small increase in the number of women who reported that they wanted a job but were out of the labor force for family responsibilities, following a large decline in March. 9 Recent research shows that the pandemic has taken a particularly significant toll on the labor market status of many Black and Hispanic mothers and mothers with lower incomes. 10\n\nAggregate average hourly earnings increased by 0.7 percent in April in a positive development for workers. Wage increases were broadly distributed across sectors, including an increase of more than 1-1/2 percent, month over month, in hourly earnings in the leisure and hospitality sector.\n\nWhile labor market conditions have improved in aggregate, significant disparities persist. Although the prime-age EPOP ratio has increased for all racial groups over the past four months, the ratio for Black prime-age workers, at 72.1 percent, is still over 6 percentage points lower than the white prime-age EPOP ratio, while the gap for Hispanic prime-age workers relative to white workers is almost 5 percentage points.\n\nJob losses are disproportionately concentrated in low-wage, high-contact sectors, suggesting that the workers least able to shoulder the economic effect of job loss have faced the greatest challenges. Despite the more than 900,000 jobs gained in the leisure and hospitality sector in the first four months of 2021, jobs in this sector remain nearly 3 million below their pre-COVID level. The leisure and hospitality sector alone accounts for 41 percent of the net loss in private payrolls since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThere is good reason to expect a strong rebound in employment over coming quarters, although the different forces affecting demand and supply may lead to uneven rates of progress. But today, by any measure, employment remains far from our goals. The unemployment rate remains elevated at 8.9 percent when we adjust the narrow 6.1 percent U-3 measure of unemployment to also reflect workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started and those who are misclassified. As of the latest reading, there is an employment shortfall of 8.2 million relative to the pre-pandemic level, and the employment shortfall is over 10 million if we take into account the secular job growth that would have occurred over the period since February 2020 in normal circumstances. 11\n\nThe path of inflation is also difficult to predict, although there are a variety of reasons to expect an increase in inflation associated with reopening that is largely transitory. Most immediately, base effects are likely to contribute substantially to the 12-month readings of headline and core PCE inflation in April and May as the price declines of March and April 2020 roll out of the 12-month calculation. I also anticipate that the recent surge in energy prices, which contributed about 1/2 percentage point to the March 12-month headline PCE reading, will fade over time, although recent pipeline disruptions add some uncertainty.\n\nIt is much more difficult to predict the size and duration of supply-side bottlenecks and how these will interact with the pattern of demand to feed through into inflation. The production of certain semiconductors may take some time to ramp up, and the feedback effects between shipping delays and container shortages appear to be only slowly working themselves out. In contrast, the manufacturing capacity taken offline by the harsh weather in Texas in February is coming back online rapidly. If past experience is any guide, production will rise to meet the level of goods demand before too long. The supplyâdemand imbalances in the in-person services sector are expected to be resolved within a few quarters with progress on virus control and the return of in-person schooling. And demand growth itself is expected to moderate after a reopening surge, broadly coinciding with the time when some of the current tailwinds from fiscal support and makeup consumption turn to headwinds. Of course, there may be additional demand and supply surprises that could further complicate the inflation picture.\n\nTo the extent that supply chain congestion and other reopening frictions are transitory, they are unlikely to generate persistently higher inflation on their own. A persistent material increase in inflation would require not just that wages or prices increase for a period after reopening, but also a broad expectation that they will continue to increase at a persistently higher pace. A limited period of pandemic-related price increases is unlikely to durably change inflation dynamics. Past experience suggests many businesses are likely to compress margins and to rely on automation to reduce costs rather than fully passing on price increases. 12 In the December Duke CFO Survey, roughly one-half of chief financial officers from large firms and about one-third of those from small firms reported \"using, or planning to use, automation or technology to reduce reliance on labor.\" 13 The pandemic-induced shift to virtual, or contactless, versions of many previously in-person interactions is likely to lead to some durable shifts in the use of technology.\n\nThus, there are compelling reasons to expect the well-entrenched inflation dynamics that prevailed for a quarter-century to reassert themselves next year as imbalances associated with reopening are resolved, work and consumption patterns settle into a post-pandemic \"new normal,\" and some of the current tailwinds shift to headwinds. 14\n\nI will be carefully monitoring measures of longer-term inflation expectations to ensure they are well anchored at 2 percent. To date, various measures suggest inflation expectations remain well anchored and broadly consistent with our new framework. The Index of Common Inflation Expectations moved back to 2 percent in the first quarter, returning to its level in 2018, which is lower than its level prior to 2014. 15 In addition, the term structure of market-based measures of inflation compensation is consistent with market participants expecting a limited period of inflation above 2 percent. A straight read of the difference between the forward nominal Treasury curve and the forward Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities curve implies inflation compensation is expected to be higher for the next two years and to decline subsequently and remain stable 5 and 10 years into the future.\n\nI will remain attentive to the risk that what seem like transitory inflationary pressures could prove persistent as I closely monitor the incoming data. Should this risk manifest, we have the tools and the experience to gently guide inflation back to our target. No one should doubt our commitment to do so.\n\nBut recent experience suggests we should not lightly dismiss the risk on the other side. Achieving our inflation goal requires firmly anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent. Following the reopening, there will need to be strong underlying momentum to reach the outcomes in our forward guidance. Remaining patient through the transitory surge associated with reopening will help ensure that the underlying economic momentum that will be needed to reach our goals as some current tailwinds shift to headwinds is not curtailed by a premature tightening of financial conditions.\n\nThe outlook is bright, but risks remain, and we are far from our goals. The latest employment report reminds us that realized outcomes can diverge from forward projections and underscores the value of patience. As the economy reopens fully and the recovery gathers momentum, it will be important to remain patiently focused on achieving the maximum-employment and inflation outcomes in our guidance.\n\n1.

    "text": "December 17, 2020\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt the Consumer Bankers Association Community Reinvestment Act Committee Meeting\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to take part in the Consumer Bankers Association's (CBA's) Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Committee meeting. The CRA officers and teams at your institutions play an important role in identifying community priorities and building partnerships with stakeholders to implement effective CRA programs. We appreciate the opportunity to hear feedback from CBA members and this committee reflecting your extensive experience making loans and investments to support local communities. 1\n\nThe Federal Reserve issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on CRA modernization earlier this fall. 2 The ANPR seeks to strengthen the regulation in alignment with the CRA statute, and the discussion in the ANPR recognizes the historical context of redlining and racial discrimination prior to the CRA's enactment in 1977. We believe that the CRA remains an important tool to promote economic and financial inclusion, and we have specifically asked for feedback about what modifications and approaches would strengthen CRA regulatory implementation in addressing ongoing systemic inequity in credit access for minority individuals and communities.\n\nWe also recognize the need to update the regulation to reflect the changes that have happened in the banking industry over time. In addition, the ANPR reflects other key objectives like providing greater consistency and transparency in CRA examinations, effectively tailoring regulations, and minimizing data burden.\n\nWe're looking forward to feedback on these big-picture questions and objectives in addition to the specific proposals discussed in the ANPR. Many of the ideas in the ANPR reflect interagency discussions, and our hope is that the ANPR provides a foundation for the agencies to converge on a consistent approach to CRA modernization that also has strong stakeholder support.\n\nLet me take a minute to highlight some of the key proposals addressed in the ANPR.\n\nFirst, we propose a CRA evaluation framework that incorporates the use of metrics and tailored standards that take into account differences across local communities and reflect differences in bank size and business model. We heard feedback about the importance of separately evaluating retail and community development activities in order to capture the distinct importance of each type of activity in meeting community needs. Therefore, the ANPR proposes that large retail banks would be evaluated under two separate testsâa Retail Test and a Community Development Test. Each of these tests is further divided into two subtests, which would result in large banks being evaluated under four subtests in each assessment area. Small retail banks, however, would be able to choose whether to be evaluated under the current framework or under the new framework. Small retail banks that elect the new framework would be assessed solely under a Retail Lending Subtest, unless they elect to have other activities considered.\n\nThe Retail Lending Subtest and Community Development Financing Subtest are grounded in a transparent, metrics-based approach to evaluating CRA performance. We propose using metrics that are tailored to local market conditions and that reflect changes across the business cycle. In addition, we have also asked for feedback on ways to pair the use of metrics with targeted performance context considerations about the impact and responsiveness of retail lending and community development financing activities.\n\nIn considering the use of metrics, the ANPR also proposes ways to tailor evaluations to a bank's business model and major product lines. For example, it proposes a major product line threshold of 15 percent of the dollar value of the bank's mortgage, small business, or small farm lending in a specific assessment area. This threshold would be separately applied to each of these product lines and would create more transparency and certainty about which lending products are evaluated in an assessment area. We also recognize that consumer lending is a unique business line, and we ask for feedback on approaches specific to evaluating consumer lending.\n\nIn proposing metrics-based approaches, we recognize the tradeoff between providing greater clarity and certainty, as against the potential burden of additional data collection and reporting requirements. The proposed metrics in the ANPR would rely on existing data to the greatest extent possible. Small banks would be exempt from deposit data collection and reporting requirements, and data used for the lending analysis would be the same as is used for current examinations. For large banks, we propose using existing data sources where possible, and we ask for feedback about potential ways to minimize the number of larger banks that would need to collect and report more-granular deposits data for a metrics-based approach.\n\nSecond, the ANPR seeks feedback on several options for updating the approach for defining assessment areas where a bank's performance will be evaluated. With the changes in the banking system and the growth of mobile and internet banking, many banks are increasingly doing business beyond the boundaries of their branch-based assessment areas. However, we have also received feedback and have reviewed data that branches continue to play a critical role in lower-income and rural communities. The ANPR proposes maintaining facility-based assessment areas while also exploring options for defining new assessment areas. Specifically, we ask for feedback on whether new assessment areas should be based on some threshold of deposits or lending in areas where the bank does not have a physical presence, and the ANPR discusses a potential option of allowing internet banks to have a national assessment area.\n\nFinally, with respect to community development, we have heard feedback from stakeholders that it would be helpful to have more upfront clarity on what activities count for the CRA. We proposed providing an illustrative, non-exhaustive list of activities that meet the requirements for CRA consideration and are requesting feedback on how such a list should developed and maintained. And we ask for input on developing a preapproval process for activities and whether the process should focus on specific transactions or on more general categories of eligible activities.\n\nThe ANPR also seeks feedback on how to clarify elements of existing community development definitions. For example, within the affordable housing definition, we seek feedback on defining naturally occurring affordable housing, which is not financed by any type of public subsidy and provides an important source of affordable housing in many communities.\n\nIn all of these proposals, we aim to modernize the CRA in a way that advances the core purpose of the statute, while also providing greater certainty, tailoring regulations, and minimizing burden. Over the next few months, the Federal Reserve System will host outreach meetings and listening sessions like this one around the country. We encourage the public to submit written comments by the deadline of February 16, 2021, and I look forward to your feedback. 3\n\n1.

    "text": "June 01, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt The Economic Club of New York, New York, New York (via webcast)\n\nIt is a pleasure to join the Economic Club of New York for this discussion. 1 Consumer demand is strong, vaccine coverage is expanding, and pandemic-affected sectors are reopening in fits and starts. As was the pandemic shutdown with its ebbs and flows, the reopening is without precedent, and it is generating supplyâdemand mismatches at the sectoral level that are temporary in nature. Separating signal from noise in the high-frequency data may be challenging for a stretch. The supplyâdemand mismatches at the sectoral level are making it difficult to precisely assess inflationary developments and the amount of resource slack from month to month.\n\nLooking through the noise, I expect we will see further progress in coming months, but the economy is far from our goals, and there are risks on both sides. The best way to achieve our maximum-employment and average-inflation goals is to be steady and transparent in our outcome-based approach to monetary policy while remaining attentive to the evolution of the data and prepared to adjust as needed.\n\nPent-Up Demand and Supply Constraints Last week's updated estimate of first-quarter real gross domestic product continued to show strong annualized growth of 6.4 percent. I expect a further acceleration in output growth driven by consumer demand during the current quarter as the reopening of the economy broadens. 2\n\nLooking through the month-to-month variation, the data suggest that very strong underlying spending growth is continuing this quarter, fueled by recent fiscal support and continued reopening. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) stepped down slightly in April after surging 4.1 percent month over month in March due to a strong spend-out that month of fiscal support from the American Rescue Plan. A similar pattern of moderation in April following outsized strength in March is also evident at the level of individual goods categories, including clothing and general merchandise, as well as spending at sporting goods, hobby, books, and music stores. Spending growth is strong in the pandemic-affected services sectors that are reopening, with spending at restaurants and bars increasing 3 percent in April after surging 13.5 percent in March.\n\nThe shift in the spending data from March to April provides a useful reminder to exercise caution in extrapolating from individual data points in the current environment. Growth this year is expected to be the strongest in decades as the economy bounces back from the depressed level associated with the pandemic. The supplemental savings accumulated over the course of the pandemic from fiscal support and constrained services consumption hold the potential for a substantial amount of additional spending, but there is uncertainty about how much of it is likely to be spent out this year as opposed to being spent out more slowly over time.\n\nWhile the early spend-out from fiscal support in the first quarter of this year was exceptionally strong, whether that strength will be maintained depends in part on the distribution of the remaining additional savings. Spending could moderate, for instance, if the additional savings is concentrated among higher-income households that may have already completed many of their durable goods purchases and may return to pre-pandemic consumption of discretionary services rather than making up for the underconsumption during the shutdown. 3 The timing of household consumption out of the accumulated savings will be very important for the strength of demand not just this year, but also next. Today's fiscal tailwinds are projected to shift to headwinds next year. So an important question is how much household spending will continue to support growth into next year as opposed to settling back to pre-pandemic trends, which would be an additional headwind relative to the strong makeup consumption we have seen so far this year.\n\nDuring the current reopening phase, the surge in demand is hitting some sectors before the supply side has had a chance to catch up. Many businesses shrank in order to survive the pandemic and now may be struggling or moving cautiously to expand capacity. These mismatches are exacerbated in some sectors by idiosyncratic supply disruptions, such as in semiconductors, steel, and lumber. Importantly, the reopening pains associated with mismatches between demand and supply in most sectors are temporary in nature and are likely to be resolved as pent-up demand moderates and businesses hire and expand. These temporary reopening mismatches are evident in recent data on both the employment and inflation sides of our mandate.\n\nSupplyâDemand Mismatches in Inflation The reopening dynamics are evident in the April inflation readings. I had been anticipating a notable move up in inflation beginning in April and lasting several months due to a combination of base effects and temporary reopening supply and demand mismatches. 4 Core PCE inflation moved up to 3.1 percent on a 12-month basis in April, while 12-month total PCE inflation rose to 3.6 percent amid high energy prices. A significant portion of these 12-month readings reflect contributions from base effects that resulted from the pandemic-related price declines in March 2020 dropping out of the 12-month calculation.\n\nCore PCE inflation is estimated to be 2.4 percent in April after adjusting for base effects. Apart from base effects, the underlying factors driving the increase in inflation are consistent with my expectations that we would see temporary price increases associated with sectoral supplyâdemand imbalances, and that the timing and sectoral incidence of these increases would be difficult to predict. While the level of inflation in my near-term outlook has moved somewhat higher, my expectation for the contour of inflation moving back towards its underlying trend in the period beyond the reopening remains broadly unchanged.\n\nThe increases in a few categories that were prominent contributors to the month-over-month April core PCE reading of 0.66 percent illustrate the role of temporary frictions associated with the economy's unprecedented reopening. Used vehicles, airfares, and accommodations together contributed nearly one-third of month-over-month core PCE inflation in April even though the cumulative weight of all three components in the core PCE basket is only 3 percent. The major contributors to the April core PCE inflation increase are not significant drivers of core inflation historically.\n\nThe used vehicles category contributed just over 0.1 percentage point to the April core PCE reading. On the demand side, stimulus payments and low borrowing rates have given households additional capability to purchase vehicles, and the pandemic appears to have increased the relative value of private transportation. On the supply side, with the limited production of new cars due to the semiconductor shortage, rental car companies have become buyers in the used vehicles market in order to restore the capacity they had shuttered during the pandemic, whereas they would normally be net sellers in this market. As a result, used car prices, which had followed a slight downward trend in the years leading up to the pandemic, jumped a record 10 percent in April. While these pressures may persist over the summer months, I expect them to fade and likely reverse somewhat in subsequent quarters.\n\nSimilarly, the travel-related accommodations and airfare sectors also contributed nearly 0.1 percentage point to month-over-month core PCE inflation. Prices in these categories are recovering from depressed values well below their pre-COVID levels. Prices are expected to continue to rise amid renewed summer travel, but the natural limitations to making up spending on foregone travel are likely to result in a normalization of demand growth after a few quarters, and the capacity in these sectors will likewise increase from their depressed pandemic levels as hiring proceeds.\n\nIn assessing the risk that such transitory pricing pressures get embedded in persistently high inflation, it is critical to remember that inflation averaged less than 2 percent over the past quarter-century, and that statistical measures of trend inflation ran consistently below 2 percent for decades before the pandemic. 5 Relative to the entrenched inflation dynamics that existed before the pandemic, the sharp temporary increases in some categories of goods and services seem unlikely to leave an imprint on longer-run inflation behavior.\n\nTo be sure, I will keep a close watch on a range of indicators for any signs of an unwelcome change in longer-term inflation expectations. The measure of breakeven inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) suggests that the recent inflation data have not disturbed longer-run inflation expectations. Indeed, since the April consumer price index data were released, TIPS-based breakeven inflation compensation for the next five years, as well as those for the five-year, five-year-forward, have moved down, not up. The TIPS measures suggest that market participants are demanding less compensation for expected longer-term inflation than they were before the April inflation data were released, rather than more.\n\nSurvey-based measures of inflation expectations are mixed. The most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters showed an increase in median PCE inflation expectations over the next five years from 2 percent to 2.2 percent, and a smaller increase for inflation expectations over the next 10 years, from 2 percent to 2.1 percent. 6 Similar to the market-based measures, this survey measure implies a slight decline in the forward inflation measure used to proxy for longer-term inflation expectations relative to medium-term expectations. In contrast, the median response in May to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers regarding inflation over the next 5 to 10 years moved up to a level last reached in 2013. 7 The Board staff's Index of Common Inflation Expectations, which combines the most recent signals from both market- and survey-based indicators, edged up a few basis points, reaching the bottom end of its range of values before the 2014 decline. 8\n\nThe inflation dynamics seen over the past few decades have led to inflation that is somewhat below target and relatively stable. Inflation dynamics have generally evolved very gradually. Longer-term inflation expectations have been well anchored, so when some developments have pushed inflation above or below target, the rise has not been embedded in the ongoing inflation rate.\n\nSupplyâDemand Mismatches in Employment A temporary mismatch between the surge in demand and a fitful supply response at the sectoral level is also evident in recent employment data. While job openings are at the top of their range, the payroll data in April were surprisingly weak. In part, the weak payrolls reflected some sectors where supply chain disruptions are limiting production despite strong demand. While motor vehicle sales were robust through April, a semiconductor shortage has resulted in production limits and the idling of a number of U.S. auto plants. 9 These plant closings were evident in a decline of 27,000 jobs in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts in April, more than accounting for the 18,000 decline in manufacturing employment overall. Similarly, employment in construction was flat in April after increasing notably in March, as single-family housing starts dropped 13 percent over the month amid shortages of lumber that constrained contractors' activity. 10\n\nThe lackluster 218,000 increase in private payrolls in April also reflects post-pandemic sectoral reallocation. Sectors that expanded employment substantially in response to COVID-related demand appear to be shedding jobs in preparation for a post-pandemic world, with delivery services jobs declining by 77,000 and grocery store jobs declining by 50,000.\n\nWith the most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showing a record 8.1 million job openings at the end of March, it appears that labor supply is lagging behind labor demand in several sectors, in part reflecting ongoing concerns about the virus and caregiving responsibilities. 11 At the time of the April survey, 2.8 million people reported being out of the labor force because of the pandemic, and only 23 percent of the 18-to-64-year-old population were fully vaccinated. The vaccinated fraction of the working-age population had increased to 40 percent by mid-May. 12 Constraints related to schooling and childcare are ongoing, and these have disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic mothers and mothers in lower-income households. 13 While it is now rare for a school district to be fully remote, recent estimates indicate that just over one-half of U.S. students are in school districts that continue to operate in a hybrid learning environment rather than fully in person. 14\n\nThere is some debate about whether the supplemental funds provided by unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are leading workers to stay on the sidelines. 15 The high level of employment gains in the lowest-wage sector and the reduction in continued claims seem inconsistent with supplemental UI benefits playing a large role in the April employment report. The largest employment gains in the otherwise tepid April employment report were in the low-wage leisure and hospitality sector, where UI replacement rates are among the highest. In addition, between the March and April reference weeks, continued UI claims, inclusive of Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Extended Benefits, fell by about 1.3 millionâindicating that many workers returned to work despite previously receiving UI benefits.\n\nIt is difficult to disentangle the effects of concerns about contracting the virus or caregiving responsibilities brought on by the pandemic from those of UI benefits. All of these factors are likely to diminish by autumn with the return to fully in-person school, continued progress on vaccinations, and the expiration of supplemental UI benefits in early Septemberâor earlier, in many states.\n\nFor all these reasons, the supplyâdemand mismatches in the labor market are likely to be temporary, and I expect to see further progress on employment in coming months. That said, today employment remains far from our goal. Jobs are down by over 8 million relative to their pre-pandemic level, and the shortfall is over 10 million jobs if we take into account the secular job growth that would have occurred over the past year in normal circumstances. As of April, the overall prime-age employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio is 76.9 percent, more than 3 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level. The shortfall in the prime-age EPOP ratio is around 5 percentage points for Black and Hispanic workers relative to their October 2019 peaks.\n\nPolicy Although continued vigilance is warranted, the inflation and employment data thus far appear to reflect a temporary misalignment of supply and demand that should fade over time as the demand surge normalizes, reopening is completed, and supply adapts to the post-pandemic new normal. Under our guidance, adjustments in the path of monetary policy are transparently tied to realized progress on our maximum-employment and 2 percent average-inflation goals. Jobs are down by between 8 and 10 million compared with the level we would have seen in the absence of the pandemic. And it will be important to see sustained progress on inflation given the preceding multiple year trend of inflation below 2 percent. While we are far from our goals, we are seeing welcome progress, and I expect to see further progress in coming months.\n\nI am attentive to the risks on both sides of this expected path. I will carefully monitor inflation and indicators of inflation expectations for any signs that longer-term inflation expectations are evolving in unwelcome ways. Should inflation move materially and persistently above 2 percent, we have the tools and experience to gently guide inflation back down to target, and no one should doubt our commitment to do so.\n\nJust as it is important to be attentive to upside risks, it is also important to be attentive to the risks of pulling back too soon. In the previous monetary policy framework, the customary preemptive tightening based on the outlook to head off concerns about future high inflation likely curtailed critical employment opportunities for many Americans and embedded persistently below-target inflation. The entrenched pre-pandemic combination of low equilibrium interest rates, low underlying trend inflation, and a flat Phillips curve is likely to reassert itself after reopening is complete. This type of environment creates asymmetric risks, since the lower bound constraint means that policy can respond more readily when inflation surprises to the upside than to the downside.\n\nRemaining steady in our outcomes-based approach during the transitory reopening surge will help ensure the economic momentum that will be needed as current tailwinds shift to headwinds is not curtailed by a premature tightening of financial conditions. The best way to achieve and sustain our maximum-employment and average-inflation goals is by remaining steady and clear in our approach while also being attentive to changing conditions.\n\n1.

    "text": "February 18, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt the \"2021 IIF U.S. Climate Finance Summit: Financing a Pro Growth Pro Markets Transition to a Sustainable, Low-Carbon Economy\" hosted by the Institute of International Finance, Washington, D.C.\n\nI want to thank the Institute of International Finance for inviting me to join this discussion. Let me start by noting that these are my own views and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 1\n\nClimate change is already imposing substantial economic costs and is projected to have a profound effect on the economy at home and abroad. 2 Future financial and economic impacts will depend on the frequency and severity of climate-related events and on the nature and the speed at which countries around the world transition to a greener economy. 3\n\nClimate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy create both risks and opportunities for the financial sector. Financial institutions that do not put in place frameworks to measure, monitor, and manage climate-related risks could face outsized losses on climate-sensitive assets caused by environmental shifts, by a disorderly transition to a low-carbon economy, or by a combination of both. Conversely, robust risk management, scenario analysis, and forward planning can help ensure financial institutions are resilient to climate-related risks and well-positioned to support the transition to a more sustainable economy.\n\nMaking Progress on Climate Change The economic consequences of climate change are already in evidence. There is growing evidence that extreme weather events related to climate change are on the riseâdroughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and heat waves are all becoming more common. 4 Natural disasters are a major source of losses to households and businesses; one study finds that natural disasters have resulted in more than $5.2 trillion in losses globally since 1980, more than 70 percent of which was not insured. 5 Extreme weather events have been shown to disrupt corporate supply chains and impact corporate profitability. 6 Chronic flooding and sea level rise negatively impact property values. 7 These events are expected to increase in frequency and severity over time, which could impact borrower creditworthiness or collateral values.\n\nWith climate-related risks on the rise, governments, regulators, corporations, and investors are mobilizing to accelerate the transition to a greener economy, including through ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Unanticipated or abrupt shifts in policy, technology, or investor sentiment have the potential to produce abrupt repricing events that could result in losses on financial institution balance sheets. Over a longer horizon, such shifts could also have implications for their business strategies.\n\nClimate change can affect the financial system through both of these channels. \"Physical risks\" refer to damages caused by an increase in the frequency or severity of weather events or other climate shifts. \"Transition risks\" arise from changes in policy, technology, or consumer behavior that lead to a lower-carbon economy. These physical and transition risks could materialize as traditional financial risks to supervised institutions, including through increased credit, market, operational, reputational, and liquidity risk.\n\nWe are already seeing financial institutions responding to climate-related risks by encouraging borrowers to adapt to and manage the risks associated with a changing climate, responding to investors' demands for climate-friendly portfolios, and funding critical private-sector initiatives to move toward more climate-friendly business models. 8 As noted by members of our Federal Advisory Council, \"[t]here has been increasing awareness among financial institutions of the need to define and develop risk management frameworks that incorporate these [climate-related financial] risks into strategic decision making on multiple levels, including investment approaches and the long-term structuring of portfolios.\" 9\n\nSupervisors have a responsibility to ensure that financial institutions are resilient to all material risksâincluding those related to climate changeâboth currently and into the future. It is essential that financial institutionsâand the financial sector as a wholeâare resilient to and prepared for the challenges of climate change. A recent survey of central banks found a large majority view it as appropriate \"to act within their existing mandate to mitigate climate-related financial risks\" that \"could potentially impact the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and could pose potential financial stability concerns for the financial system.\" 10\n\nAddressing climate-related risks and opportunities, however, will not be easy. It will require a sustained commitmentâboth from financial institutions and their regulatorsâto invest in expertise, modeling, and data, and a willingness to learn and improve over time. Climate change presents a number of complex conceptual and practical challenges that must be considered as we work together to develop a framework to ensure financial institutions are resilient to climate-related risks.\n\nDespite the challenges, it will be critical to make progress, even if initially imperfect, in order to ensure that financial institutions are resilient to climate-related financial risks and well-positioned for the opportunities associated with the transition to a more sustainable economy. I will touch on a few of the conceptual challenges that will need to be addressed as we consider the implications of climate change for our mandated responsibilities and determine how best to incorporate climate-related risks into our supervisory framework. Uncertainty, Data, and Disclosure While the scientific evidence for climate change is unequivocal, estimates of the magnitude of climate-related financial risks are highly uncertain. 11 This uncertainty stems from a number of factors. Predicting the timing and magnitude of physical risk drivers such as hurricanes, wildfires, or droughts is inherently complex. The predicted path of climate change may be nonlinear and may include tipping points or critical thresholds that, when exceeded, can lead to a significant change in the state of the climate system. 12 There is also transition-related uncertainty associated with policy developments, technological change, and shifts in behavior and preferences. Moreover, the economic and financial market impacts of climate-related risks vary across geographies, sectors, and jurisdictions and depend importantly on the existence of feedback loops. Finally, the long time horizon associated with climate change, the lack of historical data, the potential for sudden shifts in asset valuations, and the paucity of information on the climate-sensitivity of exposures complicate the translation of climate-related risks into measures of credit, market, liquidity, reputational, and operational risks. 13\n\nImproved data, disclosures, and modelling techniques will be crucial to reducing uncertainty around the potential magnitude of risks related to climate change. Financial institutions are collecting data and experimenting with scenario analysis and other techniques to better understand the potential impact of climate-related risks to their balance sheets and business models. 14 Similarly, the Federal Reserve is investing in data and empirical work to analyze the transmission of climate-related risks to the economy and developing methodologies to measure these risks, as are other central banks. 15\n\nFinancial institutions note that \"the development of uniform data standards and metrics for disclosures will be critical to adequately identify and compare climate risks across businesses and sectors.\" 16 That underscores the importance of efforts such as the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) that work toward consistent climate-related financial disclosures to improve transparency, reduce uncertainty, and help market participants appropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities. 17 Current voluntary disclosure practices are an important first step, but they are prone to variable quality, incompleteness, and a lack of actionable data. 18 Ultimately, moving toward standardized, reliable, and mandatory disclosures could provide better access to the data required to appropriately manage risks.\n\nEven with improved data and disclosures, uncertainty about the future climate trajectory will remain. 19 This residual uncertainty should not stand in the way of making prudent investments in risk-management practices in the near term to strengthen the financial sector against climate-related risks. Instead, supervisory approaches should encourage institutions to take the necessary risk-management steps to ensure their business models and strategies are robust to the wide range of potential outcomes that may evolve over timeâincluding the possible use of new tools where appropriate.\n\nTools Climate-related risks have unique characteristics that may warrant consideration of new approaches to measuring and managing risk, and new or enhanced supervisory tools. Determining whether the existing supervisory toolkit is adequate or if changes are needed will require careful thought and rigorous analysis of the unique aspects of climate risks, including their long-time horizon, variability across geographies and sectors, and data challenges. As always, supervisory approaches will be informed by analytical assessments and transparent discussions.\n\nSupervised institutions are beginning to adapt their governance, risk-identification, and risk-management processes, and business models to reflect climate-related risks. It is clear that physical and transition risks could have significantly different impacts on institutions of varying sizes, complexities, and business models, and with exposures to different geographies. Banks have told us that, \"prospective guidance and regulation should be (1) designed to assist institutions of all types and sizes to measure, monitor, and disclose the associated financial risks [from climate change]; and (2) tailored to the complexity of specific types of institutions.\" 20\n\nIn light of the high uncertainty inherent in estimating climate risks, scenario analysis may be a helpful tool to assess the microprudential and macroprudential implications of climate-related risks under a wide range of assumptions. Climate scenario analysis identifies climate-related physical and transition risk factors facing financial firms, formulates appropriate stresses of those risk factors under different scenarios, and measures their effects on individual firms and the financial system as a whole.\n\nTo be clear, scenario analysis is distinct from our traditional regulatory stress tests at banks. Scenario analysis is an exploratory exercise that allows banks and supervisors to assess business model resilience to a range of long-run scenarios. It seeks to understand the effects of climate-related risks on a range of financial markets and institutions, as well as the potentially complex dynamics among them. By contrast, traditional stress tests are a regulatory exercise to assess the capital adequacy of banks to specific macroeconomic scenarios and financial market shocks over the short-run. We are closely following the climate scenarios being developed by other central banks and supervisory authorities and engaging with those institutions so we can learn from their experiences. It will be important to think carefully about the potential for scenario analysis to support microprudential and macroprudential objectives and to consider how stress testing and scenario analysis may complement one another.\n\nEfficiency and Robustness There is unlikely to be a single \"right\" approach to a challenge as complex as the financial impact of climate change. Microprudential supervisors and regulators generally aim to promote the goals of a safe and sound banking system in the way that is as efficient and effective as possible. 21 Developing an effective framework is likely to be a complex undertaking in considering the linkages between climate change, the economy and financial markets, and ultimately the risks faced by individual banks.\n\nFor instance, consider model development and scenario analysis. At first glance, it might appear most efficient and least burdensome to apply a prescriptive approach that specifies the appropriate data and a scenario and leverages a particular credit model to produce a standardized output across firms. Although there are benefits to standardization in some areas such as data and taxonomies, it is not clear a highly prescriptive approach would be the most effective way to ensure financial institutions are well-prepared for the range of possible impacts of climate change, even if the execution burden is low. Ultimately, the outcomes are likely to be more robust if we innovate and experiment, and leverage a range of complementary approaches being developed in both the private and the public sectors. 22 In considering the trade-off here, we should strive for an appropriate balance that allows for innovation and learning across the public and private sectors, iterating in the most effective way possible.\n\nThe Path Ahead While recognizing the challenges, the Federal Reserve is making strides in better understanding climate-related risks and determining how best to incorporate them into our supervisory framework. The Federal Reserve announced last month the creation of a Supervision Climate Committee (SCC). 23 It will strengthen the Federal Reserve's capacity to identify and assess financial risks from climate change. The SCC will work to develop an appropriate program to ensure the resilience of supervised firms to climate-related financial risks. It will leverage expertise from across the Federal Reserve System to develop a robust, tailored program that reflects risk differences across types of firms and geographies.\n\nThe SCC is focusing on engagement with the private and official sectors to understand the potential impact of climate-related risks. It is engaging with a diverse group of supervised institutions and industry groups to learn how banks of different sizes, with different business models and different geographic exposures are considering both climate risks and opportunities and what they are doing to prepare for the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are learning a great deal from these discussions, and we look forward to continued engagement with the industry on this topic.\n\nThe microprudential work of the SCC is one part of our efforts to take into account climate-related risks in carrying out the responsibilities Congress has assigned to us. The SCC will work with staff in our financial stability, community development, international coordination, and research and data areas to build a coordinated approach to integrating climate-related risks where they affect our responsibilities.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is engaging with colleagues from other regulatory agencies, central banks, and standard-setting bodies. At home, this includes exploring with members of the U.S. Global Change Research Program the ways additional scientific data, models, and other information would be used to expand our analysis of weather-related disasters and climate-related risks.\n\nClimate change is a global challenge, and we recognize the benefit of collaboration across the official sector, while also taking into account important differences across jurisdictions. The Federal Reserve is co-chairing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks (TFCR). 24 Having completed a stock-take of members' existing regulatory and supervisory initiatives on climate-related financial risks, the TFCR is now focused on finalizing by midyear a report exploring the transmission channels of climate risks to the banking system and a report that describes the methodologies used by banks and supervisors to measure these risks. Next, the TFCR will turn its attention to developing supervisory practices to mitigate climate-related financial risks where there are potential gaps in the Basel framework. Already, many banks are incorporating supervisory expectations with regard to management of climate-related risks in foreign jurisdictions, for instance from the European Central Bank and the UK Prudential Regulatory Authority. 25 The TCFR's work will be helpful in strengthening supervisory collaboration across jurisdictions, which is important to banks that are internationally active.\n\nWe also participate in the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) work on climate change. Building on previous reports on climate-related risk-transmission channels in the financial system, with a particular focus on amplification mechanisms and cross-border effects, the FSB is now assessing the availability of data through which climate-related risks to financial stability could be monitored, as well as any data gaps. 26 In addition, the FSB is exploring ways to promote globally comparable, high-quality and auditable standards of disclosure based on the recommendations in the TCFD.\n\nThe Federal Reserve recently became a full member of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a network of more than 80 central banks and supervisory authorities from around the world that focuses on sharing research and identifying best practices to ensure the financial system is resilient to climate-related risks. Through the NGFS, we are engaged in work on the microprudential and macrofinancial impacts of climate change, trends in green finance, data gaps, and research.\n\nIn wrestling with the many complexities and challenges related to climate change, there are likely to be significant opportunities for collaboration with the private and official sectors. These are not easy problems, and they will not have easy solutions. We will undoubtedly reach better outcomes if we tackle these challenges through open dialogue, information sharing, and transparency. Together, we can help ensure the financial system is resilient to the risks that arise from climate change and well-positioned to support the transition to a greener economy.\n\n1.

    "text": "March 02, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics, Council on Foreign Relations, New York, New York (via webcast)\n\nIt has been one year since the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit our shoresâa year marked by heartbreak and hardship. We are all looking forward to a brighter time ahead, when vaccinations are widespread, the recovery is broad based and inclusive, and services, schools, sports, and social life are in person. The expected path of the U.S. economy has strengthened with the prospect of widespread vaccinations and additional fiscal stimulus, but risks remain, and we are currently far from our goals. 1\n\nCurrent Situation After a dark winter with elevated case counts and setbacks on service-sector jobs, case counts have come down and spending is picking up. Economic forecasts for growth during the first quarter have been significantly upgraded in response to the better-than-expected data. 2 January data for household spending overall came in strongâconfirming that the renewal of fiscal support at the end of the year provided a much needed boost to household incomes and spending at the turn of the year. The income support provided by fiscal authorities to hard-hit workers, households, businesses, and states and localities, as well as the actions of the Federal Reserve to promote orderly functioning in financial markets and low borrowing costs for households and businesses, have been providing vital support for the economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, vaccinations have been increasing, while weekly cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have decreased. The seven-day moving average of daily COVID deaths, which peaked in mid-January, declined about 35 percent during the month of February, although sadly it is still at high levels. 3 As of yesterday, nearly 77 million vaccination doses had been administered.\n\nWhile the progress on vaccinations is promising, jobs are currently down by 10 million relative to pre-pandemic levels. Improvements in the labor market stalled late last year after rebounding partway in the summer and fall of 2020. When we take into consideration the more than 4 million workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started, as well as misclassification errors, the unemployment rate is close to 10 percent currentlyâmuch higher than the headline unemployment rate of 6.3 percent.\n\nLabor force participation by prime-age workers stands lower now, on net, than it did in June after it had bounced back partway from the decline in April. 4 The decline in labor force participation relative to last June is largely a result of lower participation by prime-age women, which, in turn, partly reflects the increase in caregiving work at home with the move to remote schooling and the shutdown of daycares due to COVID. On average, over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age women with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving had increased by 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for men the fraction had increased by about 0.6 percentage point. 5 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâage women could have scarring effects, with longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth. 6\n\nRoughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the pre-COVID level is concentrated in service-providing industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality. The concentration of job losses in services has had a disproportionate effect on the lowest-wage workers. Workers in the lowest-wage quartile face an extremely elevated rate of unemployment of around 23 percent. 7 The advent of widespread vaccinations should revive in-person schooling and childcare along with demand for the in-person services that employ a significant fraction of the lower-wage workforce.\n\nRealized inflation remains low, although inflation expectations appear to have moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run target. Both core and headline measures of 12-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation were 1.5 percent in January, well below our longer-run 2 percent inflation goal. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have moved up in recent months, consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) new commitment to achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time. Market-based indicators of inflation expectations increased over recent months, with Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities-based measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 10 years rising about 40 and 30 basis points, respectively, since the end of last year. Some survey measures of inflation expectations have also moved up in recent months, although, on balance, they have only moved up toward their pre-COVID levels.\n\nIn many foreign countries, growth moderated at the end of 2020, as a spike in COVID hospitalizations and deaths led to tighter public health restrictions in many economies. Retail sales and measures of services activity weakened even as manufacturing and exports remained more resilient. Foreign activity should strengthen later this year as vaccinations rise, COVID case counts decline, and social distancing eases. It should also be aided by some rundown in the stock of excess savings, continued fiscal and monetary support, and strong U.S. demand. The turnaround in growth in each country will hinge on success in controlling the virus and limiting economic scarring from the past year's downturn, as well as on available policy space, and underlying macroeconomic vulnerabilities.\n\nOutlook So, what do these developments suggest for the U.S. outlook? Increasing vaccinations, along with enacted and expected fiscal measures and accommodative monetary policy, point to a strong modal outlook for 2021, although considerable uncertainty remains. It is widely expected that we will continue to make progress controlling the virus, reducing the need for social distancing, but variants of the virus, slow take-up of vaccinations, or both could slow progress.\n\nAdditional fiscal support is likely to provide a significant boost to spending when vaccinations are sufficiently widespread to support a full reopening of in-person services. Various measures of financial conditions are broadly accommodative relative to historical levels and should remain so. The labor market should strengthen, perhaps significantly, as the virus recedes, social distancing comes to an end, and the service sector springs back to life.\n\nInflation is likely to temporarily rise above 2 percent on a 12-month basis when the low March and April price readings from last year fall out of our preferred 12-month PCE measure. Transitory inflationary pressures are possible if there is a surge of demand that outstrips supply in certain sectors when the economy opens up fully. The size of such a surge in demand will depend in part on the effects of additional fiscal stimulus, along with any spend-down of accumulated savings, which are uncertain. 8 But a surge in demand and any inflationary bottlenecks would likely be transitory, as fiscal tailwinds to growth early this year are likely to transition to headwinds sometime thereafter. A burst of transitory inflation seems more probable than a durable shift above target in the inflation trend and an unmooring of inflation expectations to the upside.\n\nWhen considering the inflation outlook, it is important to remember that inflation has averaged slightly below 2 percent for over a quarter-century. In the nine years since the FOMC's announcement of a 2 percent inflation objective, 12-month PCE inflation has averaged under 1-1/2 percent. Readings of 12-month inflation have been below 2 percent in 95 of those 109 months. According to recent research, statistical models estimate that underlying core PCE inflation ranges from one- to four-tenths of 1 percentage point below our 2 percent longer-run target. 9 Recall that at the end of 2019, with unemployment at a multidecade low and after the addition of almost 1-1/2 million workers to the labor force during the previous year, PCE inflation was 1.6 percent for the year.\n\nMonetary Policy With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy. After an extensive review, the FOMC revised its monetary policy framework to reflect important changes in economic relationships characterized by a low equilibrium interest rate, inflation persistently below target, and low sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization. The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations when employment is too high as well as too low. It emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal assessed by a wide range of indicators. In addition, in order to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal, monetary policy will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. Consequently, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\n\nThese changes mean that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. The long-standing presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears estimates of the neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many of the most economically vulnerable Americans. 10 It may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges in the labor force. Instead, the shortfalls approach will enable the labor market to continue to improve absent clear indications of high inflationary pressures or an unmooring of inflation expectations to the upside.\n\nThe FOMC has set out forward guidance on the policy rate and asset purchases that implements the new framework. The guidance indicates an expectation that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Even after economic conditions warrant liftoff, changes in the policy rate are likely to be only gradual, as the forward guidance notes that monetary policy will remain accommodative in order to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time. In addition, asset purchases are expected to continue at least at their current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward our goals.\n\nIn assessing substantial further progress, I will be looking for realized progress toward both our employment and inflation goals. I will be looking for indicators that show the progress on employment is broad based and inclusive rather than focusing solely on the aggregate headline unemployment rate, especially in light of the significant decline in labor force participation since the spread of COVID and the elevated unemployment rate for workers in the lowest-wage quartile and other disproportionately affected groups. 11\n\nLikewise, while I will carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to achieve a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal. The past decade of underperformance on our inflation target highlights that reaching 2 percent inflation will require patience, and we have pledged to hold the policy rate in its current range until not only has inflation risen to 2 percent but it is also on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\n\nOf course, we will be vigilant in parsing the data. Given the path of inflation to date, our framework calls for inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. If, in the future, inflation rises immoderately or persistently above target, and there is evidence that longer-term inflation expectations are moving above our longer-run goal, I would not hesitate to act and believe we have the tools to carefully guide inflation down to target.\n\nToday the economy remains far from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation, and it will take some time to achieve substantial further progress. Jobs are still 10 million below the pre-COVID level, and inflation has been running below 2 percent for years. We will need to be patient to achieve the outcomes set out in our guidance.\n\n1.

    "text": "July 30, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt \"Rebuilding the Post-Pandemic Economy\" 2021 Annual Meeting of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, Aspen, Colorado\n\nThe economy is reopening, consumer spending is strong, and hundreds of thousands of workers are finding jobs in the hard-hit leisure and hospitality sector each month. Pent-up demand has outstripped capacity in some sectors, as businesses that had pared back to survive the pandemic are encountering bottlenecks as they rehire and restock. 1 These mismatches have made it more difficult to interpret the first few months of reopening data.\n\nThe second quarter of 2021 saw a large wave of demand buoyed by fiscal transfers, resulting in annualized real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growth of 11.8 percent. Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 6.5 percent in the second quarter of 2021, slightly less than many forecasters had projected, as that strong consumer demand outstripped production, resulting in a significant decline in inventories.\n\nThe tailwinds to growth from the fiscal stimulus during the first half are shifting to headwinds that will continue through the remainder of 2021 and 2022. Even so, pent-up consumption and full reopening are expected to more than offset fiscal headwinds in the second half such that PCE is expected to grow at a robust rate, and growth is expected to remain strong through the remainder of the year. By the end of the year, the U.S. economy is expected to achieve average annualized growth of 2.2 percent since the onset of COVID-19âslightly above most estimates of longer-term potential output growth. In short, growth this year is expected to compensate fully for last year's sharp contractionâas a result of the strong policy response, effective vaccines, and the resilience and adaptability of American households, workers, and businesses.\n\nWhile we are seeing progress on employment, joblessness remains high and continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics and lower-wage workers in the services sector.\n\nLast December, the Committee indicated that asset purchases would continue until substantial further progress toward our employment and inflation goals had been achieved. The June data showed that there is a shortfall of 6.8 million jobs relative to the pre-pandemic level and 9.1 million jobs relative to the pre-pandemic trend, respectively. The employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio is 3.2 percentage points short of its pre-pandemic level for prime-age workers, a group that is not affected by the elevated level of early retirements during the pandemic. Thus, as of June, we had closed between one-fourth and one-third of the employment shortfall relative to last December according to a variety of measures.\n\nAlthough the EPOP ratio for Black individuals has improved more strongly than the overall ratio over the course of 2021, closing about 40 percent of the December gap, it remains more than 3 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level and more than 2 percentage points below the current level of the EPOP ratio for white individuals.\n\nCurrently, it is difficult to disentangle the effects on labor supply of caregiving responsibilities brought on by the pandemic, fears of contracting the virus, and the enhanced unemployment insurance that was designed in part to address such constraints. Importantly, I expect to be more confident in assessing the rate of progress once we have data in hand for September, when consumption, school, and work patterns should be settling into a post pandemic normal.\n\nI fully expect progress to continue, ultimately leading to a labor market as strong or stronger than we saw before the pandemic. Looking ahead, if jobs were to continue to increase at the second-quarter average monthly pace, about two-thirds of the outstanding job losses as of December 2020 and nearly half of the gap relative to the pre-pandemic trend would be made up by the end of 2021. If, instead, the rate of job growth were to accelerate notably, those levels could be reached somewhat sooner.\n\nToday's data showed that core PCE inflation rose 0.45 percent in June, once again driven by outsized contributions from a handful of categories. New and used vehicles contributed just under 40 percent of the June increase in core PCE, while price increases for travel-related items like hotels, airfares and rental cars contributed another 25 percent. 2 All told, price increases associated with vehicles and vacations, categories that comprise about 8 percent of the core PCE basket, were responsible for over 60 percent of the June core PCE price increase.\n\nRecent high inflation readings reflect supplyâdemand mismatches in a handful of sectors that are likely to prove transitory. In assessing inflation, an annualized 24-month measure that looks through the steep declines and subsequent rebound in prices in categories affected by the pandemic currently has core PCE inflation running at 2.3 percent and headline PCE inflation running at 2.4 percent. It is reasonable to expect these measures to remain near those levels for much of the rest of the year. By comparison, this 24-month measure was running at 1.6 percent in December 2020.\n\nI am attentive to the risk that inflation pressures could broaden or prove persistent, perhaps as a result of wage pressures, persistent increases in rent, or businesses passing on a larger fraction of cost increases rather than reducing markups, as in recent recoveries. I am particularly attentive to any signs that currently high inflation readings are pushing longer-term inflation expectations above our 2 percent objective.\n\nCurrently, I do not see such signs. Most measures of survey- and market-based expectations suggest that the current high inflation pressures are transitory, and underlying trend inflation remains near its pre-COVID trend. Since the June FOMC meeting, five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities has declined a little less than 20 basis points, on net, and it currently stands at 2.2 percent, at the low end of its range of values prior to the 2014 decline. The second-quarter reading from the Federal Reserve Board's index of common inflation expectations stands at 2.05 percent, which is at the bottom of the range that prevailed from 2008 to 2014, when 12-month total PCE inflation averaged 1.7 percent. 3\n\nMany of the forces currently leading to outsized gains in prices are likely to dissipate by this time next year. Current tailwinds from fiscal support and pent-up consumption are likely to shift to headwinds, and some of the outsized price increases associated with acute supply bottlenecks may ease or partially reverse as those bottlenecks are resolved. Lumber prices have fallen, wholesale used car prices appear to have peaked, and auto semiconductor production is projected to expand.\n\nWhile there is good reason to expect that the inflation dynamics that prevailed for a quarter-century will reassert themselves on the other side of reopening, I will remain vigilant to any signs that inflationary pressures are likely to prove more persistent or that expectations are moving above target. If inflation moves persistently and materially above our target, we would adjust policy to guide inflation gently back to target.\n\nThere are risks on both sides of the outlook. There are upside risks to consumption spending associated with the high level of households' savings. There are downside risks associated with the Delta variant. While the economy's momentum is strong, vaccination rates remain low in some areas, and fears related to the Delta variant may damp the rebound in services and complicate the return to in-person school and work in some areas and slow the rotation from goods to services that account for three- fourths of the shortfall in jobs\n\nIn coming meetings, we will continue to assess progress and the conditions under which it will be appropriate to start paring back the pace of our asset purchases. Twenty-four-month core PCE inflation is now running at a 2.3 percent average annualized rate. In contrast, employment is still down by 6.8 million to 9.1 million relative to its pre-COVID level and trend, respectively, and it has closed about one-fourth to one-third of its December gap. The determination of when to begin to slow asset purchases will depend importantly on the accumulation of evidence that substantial further progress on employment has been achieved. As of today, employment has some distance to go.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the achievement of substantial progress that will determine when the Committee starts reducing the pace of asset purchases is distinct from the maximum employment and inflation outcomes that are in the forward guidance for the policy rate. Remaining attentive to changing conditions and steady in our step-by-step approach to implementing policy under our new framework should ensure that the economy's momentum is sufficient when tailwinds shift to headwinds to achieve and sustain maximum employment and inflation robustly anchored at 2 percent.\n\n1.

    "text": "January 12, 2021\n\nGovernor Lael Brainard\n\nAt the AI Academic Symposium hosted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. (Virtual Event)\n\nToday's symposium on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services is part of the Federal Reserve's broader effort to understand AI's application to financial services, assess methods for managing risks arising from this technology, and determine where banking regulators can support responsible use of AI and equitable outcomes by improving supervisory clarity. 1\n\nThe potential scope of AI applications is wide ranging. For instance, researchers are turning to AI to help analyze climate change, one of the central challenges of our time. With nonlinearities and tipping points, climate change is highly complex, and quantification for risk assessments requires the analysis of vast amounts of data, a task for which the AI field of machine learning is particularly well-suited. 2 The journal Nature recently reported the development of an AI network which could \"vastly accelerate efforts to understand the building blocks of cells and enable quicker and more advanced drug discovery\" by accurately predicting a protein's 3-D shape from its amino acid sequence. 3\n\nApplication of AI in Financial Services In November 2018, I shared some early observations on the use of AI in financial services. 4 Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly, and its potential implications have come into sharper focus. Financial firms are using or starting to use AI for operational risk management as well as for customer-facing applications. Interest is growing in AI to prevent fraud and increase security. Every year, consumers bear significant losses from frauds such as identity theft and imposter scams. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in 2019 alone, \"people reported losing more than $1.9 billion to fraud,\" which represents a mere fraction of all fraudulent activity banks encounter. 5 AI-based tools may play an important role in monitoring, detecting, and preventing such fraud, particularly as financial services become more digitized and shift to web-based platforms. Machine learning-based fraud detection tools have the potential to parse through troves of dataâboth structured and unstructuredâto identify suspicious activity with greater accuracy and speed, and potentially enable firms to respond in real time.\n\nMachine learning models are being used to analyze traditional and alternative data in the areas of credit decisionmaking and credit risk analysis, in order to gain insights that may not be available from traditional credit assessment methods and to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers who may lack traditional credit histories. 6 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has found that approximately 26 million Americans are credit invisible, which means that they do not have a credit record, and another 19.4 million do not have sufficient recent credit data to generate a credit score. Black and Hispanic consumers are notably more likely to be credit invisible or to have an unscored record than White consumers. 7 The Federal Reserve's Federal Advisory Council, which includes a range of banking institutions from across the country, recently noted that nontraditional data and the application of AI have the potential \"to improve the accuracy and fairness of credit decisions while also improving overall credit availability.\" 8\n\nTo harness the promise of machine learning to expand access to credit, especially to underserved consumers and businesses that may lack traditional credit histories, it is important to be keenly alert to potential risks around bias and inequitable outcomes. For example, if AI models are built on historical data that reflect racial bias or are optimized to replicate past decisions that may reflect bias, the models may amplify rather than ameliorate racial gaps in access to credit. Along those same lines, the opaque and complex data interactions relied upon by AI could result in discrimination by race, or even lead to digital redlining, if not intentionally designed to address this risk. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that as we innovate, we build appropriate guardrails and protections to prevent such bias and ensure that AI is designed to promote equitable outcomes. As Rayid Ghani notes, \"â¦[A]ny AI (or otherwise developed) system that is affecting people's lives has to be explicitly built to focus on increasing equity and not just optimizing for efficiencyâ¦[W]e need to make sure that we put guidelines in place to maximize the chances of the positive impact while protecting people who have been traditionally marginalized in society and may be affected negatively by the new AI systems.\" 9\n\nBlack Box Problems Recognizing the potential and the pitfalls of AI, let us turn to one of the central challenges to using AI in financial servicesâthe lack of model transparency. Some of the more complex machine learning models, such as certain neural networks, operate at a level of complexity that offers limited or no insight into how the model works. This is often referred to as the \"black box problem,\" because we can observe the inputs the models take in, and examine the predictions or classifications the model makes based on those inputs, but the process for getting from inputs to outputs is obscured from view or very hard to understand.\n\nThere are generally two reasons machine learning models tend toward opacity. The first is that an algorithm rather than a human being \"builds\" the model. Developers write the initial algorithm and feed it with the relevant data, but do not specify how to solve the problem at hand. The algorithm uses the input data to estimate a potentially complex model specification, which in turn make predictions or classifications. As Michael Tyka puts it, \"[t]he problem is that the knowledge gets baked into the network, rather than into us. Have we really understood anything? Not reallyâthe network has.\" 10 This is somewhat different from traditional econometric or other statistical models, which are designed and specified by humans.\n\nThe second is that some machine learning models can take into account more complex nonlinear interactions than most traditional models in ways that human beings would likely not be able to identify on their own. 11 The ability to identify subtle and complex patterns is what makes machine learning such a powerful tool, but that complexity often makes the model inscrutable and unintuitive. Hod Lipson likens it to \"meeting an intelligent species whose eyes have receptors [not] just for the primary colors red, green, and blue, but also for a fourth color. It would be very difficult for humans to understand how the alien sees the world, and for the alien to explain it to us.\" 12\n\nThe Importance of Context While the black box problem is formidable, it is not, in many cases, insurmountable. The AI research community has made notable strides in explaining complex machine learning modelsâindeed, some of our symposium panelists have made major contributions to that effort. One important conclusion of that work is that there need not be a single principle or one-size-fits-all approach for explaining machine learning models. Explanations serve a variety of purposes, and what makes a good explanation depends on the context. In particular, for an explanation to \"solve\" the black box problem, it must take into account who is asking the question and what the model is predicting.\n\nSo what do banks need from machine learning explanations? The requisite level and type of explainability will depend, in part, on the role of the individual using the model. The bank employees that interact with machine learning models will naturally have varying roles and varying levels of technical knowledge. An explanation that requires the knowledge of a PhD in math or computer science may be suitable for model developers, but may be of little use to a compliance officer, who is responsible for overseeing risk management across a wide swath of bank operations.\n\nThe level and type of explainability also depends on the model's use. In the consumer protection context, consumers' needs and fairness may define the parameters of the explanation. Importantly, consumer protection laws require lenders who decline to offer a consumer creditâor offer credit on materially worse terms than offered to othersâto provide the consumer with an explanation of the reasons for the decision. That explanation serves the important purposes of helping the consumer to understand the basis of the determination as well as the steps the consumer could take to improve his or her credit profile. 13\n\nAdditionally, to ensure that the model comports with fair lending laws that prohibit discrimination, as well as the prohibition against unfair or deceptive practices, firms need to understand the basis on which a machine learning model determines creditworthiness. Unfortunately, we have seen the potential for AI models to operate in unanticipated ways and reflect or amplify bias in society. There have been several reported instances of AI models perpetuating biases in areas ranging from lending and hiring to facial recognition and even healthcare. For example, a 2019 study by Science revealed that an AI risk-prediction model used by the U.S. healthcare system was fraught with racial bias. The model, designed to identify patients that would likely need high-risk care management in the future, used patients' historical medical spending to determine future levels of medical needs. However, the historical spending data did not serve as a fair proxy, because \"less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients.\" 14 Thus, it is critical to be vigilant for the racial and other biases that may be embedded in data sources.\n\nIt is also possible for the complex data interactions that are emblematic of AIâa key strength when properly managedâto create proxies for race or other protected characteristics, leading to biased algorithms that discriminate. For example, when consumers obtain information about credit products online, the complex algorithms that target ads based on vast amounts of data, such as where one went to school, consumer likes, and online browsing habits, may be combined in ways that indicate race, gender, and other protected characteristics. 15 Even after one online platform implemented new safeguards pursuant to a settlement to address the potential exclusion of consumers from seeing ads for credit products based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics, Professor Alan Mislove and his collaborators have found that the complex algorithms may still result in bias and exclusion. 16 Therefore, it is important to understand how complex data interactions may skew the outcomes of algorithms in ways that undermine fairness and transparency.\n\nMakada Henry-Nickie, notes that \"â¦[I]t is of paramount importance that policymakers, regulators, financial institutions, and technologists critically examine the benefits, risks, and limitations of AI and proactively design safeguards against algorithmic harm, in keeping with societal standards, expectations, and legal protections.\" 17 I am pleased that the symposium includes talks from scholars who are studying how we can design AI models that avoid bias and promote financial inclusion. No doubt everyone here today who is exploring AI wants to promote financial inclusion and more equitable outcomes and ensure that it complies with fair lending and other laws designed to protect consumers.\n\nIn the safety and soundness context, bank management needs to be able to rely on models' predictions and classifications to manage risk. They need to have confidence that a model used for crucial tasks such as anticipating liquidity needs or trading opportunities is robust and will not suddenly become erratic. For example, they need to be sure that the model would not make grossly inaccurate predictions when it confronts inputs from the real world either that differ in some subtle way from the training data or that are based on a highly complex interaction of the data features. In short, they need to be able to have confidence that their models are robust. Explanations can be an important tool in providing that confidence.\n\nNot all contexts require the same level of understanding of how machine learning models work. Users may, for example, have a much greater tolerance for opacity in a model that is used as a \"challenger\" to existing models and simply prompts additional questions for a bank employee to consider relative to a model that automatically triggers bank decisions. For instance, in liquidity or credit risk management, where AI may be used to test the outcomes of a traditional model, banks may appropriately opt to use less transparent machine learning systems.\n\nForms of Explanations Researchers have developed various approaches to explaining machine learning models. Often, these approaches vary in terms of the type of information they can provide about a model. As banks contemplate using these tools, they should consider what they need to understand about their models relative to the context, in order to determine whether there is sufficient transparency in how the model works to properly manage the risk at issue.\n\nNot all machine learning models are a black box. In fact, some machine learning models are fully \"interpretable\" and therefore may lend themselves to a broader array of use cases. By \"interpretable\" I mean that developers can \"look under the hood\" to see how those models make their predictions or classifications, similar to traditional models. They can examine how much weight the model gives to each data feature, and how it plays into a given result. Interpretable machine learning models are intrinsically explainable.\n\nIn the case of machine learning models that are opaque, and not directly interpretable, researchers have developed techniques to probe these models' decisions based on how they behave. These techniques are often referred to as model agnostic methods, because they can be used on any model, regardless of the level of explainability. Model agnostic methods do not access the inner workings of the AI model being explained. Instead, they derive their explanations post hoc based on the model's behavior: essentially, they vary inputs to the AI model, and analyze how the changes affect the AI model's outputs. 18 In effect, a model agnostic method uses this testing as data to create a model of the AI model. 19\n\nWhile post hoc explanations generated by model agnostic methods can allow inferences to be drawn in certain circumstances, they may not always be accurate or reliable, unlike intrinsic explanations offered by interpretable models. Basing an explanation on a model's behavior rather than its underlying logic in this way may raise questions about the explanation's accuracy, as compared to the explanations of interpretable models. Still, such explanations may be suitable in certain contexts. Thus, one of the key questions banks will face is when a post hoc explanation of \"black box\" model is acceptable versus when an interpretable model is necessary.\n\nTo be sure, having an accurate explanation for how a machine learning model works does not by itself guarantee that the model is reliable or fosters financial inclusion. Time and experience are also significant factors in determining whether models are fit to be used. The boom-bust cycle that has defined finance for centuries should make us cautious in relying fully for highly consequential decisions on any models that have not been tested over time or on source data with limited history, even if in the age of big data, these data sets are broad in scope.\n\nExpectations for Banks Recognizing that AI presents promise and pitfalls, as a banking regulator, the Federal Reserve is committed to supporting banks' efforts to develop and use AI responsibly to promote a safe, fair, and transparent financial services marketplace. As regulators, we are also exploring and understanding the use of AI and machine learning for supervisory purposes, and therefore, we too need to understand the different forms of explainability tools that are available and their implications. To ensure that society benefits from the application of AI to financial services, we must understand the potential benefits and risks, and make clear our expectations for how the risks can be managed effectively by banks. Regulators must provide appropriate expectations and adjust those expectations as the use of AI in financial services and our understanding of its potential and risks evolve. 20\n\nTo that end, we are exploring whether additional supervisory clarity is needed to facilitate responsible adoption of AI. It is important that we hear from a wide range of stakeholdersâincluding financial services firms, technology companies, consumer advocates, civil rights groups, merchants and other businesses, and the public. The Federal Reserve has been working with the other banking agencies on a possible interagency request for information on the risk management of AI applications in financial services. Today's symposium serves to introduce a period of seeking input and hearing feedback from a range of external stakeholders on this topic. It is appropriate to be starting with the academic community that has played a central role in developing and scrutinizing AI technologies. I look forward to hearing our distinguished speakers' insights on how banks and regulators should think about the opportunities and challenges posed by AI.\n\n1.

The Federal Reserve's Model Risk Management guidance (SR 11-7) establishes an expectation that models used in banking are conceptually sound or \"fit for purpose.\" SR 11-7 instructs that when evaluating a model, supervised institutions should consider the \"[t]he design, theory, and logic underlying the model.\" The Model Risk Management guidance discusses in detail the tools banks rely on to help establish the soundness of their models, such as back-testing and benchmarking and other outcomes-based tests.
