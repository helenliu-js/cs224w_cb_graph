    "text": "What the Moment Demands\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n33rd Frankfurt European Banking Congress\nFrankfurt, Germany\nNovember 17, 2023\n3:30 PM CET (local), 6:30 AM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nIn 2004, I read a speech about making monetary policy in a dynamic world.1 It was written by\nthen Governor of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke.\nBernanke noted, that when central bankers know about where the economy is headed or\nface imminent risks, they should adjust policy decisively and aggressively—what he called the\n“cold turkey” approach. He then noted, that in almost every other instance, more caution is\nwarranted. When central banks are unsure about how the economy will evolve; when they\nare unsure of the impact their policies will have; or when they are uncertain about how the\nfundamental benchmarks in the economy are changing, the optimal strategy is to look before\nleaping—to take a “gradualist” approach to policy.\nI reference this speech and its lessons to remind us that the economy has always been\ndynamic. Change is inevitable, and uncertainty is a fact of life.\n1 Bernanke (2004).\n1\n\nBut monetary policy can adjust. Going quickly when conditions demand and more slowly\nwhen the road is less clear. Our tools, strategies, and actions can always meet the moment.\nThe choice, of course, is ours.\nNow before I go much further, I would like to remind you that the views I express today are my\nown, and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nA World in Flux\nSo, what do we face? As many at this conference have noted, we are in a period when the\nrisks seem high and the waters, murky.\nAfter the long fight through COVID, economies around the globe are facing a range of crises\nand complexities: wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, the rethinking of economic\nrelations and global production chains, disruptions and dislocations from a changing climate,\nand the potential impacts, good and bad, of artificial intelligence and generative AI.2\nCentral banks also face these challenges, as well as a policy landscape that has shifted\nsignificantly in the past four years.\nRecall that, prior to COVID, central banks around the globe were focused on weaker trend\ngrowth, low real interest rates, below-target inflation, and policy tools constrained by the zero\nlower bound.3 Policymakers were focused on providing sufficient monetary policy\naccommodation and keeping inflation expectations from falling.4\nPost-COVID, the landscape has reversed. Inflation in most countries is now too high, rather\nthan too low. Global interest rates are elevated, and central banks are wondering whether\nthey’ll need to pull the policy reins even tighter to control inflation. Policy debates are now\ncentered on what constitutes sufficiently restrictive and how long to maintain that stance.5\n2 Cevik and Jalles (2023), International Monetary Fund (2023a), and Cook (2023).\n3 Discussed in Daly (2023a). Examples include Dudley (2013), Yellen (2016), Evans (2016), Draghi (2016), and Mertens\nand Williams (2019).\n4 Central banks took a range of approaches, including asset purchases (quantitative easing or QE), negative\ninterest rates, and forward guidance on keeping rates “lower for longer.” See Svensson (2015), Bech and Malkhozov\n(2016), Board of Governors (2023), Diwan, Leduc, and Mertens (2020), and Bernanke (2020).\n5 Powell (2023a, b), Schnabel (2023), Bank of England (2023), International Monetary Fund (2023b), and Daly (2023b).\n2\n\nPolicy for the Moment\nThat is a lot of change in a short period. So it is somewhat surprising that Ben Bernanke’s\nremarks have been so durable.\nBut remember, his key point was that monetary policy is flexible, and it can adjust as\nconditions change. And that is an important lesson for today.\nWhen we know where we are going and it’s important to get there quickly, moving\naggressively makes sense. “Cold turkey” is the appropriate action.6\nWe’ve seen this many times in history. This was the strategy during the Global Financial Crisis,\nwhen central banks quickly lowered policy rates and did multiple rounds of quantitative\neasing.7\nGoing back further, Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker took rapid and aggressive action\nduring the late 1970s and early 1980s, to fight double-digit inflation and a vicious wage-price\nspiral.8\nMore recently, policymakers across the globe acted decisively in response to the pandemic,\nbringing all their tools to bear to offset the impending damage to the economy.9 And then,\nwhen inflation followed and proved to be persistent, central banks raised rates rapidly to\nbring the economy back into balance and restore price stability.10\nEach of these actions were bold. Central banks were clear on what the moment demanded.\nThey acted forcefully, judging that the risks from aggressive measures were smaller than the\ncosts of any potential policy errors.11\nBut most times we face are not so clear. And a different type of boldness is required: the\nboldness to wait.\nWhen uncertainty is high and the risks to our objectives more balanced, we need to practice\ngradualism. To resist the desire to be certain. To react to not knowing with curiosity. And to\nadhere to the idea that patience, measured adjustments, and continual reassessment make\n6 Bernanke (2004).\n7 Kohn (2010), Kuttner (2018), and Dell’Ariccia, Rabanal, and Sandri (2018).\n8 Goodfriend and King (2005), Silber (2012).\n9 Clarida, Duygan-Bump, and Scotti (2021), Milstein and Wessel (2021), UN DESA (2022).\n10 OECD (2023), Council on Foreign Relations (2023). Bernanke discussed factors that contributed to the inflation and\nexpressed concerns about the slow response on the part of the FOMC (Bernanke 2022, Cox 2022).\n11 For the European Central Bank’s response to the pandemic, see the interview with ECB President Christine\nLagarde in Walker (2020).\n3\n\nfor better outcomes.12 Practicing gradualism means having the confidence to say that we\ndon’t yet know.\nThere are many times when gradualism is the best strategy, and there are countless examples\nof central banks taking this more cautious approach.13\nThe reason it is used so often is because it applies to so many different situations. Uncertainty\nabout the economic forecast.14 Uncertainty about the monetary policy transmission\nmechanism.15 And uncertainty about economic fundamentals, like the natural rate of\nunemployment or the neutral rate of interest.16\nIn this moment, we are grappling with all of these situations. At the Federal Reserve, we are\nnot certain whether inflation is on track to return to 2 percent. We are unsure about the length\nof policy lags and whether they are behind us or still to be fully realized. And we are uncertain\nabout whether the dynamics we observe today are cyclical remnants of the post-pandemic\nrecovery or indicators of structural shifts and a new normal for the national and global\neconomy.\nThe truth is none of these are knowable right now. And the perils of deciding too quickly when\nwe are not sure are real. Declaring certainty without knowing is not just a missed forecast. It’s\na policy mistake. And it has the potential to leave a lasting imprint on the economy and\nnegatively affect those we serve.\nCall to Action\nSo here is the main message of my remarks.\nUncertainty is a fact of life, but it does not leave us rudderless. We have the tools and the\nexperience to navigate whatever comes our way.\nOur challenge will be what it has always been. To respond rapidly when the situation\nrequires, and to resist the pressure to act quickly when patience is needed. To have the will to\nmake these choices, that is the policymakers’ job.\n12 Brainard (1967), Sack and Wieland (2000), Bernanke (2004, 2007), Barlevy (2009),\n13 Blinder (2006), Wilkins (2017), Lagarde (2022), Sack and Wieland (2000), Bernanke (2004), Yellen (2017).\n14 See Reifschneider and Tulip (2019) for a discussion on the elevated uncertainty around economic projections.\n15 Greenspan (2004) and Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n16 See, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2002, 2006) and Wieland (2006). Uncertainty about the natural rate of\nunemployment was a key factor coming out of the Great Recession (Kocherlakota 2010, Lacker 2012, and Daly et al.\n2012). Currently, uncertainty about the neutral rate of interest has risen; see, for example, Lubik and Matthes (2023)\nand Mericle (2023).\n4\n\nAnd we need to be collectively up to the task.\n5\n\nReferences\nBank of England. 2023. “Monetary Policy Summary and Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\nMeeting.” Report, November 2.\nBarlevy, Gadi. 2009. “Policymaking under Uncertainty: Gradualism and Robustness.” Federal Reserve\nBank of Chicago, Economic Perspectives 33(2).\nBech, Morten, and Aytek Malkhozov. 2016. “How Have Central Banks Implemented Negative Policy\nRates?” Bank for International Settlements, BIS Quarterly Review, March.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2004. “Gradualism.” Remarks presented at luncheon cosponsored by Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco, Seattle Branch, and University of Washington, Seattle, WA, May 20.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2007. “Monetary Policy under Uncertainty.” Speech presented at the 32nd Annual\nEconomic Policy Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (via videoconference), October 19.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2020. “The New Tools of Monetary Policy.” American Economic Review 110(4), pp. 943–\n983.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2022. “Commentary: Nobel Winner Bernanke: Why the Fed Didn’t Act Faster to Rein In\nInflation.” Barron’s, October 22.\nBlinder, Alan S. 2006. “Monetary Policy Today: Sixteen Questions and about Twelve Answers.” Princeton\nUniversity Center for Economic Policy Studies Working Paper 129, July.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2023. “Federal Open Market Committee Reaffirms Its\nStatement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” Press release, February 1.\nBrainard, William C. 1967. “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy.” American Economic Review:\nPapers and Proceedings 57(2), pp. 411–425.\nCevik, Serhan, and João Tovar Jalles. 2023. “Eye of the Storm: The Impact of Climate Shocks on Inflation\nand Growth.” International Monetary Fund Working Paper 87, April.\nClarida, Richard H., Burcu Duygan-Bump, and Chiara Scotti. 2021. “The COVID-19 Crisis and the Federal\nReserve’s Policy Response.” In Monetary Policy and Central Banking in the Covid Era, eds.

    "text": "FINAL\n“Beyond Fairness: The Value of an Inclusive Economy”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nLos Angeles World Affairs Council & Town Hall\nLos Angeles, CA\nOctober 15, 2019\n12:30PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you so much for the invitation to be here. It’s a real honor.\nThe issues of our day require a commitment to dialogue. Allowing\ndiverse groups to discuss, debate, and learn raises the best ideas and creates\nbetter outcomes.\nThe Los Angeles World Affairs Council and Town Hall Los Angeles have\npromoted such dialogue for decades. And now that you’ve joined forces, I\nknow your legacy will grow even more. I’m personally delighted to be one of\nthe first speakers of this new partnership.\nToday, I’m going to talk about one of the most critical issues of our day:\neconomic growth. How we are growing now… growth we’ve experienced in\nthe past… and what factors could temper or spur our growth in the future.\nBut before I begin, I need to give the standard disclaimer: the remarks\nI’m about to deliver are my own and don’t necessarily reflect the views of\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nFINAL\nCurrent conditions\nSo let’s start with growth today. How’s the economy doing?\nHere, the news is largely positive. The economy continues to expand at a\nsolid pace. Job growth is strong, unemployment is low, consumer spending is\nhealthy, and households remain confident. These are all really good signs.\nOn the other hand, we’ve yet to achieve our inflation goal on a sustained\nbasis. And a number of headwinds – such as trade uncertainty and slower\nglobal growth – have started to gust. This has caused manufacturing and\nbusiness investment to soften considerably over the course of the year.\nTo ensure we sustain the expansion against these headwinds, the Fed\nhas adopted a more accommodative monetary policy position – cutting the\nfederal funds rate in both July and September. This accommodation should\nhelp the economy continue to grow so that we can make further progress on\nour mandated goals of full employment and price stability.\nDrags on future growth\nBut what is the pace of growth we’re trying to hit? What’s sustainable?\nThis number has changed dramatically over time. During the 60 years\nprior to the Great Recession, GDP growth averaged around 3.5 percent.\nDuring the current expansion, growth has averaged only 2.3 percent.\nAnd this slower pace, far from being an anomaly, is expected to continue. Most\neconomists and forecasters, including me, predict GDP growth will average a\nbit under 2 percent for the foreseeable future.1\n1 Board of Governors (2019). The median of FOMC member projections of longer-run growth is 1.9\npercent.\n2\n\nFINAL\nSo what’s going on? Why is America’s economy expanding at a much\nslower pace than it used to?\nTo explain, we need to look at the fundamental drivers of economic\ngrowth: productivity and the labor force.\nLet’s first consider productivity growth. Although it’s fluctuated over\ntime, it’s generally contributed a little over 1 percentage point to overall GDP\ngrowth since the 1970s. It’s forecast to do about the same going forward. So\nthe reason for slower growth likely isn’t productivity.2\nLabor force growth tells a different story. In the 1970s, when the U.S.\npopulation was increasing rapidly and women were entering the workforce in\nlarge numbers, labor force growth alone averaged 2.7 percent annually. That\nmeans – even if productivity growth had been zero – the economy would have\nexpanded at 2.7 percent. That’s faster than the pace of our current expansion.\nSince that peak, the number has come down substantially. The labor\nforce has grown less than 0.5 percentage point annually for the past decade –\nand it’s forecast to stay that way for at least another ten years.3\nMuch of this decline in labor force growth is due to simple demographic\nchanges. Our population is aging. Fewer babies are being born. This dynamic\nisn’t unique to the United States – countries around the world are\nexperiencing similar trends.\nBut there’s something that is different in America. We’ve experienced a\ndecline in labor force participation for people between the ages of 25 and 54 –\nwhat we often call prime-age workers. And right now, there is a smaller\n2 Fernald and Li (2019).\n3 Congressional Budget Office (2019) and Fernald and Li (2019).\n3\n\nFINAL\nfraction of this group working or actively seeking work than we had back in\nthe late 1980s and 1990s.\nThis raises an important question: why aren’t more prime-age\nAmericans working?\nThere isn’t a simple answer. There’s a whole host of issues at play.\nOn one end of the spectrum, research suggests that some of the drop\nmay be attributed to wealthier families choosing to have only one earner.4 So\nfamilies with the financial ability to make these work-life choices may account\nfor some of the lost labor force participation.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, many people stay home to take care\nof children not out of choice, but out of necessity. Rising childcare costs and\nlack of access to parental leave likely contribute to lower labor force\nparticipation rates, especially among women.5\nThen there’s the changing labor market, which is leaving many people\non the sidelines – wanting to work, but not having the skills or education to\nkeep pace with the ever-evolving economy.6\nMore jobs currently require a bachelor’s degree than a high school\ndiploma.7 Unfortunately, college completion rates haven’t kept up with\ndemand. Recent data tells us only 37 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds have a\ncollege education.8 And we see that much of the decline in prime-age\nworkforce participation is concentrated among individuals who lack a college\ndegree.9\n4 Hall and Petrosky-Nadeau (2016).\n5 Daly et al. (2018) and Blau and Kahn (2013).\n6 Valletta and Barlow (2018) and Charles, Hurst, and Schwartz (2019).\n7 Carnevale, Jayasundera, and Gulish (2016).\n8 National Center for Education Statistics (2018).\n9 See Tuzemen (2018), who focuses on prime-age men.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThese are just a few of the factors driving down labor force participation\nin the United States. We could also talk about the talent being lost to opioid\naddiction. Or geographic mismatches that leave rural communities with\naffordable housing and few jobs, and urban communities with plentiful jobs\nand skyrocketing housing costs.\nWhatever the reason, we have more people sitting on the sidelines than\nin the past. This poses obvious problems for individuals and families – but it\nalso poses problems for our economy.\nAbsent a surge in productivity growth, slow growth in the workforce is\ngoing to be a significant structural restraint on America’s economic future.\nThe present doesn’t have to define the future\nSo what can we do? Are we really destined to grow at just 2 percent\nmoving forward? The answer is likely yes… unless we make significant\nchanges that better engage all that talent we’re leaving on the sidelines. This\nwill require a concerted effort from many stakeholders – including the Federal\nReserve.\nAt the Fed, our job is to support a healthy economy and achieve the dual\nmandate goals of full employment and price stability. The logic of our mandate\nis that a strong economy benefits everyone. And we can see this in the current\nexpansion.\nTen years of sustained growth have reduced unemployment rates to\nnear historic lows and pulled millions of Americans back into the labor force.\nThis long and robust expansion has been particularly beneficial to historically\nless-advantaged workers, including African Americans, Hispanics, and those\nwith less than a college degree.\n5\n\nFINAL\nThis makes sense. When labor markets are tight, as they are now,\nbusinesses have to compete for workers and find new ways to fill jobs. They\nrecruit more intensively, adjust hiring standards, and look to a broader pool of\npotential employees. This creates new opportunities for less advantaged\nworkers and allows them to get a foothold in the labor force.10 Indeed, the\ndata tell us that the strength of the current expansion has narrowed long-\nstanding gaps between more and less advantaged groups.11\nBut while these gaps are narrowing, they still persist. And monetary\npolicy alone isn’t enough to close them. Reducing the structural barriers that\nlimit workforce participation or keep individuals from reaching their full\npotential requires taking a hard look at some of our social and workplace\npolicies.\nThere are any number of examples we could consider, but I’d like to\nfocus on two from recent research.\nThe first looks at women. In the mid-1990s, a gap began to form in the\nparticipation rates of women in the United States and Canada. By 2017, the\nprime-age participation rate for American women was 8 percentage points\nlower than for similar women in Canada. This is a startling difference. It\nrepresents about 5 million U.S. women who could be in the labor force. A\ngrowing body of work suggests that this difference can be attributed in part to\nCanada’s generous parental leave policies and childcare subsidies, which\nallow women to remain attached to the labor market after child birth.12\n10 Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n11 Aaronson et al. (2019).\n12 Daly et al. (2018).\n6\n\nFINAL\nMy second example relates to educational attainment and career\nopportunities. African Americans and Hispanics receive four-year degrees at\nabout half the rate of whites.13 And even when they do get degrees, their\ncareer paths have a flatter trajectory.14 In economics parlance, we call this is a\nmisallocation of talent.\nBut how costly is this sort of misallocation? It’s hard to know in real\ntime, but we can look to history for some indication. Researchers at Stanford\nand the University of Chicago examined growth in U.S. per capita output\nbetween 1960 and 2010. They asked how much of that growth was due to the\nremoval of structural barriers, such as direct discrimination, lower school\nquality in minority communities, and financial obstacles that kept less-\nadvantaged people from pursuing high-paying careers in fields like medicine\nand law. The findings were striking. They estimated that the removal of\nstructural barriers accounted for up to 40 percent of the gains in U.S. per\ncapita output.15\nSo talent misallocation affects our bottom line. This suggests that\nequalizing educational attainment rates and career opportunities for less\nadvantaged groups could produce a considerable economic boost.\nOne person at a time\nUp until now, I’ve talked about what institutions can do to help get\ntalent off the sidelines and into the labor force. But I want to end with what\npeople can do. Because this is what gives me the most hope.\n13 National Center for Education Statistics (2018).\n14 Daly et al. (2017).\n15 Hsieh et al. (2019).\n7\n\nFINAL\nLet me take you to Firebaugh, California, about four hours north of here\nin Fresno County. It’s a rural agricultural community. Many of the people\nliving there don’t speak English as their first language. It’s one of the poorest\nregions in America.\nAnd yet… 97 percent of Firebaugh’s kids graduate from high school.\nThat’s 12 percentage points higher than the national average. And most of\nthem go on to college or other post-secondary study.16\nSo how do they do it? The entire community of Firebaugh – from\nparents to teachers to students to local leaders – have made education a\nsingular priority.\nBut they’re not the only one.\nBarrio Logan, near downtown San Diego, is a mostly Latinx community.\nThe average annual income for a family of four there is $25,000. Only 38\npercent of adults have a high school diploma. Just 3 percent hold a bachelor’s\ndegree.\nBut the Barrio Logan College Institute is helping change that narrative.\nThey start preparing first generation students for college in third grade. For\nkids enrolled in their program, 100 percent end up graduating from high\nschool – and 100 percent go on to enroll in college.17\nThese are inspirational success stories. They tell us the power of people.\nAnd they show us what’s possible when people come together to decide that\ntheir state today doesn’t have to determine their state tomorrow.\n16 Firebaugh High School (2017).\n17 Barrio Logan College Institute (2019).\n8\n\nFINAL\nConclusion\nSo how do we change the future? How do we scale places like Firebaugh\nand Barrio Logan?\nThe answer is simple: with intention.\nFairness has been a long-standing aspiration of our society. But\naspiration isn’t enough. We have to turn our desire to be fair into a\ncommitment to include. Inclusion has to become our practice.\nWe have to come together. We have to combine the forces of our\ninstitutions… our communities… our people.\nThat’s the way we rise above what the data tell us is possible. That’s the\nway we’ll give the next generation a better future than the one we inherited.\nThank you.\n9\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C. Daly, William Wascher, and David W.

    "text": "FINAL\n“Why Climate Change Matters to Us”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Economics of Climate Change Conference\nSan Francisco, CA\nNovember 8, 2019\n8:45AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. I’m happy to see\nsuch a full room for today’s conference. We’re joined by many more on our\nlivestream. To all of you – welcome.\nToday, I thought I’d take a few minutes to address a question I’ve heard\na lot over the past few months.\nWhy is the San Francisco Fed hosting a climate conference?\nIt’s a first for us. It’s actually a first for the Federal Reserve System.1 So\nwhy this? Why now?\nThe answer is simple. It’s essential to achieving our mission.\nThe Federal Reserve’s job is to promote a healthy, stable economy. This\nrequires us to consider current and future risks – whether we have a direct\ninfluence on them or not. Climate change is one of those risks.\n1 We are not the first to talk about this. A growing amount of research and discussion has occurred\nthroughout the Federal Reserve System on the impacts of climate change, including Rudebusch\n(2019), Colacito et al. (2018), Fried et al. (2019), Kahn et al. (2019), Kaplan (2019), and Stiroh\n(2019), to cite a few.\n1\n\nFINAL\nThe risks to our mission\nSo how does it affect our business? The Fed has three core\nresponsibilities: ensuring a safe and sound payment system, regulating and\nsupervising the banking system, and conducting monetary policy. We’re also\npublic servants, who are responsible to the communities we represent. The\nimpacts of a changing climate will affect each of these roles.\nLet’s first consider the payment system.\nExtreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires destroy\nproperty and disrupt essential services like health care and education. But\nthey also impact how people buy things. Without power, electronic payment\nmethods – debit cards, credit cards, and mobile services like Apple Pay – don’t\nwork. So you need cash for everything.\nWe think about this a lot in the Twelfth District. We manage the Cash\nProduct Office for the entire Federal Reserve System. And it’s our job to\nensure that people have access to cash when and where they need it – in\nnormal times, and particularly in times of crisis when demand spikes.\nSo we have to understand and prepare for the increase in severe\nweather events – and for the disruptions that they may cause. This is essential\nto ensuring that our cash services remain resilient and dependable for all\nAmericans.\nThe Fed’s second core function is the regulation and supervision of the\nbanking system. And climate events are becoming an increasing area of risk\nfor many of the financial firms we supervise.\nHigher sea levels, heavier rainfalls, dryer conditions, and the associated\nfallout can cause catastrophic losses to property and casualty insurers –\nespecially if the majority of their clients are geographically concentrated in\n2\n\nFINAL\nthe affected region. In 2018 alone, it’s estimated that damages from severe\nweather in the United States cost insurers upwards of $50 billion.2\nAnd the impact goes well beyond insurers. Including uninsured\ndamages, that $50 billion number nearly doubles.3 This impacts banks’\ncustomers, making it harder for them to satisfy their loan obligations. And this\ncan ultimately stress banks’ balance sheets. So ensuring financial institutions\nare regularly evaluating their exposure to climate-related risks is an\nincreasingly important part of our work.\nFinally, climate change can also influence our third function: conducting\nmonetary policy to achieve our congressionally-mandated goals of full\nemployment and price stability.\nEarly research suggests that increased warming has already started to\nreduce average output growth in the United States. And future growth may be\ncurtailed even further as temperatures rise.4 Several of the papers on the\nprogram today outline other ways in which the micro- and macro-economic\nenvironments may be impacted by climate change. While more work needs to\nbe done to clearly understand these effects, there’s little doubt that we need to\nrecognize, examine, and prepare for these risks in order to fulfill our core\nresponsibilities.\nPerhaps most importantly, we also have to understand climate risks if\nwe’re going to effectively serve the public. In the Twelfth District, sea level\nchanges are disrupting communities from San Diego to Alaska. Preemptive\n2 Insurance Information Institute (2019) and Aon (2019).\n3 NOAA (2019).\n4 See Rudebusch (2019), Tol (2009), Hsiang et al. (2017) and references therein for extensive\nreviews of the literature.\n3\n\nFINAL\npower outages and wildfires in populated areas of California are a new way of\nlife. Really, every state in our District is somehow affected.\nThe impact of these events go well beyond their immediate disruptions.\nThey can destroy wealth, exacerbate existing income inequalities, and – in the\nmost severe cases – displace people permanently. Think of Paradise,\nCalifornia.\nAs a community-engaged organization, we need to understand these\noutcomes. And we need to work with local governments, businesses, and\nindividuals to increase the resiliency of our communities. 5\nConclusion\nWhen you put all these pieces together, it becomes pretty clear: climate\nchange is an economic issue we can’t afford to ignore.\nThis isn’t just a concern for the Twelfth District. Or even the United\nStates. Countries around the world are dealing with the economic impacts of\nclimate change. And conferences like this are essential to understanding the\nchallenges that lie ahead – for all of us.\nUltimately, this is our job. The San Francisco Fed is a public service\norganization. We’re responsible for the people and the communities we serve.\nSo we have to get out in front of this issue and do what we do best.\nConvene the best people and ideas. Study data and conduct research.\nTalk to the communities we serve – and really listen when they tell us what\nthey need.\n5 See Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2019), Kabel et al. (2017), Dancy (2018), and\nCarpenter (2013).\n4\n\nFINAL\nWith that, I would like to thank our Economic Research Department for\nplanning today’s event, and the entire support team for executing it so well.\nAnd thanks to all of our distinguished speakers and panelists. I’m really\nlooking forward to your presentations and a robust discussion.\nThank you.\n5\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAon. 2019.

    "text": "Policy Nimbleness Through Forward Guidance\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nShadow Open Market Committee Conference\nChapman University\nOrange, CA\nJune 24, 2022\n1:00 PM PDT\nA few weeks ago, I met a young man with a warehouse job. He was worried. He shared that he\nhad just called in sick to his employer. When I asked him if it was COVID, he told me no. He just\ncouldn’t afford the gas that day and still manage to pay his rent.\nNow it would be of little consolation to him to learn that much of the inflation we see today is\ndriven by supply chain bottlenecks or the ongoing war in Ukraine. Nor would he be relieved to\nlearn that excess demand, supported by fiscal and monetary policy aid and a robust recovery,\nwere to blame. All he and so many others want to know is, when will this end?\nSo, let me start by saying here what I said to him: Bringing inflation down is the Federal\nReserve’s number one priority right now. And we have the tools and the will to do it.\nBut we actually want to do more than that. We want to bring inflation down without crippling\ngrowth and stalling the labor market.\nAfterall that is the dual mandate. Our job is to ensure that Americans everywhere have\nopportunities to earn a living and the confidence that the living they earn will hold its value.\nSo today, I will talk about how we can achieve that. But first, let me remind you that the views I\nshare are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nEvolving Risks\n1\n\nTo understand the path going forward, we first need to understand how we arrived here. So,\nlet’s start there.\nThe earliest signs of rising inflation pressures came in the spring of 2021. At that time, overall\ninflation was running below the Fed‘s 2 percent target, as it had been for over a decade.\nBut conditions were changing. Fiscal and monetary policy support were charging through the\nsystem, boosting demand for a variety of goods. At the same time, COVID was still ravaging\nsupply chains, disrupting production and distribution, and leaving accumulated backlogs for a\nrange of products.\nThe challenges were apparent. Consumers were robustly purchasing goods, while suppliers\nwere having trouble making and delivering them. And as we would expect, price pressures\nemerged.\nBut since high inflation readings were mainly limited to sectors most directly affected by the\npandemic, and newly developed vaccines promised to knock out—or at least significantly\ntemper—COVID, few people viewed high inflation over a longer period as inevitable.1 Indeed,\nat that time the overwhelming consensus among policymakers and economists more broadly\nwas that upward and downward risks to inflation were balanced.\nFinancial markets generally agreed. In line with most forecasts at the time, markets perceived\nthat the risk of high inflation was elevated. But they did not see this as the only—or even the\nmost likely—scenario.2 In fact, a broad range of indicators pointed to the possibility that\ninflation would settle lower, not higher once the pandemic was behind us.\nRecall that for over a decade preceding the pandemic, central banks across the globe had found\nit difficult to get inflation up to target.3 Structural forces including changing demographics,\nslower productivity growth, more global price competition, and weaker links between wages\nand prices persistently exerted downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.4\nIn other words, at that time the risk landscape on future inflation was decidedly two-sided. We\ncould act preemptively to stave off the potential for broadening price pressures only to find\ninflation once again too low, or we could wait until the path of inflation was clearer and find\nourselves with inflation too high.\n1 Shapiro (2020, 2021). By April 2021, roughly a third of the U.S. population had received at least one dose and\nabout a fifth had been fully vaccinated. https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=USA\n2 In early 2021, markets saw a roughly 33 percent chance that consumer price index inflation would average more\nthan 3 percent over the subsequent 5 years. https://www.minneapolisfed.org/banking/current-and-historical-\nmarket--based-probabilities\n3 Jordà et al. (2019b).\n4 Basu and Fernald (2002), Fernald and Li (2019), Crump et al. (2019), Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017), and\nJordà et al. (2019a).\n2\n\nTo manage these risks we needed to do more than just assess their likelihood. It was also\nimportant to stack the potential outcomes against the tools we had to deal with them.\nUnfortunately, with the proximity of the zero lower bound our tools are not symmetrically\neffective. When inflation is too high, we have ample room to raise the federal funds rate to pull\nit back down. But when inflation falls too low, and the zero lower bound binds, we have to rely\non less robust tools, such as asset purchases.5\nThis meant there could be significant potential costs to overreacting based on emerging—but\nstill limited—evidence of price pressures. Especially when any premature tightening would be\nhard to reverse and its consequences could hamper growth and productivity in the longer run.6\nAll of this tilted my thinking toward a balanced approach, one that weighed the early signs of\nprice pressures against the still-recovering job market and a policy toolkit more readily able to\nfight misses on the inflation upside than on the downside.7 This assessment was supported by\ndata showing that longer-run inflation expectations among households, businesses and market\nparticipants remained well anchored.8\nBut of course, by fall of 2021, the risks of persistently high inflation readings had become a\nreality, and forecasts showed little relief on the horizon. COVID continued to surge across the\nglobe. Vaccine uptake had plateaued. And price pressures were spreading outside those sectors\nmost directly affected by the pandemic.9\nThe Power of Communicating\nThe evolving landscape meant that monetary policy had to pivot. And it had to do so quickly.\nTo some of you, that may sound like a contradiction. Monetary policy is usually associated with\ngradual adjustments that transmit through the economy with long and variable lags. It is not\ntypically associated with agility and speed.10\nBut just as the risks facing the economy have evolved, so has our policy approach, which can\nrespond more nimbly now to incoming data than it could in the past.\nThis evolution stems largely from an evolution in the Fed’s communication. Today, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) is transparent about its reaction function and expected\n5 Cúrdia, Chen, and Ferrero (2012).\n6 Ajello et al. (2021).\n7 As of March 2021, there were 8.1 million fewer workers on payrolls than pre-pandemic. However, the\ndistribution of worker shortfalls varied across sectors and states (Albert, Foerster, and Sarte 2021).\n8 In March 2021, Daly (2021a) noted that inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5-10 years ahead had\nonly recently risen to roughly 2 percent.\n9 Lansing, Oliveira, and Shapiro (2022) and Shapiro (2022).\n10 Friedman (1961) and Rudebusch (1995).\n3\n\noutlook. This enables the committee to signal policy adjustments long before they are actually\nmade. And these signals transmit increasingly rapidly into the behavior of financial markets and\nthe economy.11\nFor example, in the fall of last year, as incoming information confirmed that persistent and\nbroad price pressures were forming, FOMC participants signaled that the future path of policy\nwould likely be tighter. The December FOMC statement and the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) moved sharply relative to previous releases, projecting an earlier date of liftoff\nand a faster pace of rate hikes than previously anticipated. At the same time, we communicated\nthat the balance sheet would adjust accordingly.\nFollowing this forward guidance and prior to any actual movements in the funds rate, yields on\nTreasuries across all durations rose, and rates in other markets followed suit. Mortgage rates,\nfor example, started an ascent that currently puts them at their highest levels in a decade.\nWhile adjustments in financial markets after FOMC communications are not unusual, the speed\nand magnitude of the movements during the past six months have been unprecedented, as the\nfigure shows.\nSource: Goldman Sachs and FRBSF staff calculations.\n11 The Fed did not begin releasing post-FOMC statements until the mid-1990s. A series of measures to increase\ntransparency followed, including the Summary of Economic Projections, the announcement of a 2 percent inflation\ntarget, and an accompanying policy framework that was revised in 2020.\n4\n\nAs financial conditions have tightened, some leading indicators of economic activity have\nsoftened, especially in interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing. And consumers have\nexpressed caution more broadly, recognizing the impact of expected higher rates on their\nfuture borrowing prospects.12\nThe fact that financial conditions and real activity are adjusting to expected monetary policy\ntightening, even when actual rates have not fully risen, means that long and variable lags may\nnot be as long, or variable, as typically assumed. And that supports policy nimbleness, allowing\nmonetary policy to be tighter than the actual level of the Fed Funds rate would suggest.\nBut guidance requires action. And here is how I see that work evolving.\nLast week, the FOMC increased the funds rate by 75 basis points and signaled that further rate\nhikes of a similar magnitude are likely.13 This was the largest single meeting increase since 1994\nand puts policy on an expeditious path to neutral by the end of the year. After that, I see\nadditional tightening beyond neutral as the likely next step.\nHow much additional tightening will be required depends on a number of factors that fall\noutside of the Fed’s direct control, including the speed and magnitude of supply chain recovery,\nthe duration of the war in Ukraine, and the willingness of individuals who have left the labor\nforce to reenter.14\nJust as 2021 required navigating a broad range of possible outcomes, policymaking now is also\nabout managing risks. If supply continues to fall short and inflation remains high, we will need\nto do more. If conditions improve and supply bounces back, we can do less.\nRegardless of which path we take, there will likely be some slowing in the economy. That’s how\nmonetary policy works. We remove accommodation or adjust rates into more restrictive\nterritory, and growth slows and the labor market cools.\n12 For example, consumer perceptions and expectations about access to credit have declined.\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2022/20220613\n13 In its March SEP, the Fed’s median projection for the federal funds rate was 1.9 percent by the end of this year\nand 2.8 percent by the end of 2023 (Board of Governors 2022b). In June, the SEP projected a revised median funds\nrate of 3.4 percent by year-end, and 3.8 percent by the end of 2023 (Board of Governors 2022a).\n14 An estimated 2 million fewer immigrant workers joining the U.S. labor market since 2020 relative to the pre-\npandemic trend (Peri and Zaiour 2022) has added to the headwinds constraining labor supply.\n5\n\nThe question is: how much economic slowing are we likely to see? Here, history gives us some\nuseful reference points.\nOne is the Great Inflation of the 1960s and ’70s and the subsequent Volcker disinflation, which,\nby the mid-1980s, had brought inflation down from its double-digit peak. But it came at\na very high cost, pushing the economy into what was then the most severe recession since the\nGreat Depression.\nBut this is not the only example or precedent of how the economy reacts to policy tightening. In\nthe mid-1990s policymakers faced a rapidly declining unemployment rate and worried that a\n1970s-style high inflation environment was coming. So they raised interest rates by 3\npercentage points in roughly a year. This rapid policy tightening put the brakes on falling\nunemployment, but the overall effects on growth were mostly benign. Most notably, the\neconomy and the labor market maintained a relatively strong expansion through the end of the\ndecade, and inflation remained in check.15\nFor a number of reasons, I expect our economic transition now to look more like the mid-1990s\nthan like the 1970’s Great Inflation and subsequent painful disinflation. That’s because many of\nthe factors that helped fuel the Great Inflation are not as prominent today.\nFor example, part of the surge in inflation during the 1960s and ’70s was because policymakers\noverestimated economic and labor market potential.16 These policy misses were exacerbated\nby widespread wage indexation that contributed to a wage-price spiral. But today’s\npolicymakers use a broader and more robust range of data to assess the economy’s potential\nperformance, and the link between wages and prices is far weaker than it was in the past.17\nThe Federal Reserve is also different than it was back then. We are a far more transparent\ninstitution now. We regularly share our views about the economy, our goals, and our expected\npolicy path. This tells markets and the public more generally what we are thinking and how we\nare likely to react as the economy changes. This consistent communication has helped keep\nlonger run inflation expectations anchored despite persistent months of high inflation readings.\nIt also has allowed us to respond to evolving data more nimbly and influence the behavior of\nfinancial markets and the economy more quickly.\nFinally, conditions in the economy are quite different now than they were in the Great Inflation.\nThere is a sizeable amount of excess demand in both product and labor markets, supported by\nCOVID related fiscal and monetary policy. This translates into large, accumulated back orders\nfor goods and historically high job vacancies in the labor market. Adjusting rates to slow the\neconomy will most likely reduce these backlogs and high job vacancies before digging into\ncurrent production and employment.\n15 See Blinder (2022) for additional discussion of past tightening.\n16 Daly (2022).\n17 Daly (2021b).\n6\n\nIn economics terms, this would mean that we are on the steep portion of a fixed supply curve\nor Beveridge curve.18 And moving along those curves by reducing aggregate demand to return\nnormal conditions would bring inflation down with a more limited effect on overall economic\nactivity.19\nIn its extreme form, this implies that policy adjustments to lower inflation will be cost free.\nWhile I think that scenario is highly unlikely, I do expect the costs of adjustment to be\nmoderate, with some slowing of GDP growth below its longer-run trend and an increase in the\nunemployment rate from the very low levels we see today.\nThis would, to my mind, constitute a relatively smooth transition from a pandemic-wracked,\nhighly accommodative economy to one in which tighter policy supports both full employment\nand price stability.\nThat is the future that I am working toward.\nCreating that future will not be easy. Some have called it a narrow path.\nBut we know the direction we need to head, we understand the risks we face, and we have the\ntools to respond to a range of conditions however they emerge.\nMost importantly, we have the will to act. Not just for this moment, but also for similar events\nin the future. Always recognizing that our decisions affect every American and no one should\nhave to choose between fueling up to get to work and paying rent to keep their home.\nThank you.\n18 The Beveridge curve depicts a systematic relationship between job openings and unemployment, which\nbecomes very steep at low unemployment rates.

    "text": "A Strong Economy – But We Can\nAim Higher\nRemarks by\nM C. D\nARY ALY\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo\nRegional Economic Development for Eastern Idaho (REDI)\nIdaho Falls, Idaho\nNovember 12, 2018\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nIntroduction\nThanks very much for that kind introduction. I’d like to thank Park Price for helping organize this\nevent and for his long service as a San Francisco Fed Director. Park is the definition of a Fed Family\nmember, and I am delighted to deliver my first speech as the president and CEO of the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco in the community Park calls home.\nPage 1 of 11\n\nI would also like to recognize our veterans who have chosen to spend part of their day with us; we\nthank you for your service.\nI’ve been coming to Idaho since 1997, when I was just a rookie economist. It was love at first sight,\nthe mix of agriculture and technology, rural and urban, the natural beauty, and all the things I love to\ndo: skiing, biking, and hiking. Indeed, when days get hard my mantra is, I’m packing up and moving\nto Idaho. Apparently I am not the only one. Boise was recently flagged by Forbes magazine as the\nfastest-growing metro area in the country,1 and Eastern Idaho is sure to be right behind.\nMore generally, Idaho’s economy is flourishing, so it’s a perfect backdrop to talk about the broader\nU.S. outlook, which is very favorable. As the president of the San Francisco Fed, my job is to\nrepresent most of the western states—from Idaho and Utah out to Hawaii and Alaska—in the\nformulation of the nation’s monetary policy. The Fed’s goal, simply put, is to keep the expansion on\na solid and sustainable footing. Congress has given us two mandates meant to support this: full\nemployment and stable prices. Most of our job focuses on the short run, not letting the economy get\ntoo hot or too cold, but we also have to consider the economy’s longer-term performance. My\nremarks today will focus on each of these in turn.\nNow, before I dive in, let me say that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of\nanyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nCurrent economic conditions\nI’ll start with the current state of the economy, which is very good. The expansion is over nine years\nold and seems destined to set a new record for the longest period without a recession in U.S. history,\nwhich it should reach in the middle of next year. The labor market is booming. Household and\nbusiness balance sheets are very healthy, and confidence is high. All these factors point to significant\nunderlying economic momentum, which is being boosted by tailwinds including the federal fiscal\n1 Sharf (2018).\nPage 2 of 11\n\nstimulus and global growth that, despite some recent unevenness, has been solid over the past few\nyears.\nEven in this strong economy, though, some people are getting left behind. There are pockets of\neconomic distress, and we need to do all we can to ensure that growth is inclusive and everyone has\nan opportunity to benefit.\nMonetary policy, however, can’t do everything. Our job is to keep the overall economy healthy, thus\nhelping promote sustainable economic growth. By doing this, monetary policy supports economic\nwell-being and creates opportunities for all to advance.\nImplications for monetary policy\nThis principle of sustaining a healthy expansion has guided our recent policy and plans. As you\nprobably know, the Fed’s monetary policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nmeets eight times per year. We left interest rates unchanged at our meeting last week. More\ngenerally, though, we’ve been gradually increasing rates in order to bring the stance of monetary\npolicy closer to neutral.\nThis policy normalization, or return to neutral, reflects our commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate.\nOne goal is “maximum” or full employment. This means an unemployment rate that is very low,\nreflecting normal worker turnover in a thriving labor market. Recent unemployment numbers below\n4 percent strongly suggest that the labor market has reached or exceeded full employment. But there\nare other indicators as well, and I’ll return to them in a moment.\nOur other goal is stable prices. In 2012, the FOMC determined that aiming for price inflation of 2\npercent was most consistent with that broad long-run goal.2 We’d been mostly running below that\ntarget since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Recently, though, inflation has come back up and is\nbasically on target. I expect this modest uptrend to continue, with inflation rising to just a bit above\n2 percent over the next year or so. Of course, there are risks on both sides of that projection.\n2 Board of Governors (2012).\nPage 3 of 11\n\nInflation could pick up more rapidly than expected, or it could drop back down again.3 For now,\nthough, the inflation numbers are very encouraging.\nThese conditions, with both of the Fed’s goals essentially met, merit the gradual normalization of\nmonetary policy.\nSo why gradual? I view this gradualism as a process of iterated learning, guided by incoming data.\nThat is, we take a policy action, wait, learn about the economy’s response, and repeat. The\ninformation gathered through this gradual approach is crucial for determining the speed and size of\nthe subsequent policy adjustments. Of course, since monetary policy acts with a significant lag—\nlikely a few years—policymakers must plan ahead, but need to be ready to adjust if the data or the\nenvironment change.4\nIn other words, the FOMC is not on autopilot, with quarterly rate increases locked in. We’re\nconstantly looking at the data and adjusting the monetary policy path as needed in response.\nAre we at full employment?\nThat summarizes where I see the economy and policy headed. But there are always uncertainties.\nWe’ve been surprised at how long it’s taken inflation to return to target. This has raised questions\nabout whether the economy has truly reached its full potential. In other words, are we at the point\nwhere growth will be increasingly constrained by bottlenecks and other supply factors, rather than\ninadequate demand?\nIn the labor market, this idea of an economy at its potential corresponds to full employment. Hence\nthe question: “Are we at full employment?” [slide]. While we frequently summarize the state of the\nlabor market with the unemployment rate, we always look at a wide variety of other labor market\nindicators. These include broader measures of underemployment that take into account individuals who\nare out of the labor market or stuck in part-time jobs. We also watch an array of independent data\nseries on job openings, worker quit rates, reported job availability and difficulties filling jobs, and\n3 These risks are discussed in Powell (2018). See also Shapiro (2018, forthcoming).\n4 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\nPage 4 of 11\n\nothers. Essentially all of these indicators are flashing bright green: they’ve met or moved beyond\ntheir values from past peaks, signaling a labor market that is indeed at full employment.\nThe key exception is continued low rates of labor force participation. This refers to the fraction of\nthe working-age population that is either employed or is unemployed and actively seeking work. My\nfirst chart shows the patterns in participation over the past 25 years for the overall population ages\n16 and over and for workers in their prime working years, corresponding to ages 25 to 54.\nYou can see that the overall rate has generally been on the decline since the year 2000.\nDemographics play a big role—specifically aging, as many of the baby boom generation head off for\nretirement.\nBut an aging population doesn’t explain everything. The chart also shows a drop in labor force\nparticipation among prime-age workers. Like the overall rate, prime-age participation peaked around\nthe year 2000. It fell around the 2001 recession and then took an even steeper tumble during and\nafter the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009. It reached a low point in 2015, nearly eight years\nafter the initial downturn. We’ve seen a bit of improvement since then. But currently, the prime-age\nparticipation rate is significantly lower than it was in the 1990s.\nPage 5 of 11\n\nThis raises the question—why aren’t Americans working like they used to? Some observers think\nthis reflects a labor market that hasn’t yet recovered from the last recession. But my reading of the\nevidence suggests that longer-term factors are at play.\nA number of influences have been identified. Research by San Francisco Fed economist Nicolas\nPetrosky-Nadeau and his coauthor Bob Hall suggests that some of the drop owes to economically\nsecure families opting in favor of one employed spouse rather than two.5 In other words, there may\nhave been some shift toward the “life” end of the work-life balance.\nAnother factor behind the decline is ongoing job polarization that favors workers at the high and\nlow ends of the skill distribution but hinders those in the middle. This is mainly due to changing\ntechnology. I know for myself, I never call a travel agent anymore. With a few taps and swipes on\nmy phone, I can book a trip to almost anywhere in the world in seconds. But it goes far beyond that:\nour economy is automating a wide range of jobs in the middle-skill range, from assembly lines, to\ncall center workers, to grocery checkers.\nA growing body of research finds that these pressures on middle-skill jobs leave a big swath of\nworkers on the sidelines, wanting work but not having the skills or flexibility to keep pace with the\never-changing economy.6\nWhat to do?\nI’ve argued that low workforce participation reflects long-term challenges. Good monetary policy\ncan’t directly cure these problems. But as I’ve already noted, it can help by keeping the expansion\ngoing. Recessions cause long-term damage to workers’ employment and wage prospects.7 Keeping\nthe economy on an even keel can help avoid these problems.\nBut much can be done beyond good monetary policy. We shouldn’t think of “full employment” as a\nfixed target, but instead think of it as something that can be moved. From that perspective, there\nappears to be quite a bit of upside potential for U.S. workforce participation.\n5 Hall and Petrosky-Nadeau (2016).\n6 See Abraham and Kearney (2018), Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006), Autor (2010), and Valletta and Barlow (2018).\n7 See for example Davis and von Wachter (2011).\nPage 6 of 11\n\nInternational comparisons are helpful on this point. The next chart shows the prime-age\nparticipation rate in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In these other\nadvanced economies, participation has increased overall and now stands well above the rates\nobserved in the United States. This is especially striking because, just like the United States, these\ncountries are facing long-term challenges like labor market polarization. Yet, they have managed to\noffset the downward pull on participation rates.\nWhat factors have contributed to this growing divergence between us and other countries?\nEducation is one. Like most advanced economies, job creation in the United States has tilted toward\njobs that require a college degree.8 But we’re not adequately preparing our new workers for the jobs\nof the future. Although the share of young people with four-year college degrees is rising, we are\nfalling behind many of our international competitors.9\nSo where should we focus our efforts when it comes to increasing college education? A good place\nto start would be reducing the educational attainment gap across students of different races and\nethnicities. Equalizing opportunity and access to higher education has substantial upside potential\n8 Carnevale, Smith, and Strohl (2013), OECD (2018a).\n9 OECD (2018b).\nPage 7 of 11\n\nfor overall growth, as well as for enhancing the economic mobility that is at the core of our\nAmerican identity.10\nBut education is not the only answer. There are other things that can be done. The United States\nversus Canada comparison is especially telling (chart). You can see a growing participation gap\nbetween the two countries since the late 1990s. By 2017, the prime-age participation rate was over 5\npercentage points higher in Canada than in the States. This is a startling difference. It represents\nabout 6.7 million additional individuals in the U.S. who could be in the labor force.\nIn a research report scheduled for public release tomorrow, I worked with current and former San\nFrancisco Fed staff to try to understand this gap.11 We found that it’s mostly due to differences for\nwomen: they account for about three-fourths, or 5 million, of that 6.7 million total. And it’s not a\nmatter of differences in educational attainment: the Canadian edge is generally evident across all\neducational groups.\n10 Further discussion is provided in Daly (2018).\n11 Daly et al. (2018).\nPage 8 of 11\n\nWhy is there such a large gap in women’s participation rates across the two countries? We discuss\nsome tentative but compelling answers in our research note. Government subsidies for the cost of\nchildcare in Canada may play a role, supporting the return to work for parents—especially\nmothers—with young children.\nProbably more important, though, are Canada’s generous parental leave policies. Workers are\nassured of being able to return to their prior job, with the same compensation, after taking a\nprolonged parental leave—up to a year and a half in some provinces. They also receive payments\nthat replace much of their lost income during leave, funded out of the nation’s employment\ninsurance system. This system encourages people to return to jobs rather than drop out of the labor\nforce following the birth of children.\nNow I’m not advocating we adopt the Canadian system or recommending any particular policy. But\nthe comparison with Canada, as well as with other industrialized nations, shows that policy matters\nand that, with the right mix of skills and support, there’s meaningful potential for increasing U.S.\nworkforce participation.\nThe Fed can help by making sure that the economy continues to grow, creating work opportunities\nfor wide swaths of the population. But over the long term, it is equally important to develop more\nsupportive educational and family policies, so that individuals are encouraged to take advantage of\nthose opportunities.\nConclusion\nTo wrap up, the U.S. economy is in very good shape. Keeping it that way requires continuing on the\npath of consistent, thoughtful monetary policy. In conjunction with policies designed to encourage\nworkforce participation, this also may help boost our economy’s longer-term growth potential,\nthereby supporting economic advancement for all Americans.

    "text": "The Choice to See\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCommencement Address, Sol Price School of Public Policy\nUniversity of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nMay 12, 2023, 11:00 AM PDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThank you, Dean Goldman, for your kind introduction. It is truly my honor to be here.\nFirst things first. I would like all the graduates—and only the graduates—to give yourselves a big\nround of applause. You have earned this day. And it’s important that you take the time to\nrecognize it.\nI also want to acknowledge the family, friends, faculty, and everyone else who, in ways big and\nsmall, helped make this day possible. Thank you.\nThis day is especially meaningful to me because I also graduated from a public policy school: The\nMaxwell School at Syracuse University. While the colors of our gowns are different, and a few\ndecades separate my graduating class from yours, we are bound by a commitment to mission-\nminded work and public service.\nOf course, when people hear “public service,” they think either of the president of the United\nStates or the DMV. But we know the label is bigger than that.\nIn fact, it’s not a label at all. It’s a choice.\nI first learned about this choice decades ago in Ballwin, Missouri. A high school guidance\ncounselor made a phone call. She asked her friend, Betsy, to meet with a former student: a\nyoung teenager who had done well in school, read a lot, loved to learn. But the family finances,\nand the family itself, had fallen on hard times. And the teenager, needing to help out, had\n1\n\ndropped out of school. She was working a bunch of different jobs—driving a donut truck,\nstocking shelves at Target, mowing lawns—whatever she could find. And her goal was to one\nday get a job as a bus driver so she could have a stable income and good benefits.\nBetsy agreed to meet her. And right away she could see that the young woman had a plan. But\nBetsy knew that, for the plan to work, this young woman needed a GED. So, she suggested it,\nand the girl took her advice. Then, Betsy told her she would have even more opportunities if she\nwent to college, at least for a little while. The young woman applied and she got in. But she\ncouldn’t afford the tuition. So, Betsy wrote a check—they still had those then—to the bursar at\nthe University of Missouri—St. Louis. And at that moment, everything changed. A semester of\ncollege turned into a BA from the University of Missouri—Kansas City, and eventually into a PhD\nfrom Syracuse University in economics and public policy.\nAnd that path led me here. Yes, that young woman was me. I went from a teenager hoping to\nbe a bus driver to president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. And the\nreason was Betsy.\nBetsy wasn’t a public servant in the traditional sense. And she certainly didn’t see herself that\nway. But that’s exactly what she was. That’s exactly who she was. And it was not because of a\njob or a title. It was her lens on the world.\nBetsy could see beyond what was right in front of her. In front of her was a teenaged dropout\nstruggling to make ends meet. Betsy saw a young woman full of promise who had simply fallen\non hard times.\nAnd her seeing changed my life. It is the reason I am here today.\nThat is service.\nBut seeing a person right in front of you is one thing. Seeing millions whose names and faces\nyou will never know is quite another. Every step you take up the career ladder puts you farther\naway from the people you serve. And that distance makes it easy to lose sight of what really\nmatters.\nIt took a charged moment to bring this point home for me. And it was the most meaningful\nmoment in my thirty-plus year career. It came in 2009, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis.\nI was part of the San Francisco Fed Research team and we were briefing the Bank’s then-\npresident Janet Yellen—Treasury Secretary now, of course.\nColleagues were describing the ongoing challenges in the labor market, which included near\ndouble-digit unemployment, lack of job growth, and a dismal forecast for recovery.\n2\n\nJanet asked a simple question. What would the impact be? The answer was immediate, almost\nreflexive—the labor market will eventually come back.\nBut eventually was beside the point, and Janet instinctively reacted. She struck the table with\nher fist and said, “These are people!” Except there was a bleep before “people.” In the Midwest,\nwe would say “friggin.” But let’s just say, Janet Yellen is not from the Midwest.\nBoth the expletive and the fist pound were startling. And for a moment we all fell silent. Janet\nhad just laid bare the truth about our work. It was not simply theoretical. Behind our data, our\nmodels, our forecasts lived people—individuals who had lost jobs, homes, sometimes hope. And\nwe had missed it.\nThe moment passed and we returned to the briefing. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And I\nhave never forgotten it.\nAs a Reserve Bank president, I have tens of millions of constituents. And it’s not enough to look\nat the data and think I know them. Real knowing comes from seeing the who behind the\nstatistics. And how our policy decisions affect their everyday lives.\nThat’s what Janet Yellen’s pound of the fist really meant.\nIt was a call for us to see.\nNow, this practice of seeing, done day after day, changes not just what we see, but also what\nwe do.\nA vivid example of this occurred early in my research career. We were studying the impact of\nenvironmental programs. One of the study sites was a village that had a tree planting program\nto prevent soil erosion and offer shade. And we had gone to check on it.\nWhen we arrived at the village, the results of the program were painfully clear: every single tree\nwas dead. A sea of perfectly planted, completely lifeless sticks in the ground.\nThe program workers were devastated. But it was obvious what had happened. The trees hadn’t\ngotten enough water, and they died.\nSo, we went to speak to the villagers. We learned that it was a two-mile walk to the well and\nback—a trip they already made multiple times a day to get water for cooking, drinking, and\nbathing. When we heard that, we understood. Of course the trees had died. We had given hard-\nto-care-for trees to people with limited access to water.\nIt was a tragic but classic policy miss: providing a well-intentioned solution without ever\nspeaking to the recipients and seeing what they needed.\n3\n\nAnd this is why seeing is so important. When we don’t see things clearly, we don’t do things\nwell, no matter how good our intentions.\nWe end up with a sea of dead sticks.\nI share these three stories with you because they capture a powerful truth. When we see things\nclearly, we do things differently.\nWe develop programs that give people what they actually need.\nWe acknowledge the real-life struggles that numbers don’t show.\nWe write the check for a struggling teenager that changes the course of her life.\nSo, as you go out into the world, remember this: Public service is not a job. It’s a choice—a\nchoice to see people clearly and to act on what you see.\nAnd if you make this choice, no matter where your career takes you—a courtroom, a classroom,\na boardroom, or the Situation Room—you will be a public servant.\nThat is my call to you.\nCongratulations, Class of 2023. And welcome to the fold.\nThank you.\n4",

    "text": "FINAL\nClimate Risk and the Fed: Preparing for an Uncertain Certainty\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nPeterson Institute for International Economics1\nJune 22, 2021\n11:00 AM EDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nEconomies are, in many ways, perpetually evolving; adapting to new\nconditions and moving from one steady state to another. As these transitions\noccur, the path forward is often hazy. We can see the world shifting around us,\nbut we’re not completely sure where we’ll end up. All we know for certain is\nthat change is on the horizon.\nSociety has faced many of these uncertain certainties: industrialization,\nglobalization, the digital revolution. It’s increasingly clear that climate change\nis another one. While the severity and scope remain unclear, the consensus is\nthat a changing climate poses a significant risk to the global economy and\n2\nfinancial system. And we know from experience that ignoring these risks or\nfailing to prepare for them will make the transformation more turbulent and\nthe destination less hospitable.\nAs monetary policymakers, our job is to navigate this uncertainty. We\nneed to anticipate the changes before us and understand their implications.\n1\nI am grateful to Stephie Fried and Fernanda Nechio of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco for assistance in preparing this text.\n2\nSee, for example, USGCRP (2018), Auffhammer (2018), Hsiang and Kopp (2018), Hsiang et\nal. (2017), Brunetti et al. (2021), Rudebusch (2021). See also Brainard (2021) for related\n1\ndiscussion.\n\nFINAL\nToday, I will talk about how the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and\nthe Federal Reserve more broadly think about climate risk and its\nimplications for the economy.\nBut before I go any further, it’s a good time to remind you that the views\nI will express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone\nelse within the Federal Reserve System.\nPreparing for Uncertainty\nNow,at this point, most people understand that their future, and the\nfutures of their children and grandchildren, will be affected by climate\n3\nchange. Indeed, in a 2019 Pew Research survey, 62 percent of Americans said\n4\nthat climate change is having at least some effect on their local communities.\nBut the future is a far-off place. And as humans, it can be tempting to\ndiscount or simply ignore it. Unfortunately, that makes the path to change\nmore treacherous. The better we understand the challenges and opportunities\nof climate change, the better we’ll be able to manage them.\nFor many people, that future is already here. Drought and wildfires in\nCalifornia and the Pacific Northwest, ice storms in Texas, floods in the\nMidwest, and hurricanes in the South have already cost lives, destroyed\n3\nDefined as the current and projected trend toward higher average temperatures and the\nenvironmental shifts that result, such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more frequent\nsevere storms, and changes in the pattern and predictability of rainfall (IPCC 2020, USGCRP\n2018).\n4\n2\nFunk and Hefferon (2019).\n\nFINAL\n5\nproperty, and displaced communities, sometimes permanently. Assessing\nclimate risk means understanding the likely frequency and severity of these\nkinds of physical disruptions.\nBut physical risks are only part of the story. A complete picture has to\nrecognize the preparations—precautionary or proactive—that individuals,\nbusinesses, and governments are making to manage the expected risks. These\nare especially uncertain since they depend on the awareness and reactions of\nindividuals, communities, and societies.\nEarly data tell us that adjustments are already under way. As the\nfrequency of climate-related events has increased, insurers and financial\ninstitutions have taken notice. They’re much less likely to shake off storms,\nfires, and floods as occasional or “freak” occurrences. Instead, they’re\nrecognizing them as indicative of a recurrent pattern that demands higher\ncompensation or different treatment.\nThe economic impact is tangible. It’s already harder and more expensive\nto insure real estate in risk-prone areas like Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and\n6\nCalifornia. Individuals and businesses in those areas are increasingly on the\nhook for property damage. This limits their ability to get loans or attract\ninvestors, curtails production, and affects decisions about the location of\ncurrent and future operations. It also leaves property owners and the banks\nthat hold their mortgages with stranded assets: real estate investments that\ncan no longer deliver their projected rate of return.\n5\nFor research on extreme events and their economic effects, see Aylward and Oliveira\n(2020), Bakkensen and Barrage (2020), Gallagher (2014), Tran and Wilson (2020),\nDeryugina (2017), and Fried (2021).\n6\n3\nSee, for example, Flavelle (2019), Grimaldi et al. (2020), Sheehan (2020).\n\nFINAL\nThese dynamics aren’t limited to businesses and households in areas\nprone to destructive weather events. We’re seeing them in parts of the\ncountry facing less conspicuous climate effects, like prolonged extreme\ntemperatures and unpredictable rainfall. The outcomes may seem less acute\nthan fires or hurricanes, but they affect business operations in equally crucial\nways—for example, by influencing which crops can be grown or how may\nmonths of the year people can work outside. These kinds of shifts are already\n7\nbeing factored into businesses’ and insurers’ assessments of risk.\nAll of this highlights an important reality. The risks from climate change\naren’t an isolated problem relevant only to a few sectors or parts of the\ncountry. Large swaths of the nation and a wide range of industries are\n8\nvulnerable to disruption.\nOf course, nowhere are these risks more acute than in the sectors of the\neconomy that produce and use carbon-based energy. The global and\nincreasingly domestic momentum to “go green” is prompting consumers and\nbusinesses to decarbonize and shift to more environmentally neutral forms of\n9\nenergy. These changes can lead to mispriced assets or misallocated capital,\nespecially for entities operating globally. We’re already seeing corporations\ntake notice. A growing number of them are including climate risk assessments\nin their daily business planning and financial disclosures. In many cases, this\n7\nBrunetti et al. (2021).\n8\nThese industries include the agricultural and resource sectors, leisure activities, various\nmanufacturing industries, and the financial institutions that support their operation.\n(USGCRP 2018).\n9\n4\nFried, Novan, and Peterman (2021).\n\nFINAL\nis happening in the absence of regulatory requirements or government\n10\nmandates.\nMany sectors are feeling the strain, including energy, automobiles, and\nconstruction. Firms in these carbon-heavy sectors could see declines in asset\n11\nprices, income, and profitability. Understandably, communities and\nbusinesses that rely on these industries are worried; they’re thinking about\nfalling production, stranded assets, and, ultimately, stranded people.\nTheir fears aren’t unfounded. We don’t have to go back very far in our\nhistory to see the devastating impact economic shifts can have on whole\nsegments of society. Think back to the 1980s wave of globalization. The view\nof most economists, including me, was that freer trade would be an\nunqualified win for the aggregate economy, raising output, driving growth,\n12\nlowering inflation, and ultimately delivering higher GDP per capita. And\n13\nglobalization has led to many good things—just not across the board.\nIndustries that had once been at the heart of the U.S. economy became\nless profitable and less viable. Workers displaced from downsized and closing\nbusinesses found it hard to transition to alternative employment with similar\npay. Some remained idle for the rest of their working lives. While new jobs\nand industries emerged, they often went to other people, in other places, far\nfrom the communities hardest hit by globalization. Thirty years later, many of\n10\nSee the work by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\n(https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/) and CDP (https://www.cdp.net/en/climate).\n11\nRudebusch (2021), Brunetti et al. (2021).\n12\nAlston, Kearl, and Vaughan (1992).\n13\nSee, for example, Broda and Weinstein (2006), Ebenstein et al. (2014), Caliendo and\n5\nParro (2015), and Hummels, Munch, and Xiang (2018).\n\nFINAL\nthese communities still bear the scars, having never fully recovered from the\n14\neffects of the transition.\nClimate change could bring similar economic upheaval, boosting\ninnovation, output, and jobs in green sectors, while reducing them in carbon-\nintensive ones. While the evolution of these patterns is uncertain, it is clear\nthat where we end up will be different than where we’ve been. And the lesson\nfrom past experience is that how we manage these shifts will shape not just\nthe climate, but also the trajectory of the economy and the individuals,\nfamilies, and communities that make it up.\nClimate Risk and the Fed\nSo, what does all of this mean for the Fed? Well, like all other risks to the\neconomy, it’s incumbent on the Federal Reserve to understand the likely path\nof climate change and the transitions that could be part of this evolution. At\nthis juncture, when both the path of change and the eventual new equilibrium\nare so uncertain, our role is to listen, study, and adjust to whatever comes our\nway.\nAnd we’ve already needed to do this. Over the past several years, severe\nweather and wildfires have frequently distorted headline employment and\ngrowth numbers, making it more challenging to decipher the true state of the\neconomy. This has prompted us and others throughout the Federal Reserve\nSystem to look at weather as a regular explanatory factor in economic\n14\nRegarding persistent trade impacts on U.S. employment, see, for example, Autor, Dorn,\n6\nand Hanson (2013) and Autor et al. (2014).\n\nFINAL\nperformance—a necessary response to the increased frequency and impact of\n15\nclimate events.\nBut the Fed and all central banks also need to be forward looking,\nresponding to the risks we see today, while anticipating those that have yet to\nunfold. This need has prompted many central banks to formally consider\n16\nclimate risk in the regulation and supervision of financial institutions. The\nFederal Reserve is thinking about these risks, too. Earlier this year, we created\na new Supervision Climate Committee to ensure the resilience of financial\n17\nfirms under our supervision.\nOf course, there are also risks to the economy that we don’t yet fully\nunderstand—the known but unknown risks. One of those is the response of\nbusinesses and households to living in a more unpredictable world. As\nuncertainty rises, so does the desire for precautionary savings that can be\nused to offset or hedge against possible future losses. While such behavior is a\nprudent response to greater risk, a change in saving behavior of a large\nnumber of individuals, both here and abroad, would contribute to a lower\n18\nneutral rate of interest, or r-star.\n15\nWilson (2019), Boldin and Wright (2015). This is different than simple seasonal\nadjustment, which assumes the local and national patterns of weather are broadly similar\nfrom year to year.\n16\nFor example, this month the Bank of England launched an “experimental” climate risk\nstress test of major U.K. banks and insurers (Bank of England 2021). The European Central\nBank includes climate risk in its supervisory guidance to financial institutions (European\nCentral Bank 2020).\n17\nThe FedSeuraple rRveisseiornv ea nBdo Raredg uisl aatlisoon e Rsetapbolristhing a Financial Stability Climate FCionmanmciitatle e to\niSdtaenbtiliiftyy, Rasespeosrst, and address climate-related risks to financial stability. The Federal\nReserve’s (Board of Governors 2020a) and\n18 (Board of Governors 202 0b) discuss these issues from microprudential and\nmacroprudential perspectives, respectively. See Brainard (2021) for additional discussion.\n7\nDietrich, Muller, and Schoenle (2021).\n\nFINAL\nA similar downward force on r-star may arise from a reduction in labor\nproductivity, as rising temperatures impede outdoor work or skill demand\noutstrips skill supply, limiting growth. This would only add to the structural\nfactors currently depressing the neutral rate of interest and further curtail the\n19\nFed’s ability to cut rates to combat economic downturns. Of course, there\ncould also be offsetting pressure on r-star from increased investments to\nmove to a more sustainable economy. In other words, there’s a lot of\nuncertainty.\nAnother known but unknown risk is how much and how rapidly the\nstructure of the economy will change. If the journey occurs abruptly, the\ntransition could put considerable pressure on both employment and prices.\nFor example, an abrupt shift from older, less green technologies to greener\nones could leave workers in declining sectors unprepared, lacking the skills to\nsmoothly transition. We could also see prices jump in emerging sectors and\nfall in declining ones, as supply responds to changes in demand. Without\nadvance preparation to help industries transform and the workforce adapt,\nthe transition costs could be large and long-lasting. As monetary\npolicymakers, we will need to watch these developments closely and prepare\nfor any and all scenarios.\nSo how do we do this? How do we watch for developments and assess\nrisks when so many have yet to fully develop? At the San Francisco Fed we\nhave taken a very direct approach. We are working intentionally and\ndeliberately with our communities, other public institutions, and the private\nth\nsector to catalog the risks and how they are playing out in the 12 District, the\n19\nFor examinations of the structural factors depressing r-star see Carvalho, Ferrero, and\nNechio (2016), Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\n8\n\nFINAL\nnation, and across the globe. These data collection efforts are multifaceted and\ninclude formal surveys, listening sessions, and targeted meetings with CEOs to\nbetter understand how climate risk affects decision making and resiliency\nplanning.\nWe are also convening the best academic thinking on these topics,\nhosting conferences and sponsoring a virtual seminar series on climate\n20\neconomics that features a range of research on the issues we are facing.\nFinally, consistent with our history, we have assembled a team to study how\nthese issues are likely to impact the Federal Reserve’s mandates in the future.\nThis team allows us to leverage our strength as students of the economy to\n21\nprepare for the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead.\nThe Transition We Choose\nFuture occurrences, especially when uncertain, are easy to push off. But\ndoing so leaves a mark.\nI saw this myself. As a teenager growing up in Missouri, I witnessed\nfactory after factory move away, or simply shutter. Each one of them left\npeople behind.

But the real\nmiss was a lack of acknowledgement. Acknowledgement that, while the\neconomy would be better off in the end, the end is a long way off and the\ntransition would not benefit everyone equally. In fact, there could be collateral\ndamage.\nSo, what do we learn from this? The key lesson is that transitions\nmatter. And how they play out is our choice. On the cusp of an economic\ntransformation that will likely be even more far-reaching, we have an\nopportunity to do things differently.\nOur future is uncertain: no one really knows the severity and scale of\nclimate change, where and who will be most affected, or the nature, extent,\nand duration of our response to the risks. But one thing is certain—the\neconomic ground is shifting. And we have a window of opportunity to\nprepare; to choose the degree of hardship we will endure.\nEconomic transitions are inevitable, but the degree of pain they inflict is\nnot. In the end, preparation gives us agency. It is our duty to use it.\nThank you.\n10\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAmerican Economic Review\nAlston, Richard M., J.R. Kearl, and Michael B.

    "text": "Resolute and Mindful: The Path to Price Stability\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSpeech to Orange County Business Council\nIrvine, California\nNovember 21, 2022\n10:00AM PST\nThese days, I am often asked how I think about monetary policy decisions. And that makes\nsense. Especially now, when the tradeoffs that many people fear—high inflation or hard\nrecession—seem so severe. My answer is this: I am resolute and mindful. Resolute in achieving\nour goals. And mindful about how we do it.\nNow to some, it may seem like there is a conflict. They worry that resolute means “at any cost.”\nOn the other side, people hear mindful and they worry we won’t go far enough—that we’ll stop\nshort of getting the job fully done.\nBut resolute and mindful are complementary principles. And today, I will share how they inform\nmy decisions as we strive to deliver low and stable prices and an economy that works for all.\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that the remarks I make are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nFrom Low to High Inflation\nI’ll start by talking about where we are and how we got here. Because this, of course, sets the\nstage for what lies ahead.\nAs many of you know, Congress gave the Federal Reserve two mandates: price stability and\nmaximum employment. Right now, we are only meeting one of those goals. The labor market is\n1\n\nvery strong and well aligned with our employment objective. In contrast, inflation is\nunacceptably high and has been that way for almost two years.\nHigh inflation feels unfamiliar to many of us. Before the pandemic, the United States had\nenjoyed almost four decades of low and stable prices, with inflation fluctuating only modestly\nbetween expansions and downturns. In fact, after the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal\nReserve and other central banks struggled with persistently low inflation, which could leave the\neconomy vulnerable to deflationary pressures and slower longer-run growth.1 Clearly, a\ndifferent problem.\nThen COVID-19 hit and plunged the United States and the world into a steep downturn. The\nFederal Reserve cut interest rates, purchased long-term assets, and opened lending facilities—\nall in an effort to bridge the economy through the worst of the pandemic.2 U.S. fiscal agents\ntook equally aggressive action, eventually putting about $5 trillion in federal spending into the\neconomy.3\nThese unprecedented efforts worked. U.S. economic growth bounced back rapidly. By the\nsecond half of 2020, demand was growing and the labor market was on track to recover.\nSupply chains were lagging, but with vaccines coming online, there was hope that production\nwould quickly return to full capacity.\nUnfortunately, this did not occur. Global production and distribution continued to lag. And by\nearly 2021, price pressures were starting to build—first in a few sectors directly affected by the\npandemic, and then more broadly, as imbalances between robust demand and limited supply\nspread throughout the economy.4\nBy the fall of that year, inflation had risen further and looked to be gaining momentum. In\ncontrast, unemployment was steadily declining and heading back to its historically low pre-\npandemic level. In response, the Fed needed to remove accommodation and tighten policy\nmuch more quickly than it had previously signaled.\n1 See Daly (2019) and references therein. At that time, the concern was that the FOMC could not get inflation up to\nthe 2 percent target. See also Williams (2017) and Powell (2018). For related research, see for example Kiley and\nRoberts (2017) and Mertens and Williams (2019).\n2 Board of Governors (2020) and Hoops and Kurtzman (2021).\n3 Parlapiano et al. (2022).\n4 Shapiro (2022).\n2\n\nPolicy Rebalancing\nBut there was a key challenge. At the time, most market participants, businesses, and\nhouseholds expected the Fed to maintain near-zero interest rates until late 2022 or even 2023.5\nMoreover, while the asset purchase program had begun to wind down that November, it was\nnot expected to conclude until the middle of 2022.6\nA long history suggests that surprising people with abrupt changes to policy can be costly,\npotentially disrupting financial intermediation and leaving lenders and borrowers unprepared.\nAnd because people have come to expect that the Fed will be transparent about its projected\npolicy actions, catching people off guard can also erode hard-won trust. So, FOMC participants\ncommunicated that policy could change earlier than previously thought. In December 2021, the\nFOMC announced it would phase out its asset purchase program more rapidly and be prepared\nto raise rates as early as March 2022.7\nThis and other forward guidance provided throughout that fall had an immediate impact.\nAlmost overnight, financial conditions tightened. Market participants began pricing in expected\nfuture rate hikes, and businesses and households started readying themselves for a new\ninterest rate landscape, pulling forward real estate purchases, restructuring debt obligations,\nand locking in longer-term fixed-rate loans. In other words, before we ever raised the federal\nfunds rate, tighter financial conditions were already working their way through the system\n(Figure 1). Indeed, by the time of the first official rate hike of 25 basis points in March 2022,\nmortgage interest rates had risen three-quarters of a percentage point and broader financial\nconditions had tightened almost a full percentage point.\n5 Just before the September meeting when the FOMC signaled likely reductions in the pace of asset purchases,\nfederal funds futures markets were projecting liftoff in late 2022 or early 2023.\n6 Board of Governors (2021a).\n7 Board of Governors (2021b, c).\n3\n\nFigure 1\nEffective federal funds rate, 30-year mortgage rate, and GSFCI\nThe responsiveness of financial conditions to our communications was notable and helpful. It\ngave us a head start on adjusting policy and mitigated the costs of an abrupt and unexpected\nchange to the policy rate.\nBut of course, the job was far from done. Inflation was still on a troubling upward climb, and\nbusinesses and families were feeling the pain. Left untamed, inflation can also distort\ninvestment decisions, exacerbate economic inequalities, and reduce confidence in the Fed’s\nability to achieve its goals, all of which can bridle longer run growth.8 The pain of so many\nAmericans coupled with the potential for long-term damage to the economy prompted the Fed\nto take aggressive action.\nWe began raising rates more quickly—expeditiously—moving the fed funds rate up in 75 basis\npoint increments. This allowed us to swiftly withdraw accommodation and bring policy more in\nline with prevailing economic conditions. As of our last meeting just a few weeks ago, the target\nrange of the federal funds rate stands at 3.75 to 4 percent, modestly restrictive relative to the\nneutral rate of interest. And we have signaled that there is more work to do.\n8 See Daly (2022) and references therein.\n4\n\nThis resolve has some people worried. They are concerned that resolute means unwilling to\nstop until the economy breaks or inflation hits 2 percent.\nBut that is not how I think about policy, nor is it the path communicated by the FOMC in its last\nstatement.9 Resolute does not mean heedless. This is especially important as we move into the\nnext—and in many ways more difficult—phase of policy tightening.\nFinding Sufficiently Restrictive\nAs we work to bring policy to a sufficiently restrictive stance—the level required to bring\ninflation down and restore price stability—we will need to be mindful. Adjusting too little will\nleave inflation too high. Adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn.\nSo, what specifically do we need to be mindful of? Many things, of course. But in our November\nFOMC statement, we mention three in particular: the cumulative tightening in place, the lags in\nmonetary policy, and the evolution of the data.\nLet’s start with cumulative tightening. Historically, we’ve used progress on the federal funds\nrate and where it stands relative to its neutral value as a gauge for policy restrictiveness. But in\ntoday’s world, that is only part of the picture. The funds rate does not capture the impact of the\nother tools in our tool kit, including the reduced asset holdings associated with balance sheet\nroll-off and the forward guidance we’ve provided about the future path of policy. It also misses\nthe fact that central banks across the globe are tightening policy as well, likely amplifying the\neffects of our own rate hikes.\nA more comprehensive way to gauge the actual level of tightening is to look at financial market\nconditions.10 Several researchers have done this and found that the level of financial tightening\nin the economy is much higher than what the funds rate tells us. As the figure shows, this has\nbeen true for a while now (Figure 2). In fact today, while the funds rate is between 3.75 and 4\npercent, financial markets are acting like it is around 6 percent.\n9 Board of Governors (2022a, b).\n10 Choi et al. (2022); monthly updates are available on the San Francisco Fed’s Proxy Funds Rate data page.\n5\n\nFigure 2\nEffective federal funds rate and proxy rate\nAs we make decisions about further rate adjustments, it will be important to remain conscious\nof this gap between the federal funds rate and the tightening in financial markets. Ignoring it\nraises the chances of tightening too much.\nOf course, we also have to account for the fact that, while financial markets react quickly to\npolicy changes, the real economy takes longer to adjust. Overlooking this lag can make us think\nwe have further to go when, in reality, we just have to wait for earlier actions to work their way\nthrough the economy. There is a large literature on the lags in monetary policy. And while there\nis no clear consensus on exactly how long they are, there is broad agreement that it’s not\nimmediate and likely takes at least several quarters.11\nThis is consistent with what we have seen in the data. The Fed started tightening policy close to\na year ago. Interest-sensitive sectors like housing started to cool very quickly. As mortgage rates\nrose, home sales, construction activity, and the pace of house price gains slowed. Labor\nmarkets remain solid but are showing early signs of cooling. Job openings are down about 10\npercent from their March high and job growth is slowing from its rapid pace last year. And\nalthough one month of data does not a victory make, the latest inflation report had some\nencouraging numbers, including a long awaited decline in goods price inflation.\n11 Romer and Romer (2004) and Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n6\n\nLooking ahead, I will be watching for further calming in these areas, as well as signs that\npandemic-related imbalances between supply and demand are continuing to subside. I will also\nbe in continuous dialogue with business leaders, workers, and community members in my\nDistrict. Policy decisions also require that we look forward. Real-time conversations yield\ninsights about how people are faring and how the economy is changing before they ever show\nup in the published data.\nAs we navigate back to price stability, we will need to pay attention to all of these things and\nadjust policy accordingly. And because the economy is dynamic, we will need to do this on an\nongoing basis. We have to constantly calibrate our stance of policy to meet evolving conditions.\nA Job Fully Done\nWhile resolute and mindful are not in conflict, there is a tension. And that’s what we want in\npolicymaking.\nWe want to go far enough that we get the job done. That’s the resolute part. But not so far that\nwe overdo it. And that’s the mindful part.\nSo, we will march unwaveringly toward our goals. Resolute and mindful, until the job is fully\ndone.\nThank you.\n7\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2020. “Monetary Policy Report.” June 12.\nBoard of Governors. 2021a. “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.” November 3.\nBoard of Governors. 2021b. “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.” December 15.\nBoard of Governors. 2021c. “Chair Powell’s Press Conference.” December 15.\nBoard of Governors. 2022a. “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.” November 2.\nBoard of Governors. 2022b. “Chair Powell’s Press Conference.” November 2.\nChoi, Jason, Taeyoung Doh, Andrew Foerster, and Zinnia Martinez. 2022. “Monetary Policy Stance Is\nTighter than Federal Funds Rate.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2022-30 (November 7).\nDaly, Mary C. 2019. “A New Balancing Act: Monetary Policy Tradeoffs in a Changing World.” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2019-23 (September 3).\nDaly, Mary C. 2022. “The Singularity of the Dual Mandate.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2022-27 (October 3).\nHavranek, Tomas, and Marek Rusnak. 2013. “Transmission Lags of Monetary Policy: A Meta-Analysis.”\nInternational Journal of Central Banking 9(4), pp. 39–75.\nHoops, Matthew, and Robert Kurtzman. 2021. “Accounting for COVID-19 Related Funding, Credit,\nLiquidity, and Loan Facilities in the Financial Accounts of the United States.” Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors FEDS Notes, July 30.\nKiley, Michael T., and John M.

Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nAmerican Bankers Association\n2025 Conference for Community Bankers\nPhoenix, Arizona\nFebruary 18, 2025\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n1\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nIntroduction\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be here in Phoenix and an honor to be speaking to so many\ncommunity bankers. I should also say, welcome to the Twelfth Federal Reserve District. We are\ndelighted to have you!\nI am really looking forward to a great discussion. To get us started, I will provide a few opening\nremarks, reflections from my vantage point as a Reserve Bank President.\nAs presidents, my colleagues and I occupy a unique place in the conversation about banking and\ncommunity banks. We don’t have a role in regulatory or supervisory policy, nor a direct role in the\nexecution of these programs. These responsibilities reside with the Board of Governors.\nBut that doesn’t mean we don’t have insights. Reserve Banks house many of the teams that do\ndirect supervision. And Reserve Bank presidents spend considerable time talking to bankers and their\ncustomers as part of our economic and community outreach. All of this gives us perspective on the\nchallenges and opportunities for all banks, especially community banks.\nReflecting on these insights in preparation for this conference, a consistent theme emerges. And\nthat is the growing gap between how we talk about community banks—often extolling their virtues and\nimportance—and the environment we create for them through regulatory and supervisory frameworks.\nOf course, we all want a safe and sound banking system. Something we have here in the United\nStates. But we also want a banking system that supports innovation and growth, where banks, businesses,\nand households can thrive. To do both takes balance, ensuring that regulatory and supervisory practices\nmatch the risks to and the aspirations for our financial system.\nThat is the subject of my remarks today. Now before I go any further, it’s a good time to remind\nyou that the views I share today are my own and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\n2\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nA Growing Gap\nThe U.S. banking system is one of the most vibrant and diverse in the world. We have more than\n4,500 FDIC-insured institutions of varying sizes, geographies, focuses, and footprints.1 This creates a rich\nfinancial ecosystem that enables households and businesses to gain access to a broad array of financial\nservices, including credit.\nCommunity banks play a crucial role in this ecosystem, supporting almost every geography in\nAmerica.2 I see countless examples of how they are woven into the fabric of cities, towns, and\nneighborhoods across the Twelfth District and beyond. You can also see this in the data on community\nbanks, which consistently show the important role you play in providing essential financial services,\nparticularly to small businesses.3,4 Most notably, perhaps, community banks are there in good and\nchallenging times. The COVID response is a good example. Community banks stepped in to ensure that\nbusinesses new and old received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program.5,6 I know firsthand how\nimportant this lifeline was for many businesses.\nBut acknowledging importance is not enough to guarantee the future of community banks. We\nalso need a regulatory and supervisory framework that fits their size, complexity, and risk.\nMore and more we are hearing this is not the case. The 2024 Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors Survey of Community Banks7 found that concerns over regulatory burden remained elevated,\nand were nearly as high as concerns over the cost of funds. Looking at the data, you can see why banks\n1 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2024).\n2 There are over 4,000 community banking organizations in the U.S. with roughly $2.8 trillion in assets.

The Paycheck Protection Program and PPPLF aided the liquidity positions of\ncommunity banks and encouraged lending to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A 2020 FDIC study showed that from 2008 to 2019, federal financial regulators\nissued 157 final rules and programs applying to community banks, an average of one every 28 days.8\nAll this adds up to an environment where community banking has become harder. Between\nincreased competition, compressed margins, and the growing costs of complying with regulation, it has\nbecome more challenging to become or stay a community banker.\nBalancing the Tradeoffs\nSo what do we do? I want to start with how I think about the tradeoffs in banking regulation.\nAnd here, I am going to look through the lens of my training as an economist.\nThe first thing to know is that the right answer is usually somewhere in the middle. The range of\ntradeoffs between a lot and a little regulatory oversight fall along a continuum. On one end, we can let\nbanks do whatever they want, with no constraints on behavior or risk taking. In theory, that would spur\ninnovation, encourage competition, and promote at least short-term growth. But it could also impose\nsignificant risks on customers, taxpayers, and the broader financial system. On the other end, we can try\nto regulate the risk out of the system. But that would bridle innovation, lending, and dynamism—things\nthat have made the U.S. financial system one of the best in the world.\nPublic commentary often focuses on these binary choices at the extremes. But that’s not where\nthe answer lies. The goal of regulation is not to remove all risk, but rather to ensure that banks manage it\nwell. The middle ground. To find the right place, you need a set of principles, and that is where I will\nfocus the rest of my time. These principles are not about banks per se, but rather about regulation and\nrisk.\nThe first principle is that the job of getting this right is never done. It’s a continuous process of\nevaluating and changing when necessary. That doesn’t mean we change things every second or every\n8 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2020).\n4\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nmonth, but rather that we recognize the world is a dynamic place, and we must adjust. This principle\nunderlies the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act.9 But it really is an ongoing\nprocess. Regulation is only as effective as our commitment to evaluating it.\nThe second principle is that the cost-benefit ratio for any regulation must pencil out. Every rule\nhas costs and benefits.10 That much we know. The question for policy makers is, does the benefit make\nthe cost worthwhile?\nAnd here, it is important to look beyond the average. Cost of compliance, and the benefits of any\nrule, will likely vary by bank size, complexity, and risk profile. Taking that heterogeneity into account\nensures that we get what we intend from regulatory policy and that we do so fairly, without unduly\nadvantaging or disadvantaging any single institution or group of institutions. This is the essence of\ntailoring and an essential element of right-sizing rules.\nAnd this brings me to the last principle. It is the sum of regulation that matters. To accurately\nmeasure the costs and benefits, we have to account for the cumulative impact. Rules and regulations are\nmade individually, but their effects are felt as a whole. This is particularly salient for community banks.11\nGetting it right in terms of costs and benefits requires this holistic view of how regulations add up.\nThese principles are not a playbook. They are a framing device to help us think about where we\nshould land along the regulatory continuum for banking.\nRegulations are tools. They need to balance protection of the consumer and the financial system\nagainst costs to financial institutions, innovation, and economic growth. And they need to recognize that\nnot all banks are the same. Carefully considered and appropriately tailored rules, that evolve as the\neconomy does, can ensure that banks of all sizes take appropriate risks and continue to thrive.\n9 The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (12 U.S.C. § 3311) requires agencies, with input\nfrom the public, to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify any outdated or otherwise\nunnecessary regulatory requirements applicable to their supervised institutions. Federal bank regulatory agencies will\nhold their next public outreach meeting on March 6, 2025.\n10 In talking about costs and benefits, I am abstracting from whether they accrued to the bank, the customer, or the\npublic.\n11 Dahl, Meyer, and Neely (2016).\n5\n\nNONCONFIDENTIAL // EXTERNAL\nSumming Up\nRegulatory policy is meant to set guardrails. It should not pick winners and losers. That is the job\nof the marketplace.\nNo community banker I have ever spoken with wants a special deal, they just want a fair one. The\nonus is on us—those in the room, Reserve Bank presidents, regulators, and the public—to be sure that we\nmatch our practices with our ideals. The future of community banking depends on it.\nThank you and I look forward to our discussion.\nReferences\nBarca, Alaina, and Harry Hou. 2024. U.S. Bank Branch Closures and Banking Deserts.

    "text": "Price Stability Built to Last\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNational Association for Business Economics\nWashington, DC\nFebruary 16, 2024\n12:45 PM ET, 9:45 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThe day after the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, just a few\nmonths back, a man came up to me in the dry cleaner. He told me that he and his wife had\ngone to dinner the night before, partly to celebrate the end of the Fed’s rate tightening cycle,\nbut mostly to mark the end of the long, hard battle to bring inflation down. He felt the worst\nwas behind us, and that he and his family could finally take a breath.\nThe relief he described is not unique. I hear it everywhere. Businesses, communities, and\nfamilies exhaling, just a bit, as they see inflation falling without the economy breaking.\nThere is no doubt things are better. But progress is not victory, and we, the FOMC, need to\ndeliver more than a few fleeting moments of relief.\nOur goals are sustainable price stability and full employment, working together in a balance\nthat will last. There is more work to do to deliver on that commitment.\nToday, I will discuss the progress we have made, the risks we face, and what we will need to\ndo to finish the job.\n1\n\nAs always, let me remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nSignificant Progress\nSo, let’s start with progress. Relative to a year ago, the economy is in a very good place.\nInflation is heading down, the labor market is rebalancing, and many of the post-pandemic\ndisruptions are dissipating.\nThe inflation progress has been remarkable. In the latest personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation release,1 prices were up just 2.6 percent compared to a year ago. Still not price\nstability, but a lot of improvement from its peak of 7.1 percent back in June of 2022.\nA big part of the story on inflation has been supply. Global production, warehousing, and\ndistribution networks have largely returned to normal. Bottlenecks, wait times, and price\npressures have followed.2\nThese things aren’t surprising. They’ve just finally happened. And they’ve helped ease goods\nprice inflation substantially, bringing it back to near pre-pandemic levels.\nThe supply-side “surprise,” if you will, has been the positive news on labor and productivity.\nDefying all the pessimists, U.S. workers in the prime of their working age came back to work\nlast year, including women and mothers. This drove prime-age participation to its highest level\nin two decades.3 At the same time, we saw a surge in immigration.4 Both of these\ndevelopments boosted labor availability.\nBut we didn’t just have more workers, these workers also became more productive.\nProductivity growth picked up notably last year, surpassing its pre-pandemic trend.5\nTogether, these supply developments eased labor market tightness and helped to bring wage\ninflation closer to a level consistent with our 2 percent inflation target.6\n1 As of December 2023.\n2 See the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index for the latest data, and Liu and Nguyen (2023) for\nanalysis.\n3 See, for example, Prabhakar and Valletta (2024). Labor force participation surged for prime-age workers through\nmid-2023, reaching a historical high for women and reattaining the pre-pandemic peak for men.\n4 The share of foreign-born people in the U.S. labor force reached a new high in 2022, at 18.1 percent (Bureau of\nLabor Statistics 2023).\n5 Productivity growth in 2023 was 2.7 percent. By comparison, estimated trend productivity growth prior to the\npandemic was between 1 and 1¼ percent (Fernald and Li 2019).\n6 That level is estimated to be about 3½ percent. See, for example, Almuzara, Audoly, and Melcangi (2023).\n2\n\nBut perhaps the best news about the decline in inflation is that supply wasn’t the only story.\nImprovement also has come from a gradual slowing in demand, the portion that monetary\npolicy directly affects.\nWe hear this from our contacts and see it in surveys, but we can also quantify it using analysis\ndeveloped at the San Francisco Fed.7 The researchers focus on the PCE index and separate\nindividual price changes into those driven by demand, where prices and quantities move in\nthe same direction, from those driven by supply, where prices and quantities move in opposite\ndirections. Their analysis shows that about two-thirds of the decline in core inflation in 2023\ncame from the demand side. Demand played less of a role for headline PCE, where supplies of\nfood and energy drive a lot of the inflation dynamic.8\nPutting all of this together, it is clear that things changed in 2023. Supply bounced back, tighter\nmonetary policy gained traction, and inflation came down rapidly. For households and\nbusinesses, the treadmill of persistently high and rising inflation slowed down. All without a\nsignificant decline in growth or employment.\nThis is unequivocally good news, and real progress.\nMinding the Risks\nThe question is, should we expect it to continue. The modal outlook of many professional\nforecasters seems to say yes.9 The median of the December FOMC Summary of Economic\nProjections portrayed a similar view.10\nMost striking perhaps is the confidence that households, businesses, and markets show for\ncontinued progress on inflation. Among households, once elevated year-ahead inflation\nexpectations have fallen substantially and are now near pre-pandemic levels.11 Business\ninflation expectations have also improved. According to the Atlanta Fed Inflation Project,\nbusinesses see prices in the coming year rising just slightly above 2 percent, about the norm for\n7 Shapiro (2022a, b).\n8 For the full analysis and regularly updated series see Supply- and Demand-Driven PCE Inflation. See also Shapiro\n(2022a, b). Similarly, Guerrieri et al. (2023) argue that the rise and fall of energy prices in both the United States and\nthe euro area played an important role in shaping observed inflation patterns after the pandemic.\n9 See, for example, the February 2024 Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\n10 Board of Governors (2023).\n11 In the Michigan survey, year-ahead inflation expectations eased to 2.9 percent in January, the lowest value since\nDecember 2020 and within the 2.3 to 3.0 percent range reported during the two years prior to the pandemic. In the\nNew York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, one-year inflation expectations were 3.0 percent in January,\nsimilar to their level in 2018 through early 2019.\n3\n\nthat series.12 Financial markets have similar expectations—inflation around 2 percent at the\nend of the year.13\nOf course, projections and expectations are just that: views about what we think will happen.\nWe need more time and data to be sure that they will be realized. And we need to monitor\nrisks that could get in the way, especially since uncertainty is so high.\nThere is a myriad of risks to consider, but I will focus on two: slower inflation progress and\nfragilities in the labor market.\nOn inflation, there is a risk that the positive supply developments we saw last year might be\nhard to sustain. Labor force participation for prime-age workers is close to historical highs,\nand with the labor market cooling and wage gains slowing, we might not see additional\noutsized contributions coming from this group.14 The large influx of foreign-born workers also\nmay slow, further limiting labor force growth.15 I always bet on workers, but at this point, it is\nhard to predict, and it does pose a risk to further rapid reductions in inflation.\nThe same is true of productivity growth. It’s highly uncertain whether we will continue to see\nthe strong numbers of last year. There are many reasons to be optimistic, but productivity\ntrends are notoriously hard to forecast, and at this point, we just can’t be sure.\nAnd of course, we live in a dynamic world, and there are always new shocks, like disruptions in\nthe Red Sea and Panama Canal, to disrupt supply. I know this was a concern you mentioned in\nthe NABE survey.16 Although not currently binding, these challenges may impair goods\ndistribution and push up costs in the future.\nOn the demand side, momentum remains a risk, especially among consumers. We’ve\nrepeatedly expected spending to slow, only to be wrong. Ongoing economic momentum that\noutstrips available supply remains a risk to the inflation outlook.\nBut slower progress on inflation is not the only risk we face. On the other side of our mandate,\nthe labor market could falter.\n12 See the Atlanta Fed’s Business Inflation Expectations survey.\n13 Based on updated analysis from Mertens and Zhang (2023).\n14 Prabhakar and Valletta (2024).\n15 For example, the Congressional Budget Office (2024) expects immigration flows to be little changed in 2024 and\nthen decline somewhat in 2025-26, returning to historic averages after that.\n16 See NABE Economic Policy Survey: February 2024.\n4\n\nLet me be clear. We do not see that right now. So far, labor market conditions have eased\nwithout a rise in unemployment. In technical terms, we’ve been sliding down the steep portion\nof the Beveridge curve, where changes in labor demand reduce vacancies without reducing\njobs and pushing up unemployment.17 As the vacancy rate gets closer to its pre-pandemic\naverage, these favorable conditions could end, and the tradeoff between falling labor\ndemand and unemployment could be more stark.\nOf course, with employment growth as strong as it has been, this seems like a distant risk. But\ngiven the speed at which labor market pivots historically occur, it’s a risk we must keep in mind.\nFinishing the Job\nSo that’s the landscape. The economy is healthy. Price stability is within sight. But there is\nmore work to do.\nTo finish the job will take fortitude. We will need to resist the temptation to act quickly when\npatience is needed and be prepared to respond agilely as the economy evolves.\nThis is not a new situation for the Fed or any central bank. Uncertainty is a fact of life. The\neconomy rarely signals exactly where it is headed.\nThe constant in our changing environment is our goals. They are always sustainable price\nstability and full employment for a healthy economy.\nAnd these are more than just words, a fact I’m reminded of nearly every day.\nAfter the dry cleaner last December, I went to the hardware store. I was standing in line\nbehind a dad and his college-age daughter. When the total rang up, the dad asked the\ncashier why it was so high. Without hesitation, the cashier said, inflation—everything costs\nmore.\nAs the two walked out of the store, the daughter said, “I never heard about inflation before the\npandemic.” Her dad responded, “I hope you never do again.”\n17 Figura and Waller (2022) and Bok et al. (2022). Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky-Nadeau (2023) link analysis of the\nBeveridge curve to the Phillips curve tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, reinforcing the view that\ninflation can fall without a sharp increase in unemployment.\n5\n\nThat is really what we are after. An economy unburdened by inflation, where people can step\noff the treadmill and make decisions about their lives and livelihoods without worrying about\nrapidly changing prices. We want price stability built to last.\nThank you.\n6\n\nReferences\nAlmuzara, Martin, Richard Audoly, and Davide Melcangi. 2023. “A Turning Point in Wage Growth?”\nLiberty Street Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, February 23.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2023. “Summary of Economic Projections.” December\n13.\nBok, Brandyn, Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, Robert G.

    "text": "Landing Softly Is Just the Beginning\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNew York University Stern School of Business\nNew York, NY\nOctober 15, 2024\n11:30 a.m. ET\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nINTRODUCTION\nGood morning.\nIt’s great to be in New York again and to have the opportunity to speak with you about the\neconomy and monetary policy. I very much appreciate the invitation, and I look forward to a\nlively discussion.\nNow, instead of starting with monetary policy, I’m going to begin with a story.\nLast week, I was walking in my neighborhood. A young father, with a stroller, a toddler, and a\ndog called out to me. He had a question. “President Daly, are you declaring victory?”\nI immediately said no. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) won’t be satisfied until\ninflation is at our 2 percent goal.\nBut as it turns out, that wasn’t what he meant.\nWhat he wanted to know was that we wouldn’t stop there. He wanted low inflation, a healthy\nlabor market, and a durable expansion. He wanted a chance to catch up and then advance. A\nchance to recoup what high inflation took from him. And an opportunity to build his career,\nfamily, and community. An opportunity to be better off.\nAs a policymaker, that has always been my objective—to deliver the foundations for that type\nof economy. And with inflation easing and the economy back on a sustainable track, that\nobjective can be our focus.\n1\n\nToday, I will discuss the progress we’ve made in bringing inflation down and the importance of\nlooking beyond a “soft landing.” Aspiring to a durable expansion with sustained price stability.\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nA MORE BALANCED ECONOMY\nLet me start with where we are right now. The economy is clearly in a better place. Inflation\nhas fallen substantially, and the labor market has returned to a more sustainable path. And the\nrisks to our goals are now balanced. This is significant improvement from just two years ago.\nThis figure makes the point (Figure 1). Since March of 2022, when the FOMC began raising\ninterest rates, inflation has declined from over 7 percent at its peak to just over 2 percent in the\nmost recent readings. Inflation expectations—what people believe about the future—have\ncome down as well, confirming that households, businesses, and markets see the progress and\nbelieve the disinflationary process will continue.1\nAt the same time, the labor market has cooled. Most labor market indicators are now at or near\ntheir pre-pandemic values, and the unemployment rate is hovering around a level judged to be\nsustainable over the longer run.2 All this means that the labor market has largely normalized\nand is no longer a major source of inflation pressures.3\n1 Bundick and Smith (2024). The most recent data also show muted inflation expectations for the near term and\nlonger term; see, for example, the Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations data page\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations.\n2 See the FOMC’s September 2024 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) (Board of Governors 2024). The\nSeptember unemployment rate of 4.1 percent was a touch below the SEP median estimate of the natural\nunemployment rate of 4.2 percent.\n3 Lansing and Petrosky-Nadeau (2024; update pending for late October). See also Powell (2024).\n2\n\nFigure 1: Inflation and unemployment since January 2021\nRECALIBRATING POLICY\nOf course, as conditions improve, policy needs to adjust.\nRemember, during the fight to bring inflation down, the FOMC raised rates aggressively and\nkept monetary policy tight, historically so.4 And then each month that inflation and inflation\nexpectations fell, policy became tighter in real terms.\nSo, the FOMC needed to recalibrate, and did so at the September meeting. I see this\nrecalibration as “right-sizing,” recognizing the progress we’ve made and loosening the policy\nreins a bit, but not letting go. Even with this adjustment, policy remains restrictive, exerting\nadditional downward pressure on inflation to ensure it reaches 2 percent.\n4 The recent federal funds rate peak maintained from July 2023 through mid-September 2024 was at the highest\nlevel in over 20 years, since early 2001.\n3\n\nMaking these adjustments to match the economy we have is crucial. It prevents the mistake of\nover-tightening and ensures we are supporting both of our goals.\nContinued progress is not guaranteed. We must stay vigilant and be intentional, continually\nassessing the economy and balancing both of our mandated objectives: fully delivering on 2\npercent inflation while ensuring that the labor market remains in line with full employment.\nThat is a soft landing.\nBEYOND A SOFT LANDING\nBut as the dad in my neighborhood reminded us, this is only part of what people need. What\nhouseholds, businesses, and communities really want is a durable economy, with sustained\ngrowth, a good labor market, and low inflation.\nHigh inflation chipped away at real incomes and purchasing power, intensifying the challenges\nof overcoming pandemic disruptions.5 Everyone felt it. But the burden fell particularly hard on\nlow- and moderate-income families, who spend a disproportionate share of their resources on\nshelter, food, and fuel, where price increases have been especially large.6\nBusinesses have also struggled, especially small- and medium-sized firms that have been\nsaddled with back-to back challenges of pandemic closures, supply bottlenecks, labor shortages,\nand high inflation.7\nA durable and sustained expansion allows both families and businesses to recoup their losses\nand rebuild incomes and wealth that raise their economic well-being.8\nAnd all of this helps communities, which depend on households and businesses to thrive.\nSo, is a durable expansion possible?\nHistory says yes.\nAgain, the data tell the story (Figure 2). Compared to recent history, the current expansion is\nstill relatively young.\n5 Guerreiro et al. (2024), Stantcheva (2024).\n6 Klick and Stockburger (2024).\n7 See Chamber of Commerce (2023) and Federal Reserve Banks (2024).\n8 Real wages and incomes have been rising, but most households are yet to fully make up the earlier losses. See\nGuzman and Kollar (2024) and usual weekly earnings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\n(https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswktabs.htm).\n4\n\nFigure 2: Length of expansions\nI’ve had the benefit of working at the Federal Reserve during the two longest expansions on\nrecord—the 1990s and the pre-pandemic period. During both, remarkable things occurred.\nBusinesses thrived, workers got jobs, and gains in household earnings, income, and wealth were\nwidely shared.9\nThe expansion just prior to the pandemic was especially impressive: nearly 11 years, 10 years\nand 8 months to be precise, the longest on record. And I saw firsthand what the data tell us—\nsustainable growth with low inflation delivers opportunities.10\n9 For the details of the 1990s expansion, see various chapters in Krueger and Solow (2001).\n10 See Daly (2020) for details and a broader discussion in the context of long-term inequality trends and the role of\nthe Federal Reserve.\n5\n\nRobust labor markets brought a broader group of workers into jobs.11 More and more\nAmericans entered or reentered the labor force, wages and incomes rose, and inequality fell.12\nEven wealth gains were widely shared, with low net-worth families generally seeing the largest\ngrowth in their holdings.13 All of this meant better conditions for households and businesses\nacross the country.\nWe’ve already seen some of the same patterns play out in our current expansion. Labor force\nparticipation for prime-age workers has reached new highs.14 Earnings gaps between high- and\nlow-wage workers have closed somewhat.15 And after rising initially during the pandemic,\nhousehold income inequality has fallen back down more recently.16\nThe bottom line: sustained expansion helps all Americans.\nTHE ECONOMY WE DESERVE\nIn the coming months and years, there will almost certainly be economic bumps, disturbances,\nand scares. And the Federal Reserve cannot fully prevent shocks from having an impact. But\nbarring such events, and with the right monetary policy mix, we can help create the conditions\nfor enduring growth.\nThe most important trait in a central banker is the ability to look ahead. To keep an eye on\ntoday and an eye on tomorrow.\nThe work to achieve a soft landing is not fully done. And we are resolute to finish that job.\nBut that cannot be all we’re after.\nUltimately, we must strive for a world where people aren’t worried about inflation or the\neconomy. A world where people have time to catch up, and then to get ahead.\nThat, as I told the young father, is my version of victory. And that’s when I will consider the job\ntruly done.\n11 Aaronson et al. (2019).\n12 Aaronson et al. (2019), Robertson (2019), Guzman and Kollar (2024).\n13 Bhutta et al.

    "text": "FINAL\nA New Balancing Act: Monetary Policy Tradeoffs in a Changing World\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nInflation Targeting – Prospects and Challenges\nSponsored by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\nand the International Monetary Fund\nWellington, New Zealand\nAugust 29, 2019\n9:30AM NZT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nGood morning, and thank you for the opportunity to participate in this\nconference. This is my first trip to New Zealand, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed\ntouring about. I had the double bonus of seeing our good friends from\nCalifornia – New Zealanders actually – who returned home to Christchurch\nabout four years ago. In my travels so far, I can see why New Zealand is on\neveryone’s bucket list!\nI’m also delighted to be here in my capacity as president and CEO of the\nth\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco – and to help mark the 30\nanniversary of New Zealand’s commitment to an explicit inflation-targeting\nregime. It was the first of its kind and has influenced central banks around the\nworld.\nBut to be effective, monetary policymaking must continually evolve. We\nlive in a dynamic world that demands we remain humble about what we know\n– and curious about what we might learn.\n1\n\nFINAL\ndual\nNew Zealand is a great example of this. You haven’t been complacent\nand\nduring the past 30 years. Indeed, you recently moved to an explicit\nmandate – one that requires both price stability full employment.\nThis is a framework we have a lot of history with in the United States. So\nyou might think I will be providing some lessons from our experience with\nbalancing these two objectives.\nAnd I’d like to. But the situation isn’t that simple. The world has changed\nsince we first took on a dual mandate more than 40 years ago. And things are\ndifferent. In the United States, here in New Zealand, and in countries around\nthe world, a new – and less familiar – economic environment has emerged.\nOur collective futures now include slower potential growth, lower long-\nterm interest rates, and persistently weak inflation. This new landscape\ndemands we think differently about how to balance and achieve our price\nstability and full employment objectives.\nSo today, I will share how I’m thinking about these issues from my seat\nat the San Francisco Fed. But before I begin, let me say that the remarks I\nmake today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone\nelse within the Federal Reserve System.\nA New Economic Environment\nTo understand the new environment we face, we first have to look back\nto the past. And here I will use the United States as an example.\nWhen I started working at the Federal Reserve in 1996, I learned three\nimportant facts – the “deep” parameters of central banking (Figure 1).\n2\n\nFINAL\nFirst, the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy averages around 3.5\npercent. Second, the real neutral rate of interest – or r-star – also averages\n1\naround 3.5 percent in the United States. Third, unemployment and inflation\nare strongly linked through the Phillips curve.\nFast forward to 2019. These facts – these deep parameters – feel like a\ndistant memory (Figure 2). As of June, participants of the Federal Open\nMarket Committee put longer-run potential growth in the U.S. at about 1.9\npercent. Estimates of the long-run neutral rate of interest were penciled in at\n2\njust 0.5 percent. As for the Phillips curve… most arguments today center\naround whether it’s dead or just gravely ill. Either way, the relationship\nbetween unemployment and inflation has become very difficult to spot.\n1\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimate of real potential growth averaged 3.5 percent from 1949 to 1996\n(https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#11). Based on estimates from Laubach and\nWilliams (2003), the real neutral rate of interest averaged 3.9 percent from 1961 to 1996, with a decline\nevident in the early 1990s (https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar).\n2\nThe median of longer-run GDP growth in the June Summary of Economic Projections was 1.9 percent. The\nmedian of the longer-run real rate of interest was 0.5 p3e rcent. See Board of Governors (2019b).\n\nFINAL\nAlthough the numbers may be a little different, the changes I’ve\ndescribed are not unique to the United States. Global demographic shifts and\nlower productivity gains are tempering growth and reducing long-run interest\n3\nrates in many countries. And a number of central banks are finding that\ninflation is less responsive to labor market improvements than in the past.\nThese trends have important implications for monetary policy. Lower r-\nstar and the zero lower bound mean we’ll have less room to maneuver when\n4\nthe next downturn occurs. And the fainter signal coming from the Phillips\ncurve means we have less direct, real-time feedback about how monetary\npolicy is playing out in the economy.\nIn other words, the jobs of central banks have gotten harder.\nUncertainty and Tradeoffs\nWhen I lay out the backdrop I just described, I’m almost always asked\nt h e s a m e q u e s t i o n s . F i r s t, if inflation isn’t rising, can we run the economy as\n3\nHolston, Laubach, and Williams (2017).\n4\nOne of the lessons learned from the financial crisis and its aftermath is that alternative too ls like forward\nguidance and the balance sheet can be effective at stimulating economies. However, they’re still imperfect\nsubstitutes for the most effective tool at our disposal: t4ra ditional interest rate adjustments.\n\nFINAL\nhot as we want without consequence? And second, does monetary policy\nreally affect inflation anymore?\nLet me tackle the hot economy question first.\nDespite many years of trying, I’ve been unable to find evidence of a “free\nlunch.” Actions always have consequences, and there are always tradeoffs to\nconsider. Some are immediate, and some take time to develop.\nThe question is… what are the tradeoffs in today’s economic\nenvironment? If the normal tension between unemployment and inflation has\nweakened, how do we know whether we’ve achieved our full employment\nmandate?\nAgain I’ll turn to the U.S. experience. Our current expansion passed the\n10-year mark in July – a U.S. record. Unemployment has fallen from 10\npercent at its peak in October 2009 to near historic lows – just 3.7 percent in\nJuly. Other critical labor market indicators have also improved, including\nprime-age labor force participation, job-finding rates, wages, and income.\nThese improvements have been particularly notable for disadvantaged\n5\nworkers who often struggle to get a foothold in the workforce. Recent\n6\nresearch I’ve done with colleagues examines this pattern closely. We looked\ninto whether running a hot economy – compared with just a sustained\nexpansion – provides extra benefits to marginalized groups.\nWe found that, when the unemployment rate drops below what is\nthought to be its long-run sustainable level, the benefits to marginalized\ngroups increase. Said simply, the gains to running a hot economy\nd i s p r o p o r t i o n a t e l y f l o w to groups that are historically less advantaged.\n5\nPetrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n6\nAaronson et al. (2019). 5\n\nFINAL\nThese findings are echoed in the comments we hear from workforce\ndevelopment and community leaders. They tell us that the current hot\neconomy has allowed many of their constituents to get a second look from\n7\nemployers.\nThis outcome is intuitive. When labor markets are tight and firms are\ncompeting for workers, they find new ways to fill jobs. They recruit more\nintensively, adjust hiring standards, and look to a broader pool of potential\n8\nemployees. These conditions create more opportunities for disadvantaged\ngroups.\nAll of this means that assigning too much weight to our projections of\nthe long-run sustainable rate of unemployment – or u-star – risks\nundershooting what the labor market can really deliver. Indeed, central banks\nin the United States and other countries have been marking down their\n9\nestimates of u-star as unemployment rates have fallen. And recent research\nin the United States and here in New Zealand points to non-inflationary rates\nof unemployment that are even lower than current estimates of the natural\n10\nrate would imply.\nBut as I said before… there is no free lunch. There are potential\nconsequences to running a hot economy we need to consider.\nFor instance, an overly tight labor market might encourage businesses\nand workers to make decisions that have negative long-term effects on\n7\nPowell (2019).\n8\nThis insight was originally documented in Okun (1973). This type of behavior is documented more recently\nin Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013), Leduc and Liu (2019 forthcoming), Abraham and Haltiwanger\n(2019), and Modestino, Shoag, and Ballance (2016).\n9\nIn 2012, the FOMC Summary of Econ omic Projections put the longer-run unemployment rate between 5.2\nand 6 percent (Board of Governors 2012). In June 2019, the median estimate of u-star had fallen to 4.2\npercent (Board of Governors 2019b).\n10\nPetrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019), Crump et al. (260 19), and Jacob and Wong (2018).\n\nFINAL\npotential output. Some research has found that persistently strong economic\nconditions can pull young people out of school – a choice that may undermine\n11\ntheir future job prospects and earning potential. And anecdotal evidence\nsuggests that firms may reduce investments in employee training and skill\ndevelopment to reduce the costs of rapid employee turnover.\nWe also have to think about how running the economy hotter affects\nfinancial stability. If interest rates get too low, and borrowing becomes too\neasy, imbalances in financial markets could once again develop. In the United\nStates, I’m closely watching the high level of corporate debt, particularly\namong riskier firms. While I don’t view current corporate indebtedness as\nposing an acute financial stability risk, this vulnerability could amplify the\nmacroeconomic impact of any shocks to the economy.\nSo we need to stay vigilant. But for now, the latest Federal Reserve\nFinancial Stability Report judges that the U.S. financial sector remains\n12\nresilient. And if vulnerabilities were to increase further, there are\ninstruments such as the countercyclical capital buffer that we might want to\nconsider before making monetary policy more restrictive.\nPutting this all together, where do I come out on the tradeoffs of\nrunning a hot economy? Right now, with little inflationary pressure and\nconsiderable uncertainty about the threshold for full employment, I’m biased\ntowards including as many workers as possible in the expansion.\n11\n12\nCharles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo (2018), and Cascio and Narayan (2019).\nBoard of Governors (2019a).\n7\n\nFINAL\nEvery Tenth Counts\nNow let me turn to the second question: Can monetary policy still affect\ninflation?\nLooking at the data does give one pause. Inflation rates in many\ncountries have remained stubbornly below 2 percent for more than a decade.\nThis is despite considerable monetary stimulus and relatively healthy labor\nmarkets.\nNow, some would argue that these misses are not really meaningful –\njust a couple of tenths. But in our new economic environment, every tenth\ncounts. There are a number of difficulties that could arise with persistent\nmisses on our 2 percent goal.\nOne of the most important benefits of inflation targeting was that it\nresulted in well-anchored inflation expectations. Households and firms\nbecame willing to smooth through idiosyncratic price shocks rather than\nincorporate them into wage demands or long-term contracts. This success is\nreflected in the research that shows expectations, rather than past inflation,\n13\nhave become the key determinant of future inflation.\nBut like most things, expectations can cut both ways. If we consistently\nfall short of our inflation target, expectations will drift down. We’re already\nseeing signs of softness in survey- and market-based measures of longer-run\n14\ninflation expectations.\nPersistent misses on inflation will make the public more likely to\nincorporate these delivered outcomes into their plans. The anchor we worked\n13\nJordà et al. (2019) and IMF (2013).\n14\nNechio (2015) and Lansing (2018). 8\n\nFINAL\ntalk\ndeliver\nso hard to achieve will move from the 2 percent target we about to the\nless-than-2 percent inflation we .\nThis is particularly worrisome given the proximity of the effective lower\nbound. Below-target inflation translates directly into less policy space to offset\nnegative economic shocks. In very practical terms, if inflation expectations are\na quarter point below our target when the next downturn arrives – and so are\nnominal interest rates – that’s one less rate cut at our disposal.\nMonetary Policy in a Changing World\nLooking ahead, persistently low inflation presents a new problem for\nmonetary policymakers.\nThirty years ago, central banks around the world needed to tamp down\nrising inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand responded by boldly\nintroducing inflation targeting as a new monetary policy framework. Others\nquickly followed. These flexible inflation-targeting regimes played a large role\nin bringing inflation under control and in anchoring inflation expectations.\nbelow\nToday, we’re fighting a different battle. We’re fighting inflation from\nour target. This final figure (Figure 3) shows how dramatic the change\nhas been.\n9\n\nFINAL\nAs central bankers, we have to ask ourselves: Are we powerless to\nrespond to these new dynamics? Or do we simply need new tools?\nOur current tool, flexible inflation targeting, is by design forgetful. It lets\nbygones be bygones and makes no attempt to make up for past inflation\nmisses. This worked well when inflation shocks were tilted to the upside and\nwe had plenty of policy space to offset unwanted increases.\nIn our new world of low inflation and low r-star, this approach has clear\nchallenges. It runs the risk of repeatedly delivering below-target inflation\nduring expansions, and leaving the economy with even less policy space when\nthe next downturn hits.\nAlternative strategies such as average inflation targeting and price-level\nand nominal income targeting explicitly include a make-up strategy. They\nensure inflation misses balance out over time. While no magic bullet, these\n10\n\nFINAL\nmake-up approaches recognize that we’ll need to be intentional – rather than\n15\nopportunistic – about offsetting inflation underruns.\nOf course, any changes in our monetary policy framework require\ncareful and deliberate thought. The current approach has been effective in\nkeeping inflation low and steady through good times and bad. So the bar for\nchange should be high.\nBut the future looks different than the past. And much like 30 years ago,\nthe world we face today requires us to consider bold action. For now, we must\nfully use the tools we have. And looking ahead, we must adapt our monetary\npolicy frameworks to deliver on the mandates we’re committed to: full\nemployment and price stability.\nConclusion\nThere’s no question that our world has changed tremendously in recent\nyears. And these changes have created challenges that we’re still learning how\nto address. But we’re working from strong foundations. Foundations that the\nReserve Bank of New Zealand helped lay down 30 years ago.\nI look forward to figuring out where we go next with you.\nThank you.\n15 Svensson (1999), Nessén and Vestin (2005), Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019), and Mertens and Williams\n(2019).\n11\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., MBraoroyk Cin. gDsa Plya, pWerisll ioanm E Wcoansocmheicr ,A acntidv iDtyavid W.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nArizona State University Economic Forecast Luncheon Virtual Event\nTempe, AZ\nDecember 1, 2020\n11:15AM MT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nHello everyone. Thank you for the invitation to join you today.\nIt’s safe to say that 2020 has been a year to remember. Twelve months\nago, we were in the midst of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.\nUnemployment sat near historic lows, wages and incomes were rising, and\ninflation was moving gradually back toward our 2 percent target.\nThen COVID-19 hit our shores. And our fortunes changed almost\novernight. To date, more than 250,000 Americans have died and countless\nothers have been sick. People have lost jobs, businesses, and livelihoods, and\nthe burden has fallen most harshly on those least able to bear it. This is an\nenormous human toll.\nAlthough we’ve retraced some of the initial economic losses, the\neconomy remains far below the levels of employment and output we had prior\nto COVID-19. And coronavirus cases are once again surging.\n1\n\nFINAL\nSo today, I will discuss two important questions. What lessons should\nwe take from this difficult year? And what priorities should we focus on in\n2021?\nBut let me first remind you that the remarks I’m delivering today are my\nown, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the\nFederal Reserve System.\n2020 lessons\nLet’s begin by considering the lessons learned from 2020. There are\nmany, but I will focus on those related to the economy and how it functions.\nLessons that can help us build a more prosperous and resilient future.\nThe first lesson is that we are all interconnected. Our fates are tied\ntogether — as individuals, as communities, as states, and as a nation.\nCOVID-19 has exposed this connectivity in stark relief. I think about my\nown community, Oakland, California. So many businesses in my neighborhood\nhave had to shutter to fight the virus. Without income, these businesses\nhaven’t been able to pay their rent. This has passed through to landlords,\nwho’ve then had trouble paying the mortgages on the buildings they own. This\nthen spilled onto banks, who had to cover the forbearance or loss, leaving\nthem with fewer funds to lend to other businesses looking for a lifeline. And\non and on it goes. The circular flow we all learned about in Economics 101 is\nreal.\nBut while we are all interconnected, COVID-19 has reminded us that the\nimpact of economic shocks does not fall equally. That’s the second important\nlesson from this year. Not everyone has the same experiences in our society.\n2\n\nFINAL\nAnd far too often these differences in outcomes trace back to race, ethnicity,\ngender, or socioeconomic position.\nYou can see this in the data on COVID. A disproportionate share of\npandemic job losses have occurred among men and women of color.1 Mothers\nwith children at home have had to leave the labor force altogether to provide\nschooling and child care.2 And low and moderate income communities across\nthe country have seen an outsized decline in income and wealth at the same\ntime that the basic needs of their citizens have risen.3\nOf course, these are not new issues. But the lens of COVID has vividly\nand painfully highlighted their costs.\nAnd this leads me to my third lesson of 2020. We are limiting our\neconomic prosperity. Persistent and pervasive differences in outcomes\nrepeatedly leave talent on the table and cost our economy.4\nLooking only at differences in outcomes by race, a recent report found\nthat aggregate economic output since 2000 would have been $16 trillion\nhigher if Black and white Americans had more equal education and wages. To\nput this in growth terms, the U.S. economy would have grown about two-\ntenths of a percentage point faster every year since 2000 if these gaps had\nbeen closed. 5\nAnd racial differences in education and wages are only some of the gaps\nin our society. Differences in credit, wealth, and occupational and investment\nopportunities by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status cumulate to mean\n1 Gould and Wilson (2020), Kochhar (2020).\n2 Edwards (2020).\n3 Shrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020).\n4 Cook (2020), Bostic (2020), Hsieh et al. (2019), Daly (2019a).\n5 Peterson and Mann (2020).\n3\n\nFINAL\nless innovation, lower productivity, and ultimately slower growth for\neveryone.6\n2021 priorities\nSo what do these lessons imply for policy priorities going forward?\nThere are many to consider, but today I will focus on the ones related to\nmonetary policy and the Federal Reserve.\nSustain the bridge\nAn important precondition for continued economic recovery is that the\nvirus be well contained. Unfortunately, the public health trajectory is very\nworrisome, with COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths trending higher\nacross the country.\nSo the Federal Reserve’s first priority is to use its tools to help bridge\nthe economy across the disruptions caused by the virus. This means keeping\nthe federal funds rate near zero and continuing to perform our lender of last\nresort responsibilities.7\nOur commitment to maintaining this accommodative stance until the\neconomy is back on stable footing lowers borrowing costs for households,\n6 Cook (2014), Cook and Gerson (2019), Hsieh et al. (2019), Matthews and Wilson (2018),\nPeterson and Mann (2020).\n7 The Federal Reserve established a broad set of emergency lending facilities in March 2020\n(Powell 2020). Funding for these programs via the U.S. Department of the Treasury is\nslated to expire at the end of 2020, and the Federal Reserve has announced plans to return\nthe unused portions of the funds allocated to the CARES Act facilities\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/foia/letter-from-chair-powell-to-secretary-mnuchin-\n20201120.htm). As noted there, the Federal Reserve retains additional financing options\nvia the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n4\n\nFINAL\nbusinesses, and state and local governments.8 And so far our policies are\nworking. Interest rate-sensitive sectors, like housing and autos, have\nrebounded sharply in the past six months. Individuals and businesses have\nbeen able to refinance debt, initiate new loans, and make investments, which\nhas kept more workers employed in the economy. This translates into\nstronger income and consumption growth for millions of Americans.\nBut we must stay vigilant. So the Fed will be ready to respond with our\nfull range of policy tools until COVID-19 is behind us.\nReturn to full employment and sustainable 2 percent inflation\nThen the real work will begin. COVID-19 will leave a deep hole, and it\nwill take ongoing monetary policy support to bring us back to full\nemployment and average 2 percent inflation.\nSo what will that look like? The fundamental road map can be found in\nthe FOMC’s new monetary policy strategy announced in late August.9 That\ndocument acknowledged that maximum employment is not a fixed target. It is\na broad-based and inclusive goal that changes as the economy evolves. The\nstrategy also clarified that achieving our price stability goal—average inflation\nof 2 percent—requires a new regime: flexible average inflation targeting. In\npractice, this means we will be willing to accept periods of moderately above\n2 percent inflation, in order to offset sustained periods of below 2 percent\ninflation.\nUsing this strategy document, the FOMC released forward guidance in\nSeptember, saying that we expect to keep the target range for the federal\n8 Board of Governors (2020a, b).\n9 Board of Governors (2020c).\n5\n\nFINAL\nfunds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until labor market conditions have reached levels\nconsistent with maximum employment, and inflation is on track to moderately\nexceed 2 percent for some time. This approach will support the economic\nrecovery and the Fed’s dual mandate goals.\nRemember that our tools are powerful\nSo what could get in our way? History points to one important thing:\ndoubts that our tools are powerful enough to achieve our goals.10\nA full and true recovery from COVID-19 will most likely be protracted.\nAnd it will be tempting, as time passes, to think that monetary policy has done\nall that it can. That we no longer have a role to play.\nWe saw this in the last recovery. There were concerns among some that\nthe Federal Reserve was overstepping its role and using monetary policy to\ninfluence long-standing structural problems like skills gaps and permanent\njob dislocation.11 But the data did not support those fears, and monetary\npolicy remained accommodative. The result was the longest expansion in U.S.\nhistory, a historically low unemployment rate, and a significant narrowing of\nwage, income, and wealth gaps in the economy.12\nThe priority going forward will be to remember. To remember that\nworkers and firms are flexible, people are resilient, and with a strong\neconomy the labor market is more durable and elastic than we think. To\nremember that, by supporting strong and sustained growth, monetary policy\ncan help deliver the full employment outcomes we desire.\n10 Romer and Romer (2013).\n11 Kocherlakota (2010), Lacker (2012), and Phelps (2008). Daly et al. (2012) provide an\nalternative view.\n12 Aaronson et al. (2019), Robertson (2019), Semega et al. (2020), Bhutta et al. (2020).\n6\n\nFINAL\nOf course, the temptation to think we are powerless will be even greater\nfor inflation. After all, we only occasionally brushed against our 2 percent\ntarget in a nearly 11-year expansion. But decades of research have repeatedly\nshown that inflation in the long run is primarily determined by monetary\npolicy—and central banks have the ability to control where it settles.\nOur primary tool for achieving our inflation goal is our credibility. And\nhere the move to flexible average inflation targeting is powerful. It tells\nhouseholds and businesses that we are fully committed to delivering 2\npercent inflation over time and ensures that inflation expectations remain\nwell-anchored around our target.\nGoing forward, we will need to match these statements with our\npolicies. Hitting or exceeding 2 percent inflation for a few months does not\nmean victory. To fully achieve the goal of price stability, we need to see a\nsustained period of moderately above-target inflation. Only then will the job\nbe complete.\nSo again, we will need to remember. Remember that inflation is always\nand everywhere a monetary phenomenon.13 That even when progress is\ngradual the central bank can, with commitment, bring inflation sustainably to\ntarget.\nEnsure that we can finish\nNow the implications of my remarks thus far are that policy rates will\nlikely be lower for longer. This naturally raises concerns about financial\nstability. In such a low rate environment, investors could reach for yield, asset\n13 Friedman (1970), p. 24.\n7\n\nFINAL\nmarkets could inflate, and the banking and broader financial system might\nfind itself ill prepared to cope should the economy falter.\nWhile these risks cannot be dismissed, it is not at all clear that\nconventional monetary policy is the best way to mitigate them. Interest rates\nare a blunt tool. Moving them to combat financial imbalances has limited\nupsides and potentially significant downsides, such as derailing an expansion\nand leaving us short of our maximum employment and price stability goals.14\nOther, better methods include tools directly targeted on the financial\nsystem. Over the past decade, regulators around the globe have developed and\nstrengthened a suite of micro and macro prudential programs designed to\nkeep financial firms well capitalized over the business cycle.15 In the United\nStates, these include capital and liquidity stress-testing and tools like the\ncountercyclical capital buffer and the stress capital buffer. The Fed also has\nthe power to restrict banks from paying dividends or doing share buybacks\nwhen capital could be at risk, as recently executed in response to the\npandemic.\nAll of these policies are built on the recognition that well-capitalized\nbanks are critical to a healthy financial system and that the best capital banks\ncan get is the capital that they already have.\nIn coming years, we will need to continue to build out and strengthen\nour suite of tools to further mitigate risk. The financial system and the\neconomy are constantly changing, and regulatory principles and supervisory\napproaches must evolve to keep pace. It’s easy to see where more may be\nneeded. A growing share of financial intermediation in the U.S. takes place\n14 Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015), Bernanke (2015), Svensson (2015).\n15 Yilla and Liang (2020), Williams (2015).\n8\n\nFINAL\noutside of the formal banking system. Understanding this evolution and how it\nimpacts financial stability is critical.16 The rising frequency of devastating\nweather events also demands attention. It highlights the need for further\nwork on climate risk and how it will affect the financial system and the\nbroader economy.17\nEnsure that our work helps everyone\nFinally, we will need to do more to ensure that the benefits of low\ninterest rates and rising asset valuations can spread widely throughout the\neconomy.\nThe COVID-19 response made it clear that our interest rate policies and\nlending programs do not reach everyone equally. Many businesses and\nhouseholds are outside of the traditional banking system and do not have the\nsame opportunities to refinance or initiate loans.18 We’ve heard repeatedly in\nthe 12th District and across the country that these differences hampered the\npandemic relief, slowing its delivery to many in need.\nTo solve these issues, and increase the reach of the financial\ninfrastructure, we will need to think outside of the traditional banking box.\nThis could mean developing firmer partnerships with Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions and other nonprofit or small dollar\nlenders. These institutions are already connected to low- and moderate-\nincome communities and are innovating to improve their reach among those\nmost in need. It could also mean taking lessons from recent months and\n16 U.S. Department of the Treasury (2020).\n17 Brainard (2019) and Daly (2019b).\n18 Shrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020) and Liu and Parilla (2020).\n9\n\nFINAL\ndeveloping blueprints for lending relief programs that can be more equitably\ndeployed next time they are needed.\nThe bottom line is clear. Building safe and sound ways to increase\nfinancial support to all Americans needs to be a top priority.19, 20\nSumming up\nThere is no doubt that 2020 has been a challenging year. It’s reversed so\nmuch of the economic progress we made in the last expansion, and\nhighlighted and magnified the persistent and systemic barriers that prevent\nus from reaching our potential.\nBut it’s also brought us clarity. Clarity of priorities and clarity of\npurpose.\nAs we close this year and move on to the next, let’s bring that thread\nwith us. The path will not be easy and the journey will not be short. But if we\nalign together and use all of our tools, we will complete the job.\nAnd this is what 2021 demands of us.\nThank you.\n19 Hangen and Swack (2020).\n20 Opportunity Fund (2018).\n10\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNational Press Club Virtual Event\nWashington, DC\nJune 15, 2020\n12:30PM EST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nHello, everyone. Thank you for the invitation to join all of you, especially\nat this critical time in our country. Today’s challenges require everyone’s best\nthinking, and dialogues like the ones hosted here play a crucial role in\nnavigating our way toward a better future.\nOf course, our challenges are many right now.\nCOVID-19 has taken a tremendous toll on American life. Just a few\nweeks ago, the United States passed a grim marker – one hundred thousand\nCOVID-related deaths.\nTo mitigate the spread of the virus, large portions of the country paused\nall but essential economic activity for more than two months. The magnitude\nof this sacrifice is unprecedented in our modern history – more than 20\nmillion workers pushed into unemployment, millions more out of the labor\nforce altogether, and countless businesses shuttered, some forever.\nIn both health and economic terms, the costs have fallen most heavily on\nthose who are least able to bear them. Low-income communities have been\n1\n\nFINAL\n1\ndisproportionately burdened by COVID-19. Job losses have been\nconcentrated among those with less than a college education, people of color,\npeople with disabilities, immigrants, and others. And the past three weeks\nhave served as a painful reminder that these are far from the only inequities\nin our country. Tensions and unrest around instances of police brutality,\nstructural racism, and systemic injustice have flared nationwide.\nThree crises – health, economic, and social – are converging into one\ndifficult moment in American history. It forces each of us to reflect and\nconsider who we are, as individuals and as a collective. And it will require\nthose of us in leadership positions to take bold action if we’re going to chart a\ncourse through this turmoil and on to a better future.\nToday, I will primarily discuss our economic challenges and what bold\naction could look like in that space. And while economic equity is only part of\nthe solution we need to craft, it will provide an essential foundation for\nmaking progress on health and social inequities as well.\nBut before I go further, let me give the standard disclaimer: my remarks\ntoday are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.\nBridging the coronavirus\nSo let’s talk first about what the economic challenges we’re facing look\nlike.\nWe began this year in the midst of the longest economic expansion in\nAmerican history. While it felt slow at times and didn’t reach every\n1\nShrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020), Cajner 2e t al. (2020).\n\nFINAL\ncommunity to the same degree, we nonetheless experienced more than 10\nyears of growth. Then the coronavirus reached our shores, and a decade of\neconomic progress was erased in a matter of months.\nIn response to this shock, both monetary and fiscal policymakers moved\nquickly to deliver emergency support to households and businesses disrupted\nby the virus.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we cut the federal funds rate to essentially zero\nand used our lender of last resort powers to provide liquidity to volatile\nfinancial markets. With assistance from the Treasury, we also provided more\ndirect support for households, businesses, and state and local governments.\nThese actions have helped ease market pressures and ensured the smooth\n2\nflow of funding and credit that is so vital to our economy.\nOur decisions were firmly rooted in lessons from history. The measures\nthe Fed took during and after the Great Recession a decade ago taught us how\nto respond even faster and more forcefully to COVID-19.\nLessons from the Great Depression also loomed large. The mistakes\nmade in the 1930s underscore the importance of a rapid and forceful\nmonetary policy response when crises occur. The severe hardship during that\ndecade would have been much less acute had monetary policy been more\n3\naccommodative earlier.\nFiscal policymakers also took swift and bold action. Congress and the\nWhite House approved several rounds of economic relief, collectively worth\nalmost three trillion dollars. The aid was broad-based and included expanding\nand enhancing unemployment insurance, giving cash payments to most\n2\nBoard of Governors (2020), Powell (2020).\n3\nBernanke (2002). 3\n\nFINAL\nhouseholds, and providing direct support to small businesses through a\n4\nforgivable loan program.\nTaken together, these monetary and fiscal measures are helping to\nbridge our people and our economy through the immediate hardships caused\nby COVID-19. And that’s the intent – to provide emergency relief so that we\ncan emerge from the crisis on the best possible footing and expand more\nrapidly when the virus is safely controlled or behind us.\nOf course, no one knows right now if these emergency actions will be\nsufficient, or if more relief will be needed. The virus, and how quickly we are\nable to manage it, will determine the length of the bridge we need to build.\nspeed\nWe’ll need to be flexible and responsive as the situation evolves – and\nCommitment\nprepared to do more, if more is needed. Because of action alone isn’t\nenough. to action over the long term is essential to ensuring a\nsustainable recovery.\nA decade is too long\nThe hardest lesson from both the Great Depression and the Great\nRecession is that it took a decade to dig out. A decade for the economy to fully\nrecover and for the benefits of growth to reach all of those displaced by the\nshock.\nThe Great Depression began in 1929. And in 1939, overall employment\nwas still below its pre-depression peak, leaving many workers and families\nstranded and struggling 10 years later.\n4\nSee Wilson (2020) for a discussion of its pot4e ntial economic impact.\n\nFINAL\nThe employment recovery following the Great Recession was faster, but\nthe gains were uneven. In 2018, household incomes for the bottom 20 percent\nof households were still lower than their pre-recession peak more than a\n5\ndecade earlier.\nWhat do we learn from this? A decade is too long. We can’t wait 10 years\nfor an economic recovery to reach everyone.\nSome people might argue that our ability to reverse these patterns is\nlimited. That in present times, the post-virus economy will be so different that\nnot everyone will be able to adapt. That we should expect some dislocations to\nremain.\nAnd it’s certainly true that many of the recent job losses are likely to be\n6\npermanent. But we heard similar arguments during the Great Recession –\nthat we should expect unemployment to remain permanently elevated well\nabove its prior levels. The thinking was that unemployment approaching 10\npercent was due in large part to permanent or structural factors, rather than\n7\ntemporary cyclical disruptions.\nThe subsequent expansion proved that these arguments were wrong.\nUnemployment approached 50-year lows, while inflation remained subdued.\nWe discovered that the labor market was much more flexible than we thought\n– and that finding maximum employment experientially, rather than\ntheoretically, yields a higher number than almost anyone thought possible.\n5\nSemega et al. (2019).\n6\n7\nBarrero, Bloom, and Davis (2020).\nSee for example Kocherlakota (2010), Lacker (2012), and Phelps (2008). Daly et al.\n(2012) provide an alternative view. 5\n\nFINAL\nMoreover, we found – in the data, and in our conversations with\nbusiness and community leaders – that letting the economy run past what we\nthought was possible has tremendous benefits, especially for less advantaged\n8\ngroups. Individuals who were previously seen as less employable – such as\nthose with less education or experience – were able to get a foothold when\n9\neconomic conditions were sufficiently strong.\nThose same groups – who only lately got a chance to experience the\nbenefits of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history – are now among\n10\nthe hardest hit as we respond to COVID-19. And this is not a new\nphenomenon. As in so many previous economic cycles, those least advantaged\nin the labor market are the first to be let go when conditions deteriorate, and\n11\nthe last to be hired when conditions improve.\nUnless we build the foundations for a sustained and robust recovery, we\nrisk losing these individuals – from the labor force, and perhaps even from the\n12\nmainstream of economic life.\nThis isn’t just about fairness – although that’s clearly important. Low\nemployment risks letting many people sit idle, sidelined from work and\nparticipation in economic life. This limits growth and pulls at the health of our\ncommunities.\nWe have to commit – now – to not letting this happen. Any plan for long-\nt e r m e c o n o m i c r e c o v e r y has to include the people we welcomed into\n8\nSee the discussion of the “Fed Listens” initiative on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-\nmonetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm\n9\nAaronson et al. (2019), Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n10\n11\nCajner et al. (202 0).\nCouch and Fairlie (2010), Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller (2012).\n12\nKrueger (2017). 6\n\nFINAL\nemployment during the expansion. This must be the measuring stick we hold\nourselves to.\nThe path forward\nWith this goal in mind, what should our path forward look like? The\nanswer isn’t simple, and it can’t be achieved by any one institution alone.\nAt the Federal Reserve, I expect our current stance of highly\naccommodative monetary policy to continue until the economy has largely\nrecovered what’s been lost due to the virus. Getting back on track to achieving\nour congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price\nstability is our top priority. And with the current low inflation environment\nexpected to continue, we can once again search for the upside potential of our\nfull employment goal.\nBut monetary policy can’t help the U.S. economy reach its full potential\non its own. We also need fiscal policymakers to commit to sustained\ninvestments in our economic future. The need for this was evident before the\n13\ncrisis, and it’s even more evident now.\nIncreasing investments may sound like a surprising recommendation.\nAfter all, we’ve already spent trillions of dollars in emergency economic relief.\nAnd this has occurred at a time when the federal debt was already at\n14\nhistorically high levels.\nBut the key word there is “emergency.” These actions were taken to\nkeep households and businesses solvent in the midst of the crisis. Much more\n13\nSee Elmendorf and Dynan (2020) for a related discussion recorded before the U.S. virus\noutbreak.\n14\nCongressional Budget Office (2020). 7\n\nFINAL\nwill be needed in order to build a strong economic foundation that will allow a\nfull recovery and sustained expansion.\ncomposition\nNow let me be clear: I’m not just advocating for increased public\nspending and debt. The of spending is crucial. We need to focus\non investments that leverage the talent of everyone and contribute to the\neconomy’s long-term growth prospects. In this case, inclusive growth is faster\ngrowth – and it will pay for itself in the long run.\nAnd now is an especially good time to take on this type of debt. Even\nbefore the crisis, we were in an environment of low interest rates – and that is\n15\nexpected to continue for the foreseeable future. This makes public spending\nrelatively inexpensive and easy to finance.\nThe payoff is potentially huge. Public works programs during the Great\nDepression re-employed many of those hardest hit by the downturn and made\nlasting improvements in the nation’s infrastructure that boosted our\n16\neconomy’s potential output. The GI Bill following World War II helped\n17\neducate a generation and set the stage for rapid postwar growth. And the\nconstruction of the interstate highway system created jobs while laying the\n18\ngroundwork for our modern economy.\n15\n16\nWilliams (2018), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\nSee, for example, Kline and Moretti (2014).\n17\nBound and Turner (2002), Fernald and Jones (2014).\n18\nFernald (1999). See also Leduc and Wilson (2012) for the effects of road spending\nfollowing the Great Recession. 8\n\nFINAL\nOpportunity infrastructure\nSo what should today’s investments look like? The greatest need is for\nwhat I’ll call “opportunity infrastructure” – the building blocks that help\nindividuals maximize their potential.\nFirst, we need to invest in people’s health. The coronavirus exposed\nexisting inequities in both health outcomes and access to health care.\nStructural factors related to race, location, and income have created\ndisparities that leave less advantaged communities more vulnerable to health\nshocks. And when those shocks come, access to health care can be\n19\nprohibitively expensive, or not available at all.\nA healthy economy requires healthy people who can live, and work, and\ncontribute to our society. Investing in health infrastructure, access, and care\nwill both improve individual outcomes and help create a more productive\nlabor force.\nNext, we need to invest in the full life cycle of education. Education is\nthe best form of insurance against unemployment. We’ve seen this in the\nrecent job losses, which were much less severe for those with college degrees.\nEducational investments should begin with early childhood education\nthat helps kids develop and allows parents to pursue employment without\n20\nmaking difficult tradeoffs. We should also focus on making higher education\nmore accessible, and encouraging students to enroll in and complete college.\nOf course, lifelong learning also means bolstering access to schooling and\nskills training to help workers displaced by economic shocks like COVID-19.\n19\nShrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020).\n20\nHeckman, Pinto, and Savelyev (2013), Shrimali, Mattiuzzi, and Choi (2020), Grunewald\n(2020). 9\n\nFINAL\nThese investments boost employment, labor force participation, and ensure\n21\nour nation’s long-term global competitiveness.\nFinally, we need to invest in digital infrastructure so that we can expand\naccess to opportunity and create more economic resiliency. As shelter-in-\nplace became the norm around the country in March, being able to get online\nwas a crucial determinant of people’s ability to continue engaging in the\n22\nworkplace and in the classroom.\nJobs and education are only going to become more reliant on technology\nin the months and years ahead. And the “digital divide” means those without\nadequate connectivity will struggle to be full participants in our future\n23\neconomy. We need to close this gap in order to maximize our economic\npotential.\nWe can’t afford not to\nThe coronavirus is the largest economic shock most of us have\nexperienced in our lives. It’s taken a tremendous toll on all of us. But the\ninequities it exposed – and often magnified – have been with us for a long\ntime.\nRight now, not everyone gets the same chance to succeed in our\ncountry. And it’s not for lack of trying – it’s for lack of opportunity. Our\nBut we don’t have to accept this.\nsystem, whether we meant it to be or not, is set up that way.\n2\n22\n1\nSee the discussion in Daly ( 2 019).\nGao (2020).\n23\nGoss, Lee, and Gao (2019). 10\n\nFINAL\nOur nation’s economic health, physical health, and societal health are all\nintertwined. And while addressing our economic challenges alone can’t solve\nthe health and social issues we’re facing, it can certainly help.\nWe find ourselves at an inflection point. A moment when crises\nconverge, and a once-in-a-generation opportunity presents itself. The choices\nwe make today will define our future path.\nWe have to choose long-term growth. We have to choose equitable\nopportunity. We have to choose inclusive success.\nWe can’t afford not to.\nThank you.\n11\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C.

    "text": "Version Two\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of San Francisco School of Management Commencement\nSan Francisco, CA\nMay 17, 2024\n9:15 a.m. PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThis speech is dedicated to Gene and Jane Wagner and everyone who ever helped someone find\ntheir way.\nThank you for your kind introduction. And thank you, Father Fitzgerald, for the invitation to\nspeak here today. It is truly my honor.\nNow before I begin, I want to ask, how many of you missed your high school graduation\nceremony because of the pandemic? Raise your hands.\nI see a lot of hands.\nSo, the very first thing I want you to do is to take a moment to really appreciate that you’re here\nnow, in person, celebrating what you have achieved. You are resilient, and we are so proud of\nyou.\nAnd to all the family, friends, faculty, and everyone else who helped make this day possible.\nThank you. You have done an amazing service for us all.\nToday, I’d like to share two stories. Actually, one story told two ways.\nHere is version 1.\nWhen I was 15, I dropped out of high school to help support my family. I had odd jobs, and my\ngoal was to be a bus driver, because it came with union wages and good benefits. But I got\n\nlucky. I met a mentor, and she encouraged me to think bigger. To get a GED and go to college.\nSo, I did. I got a degree in economics and philosophy and went on to get a Ph.D. In 1996, I got a\njob as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Now, 28 years later, I’m\nstanding in front of you as President and CEO of that very institution.\nThat story is true. It’s meaningful. And it’s comfortable.\nIt’s also incomplete.\nSo, let me try again. And give you version 2.\nWhen I was 15, my family stumbled. My siblings moved in with my grandparents and I moved in\nwith friends. I left high school and got a job—three, actually. I drove a donut truck, worked at a\ndeli, and worked at a Target. I wanted to be a bus driver so I could have one job instead of\nthree.\nI was struggling.\nSo, a friend introduced me to a woman named Betsy. Betsy was kind and practical. She\nencouraged me to get a GED. As it turns out, you can’t be a bus driver without one.\nSo, I said yes.\nBut when I went to take the test, I was nervous, terrified really. I kept sweating on my test\npaper and breaking my pencil lead.\nAll I could think about was failing. Disappointing Betsy. Not being a bus driver. Not being\nanything close to a success.\nI wanted to quit, leave the test. Fortunately, I didn’t.\nNow, I’d like to tell you that with age and experience, fears of failing, disappointing, and\nchanging course go away. But that’s not how life works.\nAfter college, I went straight to graduate school, at the University of Illinois. I didn’t even think,\nI just went. I’d graduated at the top of my economics class and it seemed expected, natural.\nBut after a year, I felt unsure. Unsure if I wanted a Ph.D. Unsure if I wanted to be an economist.\nUnsure if I wanted to be a researcher.\nEvery day, I thought about changing. Switching programs, getting a job, doing anything\ndifferent than what I’d signed up for. Starting again.\nBut the stakes seemed high.\n2\n\nAfter all, the University of Illinois was Betsy’s alma mater. My undergraduate economics\nprofessors were so proud that I had followed in their footsteps to get a Ph.D. And my friends\nseemed confident, on track, and on their way to success.\nChanging my mind, changing course, felt weighty, irreversible, definitely like going backwards.\nBut I pivoted anyway.\nI moved to Chicago. I went to work for a theater and a dance company. I did accounting,\nbusiness, and even some prop and set design. I loved it.\nThen about a year into my new life, I realized it wasn’t perfect. I missed economics. I missed\nresearch and working with others to solve hard problems. I missed gathering evidence and\nevaluating it to inform policy. I missed everything. Because economics, as it turned out, was my\ncalling, my vocation. And I wanted to go back.\nBut that’s where things got really hard. I needed help. And I needed it from the very same\npeople, professors, who had helped me the first time.\nMy heart pounded as I dialed the phone. Gene Wagner, my undergraduate professor and\nmentor, answered. I immediately blurted out my news, stumbled through my explanation,\napologized, twice, and then I waited.\nI heard the rumbling of his voice before he shouted, and then it came: “Jane, come to the\nphone, Mary wants be an economist!”\nYou can imagine how I felt.\nNow, we spent the next hour talking, me, Gene, and his wife Jane. He told me that when he\nwas finding his path, he felt unsure too.\nHe never thought he could get a Ph.D. He worked construction, came from a working‐class\nfamily, and the whole idea felt foreign. But he loved being an economist, loved the direct\nconnection to people and to practice. Every day he went to work he felt joy, and he knew I\nwould feel the same.\nThat day, my professor, and someone I admired, told me version 2 of his story, and it changed\nme.\nThat’s why on this day, your graduation, I’m sharing version 2 of my story with you.\nTo tell you that I’ve been unsure, changed my mind, and thought I couldn’t do it.\n3\n\nBut I have done it. And so can you.\nThe truth is, no one gets to where they are smoothly. Everyone detours, doubts, and pivots.\nThat is human and part of finding your way.\nIt can be hard to know this when you are right in it. It can feel like friends are surging forward,\nand you are falling behind.\nBut that’s just noise.\nYour job, as you move forward in your journey, is to acknowledge the fears, and the\nuncertainty, and then listen.\nWe all have a voice inside of ourselves, telling us what’s next. The challenge is to hear it and\nthen be brave enough to follow its guidance.\nBecause in the end, there are no crooked paths, only your path. So, be yourself. Find your own\nway. And be proud of your version 2.\nThat’s the story, your story, that will change lives and change worlds.\nYou are ready. And we are all looking forward to what you will do.\nCongratulations, Class of 2024!\n4",

    "text": "FINAL\nThe Agency of Humanness\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of Missouri- Kansas City Virtual Commencement Address\n“A Pocket Speech”\nKansas City, MO\nMay 15 and 16, 2021\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nCongratulations UMKC graduates. I am pleased and privileged to be part of your celebration and the\nmarking of a fantastic accomplishment in your lives. Of course, I wish I could be with you in person, but I\nhope the virtual me conveys the joy and pride I have for each of you and your accomplishments. I join\nyour friends, family, and professors in giving you a big round of applause.\nNow, when I was young, I spent a lot of time thinking about change. How it happens, how I could be a\npart of it, how my voice could be big enough to be heard. And history books are filled with stories, most\nof them featuring heroes who simply took charge. They knew what to do and when to do it, and in a\nfew simple actions, they altered the course of history, leaving us all better off.\nAs I’ve aged, I’ve learned that these are just stories, told after the fact, that highlight the outcomes and\nendings, with very little sense of the journey. But today, I will tell you that the journey is everything. It’s\nthe true path to change. And here you have what those heroes had. You have agency—the ability to\naffect the world around you with the actions you take every day.\nAt no time in my memory has this kind of agency been more critical. The pandemic has torn away the\ntrappings of our normal lives and let us see more clearly what is really there. Some of the revelations\nhave been hard—disparities, divisions, hate, a sense that there is too little for everyone, so we must\nfight for our fair share. But we’ve also seen brightness, generosity, vulnerability. We’ve pulled down\nthe curtains that separate us, and watched each other navigate work, home, and family, from kitchens,\nbedrooms, and makeshift offices. And time and time again, what we’ve seen is that we are much more\nsimilar than different.\nAnd this is the thing we must pull through and remember from the pandemic. The challenges we face in\nthe world can be solved, but only if we bring our full selves to the task. The parts that lie behind the\nsynthetic divides that have long separated our personal selves from our work selves. The parts that\nreflect who we truly are. The parts of us that are fully human.\n1\n\nFINAL\nAnd here is where you come in. You’ve overcome so many challenges and\npersevered to finish your degrees, all while living through a global pandemic, something that hasn’t\nhappened in a hundred years. It makes you uniquely prepared to help build the post-pandemic future\nyou want, we all want. You bring something beyond your degrees and programs, you bring lived\nexperience.\nAs we move past the pandemic, our minds will draw us back to the familiar. Pulling us to return to the\nway things used to be. But that would be a mistake. You have the power to demand something\ndifferent. To build a world that is better, more generous, more equal, more forgiving, and most\nimportantly, more complete.\nSo, as you begin the next chapter of your lives, embrace the journey that brought you here. The tragedy\nof the pandemic can be your strength, your superpower, the thing that separates you. The thing that\ngives you vision—the vision to see through what is and imagine what can be.\nYour task, of course, will be to use your strength. To find agency in your humanness and help others do\nthe same. But I guarantee this: if you do that, our children’s children will read about you. They’ll wonder\nhow those heroes changed the world. And remember, it will be important to tell them the full story.\nThey did it by being human.\nCongratulations graduates. The future is yours, and I cannot wait to see what you do with it.\n2",

    "text": "FINAL\n“The New Stone Soup”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nIveagh House Lecture\nDublin, Ireland\nFebruary 10, 2020\n6:45PM GMT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction and warm welcome. It’s a privilege\nto be back here in Ireland. This is the first country I ever visited outside of the\nUnited States, and I still remember how welcoming you were and how much I\nlearned. So it’s truly a privilege to return.\nIt’s also a great honor to be part of such a distinguished lecture series,\naddressing such a distinguished audience. Now before I begin, let me say that\nmy remarks tonight are my own, and don’t necessarily reflect the views of\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you know, I am a policymaker – a monetary policymaker. Many of us\nin this room are policymakers or people who support policymakers. And even\nthough we come from different countries and have different areas of\nexpertise, we all share something in common.\nWe each want to serve the public. We each want to be remembered for\ndoing our best. We each want to make contributions that stand the test of\ntime.\n1\n\nFINAL\nBut times today are challenging. Countries across the globe face slow\ngrowth, low real interest rates, and persistent low inflation. This makes our\neconomies less resilient to everyday shocks and less able to offset them with\nthe tools we’ve traditionally relied on. Moreover, our futures are\ninterconnected. Today, a shock to one country can spill over. Said simply,\nwhen one of us stumbles, all of us sway.\nSo my question tonight is: in the face of these challenges, what can we\ndo?\nThe environment we face\nFirst, let’s talk about how we got here. And I’ll start with the story in the\nUnited States.\nLarge structural shifts are reshaping our economy. First among them is\npopulation aging. The baby boom generation is retiring. And this is having a\nprofound effect on labor force growth – especially since subsequent birth\ncohorts are so much smaller.\nThe numbers tell the story. During the 1970s, as the baby boom\ngeneration matured and entered the labor market in large numbers, the U.S.\nlabor force grew by just over 2.5 percent per year. Today, labor force growth\nis closer to 0.5 percent per year. All else being equal, this shaves about 2\npercentage points off potential GDP growth in the United States each year.1\nThis slower economic growth translates directly into lower interest\nrates. Slower growth decreases investment by reducing the return on capital.2\nAt the same time, an aging population increases the pool of available savings,\n1 Congressional Budget Office (2020), Fernald and Li (2019).\n2 Williams (2017).\n2\n\nFINAL\nas older individuals build and preserve their nest eggs. Together, these forces\nincrease the supply of savings relative to the demand for investment, reducing\nreal interest rates.3\nThese patterns are not unique to the United States. We could just as\neasily be talking about Ireland, or any country in Europe, or just about any\nadvanced economy around the world.4\nAnd these are not our only challenges. On top of slower growth and\nlower real interest rates, central banks are finding it more difficult to achieve\ntheir inflation goals, even in good times.\nFundamental changes in product markets have been putting downward\npressure on prices. And since many markets are global, these changes are\nspreading – creating a strong disinflationary trend and pulling down inflation\nand inflation expectations in many parts of the world.5\nCombined, these factors – lower inflation, lower inflation expectations,\nand lower real interest rates – add up to one thing: less monetary policy space\nwhen the next downturn emerges.\nBut central bankers aren’t the only ones feeling the pressure. Fiscal\npolicymakers are also constrained. Policies enacted to offset the global\nfinancial crisis have left many advanced nations with relatively high debt-to-\nGDP ratios.6 And most face looming obligations to support their aging\npopulations at levels promised when growth was much faster.7\n3 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016).\n4 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\n5 Mertens and Williams (2019), Amano, Carter, and Leduc (2019).\n6 Badia and Dudine (2019).\n7 See for example Rouzet et al. (2019).\n3\n\nFINAL\nSo this is where we find ourselves. Facing a future where economic\nshocks are inevitable, and where monetary and fiscal agents have less policy\nroom to combat them.\nSo again I ask: what can we do?\nMake stone soup\nWhen faced with a tough problem, my first instinct is to turn to books,\nmodels, and other formal practices. I’m an economist after all – that’s what we\ndo. But wisdom isn’t only found in traditional tools. Sometimes, you have to\nturn to tales.\nOne of my favorites is the story of stone soup. It's a European folktale\nI’m sure you've heard. There are many different versions, including one by\nIreland’s own William Butler Yeats. But I'd like to share the story as I learned\nit.\nOne day, a group of strangers came to a village. They were hungry and\nknocked on doors, asking for food. But the villagers had very little and were\nhungry themselves. They closed their doors, pulled their shades, and guarded\ntheir meager stocks.\nSo the strangers went into the town center and dragged over a large pot.\nThey built a roaring fire underneath. And to the pot, they added a few stones.\nAs the pot began to boil, the villagers looked on, curious. Some came\noutside. They asked: what are you doing? The strangers, with confidence, said\nthey were making stone soup. Then they began to imagine aloud how much\nbetter it would taste with just a few additional ingredients – an onion, a\npotato, a beef bone…\n4\n\nFINAL\nNo one villager had everything. But each villager had something. So they\nstarted contributing to the pot. And when they combined it all, everyone had\nmore. Everyone had enough.\nI learned this story when I was 7 years old. And it has stuck with me all\nthese years. I share it with you today to emphasize this point.\nIt’s tempting to look at our cupboards and say they’re bare. That the\nproblems we’re facing are too big. That the tools we have at our disposal are\ntoo limited. That the best strategy – the only strategy – is to close our doors,\npull our shades, and guard our meager resources as long as we can.\nBut this is why we need stories. To help show us a different path.\nSo what lessons from stone soup can we apply to our current situation?\nLook for strangers\nThe first lesson is to seek the perspectives of others. As policymakers,\nwe like to think that our education, experience, and institutional history are a\nsufficient foundation for good decision-making. We especially want to think\nthis when times are tough and people are counting on us to fix things.\nBut these are the very circumstances when pausing and engaging with\nthose outside of ourselves is most important.\nLet me give you an example. For much of our history, central bankers\nhave used the natural tension between unemployment and inflation to\nevaluate the stance of monetary policy – whether we’ve got it right or not. But\nover the past decade, this natural tension has been harder to see.\nUnemployment has fallen dramatically while inflation has remained relatively\nmuted. The question is, what should we make of this?\n5\n\nFINAL\nAs a labor economist and policymaker, I’ve thought a lot about this. But I\nactually found the answer by listening to those less familiar with the tradeoff.\nLast year, the Federal Reserve conducted a series of listening events as part of\nour monetary policy framework review. We talked to academics,\npolicymakers, and – most importantly – business and community leaders.8\nHere’s what we learned. A historically low unemployment rate does not\nmean that the labor market is historically tight. And letting the economy run\npast what we thought was possible has tremendous benefits, especially for\ndisadvantaged groups. Eleven years into the expansion, many more workers\nhave entered the labor force and found jobs than anyone thought possible. By\nfinding full employment experientially, we have improved the lives of\ncountless Americans.9\nImportantly, few models would have predicted this. Little history would\nhave told us this was possible. Our traditional approach would have said to\ncurb this growth, eliminate the possibility of unwanted inflation, and be\nsatisfied with bringing unemployment back to its historical average. If we had\nstayed within this mindset, we might very well have cut the expansion short.\nIn other words, if we hadn’t talked to others – the proverbial strangers –\nwe wouldn’t have seen all that was possible.\n8 See the discussion of the “Fed Listens” initiative on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors web site: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-\nmonetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm.\n9 See for example Aaronson et al. (2019), Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n6\n\nFINAL\nWe have more than we think\nHere’s the second lesson from stone soup. The bravest thing the\nvillagers did was to contribute to the soup without fully knowing what would\ncome of it. In other words, they had to act despite considerable uncertainty\nabout the outcome.\nAs policymakers, we face a similar challenge. There is no doubt that we\nare collectively more constrained than in the past, and that we face greater\nuncertainty about the impact of our tools and their ability to achieve our goals.\nStill, we have to act like the villagers.\nAfter more than 40 years of fighting to bring inflation down to target,\nthe new economic environment requires that monetary policymakers push\ninflation up to target.10 And while this will not be easy, we have the tools we\nneed. Options like average inflation targeting, nominal income targeting, and\nboosting the inflation target are already being researched and widely debated.\nBut having the tools and actually being willing to use them are two very\ndifferent things. And with very limited experience using these tools in this\nway, we feel uncertain. We’ve exercised the muscle of pushing inflation down\nfor so long that changing direction feels unnatural. But that is exactly what we\nwill need to do. We need to embrace the mindset that inflation a bit above\ntarget is far better than inflation a bit below target in today’s economic\nenvironment.11\nA similar mindset shift will be necessary for fiscal policymakers. With\nmonetary policy facing its own limits, fiscal policy will need to play a larger\n10 Jordà and Nechio (2018).\n11 Mertens and Williams (2019).\n7\n\nFINAL\nrole in smoothing through economic shocks. But in a world of fiscal discipline,\nit’s hard to commit to the idea of more.\nBut more is exactly what we need. Expanding the array of automatic\nstabilizers that form part of the social safety net can help mitigate the depth\nand duration of economic downturns.12 Think of unemployment insurance,\nwhich kicks in automatically when things are bad, helping individuals smooth\nthrough a tough time while limiting the amplification of their loss throughout\nthe economy. Although more work is needed, recent research suggests that\nthese types of programs will likely be especially powerful in the new\neconomic reality we face.13\nPerhaps most importantly, we need to continue investing in our future\ngrowth. Countless research studies have shown that spending on things like\ninfrastructure, research and development, and education pays off and actually\nincreases the productive capacity of the economy in the longer run.14 In\ntoday’s low interest rate environment, such investments are relatively easy to\nfinance and will pay a high rate of return in the future.15 We should take\nadvantage of the opportunity.\nA better global legacy\nBefore I conclude, I’d like to leave you with some final thoughts.\n12 See, for example, the panel discussion including Janet Yellen and others at the 2020\nAmerican Economic Association Annual Meetings:\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/1357.\n13 McKay and Reis (2016), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2016), Boushey, Nunn,\nand Shambaugh (2019).\n14 Fernald (1999), Leduc and Wilson (2012), Jones and Williams (1998), Bosler et al.\n(2018).\n15 Elmendorf (2019).\n8\n\nFINAL\nWe all look at the world through the lens of our own experiences. We\nonly know what we know. But what stone soup tells us is that it’s possible to\nwiden our lens. The villagers in the story were able to see a new path forward\nwhen they engaged with the strangers. Their mindsets changed. And then,\nthey were brave enough to act.\nAs policymakers, we must actively look for perspectives outside of our\nown. And we need to be courageous enough to take action, even in times of\nuncertainty. We don’t have the luxury of waiting for strangers to knock on our\ndoors.\nSo let this be our legacy. In the face of challenges, with limited tools and\nless than clear paths, we chose an abundance mindset over a scarcity mindset.\nWe came together and worked to hand future generations a better world than\nthe one we inherited.\nAs policymakers, I think we can all live with that. Maybe even be proud\nof it.\nThank you.\n9\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Mary C. Daly, William Wascher, and David W.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUneven Outcomes in the Labor Market Conference\nVirtual Presentation\nFebruary 4, 2021\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nAuthor’s Note:\nThis speech is a reflection of my experiences and my learning. It is by definition imperfect. But in our\nimperfection, we must still do our part and participate in the conversations it will take to make\nprogress on racial equity. I will continue learning from and with all those committed to equity for all.\n“You don’t even know what I’m capable of”\nAbout 40 years ago, I found myself sitting in a coffee shop, waiting to\nhave a conversation with one of my students. We’d just finished a semester at\nthe University of Missouri—Kansas City. I was her peer teacher, leading\nreview sessions for the History of Science—a required course.\nI’d done the job for only one term, but I loved it. Loved teaching, loved\nhelping, loved the students—all one hundred-plus of them.\nSo when the semester came to an end, I couldn’t wait to see my\nevaluations. They were great—one after another giving me high marks and\nexpressing thanks. I remember feeling this tremendous sense of pride—like\nmaybe I had found my calling. 1\n\nFINAL\nBut as I got close to the end of the stack, I came across one that was\nunexpected. In the margin of the form, handwritten in pen, someone had\ncommented: “I wonder if Mary is a racist.”\nI kept staring at it, thinking it was a joke. One of those ironic puns that\nsays the opposite of what is true. But it wasn’t. It was an actual question,\nwritten by one of my students.\nFortunately, even though the evaluations were anonymous, the student\nhad signed her name. I knew her, had talked with her many times.\nSo after a few breaths, I decided to reach out.\nThat’s how I found myself sitting in a coffee shop, waiting to have a\nconversation that felt both perplexing and worrisome.\nIt was a hard meeting, for both of us. But we talked, a lot. Here is what I\nlearned.\nThe young woman was one of two Black students in my class that year.\nThey were friends. They had come to me together at the beginning of the\nsemester, just to check in. They shared that they’d gone to the high school\nnear campus. I’d heard of the school. It was thought to be a tough ride—\nlimited resources, lots of disruptions, low academic performance. They were\nworried that the History of Science, a hard class, was a high bar for their first\nsemester.\nI empathized with them. I had struggled with the class in my first term.\nSo I sprang into action. I thought about what I could do to make sure they\nsucceeded. I made a plan, spent extra time, and worked to build their\nconfidence.\n2\n\nFINAL\nHere’s what it looked like to them. I didn’t push. I gave them easier\nassignments. I congratulated them for minor successes. I held them to a\ndifferent—lower—standard than I set for the rest of the class.\nThey felt it, every time—like a cut. And after a semester of me doing\nthis, they did not feel confident. They felt unseen, skipped over. They\nwondered if maybe I was a racist.\nWhy wouldn’t they? For a whole semester, my students had observed\nthe way I treated them, and how different it was from the standard I set for\nthe rest of the class. I had used the information they had shared with me,\nabout where they went to school, as an unintentional weapon against them.\nLooking back, I see I was caught up in my own experience. I never asked\nthem what I could do to be helpful. I just jumped in. I assumed I knew what\nthey needed based on a few facts about their background. I let my good\nintentions—and the feeling of doing good—be my metric for success.\nI remember this like it was yesterday. My student, her untouched coffee,\nthe look on her face when she said, “I thought you understood me. You don’t\neven know what I’m capable of.”\nThe tyranny of good intentions\nI failed in my responsibility to those students. But this story is not\nunique to me. It happens every day—with all of us. We think we know what is\nask\nbest for people. We want to do something to contribute. So we move in\nquickly, to fix, solve, or soothe before we ever bother to .\nIt’s the tyranny of good intentions. And it allows assumptions and biases\nto drive our behavior.\n3\n\nFINAL\nThe fact that I’d done this—that I had judged my students’ abilities\nbased on their background—devastated me. I entered college with a GED after\ndropping out of high school at age 15. So many times, well-intentioned people\nassumed they knew me—what I could do, what I needed, what I could be.\nAlways a little less than what I had hoped for. And each time, it pained me—\ndiscouraged me. Until one day it didn’t—because someone looked past where\nI had come from and saw me for what I wanted to be.\nBut that’s the insidious thing about biases. They’re so deeply rooted in\nus, we don’t even realize we’re perpetuating them. It doesn’t matter how\nmany times we’ve seen them or been victims of them—they repeat. Until\neventually, they become our “truth.”\nAnd I end up asking less of my two Black students from a low-income\nhigh school. And all of us settle for persistent gaps—between Blacks and\nWhites, men and women, rural and urban dwellers, those with and without\nadvantage. Gaps that feel familiar, maybe inevitable, definitely embedded. So\nless\nthat even when we know aptitude, interest, and talent aren’t the privilege of a\nfew, we see difference as deficiency. We see others as .\nAgainst that picture, good intentions seem good enough.\nThe practice of equity\nAfter the coffee, I went home and did what you might expect. I vowed\nnot to repeat the same mistakes. I took classes, did anti-bias training, filled out\ncountless workbooks.\nWhat I learned is that the practice of equity requires accountability. And\nit takes work.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThe fact is, humans have biases. Some, like unconscious biases, are\nimpossible to completely eliminate. So we have to be intentional. We have to\ndevelop practices, behaviors, habits, and policies that minimize the impact of\nbiases on our decisions. We also have to put down our armor of good\nintentions and own the outcomes, whether we meant to cause them or not.\nAnd this is the hardest part of practicing equity: it takes humility. We\nhave to be willing to see ourselves, and the world around us, through the eyes\nof others.\nAccepting the difference between impact and intent takes continuous\ncommitment. It also takes courage, to have hard conversations again and\nagain. To listen, with curiosity, even when it feels bad. And to take what we\nlearn and make practical change.\nOnly then we will be accountable for our impact. Only then can we really\nmake a difference.\nAm I a racist?\nWhen I think back on that conversation with my student, I feel grateful.\nShe was brave. And I learned.\nBut I also feel responsible—for making sure that people and their\npotential are seen. That they don’t have to fight for attention or prove that\nOf course not.\nthey deserve it.\nFor most of us, “Am I a racist?” feels easy to answer. It’s\nalmost reflexive.\n5\n\nFINAL\nBut the question isn’t about that. It is about asking whether each day, we\nthey\nare equitably and intentionally giving people an opportunity, seeing their\npotential as boundless, and doing whatever need to see that through.\nlift\nPeople rise or fall to our expectations. And in this, we have the power to\n.\nMy students wanted me to believe in them. To validate that they\nbelonged and treat them like that was true. We all have that ability—to see\nothers as equals and to invest, mentor, and support.\nThe question is: will we use it?\nAchieving equity in our society is an audacious goal—and it is long\noverdue. It will require systemic change that fundamentally alters the\ninstitutions we’ve built. But it will also require us.\nInstitutions are simply mirrors. They reflect who we are and who we\nwant to be. If we change, so will they. So today, let’s begin. One person at a\ntime. Starting with me. Starting with you.\n6",

    "text": "Steering Toward Sustainable Growth\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas\nLas Vegas, NV\nApril 20, 2022\n08:25 AM PDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nGood morning.\nI am thrilled to be back in Las Vegas. But even more than that, I’m thrilled to see that Las Vegas\nis back. I saw this at the airport and driving around town yesterday. And I also heard it from the\ncivic, business, and community leaders we met. Nevada is thriving, growing, and moving\nenthusiastically toward a post-pandemic world.\nAnd this is true for the economy as a whole. After two years of pandemic-related economic\nchallenges, signs of health are everywhere. The job market is robust, household and business\nbalance sheets are strong, and consumer and business sentiments are solid, despite the war in\nUkraine and rising prices at the gas pump.\nOf course, everyone agrees that inflation is too high. Across the country, Americans are waking\nup and going to bed worried about whether their incomes will keep up with the rising cost of\nrent, food, and fuel. Businesses are also worried, some thinking twice about committing to long-\nterm contracts that may become too costly to fulfill if prices continue to rise. Put simply,\nhouseholds and businesses are feeling the pain and asking when things will get better.\nSo today, I will spend my time discussing inflation and how monetary policy has and will adjust\nto bring it down and put the economy back on a sustainable path. But before I get started, let\n1\n\nme remind you that the views I will share today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those\nof anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nFocusing on Inflation\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve has two Congressionally mandated goals: full\nemployment and price stability. Although there is no fixed number for full employment, we\ndefine it as a broad and inclusive goal that considers all those who want to work.1 Right now, by\nalmost any measure, this goal has been achieved. Anyone who wants to a job has not just one\nbut many opportunities to choose from, and workers of all types are benefiting, including those\noften left behind in expansions.2\nIn contrast, we are far away from our price stability goal. The Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) defines price stability as average inflation of 2 percent. The high readings we have seen\nover the past year, breaching 8 percent last month, clearly exceed that target.3 This means\npolicy must adjust. One of our goals is not being met.\nThe key insight of the dual mandate is that both sides matter. It was critical to assist the\neconomy in recovering the job losses that occurred early in the pandemic, and it is now critical\nto stem what has been a longer-than-expected run of high inflation.\nThe question is how to do that smoothly. And to determine that, we have to understand how\nwe got here.\nThe simple answer is COVID. Lockdowns early in the pandemic, transportation issues, and labor\nshortages constrained the supply of many goods. And these supply disruptions fell largely\noutside the scope of policy. After all, policymakers can do little to get more cars to the lot or\nmore appliances into stores.\nIn contrast, we have a range of tools to help people buy what they need. And these tools were\ndeployed to help households sustain while we fought the pandemic. For those who lost their\nincomes, fiscal policy provided a lifeline. To bolster growth and employment, monetary policy\n1 In August 2020, the FOMC revised its long-run statement that defines full employment and price stability goals.\nSee Board of Governors (2022).\n2 Powell (2022) discusses employment gains across ethnicities as well as the record number of job openings per\nunemployed persons. Expansions tend to pull down the unemployment rate for all demographic groups. However,\nthis process is faster for groups with higher unemployment rates during recessions; see Aaronson et al. (2019) and\nDuzhak (2021).\n3 The 12-month change in headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation was 8.5 percent and core CPI inflation was\n6.5 percent in March.\n2\n\nturned accommodative. These measures helped sustain consumer spending and get people\nthrough the worst of the crisis.\nUnfortunately, as the pandemic persisted, this policy-supported demand collided, again and\nagain, with COVID-disrupted supply. And as we would expect, as demand outstripped supply,\ninflation rose.4\nSince high inflation was initially caused by the pandemic and our responses to it, the\nexpectation has been that it will recede as COVID does. The problem is that, while COVID has\nabated, it has not disappeared. We can more easily do things like go out for dinner, travel, and\nsee a movie. But countries and firms managing new variants and rising caseloads have not been\nable to return to full production. So, supply chain disruptions have lingered. And the war in\nUkraine has further pressured supply, especially for energy, food, and other critical\ncommodities.\nAll of this has added up to persistently high inflation readings. And that presents a different\nproblem. Long periods of high inflation, even if it is projected to come down, can seep into\nexpectations, leading people to anticipate further price increases. This is especially salient now,\nwith prices for food and gas making headlines. Research tells us that these prices heavily\ninfluence consumers’ beliefs about future inflation.5 We already see this in surveys of short-run\ninflation expectations, which show that consumers and businesses are reacting to high inflation\nreadings.6\nFortunately, longer-run expectations have remained steady. Moreover, consumer and business\nsurveys, as well as market-based measures of inflation compensation, foresee an easing of\ninflation pressures in coming years, moving to levels more consistent with the FOMC’s average 2\npercent goal.7\n4 As a consequence of more spending being redirected from services towards goods, inflation rates across these\ntwo sectors have diverged. CPI inflation for services hit 5.1 percent in March, while goods CPI inflation is running at\n14.2 percent. In February, PCE inflation reached 4.6 percent for services and 9.6 percent for goods.\n5 D’Acunto et al. (2021) show that consumers particularly rely on grocery prices in their consumption bundle.\nCoibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) link households’ inflation expectations to food and gas prices.\n6 Armantier et al. (2022) find that short-term inflation expectations have moved up with higher inflation readings.\nHowever, they also point out that medium- to longer-term inflation expectations are less responsive now\ncompared with before the pandemic.\n7 The breakeven inflation rate, computed as the difference between nominal and real yields, is 4.33 percent\nannually over the next two years, as of April 13, 2022. Also as of this date, the annual breakeven inflation rate over\nthe five-year period starting five years from now is 2.35 percent. According to the ATSIX data developed in Aruoba\n(2016), the expected one-year inflation rate nine years out stands at 2.29 percent (updated data available at\nhttps://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/atsix).\n3\n\nBut we can’t be complacent. The longer realized inflation remains high, the more risk there is\nthat rising prices will become part of public psychology.8 And once psychology shifts, it is hard to\nbring it back.\nWe learned this lesson the hard way. The last time we experienced this kind of elevated\ninflation was in the 1970s—some of us remember that time. Americans faced a steady\ndrumbeat of rising prices that lasted for over a decade. By the early 1980s, high inflation had\nbecome firmly entrenched in the public’s psyche. To get things under control, the Fed had to\nimplement a series of steep interest rate hikes. They worked, but the correction was painful.9\nThis is a history no one wants to repeat. And it’s why the Fed is taking actions today, far earlier\nthan in the 1970s, to tighten policy, rebalance demand and supply, and ensure that both of our\ndual mandate goals are achieved.\nThe obvious next question is, how will we get there?\nHow We Get There Matters\nThe truth is, there is a hard way and an easier way.\nTo see what I mean, imagine you’re in a car. You’re driving along the highway and you spot a\nhazard up ahead. At this point, you know you need to slow down. One way to do it is to slam\nhard on the brakes. You’ll achieve your goal, but you and your passengers will probably suffer in\nthe process. You might jerk forward in your seat or spill coffee on your lap. That’s the hard way.\nThe better way is to purposefully and smoothly decelerate. You avoid the danger, and you spare\nyourself and others the whiplash. Most importantly, you get to continue your trip.\nI think we can all agree that this is good driving. But it is also good policymaking. If we slam the\nbrakes on the economy by adjusting rates too quickly or too much, we risk forcing unnecessary\nadjustments by businesses and households, potentially tipping the economy into recession. If\nwe ease on the brakes by methodically removing accommodation and regularly assessing how\nmuch more is needed, we have a good chance of transitioning smoothly and gliding the\neconomy to its long-run sustainable path.\nNow some are nervous—or even skeptical—about whether this can be achieved. They fear that\nmonetary policy is behind the curve and only a rapid and aggressive tightening can prevent an\n8 Malmendier and Nagel (2016) show that individuals form inflation expectations based on realized inflation during\ntheir lifetime.\n9 Goodfriend and King (2005) document the depth of the two recessions in the early 1980s that followed interest\nrate hikes to rein in inflation. For an extensive record of the Volcker disinflation, see Silber (2012).\n4\n\nunbridled increase in inflationary pressure. 10 Of course, for those who hold this view, memories\nof the 1970s inflation and the painful correction it required loom large.\nFor many reasons, this is not my modal outlook. First, the conditions we face today are very\ndifferent from the 1970s. For one thing, current high inflation readings have a clear catalyst—\nthe pandemic. Moreover, the duration of rising prices has been far shorter—a year, rather than\na decade. And in stark contrast to the 1970s, longer-run inflation expectations have remained\nstable.\nSecond, the Fed is different than it was in the 1970s. We are far more attuned to the\nimportance of inflation psychology and the transparency it demands. So we regularly share\npost-FOMC statements, summaries of economic projections, and other forms of forward\nguidance that tell households, businesses, and market participants what we are thinking and\nwhere policy is heading.11\nThese communications provide clarity. But they also affect financial conditions, often long\nbefore we adjust rates. You can see this in the recent data. Although the FOMC has only raised\nthe funds rate 25 basis points so far this year, our forward guidance has resulted in higher\ninterest rates for Treasuries across the yield curve.12 This has in turn moved rates in other\nfinancial markets. Mortgage rates, for example, have gone up to their highest levels since the\nstart of the pandemic. This highlights an important point—communication is itself a tool and\ncan tap the brakes on the economy long before actual adjustments to policy occur.\nThird, history suggests that smooth, rather than abrupt, transitions are the norm. In fact, a\nrecent study by Princeton professor and former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder shows that, out of\nthe last eleven tightening cycles, when the Fed raised interest rates after a period of\naccommodative policy, seven were followed by a mild recession or none at all—basically a\nsmooth landing.13\nThere are, of course, no guarantees when it comes to a highly uncertain and fast-moving\neconomy. But for now, most economic agents also expect a smooth transition. Financial market\ndata put very little probability on a near-term recession.14 And consumers continue to see\nunemployment falling in coming quarters, even as the Fed adjusts rates.15 My business contacts\n10 See, for example, Summers (2022).\n11 For a complete discussion about how the current moment differs from the 1970s, see Daly (2022).\n12 Over the past six months, the 1-year Treasury yield moved up about 170 basis points while the 10-year Treasury\nyield moved up about 125 basis points.\n13 See Blinder (2022).\n14 Bauer and Mertens (2018a) document that the slope of the yield curve, which is the difference between long-\nand short-term interest rates, can be used to predict recessions. Bauer and Mertens (2018b) argue that the\ndifference between 10-year and 3-month interest rates performs best among several alternatives. By this metric,\nthe yield curve is far from an inversion and implied recession probabilities are low.\n15 See the preliminary results for the April edition of the Michigan Survey of Consumers, available at\nhttps://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=69819.\n5\n\nare equally optimistic, preparing to move past the pandemic and take advantage of\nopportunities for growth and expansion.\nThis bullishness likely reflects the strong underlying momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as\nthe public’s confidence that, even as rates rise and the economy slows, growth and the labor\nmarket will remain solid.\nBut this will take work. And let me turn to that next.\nNavigating Policy Out of the Pandemic\nAs I have noted, the inflation outlook combined with a strong labor market leave no doubt that\nfurther policy tightening is appropriate. The question is, how much and how quickly?\nLet’s start with how much. The first step is to remove the accommodation that we provided\nduring the pandemic. That means raising the federal funds rate to its neutral level, which most\nforecasters put at around 2.5 percent in nominal terms. We started that journey in March with a\n25-basis-point rate increase, so we still have significant work to do. Moving purposefully to a\nmore neutral stance that does not stimulate the economy is the top priority.\nAnd this is where the question of timing comes in. How quickly should we get there?\nAccounting for the risks of being too fast or too slow, I see an expeditious march to neutral by\nthe end of the year as a prudent path. We will continue to evaluate the data and the risks, but\ntoday I see little indication that the economy needs policy accommodation.\nOnce accommodation is removed, we need to evaluate the effects—observe how financial\nconditions adjust, how much inflation recedes, and what more remains to be done to ensure a\nsustained expansion. This watchful deliberation is always important, but it’s critical when the\nlevel of uncertainty is high, as it is today.16\nThere is the uncertainty about COVID. While it feels like our recovery from the pandemic is\ngaining traction here in the United States, China and other global producers are in the midst of\nanother wave of lockdowns to manage outbreaks. This makes it hard to declare victory on the\npandemic or to be comfortable about the projected recovery of supply chains.\nThere is also uncertainty about the impact of the war in Ukraine. So far, the U.S. economy is\nweathering the disruption to supplies of oil and other commodities, but energy shocks have\n16 Leduc and Liu (2016) show that increases in uncertainty decrease demand and lower economic activity. Bok,\nMertens, and Williams (2022) show that financial market pricing is consistent with this view when the lower bound\non interest rates is a salient concern.\n6\n\nhistorically led to periods of economic contraction, domestically and globally. And that’s a risk\nthat bears close watching.17\nAll of this means that it’s hard to fully know what next year will look like. Will we be in a world\nwhere supply chains have healed, inflation has come down, and policy can remain close to\nneutral? Or will we be in a world where disruptions remain, inflation persists, and monetary\npolicy must further adjust to restrain the economy, balance supply and demand, and return\ninflation to our price stability objective? The data will tell us over the course of this year, and we\nwill be prepared to respond when it does.\nBut no matter what happens next year, that will not be the end of our work. The Fed’s\noverarching job is to foster a long and durable expansion that delivers both full employment\nand price stability. We need to calibrate policy to get back on that path. We need to manage\nthe economic headwinds immediately in front of us. But we also need to lay the groundwork\nfor the economy we want in the future. A truly smooth transition does both.\nGo Smooth to Go Far\nLet me leave you with a story that illustrates my approach to policymaking and how I will\nnavigate the challenges ahead. As a teenager, I worked at a donut shop. Part of my job was to\ndrive a delivery truck. I drove the long-distance route at night, when traffic was sparse. As you\nmight expect, I sometimes went a little too fast. And as you also might expect, that didn’t turn\nout too well. I wound up losing my license for three weeks—which, to me, felt like a lifetime.\nThat youthful mistake taught me a valuable lesson. Getting there is important. But so is the\njourney. In my attempt to get there quickly, I actually didn’t get there at all. Though I didn’t\nknow it at the time, I had taken the hard way.\nBut we don’t have to. A smooth and methodical approach to policy will alert us to hazards along\nthe way, prepare us for unexpected bumps in the road, and ultimately keep us moving\nforward—not just to our immediate destination, but to all of the destinations that follow.\nThank you.\n17 The impact on domestic growth may be different this time. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration, the United States has been a net exporter of petroleum since 2019.\n7\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C.

    "text": "FINAL\nThe Last Resort in a Changing Landscape\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nMoney Marketeers of New York University Webinar\nNew York, NY\nApril 15, 2021\n02:00 PM EDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nI grew up in Missouri surrounded by three rivers. Nearly every spring,\nat least one of them would flood. Each time this happened, families,\nbusinesses, and sometimes whole communities, would be forced to higher\nground until the water receded and returned to its banks.\nPublic programs were there to assist. Teams helped people evacuate,\ntemporary shelters were stood up overnight, and financial support was\nprovided for repairs and rebuilding. By many measures, these responses\nwere a win, repeated successes of a system meant to insure against these\ntypes of disasters.\nBut flooding was not a rare event, it happened almost every year.\nAgainst that backdrop, the prevailing public policy seems incomplete. A patch\nagainst a problem that owed in part to known structural factors such as\ngeography, location, and regular weather patterns.\nWhich takes me to what I want to discuss today. Changes in our\neconomic and financial landscape have left us with a financial market\n1\n\nFINAL\ninfrastructure that is more vulnerable to disruptions. We saw this in the\nGlobal Financial Crisis and in our recent experience with the unprecedented\nshock of COVID-19. As the lender of last resort in the United States, the\nFederal Reserve was there to assist. In both cases, we intervened—provided\nliquidity, stabilized markets, and ensured that the financial system could\ncontinue to fulfill its role in the economy.\nBut the frequency and scale of our interventions is concerning. Without\nchanges to our financial infrastructure, the Federal Reserve may regularly be\ncalled to step in to stabilize markets during turbulent periods. And not just\nfor 100-year floods like COVID-19, but for more typical disruptions associated\nwith average shocks to the global and domestic economy.\nThe Federal Reserve’s role as lender of last resort will always be a\ncritical backstop in the protection against turmoil and dislocation caused by\nrare or extreme events. But to fulfill the role sustainably, we need to be the\nlast, not the first, line of defense. Regularly relying on “save the day”\ninterventions by the Federal Reserve can be costly, resulting in public losses\nand undesirable risk-taking on the part of the private sector.\nAs policymakers, we must continually evaluate our actions. We must\nuse all of our experiences, even those from times of crises, to identify\nvulnerabilities and create a more resilient future. This means working\ntogether, across regulatory agencies, to examine the events of last year and\nask what needs to be done to minimize the chances of future severe\ndisruptions.\nSo as we begin to emerge from our battles against COVID-19, it is time\nto focus on crafting more complete policies that leave us better prepared to\n2\n\nFINAL\nweather future storms, big and small. Only then can we foster a more stable,\nsound and resilient financial system.\nBefore I turn to this, let me remind you that my remarks are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nA Changing Landscape\nThe financial sector is crucial for the smooth functioning of the\neconomy. It enables the borrowing, lending, and saving that supports growth.\nFrom that vantage point, it is a public resource, a critical infrastructure for our\nshared prosperity.\nBut many shifts, exogenous to the financial system itself, are affecting its\nfunctioning. Most notable is the decline in the neutral rate of interest, or r-\n1\nstar, which has been falling globally for the past three decades. The decline\nreflects slow-moving structural trends including a step-down in productivity\ngrowth and shifts in the demand for savings and investment associated with\n2\npopulation aging. The decline in r-star and other prevailing interest rates\nalone would challenge the profitability of financial firms. But lower neutral\nrates of interest also mean that the Federal Reserve and other central banks,\nconstrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates, need to routinely\nemploy “low-for-long” policies to achieve mandated employment and price\n3\nstability goals.\nThe effects of these low-for-long policies have well-documented\nbenefits of boosting economic growth, which ultimately supports the financial\n1\nHolston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Jordà and Taylor (2019).\n2\nCarvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016), Williams (2017).\n3\n3\nMertens and Williams (2019), Andrade et al. (2021).\n\nFINAL\n4\nsystem. But they are not without trade-offs. Over time, low interest rates can\nput pressure on the business models of financial institutions, leading them to\n5\nreach for yield, which can jeopardize the stability of the financial system.\nA related but additional development affecting the financial system is\nthe broad-based increase in debt levels and leverage ratios. Government\npolicies enacted to offset the Global Financial Crisis in the late 2000s left many\n6\nadvanced nations with relatively high debt-to-GDP ratios. The response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified this trend. Debt has also surged\n7\nin the private sector, especially among nonfinancial corporate firms. Notably,\n8\nmuch of this increase in debt has been funded outside of the banking sector.\nWhile the rise in public and private debt have contributed to economic growth\nover the past decade, the increased indebtedness has created vulnerabilities\nthat the financial system has to intermediate.\nImportantly, this increase in borrowing has had a significant impact on\nthe U.S. Treasury market. And this is the final aspect of the changed landscape\nthat I will focus on. The Treasury market is the largest and most liquid bond\nmarket in the world and is a critical component of the domestic and global\nfinancial infrastructure. Broker-dealers provide the lion’s share of Treasury\nsecurity intermediation and generally are well-positioned to meet the\ndemands of investors to buy or sell Treasury securities.\nOver the past decade, Treasury securities have also become an\nincreasingly important p art of short-term funding markets, for instance as\n4\nArias et al. (2020), Caldara et al. (2020), Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019).\n5\nChoi and Kronlund (2018), Di Maggio and Kacperczyk (2017), Financial Stability\nOversight Council (2020).\n6\nBadia and Dudine (2019).\n7\nBoard of Governors (2020).\n8\n4\nBoard of Governors (2020), Financial Stability Board (2020).\n\nFINAL\ncollateral in repurchase agreements. And a sizable and growing share of\nTreasury securities are held by financial entities such as hedge funds or\nmoney market funds that in times of stress can find themselves needing to\nliquidate quickly to meet redemption demand. This can put pressure on\nbroker-dealers to absorb those sales.\nThe pressure on the Treasury market is magnified by the fact that\nTreasury securities remain a safe haven investment for foreign official and\nprivate investors. Normally, this is a benefit to the U.S. economy, but in\nperiods of global stress, when liquidity is at a premium, it increases demands\non Treasury clearing that go far beyond the needs of domestic investors.\nIn all of these situations, broker-dealers are the primary intermediary\ntasked with meeting the demand for liquidity. This normally works extremely\nwell. But, as we saw last year, these intermediaries face regulatory and\ninternal risk limits that can challenge their ability to meet surges in demand\nfor liquidity. Given the growing size of the Treasury market, and the potential\ninability of broker-dealer balance sheets to keep up, this intermediation\n9\nchannel could face more capacity pressure in the future.\nLender of Last Resort: Crisis and Response\nThe onset of COVID-19 and the financial and economic disruptions that\nit caused, exacerbated many of the vulnerabilities embedded in the changing\nfinancial landscape. The crisis roiled financial markets. Even the bedrock\nTreasury market experienced a severe disruption.\n9\nThis issue has been raised by various researchers including Duffie (2020) and Liang and\nParkinson (2020). But this is an open area of study and one where no consensus has\n5\nformed.\n\nFINAL\nIn the early days of March 2020, when it became clear that COVID-19\nwas a pandemic that would disrupt the entire global economy, investor\nsentiment shifted quickly. Short-term funding markets became especially\nstressed. A “dash for cash” among both domestic and foreign investors\nresulted in a run from even relatively safe longer-dated Treasury securities to\n10\ncash and Treasury bills. The rapid and large-scale repositioning caused\ntrading volumes to surge and price volatility to spike. Broker-dealers, facing\ntheir own internal risk and balance sheet limits, had difficulty meeting the\ndemand for cash. Bid-ask spreads widened, market depth fell, and the\nnormally fluid Treasury market was strained. Stress was particularly\napparent in longer-dated off-the-run securities.\nThe Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed’s Open Market\nTrading Desk reacted immediately, conducting a record number of open-\n11\nmarket operations to restore and promote smooth market functioning. This\nis exactly what the lender of last resort is tasked with accomplishing.\nStepping back from the crisis and the unique features of the shock, the\nevents of last March raise questions about the resiliency of intermediation in\nthe Treasury market during periods of market stress. A key lesson from the\nGlobal Financial Crisis (GFC) was that even rare events deliver important\nlessons. Following the GFC, regulatory bodies across the globe made material\nchanges to the financial system that paid dividends during the COVID-19\ncrisis. For example, in the United States, the regulatory framework that came\nout of the Dodd-Frank Act ensured that systemically important institutions\nentered the pandemic with sufficient capital to facilitate the forbearance and\n10\nAcharya, Engle, and Steffen (2021).\n11\n6\nLogan (2020a).\n\nFINAL\n12\nlending that has been critical to our economic recovery. The question before\nus now is, what can we learn from the events of March 2020, and how can we\nuse those lessons to build a more resilient financial system moving forward.\nBuilding the Resiliency of the Financial System\nThere are many potentially important topics for study, but I will focus\non two that are particularly salient to the idea of building more resiliency in\nthe financial system: short-term funding markets and greater prudential\noversight for the banking system.\nTreasury and Short-Term Funding Markets\nFor the Treasury market, a number of possible reforms are currently\n13\nbeing discussed. These include the Federal Reserve creating a domestic\nstanding repurchase facility to backstop markets in times of stress and making\npermanent the temporary FIMA—Foreign and International Monetary\nAuthorities Repo Facility—to help support smooth market functioning. These\nactions would provide assurance to markets that liquidity will be available in\ntimes of stress, but they could also leave financial markets more dependent on\ntheir existence. So, further careful study is required.\nOutside of the Federal Reserve, expanding trading platform access to\nmore entities and using central clearing for Treasury cash markets could\nreduce the burden on broker-dealers and lessen the liquidity crunch in times\nof stress. Additionally, reconsidering the inclusion of reserves or even\nTreasuries in the regulatory leverage-ratio requirements for broker-dealers,\n12\nSee Baily, Klein, and Schardin (2017), Quarles (2020), Brainard (2021).\n13\n7\nSmith (2021).\n\nFINAL\nparticularly when markets are strained, could further facilitate capacity for\n14\nclearing. Again, these changes and expansions have potential benefits and\ncosts so further careful study is warranted.\nLooking beyond the direct functioning of the Treasury market, the\n15\nstability of hedge funds and money market funds is an important priority.\nThese entities have structural funding risk that can easily spike in times of\nstress, contributing to the severity of runs. The Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (FSOC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission have signaled\nsome movement in shoring up the resiliency of these funds, something I see as\ncritical to ensuring that we are prepared for the next stressful shock.\nExpanding Prudential Oversight\nBut fixing the Treasury market and reforming other short-term funding\nmarkets is just one piece of ensuring a healthy financial system going forward.\nThe proximity of the effective lower bound on interest rates and the necessity\nto keep policy rates low for longer after a downturn, can, as I mentioned\nearlier, result in reach-for-yield behavior among financial firms. So, we also\nneed to find ways to foster and maintain sustainable increases in leverage.\nRegulators already have a variety of regulatory and supervisory tools\nthat provide an effective first-line of defense, including capital requirements,\nleverage ratios, and stress tests. These tools have proven successful at\nkeeping the banking sector healthy and well-capitalized over the business\n14\nSee for example Liang and Parkinson (2020), Duffie (2020), Treasury Market Practices\nGroup (2019), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (2020).\n15\nU.S. Department of the Treasury (2021), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n8\n(2021).\n\nFINAL\ncycle, a characteristic that has served us well as we work through the\n16\npandemic.\nBut new risks emerge as the economy evolves and we need to ensure\nthat we are prepared for what is ahead. The banking sector is just one part of\nthe financial system. Shadow banking was a problem during the Global\nFinancial Crisis, and with the rapid growth of the fintech sector, there is much\nto consider outside our traditional areas. At the Federal Reserve, we\ncontinuously monitor the resilience and vulnerabilities of the financial system\n17\nas a whole and publish our assessment in our Financial Stability Report. And\nthe FSOC is actively working to ensure that all the regulatory bodies are\n18\ncoordinating, so that the right policy levers can be activated. But more work\nmay need to be done to ensure that other parts of the financial infrastructure\nremain sound and stable.\nPolicy for a Changing World\nTurning back to where I started, I often think about my experience\ngrowing up near a flood plain. The frequent disruptions of the rivers to\npeoples’ lives and livelihoods. It reminds me of the importance of a last resort\nbackstop. Protection against losses too big for any one of us to bear. But the\nexperience also taught me the value of prevention. Of building resiliency and\nminimizing the chances that a backstop is needed at all.\nand\nWhat the rivers of Missouri really taught me is that optimal public\npolicies are those that manage mitigate risks. Backstops and prevention\nthat result in consistently better outcomes.\n16\nBaily, Klein, and Schardin (2017), Quarles (2020), Brainard (2021).\n17\nBoard of Governors (2020).\n18\n9\nFinancial Stability Oversight Council (2020).\n\nFINAL\nThis is the balance we will need to strike to ensure that our ever-\nchanging financial system continues to fulfill its role as critical public\ninfrastructure.\nThank you.\n10\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAcharya, Viral V., Robert F.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCollege of Western Idaho\n2025 Commencement Ceremony\nBoise, Idaho\nMay 16, 2025\nApprox. 7:40 p.m. MT, 6:40 p.m. PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n1\n\nIntroduction\nThank you, Skip, for that kind introduction. It is truly my honor to be here for the College of\nWestern Idaho’s 16th commencement ceremony. I’m so happy to be celebrating with you.\nBefore I go any further, I would like to ask all the graduates, and only the graduates, to give\nyourselves a big round of applause. You’ve earned this day and it’s important to take a moment and\nacknowledge it. Of course, we also have to recognize all the family, friends, and faculty who have helped\nmake this day possible.\nI first visited CWI last fall, and I immediately felt at home. Everyone is welcome, everyone has\nopportunity, everyone belongs. Whether you like welding, mechanics, nursing, business—or one of the\nother 120 plus programs the college offers—you can learn here and you can thrive.\nThat’s the American promise. Everyone has a future.\nNo matter how you start, or where your journey takes you, with hard work and determination, you\ncan craft a path to success. A path that you choose.\nI believe that. But truth be told, I didn’t always know it.\nRaising Expectations\nWhen I was a teenager, I used to drive around neighborhoods with big houses. I would go out at\nnight when my shift of making donuts was complete, and the streets were mostly empty. I liked looking at\nothers’ accomplishments. I wasn’t jealous, just resigned. Their lives were so different than mine.\nSee, I was living in Ballwin, Missouri. I had dropped out of high school about six months earlier.\nMy family had difficulties, and they finally took us under. So, I went to work.\nThe last thing I heard as I left high school still rattled in my mind: “It’s your decision. But you\nwill never amount to much.”\nI believed it.\nSo I drove around looking at houses, thinking at 15, my fate was already determined.\n2\n\nI set my sights on getting a full-time job with better pay and maybe benefits. A big billboard on\nthe side of the road became my goal: “Good hours, good pay, good people. Be a bus driver.”\nCall it good luck, good timing, or just a good person seeing something I couldn’t—my former\nhigh school guidance counselor made a connection. She introduced me to a friend of hers, Betsy.\nBetsy had this amazing car, a Mercedes her father had once driven. We sat inside on its leather\nseats, drinking coffee from McDonald’s, and we talked. Actually, I talked, and she listened. When I was\ndone, she said gently, “You can't be a bus driver without a high school diploma.”\nNow, dreams are hard to give up, even when they’re small. And I was crushed. All I could hear\nwas the voice from high school saying, “You’ll never amount to much.”\nBut then Betsy said a second sentence. “So, you will have to get a GED.”\nI would like to say I jumped at the opportunity, but I didn’t. It seemed daunting. I hadn’t been in\nschool for a while, and I wasn’t sure where to begin. But Betsy encouraged me, and as you can see from\nthe honorary green tassel that I’m wearing tonight, I did it!\nMy GED stands as the single best degree I’ve ever earned. I have it right here. It was more than a\ncertificate, a piece of paper saying that I could become a bus driver. It was a change. A little opening in\nmy narrow expectations. A sliver of light that let me see that more might be possible.\nFinding Out\nAfter my GED, Betsy suggested I take a semester of college. I didn’t know much about college or\nmany people who had ever gone. But she said it would be a good way to see what I liked, so I decided to\ntake a chance. After all, I could always go back to bus driving.\nI took a semester, and I really enjoyed it. So, I decided to keep going. I moved across the state\nand started a four-year program.\nI was in way over my head in the early days. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to study. I wasn’t\nearning any money. And I was worried about failing.\n3\n\nI started out in psychology and philosophy, and took math, history, science, photography, music,\nand computers. I even took a marketing class at a community college to see if that would fit my interests.\nBut nothing clicked. So, I went to the campus learning center to get some help. The advisor suggested\neconomics and took me to a class.\nI had never had economics, so I had no idea what to expect. The class was large—in a giant\nauditorium. It lasted 90 minutes, and it felt like 15. I knew I had found my place.\nI graduated with a degree in economics and philosophy. And went onto get a PhD and eventually\na job at the San Francisco Fed, where I am now President and CEO.\nAmount to Much\nSo why do I tell you this story?\nWell, it’s not to say that you need a PhD in economics or a path that looks like mine.\nIt’s to say that the words I heard as I exited high school were never true. They were just a narrow\nperspective on what could be.\nThe truth is, decisions are rarely final and paths are rarely predetermined. We all have moments\nwhen we feel stuck or off course. But time passes, constraints fade, doors open, and your ambitions\nfollow.\nI didn’t start out wanting a PhD or even knowing what the letters meant. But I got a GED, and\nthat led to a class, and that led to a semester, and that led to a career.\nAnd looking back, I realize it was never the big houses that I went to see. It wasn’t the owners’\naccomplishments. It was the possibilities.\nA world where a single decision isn’t final. And we all have the opportunity to choose and choose\nagain.\n4\n\nAnd that is why I love CWI and why I am thrilled to be here tonight. It’s filled with possibilities.\nAnd it’s filled with choosers. Each of you put in hard work, dedication, and desire to earn a degree. You\nexpected a lot of yourselves and rose to meet the challenge.\nAs you leave tonight, my wish for you is that you always have the opportunity to choose.\nMy hope for you is that you always have the will to take it.\nAnd my want for you is that you always know that you already amount to much.\nCongratulations graduates! I look forward to seeing what you do.\n5",

    "text": "Forward-Looking Policy in a Real-Time World\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nGriswold Center for Economic Policy Studies\nPrinceton University, Princeton, NJ\nMarch 4, 2023, 1:00 PM ET\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThe most frequent question I am asked these days is, “What will the Fed do next?”\nI understand. People are worried. Inflation is high and the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) has taken aggressive policy action to bring it down. The responses range from fearing\nthese actions will tip the economy into a recession to fearing they won’t be enough to get the\njob done.\nFor most, this adds up to a lot of uncertainty. And the impulse to look for answers in the\nimmediate. The next meeting. The next data release. The next market update. It doesn’t help\nthat we face a round-the-clock ticker tape of economic and financial news.\nBut achieving our mandated goals takes time and a broader view. As policymakers, we have to\nrespond to an economy that is evolving in real time and prepare for what the economy will look\nlike in the future.\nSo today, I am going to do just that. I will pull back the lens from the immediate and talk about\nwhat the inflation landscape looked like before the pandemic, what it looks like now, and what\nboth could mean for the future.\nBefore I get started, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express today are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve\nsystem.\n1\n\nThe World We Had\nTo understand how future inflation could evolve, we must first remember where we were\nbefore the pandemic. So, let me start there.\nBefore the pandemic and the current episode of high inflation, the world was starkly different.\nThe central and decade-long challenge for the Federal Reserve and most other central banks\nwas trying to bring inflation up to target, rather than pushing it down.\nLarge structural forces were at play. The most notable was population aging, which was\naffecting the labor force and savings rates in industrialized and developing nations alike.1 Global\nproductivity growth was also slowing, affecting demand for investment.2 Together, these\ndevelopments brought about weaker trend growth and lower real interest rates, and they put\nsteady downward pressure on inflation.3 Economics and policy discussions became focused on\nsecular stagnation—a persistent state of little or no growth with economies running below\npotential. And a low neutral rate of interest, the zero lower bound on interest rates, and the\nrisks of consistently below target inflation were top of mind.4 ,5 ,6\nThe inflation challenges in the U.S. were pronounced (Figure 1). Despite sustained monetary\npolicy accommodation after the Great Recession, annual personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) inflation remained below 2 percent for 84 of the 98 months from 2012 through February\n2020, or about 86 percent of the time.7 Over that same period, the federal funds rate was set\nnear zero almost half of the time and below the neutral rate of interest the entire time.8\nThis environment ended up offering some advantages. The economy was able to run\nconsistently above estimates of potential growth and unemployment was able to fall to near-\nhistoric levels without spurring inflation.\nBut it also came with risks. Namely, that inflation would fail to get to target in good times and\nfall further in bad ones. Eventually, this would seep into inflation expectations, reducing\nmonetary policy space and compounding the existing structural downward pressures on\n1 United Nations (2022) and Jones (2022).\n2 Fernald et al. (2017) and Fernald and Li (2022).\n3 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017) and Jordà et al. (2019).\n4 Summers (2014), Gordon (2015) and Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Summers (2016).\n5 Bernanke (2012), Dudley (2013), and Yellen (2013).\n6 Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2019), Mertens and Williams (2019), and Lansing (2021).\n7 The sustained accommodation included low interest rates, forward guidance, and the announcement of a formal\ninflation target in January 2012 (Board of Governors 2012).\n8 The neutral rate of interest declined over this period and currently is estimated to be about 2.5 percent.\n2\n\ninflation.9 The persistent deflation in Japan underscored this challenge, and it motivated the Fed\nand many other central banks to fight vigorously to get inflation up to target.10\nThis was the seemingly unchangeable topography of the economy before the pandemic.\nAnd then of course, everything changed.\nThe Pandemic Shock\nWe all know the story. When COVID-19 hit, the economy faltered. The Fed cut interest rates,\npurchased long-term assets, and opened lending facilities, all to help bridge the economy\nthrough the very worst. U.S. fiscal agents took equally aggressive action, infusing about $5\ntrillion in federal spending into the economy.\nThese actions were unprecedented. And they worked, to an extent. U.S. economic growth\nrebounded, demand surged, and the labor market began to recover. Supply chains, however,\nwere slow to respond. And by early 2021, price pressures were starting to build—first in a few\nsectors directly affected by the pandemic, and then more broadly, as imbalances between\nrobust demand and limited supply spread throughout the economy.11 By the fall of 2021,\ninflation was high and heading higher.\nThe chart puts the change in inflation in perspective (Figure 1). After averaging about 1.4\npercent per year in the low-inflation period, PCE inflation shot up to an average rate of 5.8\npercent between February 2021 and today—a quadrupling of average inflation.12 Said simply,\nwithin a year, inflation went from consistently undershooting our 2 percent target to reaching\nlevels not seen in more than a generation.\nIn response, the Fed pivoted from a stance of sustained accommodation to one of rapid\ntightening, first through forward guidance and then through conventional increases in interest\nrates. Since March of last year, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate at every meeting, by\n9 Amano, Carter, and Leduc (2020) and Diwan, Leduc, and Mertens (2020).\n10 It also prompted a review of policy objectives and tools that could reliably deliver on this goal. See Board of\nGovernors (2020).\n11 Initially, the FOMC believed the run-up in inflation was transitory. From April through November 2021, five\nconsecutive FOMC statements described inflation developments as “largely reflecting transitory factors” or “factors\nthat are expected to be transitory.” But the word “transitory” did not appear in any subsequent FOMC statements.\nNot everyone shared this initial view that inflation would be transitory, with some commentators arguing that the\nextensive federal fiscal relief to address the pandemic could trigger a prolonged episode of high inflation. See\nBlanchard (2021) and Summers (2021).\n12 Notably, the inflation surge over the past two years has brought the price level close to a linear trend of 2\npercent growth as measured since January 2012. Stated differently, the PCE price index has risen at an average,\nannual rate of slightly above 2 percent when measured over the entire 11-year period from January 2012 through\nJanuary 2023.\n3\n\nFigure 1\nA shock to inflation\nHeadline PCE inflation, Jan 2012 to Jan 2023 (12-month rate)\nAverage Annual Inflation Rates\nJan 2012 to Feb 2021 = 1.43%\nFeb 2021 to Jan 2023 = 5.82%\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis, FRBSF staff calculations. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\na cumulative total of 4½ percentage points. This is the fastest pace of monetary policy\ntightening in 40 years. Broader financial market conditions, which capture funds rate\nmovements, along with FOMC forward guidance and the reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet,\nhave tightened even more.13\nThis tightening, while pronounced, was and remains appropriate given the magnitude and\npersistence of elevated inflation readings. Higher interest rates help bridle demand growth,\nbringing it back in line with supply. This rebalancing helps reduce inflation pressures.14\nAnd this is what we are seeing (Figure 2). The economy has been gradually slowing and inflation\nhas followed. Since June of 2022, overall inflation has been easing, falling from its highs of\naround 7 percent to its current reading of 5.4 percent in January of this year.\nThis is good news, a sign that policy is doing its job and—along with improvements in supply—\nworking to reduce the imbalances that have pushed inflation so high. But the work is far from\ndone.\n13 Choi et al. (2022).\n14 The Phillips curve summarizes the link between inflation and economic activity. For evidence, see Hazell et al.\n(2022) and Jørgensen and Lansing (2021, 2023). Shapiro (2022) decomposes inflation into demand-driven versus\nsupply-driven components.\n4\n\nFigure 2\nInflation components: Goods and services\nDecomposition of headline PCE inflation (12-month rate)\nJan2023\n5.4%\n6%\nGoods\nHousing\nOther services\nApproximation error\nHeadline\n4%\n2%\n0%\n-2%\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis, FRBSF staff calculations. Gray shading indicates NBER recession dates.\nOverall inflation remains well above target and contributions from each of the components of\ninflation—goods, housing, and other services—remain well above their historical trend (Figure\n2). Moreover, the incoming data have been bumpy. The recent PCE reading is a good example.\nAfter months of decline, headline and core inflation both ticked up in January on a 12-month\nbasis, and the monthly inflation rate rose at its fastest pace in seven months. This suggests that\nthe disinflation momentum we need is far from certain.\nPutting all of this together, it’s clear there is more work to do. In order to put this episode of\nhigh inflation behind us, further policy tightening, maintained for a longer time, will likely be\nnecessary. Restoring price stability is our mandate and it is what the American people expect.\nSo, the FOMC remains resolute in achieving this goal.\nAs we work toward that end, we must also consider the world we are entering. What will the\npressures on inflation be once the pandemic shock has fully worn off? Will we return to a world\nwhere the central bank struggles to get inflation up to target? Or has the pandemic left a more\npermanent imprint, such that the pressures on inflation now trend higher and we have to work\nto keep them at bay?\n5\n\nThe answers aren’t yet clear. But the questions are imperative.\nAn Uncharted Path\nWe know what forces drove the pre-pandemic inflation trend. And we know what forces are\ndriving the ongoing pandemic-induced inflation surge. What we don’t know is how they will\nevolve and interact after the pandemic is gone, or what this new confluence will mean for\nunderlying inflation.\nIndeed, a number of forces have either grown in importance during the pandemic era or were\nset in motion by it. And I want to touch on four in particular that could counterbalance or even\noffset entirely the deflationary trend of the past.\nOne is a decline in global price competition. If firms decide to reshore some or all of their\nforeign production facilities, costs and prices are likely to continue to rise. My conversations\nwith business leaders suggest that some of this is already happening. But it’s a major\nundertaking to completely revamp well-established production networks, and it remains to be\nseen how far this trend will go. One thing, however, is clear. Globalization has been a key driver\nof past goods deflation in the United States.15 And a trend toward less global competition could\nmean more inflation in the goods sector and more pressure on overall inflation going forward.16\nAnother potential factor affecting future inflation is the ongoing domestic labor shortage. Labor\nforce participation fell precipitously during the pandemic and has been slow to recover,\nespecially among workers aged 55 years and older. These developments exacerbate the already\nsignificant downward drag on participation related to population aging.17 Absent a substantial\npickup in the share of working-age adults looking to be employed or a large change in\nimmigration flows,18 labor force participation will continue to decline and worker shortages will\npersist, pushing up wages and ultimately prices, at least in the near and medium term.\nInflation pressures could also move upward as firms make the transition to a greener economy,\nwhich will require investment in new processes and infrastructure. As firms increase\ninvestments in renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies, they are likely to pass some\nportion of these transition costs on to consumers, boosting inflation. This increased demand for\ninvestment could raise the neutral rate of interest, at least in the short and medium term,\nlessening the importance of the zero lower bound and the downward pressures on inflation that\ncame with it.19\n15 See for example Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido (2010).\n16 See Figure 2 (green bars) for the contributions of goods inflation to overall PCE inflation over time.\n17 Hornstein and Kudlyak (2019; updated FRBSF estimates) and Montes, Smith, and Dajon (2022).\n18 Duzhak (2023).\n19 Daly (2021).\n6\n\nFinally,—and this is at the forefront of my mind as a policymaker—there is the possibility that\ninflation expectations could change. To date, these expectations—especially in the longer run—\nhave remained stable and well anchored near the Fed’s 2 percent goal.20 In other words, so far,\ninflation psychology has not shifted and public faith in the Fed’s ability to achieve its price\nstability mandate remains intact. But the longer inflation remains high, the more likely it is to\nundermine confidence. And once high inflation becomes embedded in public psychology, it is\nvery hard to change.\nAny or all of these factors could influence the natural tilt of inflation and the monetary policy\napproach necessary to maintain price stability over the long term.\nThe hard part, of course, is knowing when and how each of these factors will evolve or what\nforce they will have relative to the strong pull coming from population aging and slow\nproductivity growth. If those pre-pandemic trends reemerge as the dominant structural forces,\nthen our efforts to bring inflation down will be reinforced by natural features of the economy.\nBut if the old dynamics are eclipsed by other, newer influences and the pressures on inflation\nstart pushing upward instead of downward, then policy will likely need to do more.\nWe don’t know what the trend will be. But we do know that, while we continue to diffuse the\nongoing inflation shock, we need to be working to gather data and research that illuminates the\nlikely path forward. That’s prudent policymaking.\nThe Duality of Policymaking\nStill, when things are hard and you’re in the middle of it, it’s easy to get caught up in the here\nand now. So much so that we can forget to look forward, take stock, and imagine what the\nfuture could hold.\nBut policymaking requires it. The pandemic and its shockwaves will one day fully dissipate. And\nwe must be ready.\nSo as I close today, I will return to the question I started with: What will the Fed do next?\nMy answer: We will work on the economy we have, and prepare for the economy to come.\nThat’s what this moment demands.\nThank you.\n20 Armantier et al.

    "text": "FINAL\n“Bloom Where You’re Planted”*\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSyracuse University Commencement\nSyracuse, NY\nMay 12, 2019\n11:00AM ET\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n*This speech is dedicated to all those who helped me get here.\nIntroduction\nWow. This is awesome, and I’m not even graduating. Such a big crowd.\nSo much excitement.\nyou\nBefore I begin, I want all the graduates – and only the graduates – to\ngive yourselves a big round of applause. This is a special day, and I want to\ntake in its meaningfulness.\nThe last time I was here, I was getting my Ph.D. and serving as a\ngraduation marshal. I was excited, of course, but also slightly nervous that I\nwould mess up my role as flag bearer during our procession.\nThis is way more responsibility. But luckily, I don’t have to carry\nanything.\nChancellor Syverud, thank you so much for entrusting me with this\nhonor. And thank you for that very kind introduction.\nSince becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,\nI’ve listened to a lot of introductions about myself.\n1\n\nFINAL\nThere is a common thread in all of them. An ‘unlikely’ path. GED to PhD\nto CEO. Forty years of life condensed into three, rarely seen together,\nacronyms.\nThe question that almost always follows is: How did it happen? Am I\nexceptional? Did I see forty years ago the life I have today?\nThe answer is simple: not at all.\nBetsy\nForty years ago, I was sitting in the parking lot of a McDonald’s near\nBallwin, Missouri, where I grew up. I had driven there to meet a woman\nnamed Betsy, a friend of my high school guidance counselor.\nBetsy was in her mid-30s, a successful woman, busy building her life\nand career. I was 15, my family was in chaos, I’d dropped out of high school,\nand I was living with friends. My counselor thought Betsy could help.\nBetsy had the fanciest car I had ever seen. It had a tan leather interior,\nand when the sun shined in, it felt warm and safe. It was a refuge.\nMy counselor was right. Betsy took me under her wing. She encouraged\nme to get a GED. She paid $216 for my first semester of college. [I know, it’s\nhard to believe.] And that started the journey that led me here, to a PhD from\nSyracuse University.\nBut those are the highlights of the story, and they don’t capture how\nBetsy really changed my life.\nSitting in that car, feeling like my world was out of control, I wanted\nBetsy to give me answers, to fix things. Instead, she told me:\n“Mary, you have to bloom where you’re planted.”\n2\n\nFINAL\nI was shocked. I immediately protested. I said it wasn’t fair. I didn’t\nknow how to manage my life. I was only 15. It all seemed too much.\nI blamed others. I blamed myself. For a moment, I even blamed her. I felt\nlost.\nHow was I going to make it?\nMary, you have to bloom where you’re planted.\nSo she said it again. More gently this time.\nBuilding resiliency\nThe fact that you have to start from where you are is hard. It’s an easy\nstatement to understand, but a much tougher one to accept.\nLife can be unfair. Not everyone begins from the same position. And as\nyou go out in the world, you may find yourself short of where you think you\nshould be.\nSometimes it knocks the wind out of you. Sometimes it makes you\nangry. It always leaves you feeling a little unsure.\nMy situation was tough. Betsy never denied it. But she told me that I had\none life, and I shouldn’t let it be defined by the bad draw I’d gotten.\nHer advice was to accept my frustration and sadness, and let it inform –\nbut not determine – my future. Let it serve as a reminder, but not a barrier.\nfreeing\nI’ll be honest… accepting my situation was difficult. But I also found it\n.\nIt meant I could change my life. That my presence mattered. That I had\nsome say in my own success.\nIt helped me be resilient, and it allowed me to bounce back, make my\n3\nway, and stand in front of you today.\n\nFINAL\nBloom where you’re planted\nBut acceptance and blooming aren’t the same. So how do you thrive?\nFor me, it’s been about being open.\nEvery week when I saw Betsy, she had a new book for me. Sometimes it\nwas about art, sometimes history, maybe even poetry. And always, there were\nthe biographies.\nI drank it all in. And it let me live in a world beyond my own experience.\nMy father was a postman. My mom stayed home and took care of us. I\nhad loved school, but the challenges of our daily lives consumed me. And they\ncrowded out my interest in other things. They made me insular, and inward-\nfacing. They left me feeling alone.\nBetsy’s books took me outside myself. They generated ideas –\nperspectives I’d never considered, concepts I’d never thought of. They also\nshowed me paths – taken by other people, people I didn’t know – that seemed\nhope\ncompletely improbable and wildly unrealistic.\nThey sparked .\nSo when Betsy suggested I get a GED, I was willing to give it a try.\nGrowing into yourself\nBut that’s not the end of the story. Betsy is a nudger. I’d get one thing\ndone, and she would suggest another, even more improbable sounding\npossibility. Once I had a GED, she suggested I go to college.\nI’d never imagined college – I’d barely heard of it. But I wanted to be\nlike Betsy. And I certainly didn’t want to let her down. So I went.\n4\n\nFINAL\nI was in way over my head during my first semesters of college.\nFamiliar feelings crept in. Fear, mostly. A sense that maybe I didn’t belong, and\nI couldn’t make it.\nSo I worked day and night, and took as many classes as allowed, all in an\nattempt to catch up and boost my confidence. I told myself I could fake it until\nI made it.\nAnd I did make it. But not in the linear, predictable fashion you might\nthink.\nI graduated with a degree in economics… and philosophy. But I loved\nthe arts, and got my first jobs out of college at a theatre, and a dance company.\nmicro social\nEventually I returned to economics and public policy, which brought me to\nmacro monetary\nSyracuse. And after getting a PhD in economics and policy, I chose\na job working on economics and policy at the San Francisco\nFed.\nNow when people hear these details, they often conclude that I must be\nwhen\namazingly self-assured. But the truth is, I’ve spent years struggling with my\nconfidence. Wondering , not if, I would be found out.\nWhen would people dig through the veneer I had created and discover\nthat, beneath the degrees, the accomplishments, and the contributions, I was\nsimply an imposter – that scared kid in Betsy’s car.\nHere is the big reveal. True confidence came only recently for me.\nMostly because I spent years focusing on the wrong thing.\nOther people weren’t waiting to criticize me, or judge me for my past. I\nwas doing that to myself. I was constantly trying to rise above my background.\nThe secret all along was to just embrace it.\n5\n\nFINAL\nMy experiences absolutely define me, but in a way I hadn’t been able to\nsee. They make me focus on others, be tolerant of fresh starts, celebrate wins,\ndespite because\nand look for ways to contribute.\nIn other words, I’m not who I am my life. I am who I am\nof it.\nDon’t go it alone\nSo with all those shrouds of doubt laying over me, how did I ever come\nto see who I was? With the help of many others.\nWe’re often taught to admire people who pull themselves up by their\nbootstraps and forge a path completely on their own. It can make it hard to be\nvulnerable, and ask someone for help.\nBut I didn’t have the luxury of standing alone when I met Betsy at 15.\nAnd it taught me that we all need Betsys – in fact, we need a lot of them\nthroughout our lives.\nA few years ago, I received an award from my undergraduate school –\nthe University of Missouri-Kansas City – for ‘defying the odds.’ Winning the\naward was a great honor. But the most amazing part was getting to invite all\nthe people who had helped me get there.\nMy wife Shelly and I hosted a dinner of gratitude. Betsy was there, of\ncourse. But so was my sixth grade best friend… my undergraduate economics\nprofessor – a fellow Syracuse grad! – who drove from Phoenix to attend… the\ncouple who brought me into their home in Kansas City when I felt homesick.\nAnd there were many others, too.\n6\n\nFINAL\nThey all had one thing in common. They had been my supporters.\nListening when I needed to talk, believing in me when I lost faith, and pushing\nme when I got stuck.\nlesser\nWhen I looked around that table, I can tell you with complete certainty\nthat my life wasn’t because I’d gotten help along the way. It was far, far\nricher.\nEmbrace your path\nToday is about celebrating your accomplishments. It’s about taking in\nyour time here, and looking forward to your future.\nBut my advice isn’t for today.\nIt’s for all your future days. The ones that make you stretch and grow as\nyou learn who you are, and what you want to contribute.\nAnd on those days, I hope you’ll be open. Open to opportunities you\nhaven’t yet conceived of, and to paths you’ve never imagined.\nDon’t worry if your journey wanders, or if your seemingly perfect plans\nend up being not quite right. This is just part of exploring, and it helps you\nfigure out what’s right for you.\nAnd when something goes wrong, and fear and worry creep in, I hope\nyou’ll remember Betsy’s words: You have to bloom where you’re planted.\nYou may not always be in control of where you land. But you can\nabsolutely decide how you’re going to live there.\nOwn your situation. Let it make you resilient. Let it fuel your confidence.\nBe vulnerable enough to ask for help, and be brave enough to take it.\n7\n\nFINAL\nIf you do these things, I promise: you’ll be great. Able to thrive in the\nmost unlikely of places. Able to achieve the completely improbable and the\nwildly unrealistic.\nThank you, and congratulations. I can’t wait to see who you become.\n8",

    "text": "What Will Your Letter Say?\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUtah Valley University Commencement\nOrem, Utah\nMay 6, 2022\nThank you for that kind introduction. I’m so happy to be here and honored to be part of your\ncelebration.\nSpeaking of celebrating, before I get started, I would like all the graduates—and only the graduates—to\ngive yourselves a big round of applause. This is a special day, and I want each of you to take in its\nmeaningfulness. For everyone else—family, friends, professors, university leaders—these graduates are\nour future and I stand with you in looking forward to what they will do.\nNow the last time I sat where you are today was 1994, almost 30 years ago. I was graduating with my\nPh.D. from Syracuse University and looking forward to my new life as an economist. So when I got my\nfirst job in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco I was excited. And in\n2018, when I got the job I have now as president and CEO I was ecstatic.\nWhen the job as President became available, I knew I was qualified. But I also knew the competition\nwould be tough. After all, the Fed is a storied institution. Many of the world’s great economists have\npassed through its doors. Most of my colleagues arrived from schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and\nStanford—pedigrees that could be intimidating. And now I was competing against hundreds of\napplicants inside and outside of the Fed with portfolios that I thought could be better than mine.\nAnd so, I did what many of us do to stand out: I wrote a beautiful cover letter. It was truly a work of art.\nIt expounded on history, the state of the nation, and how my long list of credentials, accumulated over\nmy career, were meant for an opportunity like this. One week later when I finished, I proudly showed it\nto an acquaintance who had experience in hiring. And she said, “Wow Mary, this letter is amazing.” And\nthen she said, “…but anyone could have written it.”\nMy heart sank, but I also knew she was right. I had written the letter I thought the hiring committee\nwanted to read. And I was presenting the person I thought I needed to be to get the job. A person, in\nmy mind, who bore only an abstract resemblance to the real me.\nLet me tell you about the real me: I grew up in Ballwin, Missouri. And when I was fifteen, I dropped out\nof high school. My family was struggling and I thought my time would be better spent earning an income.\nSo, I cobbled together a schedule of odd jobs. I worked at a donut shop and at Target, hoping to\n1\n\neventually become a bus driver—stable employment with good income and benefits. By an unexpected\ntwist of fate, I met someone who encouraged me to get a GED. Later, I became the first in my family to\nattend and graduate from college.\nThat was my story, and it was—to put it mildly—very different from most of my colleagues and anyone\nelse who had ever held the position I was trying to get. So I left it out of the letter and focused on\ncredentials and accomplishments and things that made me similar rather than different.\nAnd it wasn’t the first time I had done this. In my early years at the Fed, I felt the need to fit into a\ncertain mold. So, I went shopping. I bought pearls and skirt suits, even a scoop neck sweater. Now\nanyone who knows me, or has even seen me, knows that I’m most comfortable in slacks and a collared\nshirt, my outfit of choice most days. But back then, I dressed as the person I thought people wanted to\nsee. I even tried to style my hair a certain way. I worked to become economist Mary, rather than just\nMary.\nBut that mindset spread and began to permeate everything. In conversations with colleagues, I was\ncareful not to veer into topics that were too personal. I tried not to reveal too much of my background.\nI kept things focused on work, job, and contribution, all with the view that people can’t judge what they\ndon’t know.\nPretending, as it turns out, is exhausting. It is also hugely limiting. I was sitting on a mountain of\nexperience that gave me unique insight into how the economy functions. As a kid from Missouri, I\nwitnessed firsthand how people get left behind—fall through the cracks—and the lasting impact,\ngenerations out, that this can have on families. I saw the toll that poverty takes and the stress people\nfeel when they don’t have opportunities. But I never talked about it. And so on the outside I looked like\neveryone else. I had become Mary the economist with a job as a researcher, instead of Mary from\nMissouri with a GED.\nThe irony of course, is that no one actually asked me to play a role. I had done this to myself. And when I\nstarted to understand that, I started to change. Gradually. Little by little, I shed the pearls and the skirts.\nI let my hair be wild. I even agreed to a profile story in a major news outlet that revealed personal\ndetails about my past.\nGetting the space to be myself was a remarkable gift. I felt newly at ease, and that ease translated into\nopportunities. By being open and me—all of me—I attracted people with diverse ideas. I connected my\nexperiences with my research and found capacity that I didn’t know I had. I became so much better at\nmy job. But mostly I found fortitude and confidence from aligning my inner with my outer self. Mary\nwith a GED who also had a Ph.D. And perhaps unsurprisingly, my career took off.\nWhich brings me back to 2018, 20 years after I stopped wearing pearls, applying for the top job at the\nbank where I had built my career, and here I was back to my old habits. Once again, playing a role. Back\nto being the Mary that I thought people wanted.\nSo, I re-wrote the letter. But this time, I leaned into my story. I talked about my life growing up in\nBallwin, MO, the eldest of four siblings, in a family with challenges, and how those experiences helped\nme understand the responsibility of institutions and the honor of serving others. I also talked about\ndignity and the importance of the economy in creating and sustaining opportunities for everyone. I\n2\n\nwrote it in two hours. And no one else could have written it. And when I hit send, I felt absolutely\nterrified.\nOf course, we all know how the story ends. Six months and many interviews later, I got the job—not in\nspite of where I came from, but, in part, because of it. And I relearned what I’d learned many times\nbefore. Difference, my difference, is a virtue, not a weakness.\nAnd this brings me to the time in my speech where I very much want to impart some lasting wisdom. A\nphilosophy for how to live your life and accomplish your dreams. It’s simple: “Be yourself.” “Stay true to\nwho you are.” This is good advice. You should do those things. But the truth is, you probably already\nknow that.\nWhat you might not know—what I have learned over the course of my 30-year career—is that being\nyourself isn’t a switch that you can simply turn on. It’s a journey of discovery, and it’s one that you will\nhave to take over and over again.\nThroughout your lives and career, you will likely lose yourself here and there. You will drift away from\nthe person you know you are. You may feel out of sorts or like you don’t fit in. And you may want to\nhide. And in those times, you very well might do as I have done, and take refuge behind a mask of your\nown making. And that’s okay. It’s part of being human.\nThere is safety in conformity. Being yourself, especially when yourself is different from others, can feel\nrisky. It leaves all of us feeling vulnerable and exposed. But as you embark on your careers—as you\nstretch for new things and find yourself in unfamiliar places—find your way back, return to the core of\nwho you are. That is the place from which your greatness will grow.\nYou are the sum total of every experience, every triumph, and every hardship that you have endured.\nAnd this singular equation is your superpower. It is the secret combination that unlocks your innate\ntalents and sets you apart from every other person you meet. It is what makes your letter uniquely\nyours.\nAnd so, class of 2022: what will your letter say?\nMy wish for you is that it will say the things you are most afraid to reveal. That these revelations will\nupend assumptions about who belongs where. That your bravery will fly in the face of the worry and\nfear and all of the other emotions that arise when we strive for something more. And most of all, I hope\nyour letter will be unmistakably, unapologetically, you.\nAnd to that you, I say: Congratulations on this momentous achievement of your graduation. I cannot\nwait to see what amazing things you will do.\n3",

    "text": "This Time Is Different…Because We Are\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nLos Angeles World Affairs Council & Town Hall\nLos Angeles, CA\nFebruary 23, 2022\n12:30 PM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIt’s hard to believe it’s been almost two years since COVID-19 hit our shores. And while it’s not\nfully behind us, we’ve come a long way, especially in the economy. Growth is up.\nUnemployment is down. And people are getting back to their lives.\nBut as anyone who has shopped, bought gas, or paid rent lately knows, inflation is high—higher\nthan it has been in nearly four decades.\nFor some, this is a sign that price stability is at risk. That, absent aggressive action by the Fed,\nthe economy will be propelled into a 1970s-style “Great Inflation.”\nLike many of you, I lived through that time. I remember my parents’ daily complaints about\nrising prices and rising bills, and the hours-long waits at gas stations in the hot Missouri sun,\nstuck to the vinyl seats of our station wagon.\nHigh and rising inflation made life harder. And there was no end in sight.\nBut the picture today looks different. And so does the Federal Reserve. We have evolved as an\ninstitution, and our understanding and tools have evolved as well. I’ll spend my time today\ntalking about how this evolution makes us better prepared to meet our dual mandate goals of\nprice stability and full employment, even in these challenging times.\n1\n\nFirst, I want to remind you that the views I will express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nThen…\nBefore I talk about what’s different this time, let me talk about what exactly happened during\nthe “Great Inflation.” What was it like?\nFrom about the mid-1960s through the early 1980s, American households faced an unrelenting\nrise in prices. The worst of it came during the 1970s, when the cost of living for the average\nfamily more than doubled.1 The stress in our nation was palpable. Businesses and families lost\nconfidence, and many struggled simply to make ends meet.2\nPeople wondered how it had happened.\nThe answer, of course, is complicated. But I will focus on a few factors that I think are\nparticularly relevant for today’s discussion.3\nThe first has to do with fundamental economic changes and our inability back then to measure\nand understand them in real time.\nFor example, after decades of rapid postwar GDP growth, led by booming technological\nadvancements and rising labor productivity, U.S. productivity growth had started to slow. This\nmeant that the capacity of the economy to expand without spurring inflation was much more\nlimited than it had been in previous decades.4\nAt the same time, the labor market was changing. Young baby boomers were joining the labor\nforce in large numbers and altering the age composition and the dynamics of the workforce. In\nparticular, they were taking longer to find jobs and churning through more opportunities as they\nfound their preferred path. This behavior, which is completely natural, increased the “steady-\n1 This pace was three times faster than it had been the previous decade. See consumer price index (CPI).\nhttps://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUSR0000SA0\n2 The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index reached its all-time low of 51.7 in May 1980 when CPI\ninflation over the preceding 12 months had exceeded 14 percent. The most recent preliminary estimate of the\nsentiment index in February 2022 was 61.7. www.sca.isr.umich.edu/tables.html\n3 For an overview of research that seeks to explain the Great Inflation, see Lansing (2000) and Bryan (2013).\n4 Basu and Fernald (2002).\n2\n\nstate” rate of unemployment, a benchmark policymakers used to judge how close the economy\nwas to full employment and full capacity.5\nLooking back, it’s clear that policymakers missed some critical shifts. Without the data, tools,\nand focus on real-time monitoring, they—and macro forecasters more broadly—expected the\neconomy to behave as it had before, for inflation to fall as the economy and labor force grew.6\nThese views, in part, kept the Fed from acting forcefully to offset rising inflation.7\nBut the story doesn’t end there. The Fed’s policy misses were amplified and perpetuated by\ninstitutional factors and by its own communication strategy.\nLet’s start with institutional factors. At the time, there was a very tight link between price and\nwage inflation. Many employment contracts included automatic cost-of-living adjustments, or\nCOLAs, which meant that when prices went up, wages soon followed.8 Firms then passed on\nthese increased labor costs to prices, and so it went, again and again, in a self-perpetuating\nupward inflation spiral.\nWhen two oil price shocks created even higher inflation, prices and wages grew in near\nlockstep. And here is where the Fed’s own communication practices exacerbated things.\nThe Fed and many central banks at the time held the view that transparency and\ncommunication were more costly than beneficial. Central bankers actively avoided sharing\ninformation, believing that such communications might constrain their ability to nimbly adjust\npolicy, or even dilute its impact.9,10\nBecause of this, the Fed operated largely behind closed doors. The public became aware of Fed\npolicy actions by watching how markets reacted following Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) meetings. And the main source of information that market participants, households,\nand businesses had about the Fed’s commitment to price stability was what they could glean\nfrom incoming inflation data.\nFigure 1\n5 Crump et al. (2019).\n6 DeLong (1997) and Taylor (1997).\n7 Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000), Orphanides (2003), Primiceri (2006), and Romer and Romer (2013). Political\npressures also played a role in the Fed’s decision to keep policy accommodative. See Weise (2012).\n8 Ragan and Bratsberg (2000).\n9 Cukierman and Meltzer (1986) and Bernanke (2007a). Bernanke noted, “Since 1975, the Federal Reserve has\npresented testimony twice each year to the Congress on the conduct of monetary policy.” So there was at least\nsome communication to the public about policy back then. Before the 1990s, however, inflation targets, FOMC\nstatements, and other communications were not publicly shared as they are now.\n10 In the June 2003 FOMC meeting, then-Chair Alan Greenspan advised participants to be “very vague” in response\nto questions about the conduct of monetary policy. See Federal Open Market Committee (2003).\n3\n\nThe result was predictable.\nAnd you can see it in this figure. The green and blue lines show two measures of actual inflation\nand the red line shows inflation expectations.\nClearly, the more inflation rose, the more consumers and businesses expected it to rise. As\ninflation moved up, so did inflation expectations.11 These expectations of future inflation were\nthen built into wage and price contracts.\nBefore long, inflation dynamics and future inflation were deeply intertwined with inflation\npsychology. And with the Fed offering little guidance or reassurance that it would do something\nabout it, the situation snowballed.\nIt wasn’t until the Fed implemented a series of steep interest rate hikes that inflation finally\nstarted to recede.\n…Now\nNow inflation is high again and many are concerned that we could soon be facing another long\nand painful period, followed by another long and painful correction.\n11 Cogley and Sbordone (2008) and Lansing (2009).\n4\n\nBut that’s not what I see. Let me explain.\nYou’ve heard many, including me, talk about how inflation itself is different this time. It’s been\npushed up by pandemic-related imbalances between policy-supported demand, which has\nremained robust, and COVID-disrupted supply, which has been slow to recover. Both of these\nfactors should recede as the pandemic weakens its grip.\nAnd the economy is also different. There are weaker links between wage and price inflation,\ngreater global price competition, and a number of longer-term structural factors, including an\naging population, that will continue to exert downward pressure on growth and inflation once\nthe pandemic is behind us.12\nBut these are not the differences that matter most. The main reason I’m confident we are not\nheading for another 1970s-style Great Inflation is that the Federal Reserve is different. And I’m\nnot referring to the people of the Fed, who clearly have changed, but to the practices and\nbeliefs, which have changed even more.\nOne major evolution that separates today’s Federal Reserve from the Fed of 50 years ago is a\ndeep understanding that inflation expectations influence future inflation.13 If people expect\ninflation to persist, then it does.14\nThis understanding led the Fed, and economists more broadly, to a critical insight: in order to\nmanage actual inflation, policymakers also have to manage inflation psychology.15 The Fed has\nto enlist the help of households, businesses, and market participants in the job of fighting\ninflation, by communicating with them about its commitment to price stability and its plan to\nachieve it.\nActing on this insight required a radical transformation. The Fed had to break open its “black\nbox” of decision-making and embrace transparency.\nFigure 2\n12 Eichengreen (2015), Gordon (2015), and Laubach and Williams (2016).\n13 Orphanides and Williams (2005) and Bernanke (2007b).\n14 Gürkaynak, Levin, and Swanson (2010).\n15 In October 1979, at the height of the Great Inflation, Fed Chair Paul Volcker (1979) famously observed, “Inflation\nfeeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to\nbreak the grip of inflationary expectations.”\n5\n\nSource: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nTo understand the magnitude of this transformation, you have to recall that, for most of its\nhistory, the Fed was uncommunicative.\nThe first step in its communications “revolution” came in 1994, when the Fed began releasing\npost-FOMC meeting statements (see Figure 2).16 In the mid-2000s, the Fed went further,\npublishing the Summary of Economic Projections to provide the public with information about\nthe expected path of the economy and interest rates. In 2012, the Fed announced its first\nexplicit inflation target, 2 percent.17 And in 2020, we introduced a new monetary policy\nframework, which outlined principles for managing our inflation and employment mandates in a\nvariety of economic conditions.18\nAs the figure illustrates, the Fed went from being mostly silent to explicitly and intentionally\ntransparent.\nThe effects of these efforts can be seen in the data.\nWith greater transparency came more stable inflation expectations, which, since the late 1990s,\nhave remained well anchored around 2 percent through spikes or drops in the inflation rate.19\n16 Revolution was the term then-Vice Chair Janet Yellen used to describe the evolution of communication at the\nFederal Reserve. See Yellen (2012).\n17 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20120125c.htm\n18 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm\n19 Williams (2006), Bernanke (2007b), and Jørgensen and Lansing (2022).\n6\n\nEven today, with inflation at a 40-year high, long-run inflation expectations of businesses have\nremained quite stable.20 And financial market expectations have also been well anchored, as\nevidenced by long-term interest rates staying low despite the current inflation shock.\nThis tells us that businesses and markets are listening. They’re hearing the Fed’s\ncommunications and believe that we will act on our commitments.\nIn practice, greater transparency, better communication, and the era of well-anchored inflation\nexpectations built Fed credibility. And this credibility provides an important insurance. It makes\nthe economy more resilient and less vulnerable to painful periods like the one we experienced\nin the 1970s.21 And it gives all economic agents, not just the Fed, a role to play in helping the\neconomy smooth through inflation and other shocks, making it more resilient to whatever\nchanges are on the horizon.\nMost importantly, greater transparency and a strong commitment to achieving our goals\nassures Americans that periods of high inflation or unemployment will not last forever; that\nthere is an end in sight.\nFocused and Aware\nBut transparency is not a destination, it’s a practice. And it requires ongoing communication if\nwe are to keep the credibility that we so value.\nIn that spirit, let me tell you about how I see the economy today and the policy adjustments\nthat will be needed to move us to a sustainable path.\nLet’s start with the economy. By almost any measure, it is doing well. GDP growth, consumer\nspending, and business investment are all up, and the labor market continues to post solid job\ngains, low unemployment, and strong wage growth. Importantly, labor market gains have been\nbroad based, occurring for a wide range of groups, including those who are traditionally\ndisadvantaged—African Americans, Hispanics, and people with less than a college education.\nOf course, as everyone knows, inflation is too high, and inflation pressures have begun to\nspread outside of sectors most directly affected by pandemic-related disruptions.22 Most\n20 See Survey of Professional Forecasters. https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-\nresearch/survey-of-professional-forecasters\n21 Indeed, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke (2003) observed that during the Great Inflation, “the Fed’s loss of\ncredibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.”\n22 Lansing, Oliveira, and Shapiro (2022).\n7\n\nstrikingly, average Americans, like my parents five decades ago, are worrying about rising prices\nand rising bills.\nThis means it is time to move away from the extraordinary support that the Fed has been\nproviding during the pandemic and bring monetary policy in line with the challenges of today.\nAbsent any significant negative surprises, I see our next meeting, in March, as the appropriate\ntime to begin this adjustment.\nThe timing and magnitude of future funds rate and balance sheet adjustments will depend on\nhow the economy and the data evolve. And this will depend on how well we transition from\npandemic to endemic; how much and how quickly supply chains recover; how rapidly workers\nsidelined by health, family care, or other COVID-related barriers return to the labor force; and\nhow quickly the fiscal boost that aided spending in 2020 and 2021 fades. We will closely watch\nall of these developments and let the data determine the appropriate path of policy.\nAs we adjust policy and move into a post-pandemic world, we will also have to keep in mind\nthat many of the challenges that existed pre-pandemic will likely still be with us. Notable for\npolicy are slower global growth, less monetary and fiscal policy space, and the associated\ndownward pressure on inflation.23\nAgainst this backdrop, the next few years will require focused awareness; focus on bringing\ninflation back down to levels consistent with price stability and delivering a labor market that\nworks for everyone; and awareness, of the uncertainty that lies ahead and the challenges that\nare surely before us.\nThat for me is the main lesson of the Great Inflation. It’s not really about the Fed. It’s not even\nreally about economics.\nIt’s about humility.\nIt’s about knowing that ours is an economy in transition. And that none of us knows for sure\nwhat the new future holds.\n23 Fernald and Li (2019) and Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013). These and other developments help explain the steady\ndecline in the neutral policy rate, which over the past 30 years has been more prone to reaching the zero lower\nbound. See Mertens and Williams (2021).\n8\n\nWe need to move forward with confidence—in our policy, in our tools, and in the credibility the\nFed has built. But we also have to remember that evolution isn’t static. And to meet the needs\nof a constantly changing economy, we have to be constantly changing.\nToday’s Federal Reserve looks different than it did 50 years ago. And I expect that it will look\ndifferent again in 50 more.\nAnd that will be a good thing. It will mean the evolution continued. And that next time will also\nbe different.\nThank you.\n9\n\nReferences\nBasu, Susanto, and John G.

    "text": "Calibrating Policy in an Uncertain Time\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSalt Lake Chamber, Salt Lake City, UT\nApril 12, 2023, 9 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nGood morning. It’s great to be here in Utah. I am especially delighted to be with all of you at\nthe Salt Lake Chamber, this time live and in person. So, thank you very much for the invitation,\nand I look forward to a great discussion.\nTop of mind for many of you are recent stresses in the banking system and what they mean for\nbusinesses, consumers, and the broader economy.\nThe most important thing to know is this: The banking system is sound and resilient. As my\ncolleagues Chair Powell and Vice Chair Barr have said, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Department of the Treasury took decisive actions to\nprotect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system.1 These\nactions demonstrate that we are committed to ensuring that all deposits are safe. We will\ncontinue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our\ntools for any size institution, as needed, to keep the system safe and sound.2 The strength of\nour financial system rests on having a wide range of institutions, including regional and\n1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023b).\n2 With the support of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board also created the Bank Term Funding Program to\nensure that banks that hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par; see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve (2023a). This program, along with the normal discount window, ensures\nthat banks have the liquidity they need.\n1\n\ncommunity banks. And we are committed to supporting all institutions and the valuable role\nthey play in our financial system.\nFinally, as many of you know, the Federal Reserve Board, under the direction of Vice Chair for\nSupervision Michael Barr, is currently conducting a thorough review of the supervision and\nregulation of Silicon Valley Bank before its failure. This review will be completed by May 1, at\nwhich time the Board will share the results publicly.\nWhile the recent banking stresses have received a lot of attention, they are only part of the\neconomic picture right now. In the remainder of my time today, I will discuss the full slate of\nfactors the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) must consider as we work to assess the\neconomy and calibrate monetary policy in this uncertain time.\nBut before I go on, let me say that the remarks I make today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nOngoing Economic Strength and High Inflation\nBy almost any measure, the U.S. economy remains strong. GDP growth, consumer spending,\nand the labor market all continue to outperform expectations. Moreover, these indicators are\nexpanding at rates well above levels consistent with returning inflation to the FOMC’s longer-\nrun goal of 2 percent on average over time.\nWe see this strength most clearly in the labor market. The U.S. economy has added close to\n350,000 jobs per month over the first three months of this year. This far exceeds the 90,000\njobs needed each month to keep up with the growth of the labor force. This has kept\nunemployment historically low and job vacancies unusually high, especially for firms in rapidly\ngrowing sectors including travel, leisure, and hospitality, among others.\nOf course, there are a number of signs that the labor market is starting to cool, but it remains\nextremely tight and is likely to come back into balance only gradually.3\nThe sustained imbalances in the economy have translated into persistently high inflation, well\nabove the Fed’s 2 percent target.4 The most recent data tell the story. Looking at the personal\nconsumption expenditures, or PCE, price index, the Fed’s primary measure of inflation, it rose 5\npercent over the 12 months ending in February, the latest reading we have. That’s down from\n3 Signs of cooling include the following. Average hourly earnings growth over the previous 12 months has\nmoderated from 5.9% in March 2022 to 4.2% in March 2023. The quits rate is down to 2.6% from a high of 3%. And\nthe number of job openings fell below 10 million in February from above 12 million in March 2022.\n4 Federal Open Market Committee (2023) specifies the 2 percent target as measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures.\n2\n\nthe peak of 7 percent in the middle of last year, but not yet close to levels consistent with price\nstability.\nAnd American families are feeling the impact. This is apparent in sentiment surveys and well\nsummarized by a single striking fact:5 For most workers, inflation is rising faster than wage\ngrowth, consistently eroding purchasing power and leaving them worse off over time.6\nMy colleagues and I are deeply aware of the toll that high inflation takes on the economy and\nthe lives and livelihoods of all Americans, especially those least able to bear it. And we remain\nresolute and committed to bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal. It is essential for both\nsides of our mandate, and we have the tools and the resolve to get the job done.\nPolicy Decisions under Uncertainty\nAnd that brings me to policy and what lies ahead in terms of our decisions. We have taken\naggressive action over the past year, moving the federal funds rate from near zero to between\n4.75 and 5 percent as of our March meeting. These actions have been warranted and\nconsistent with our commitment to restore price stability.\nWhile the full impact of this policy tightening is still making its way through the system, the\nstrength of the economy and the elevated readings on inflation suggest that there is more work\nto do.\nHow much more depends on several factors, all with considerable uncertainty attached to their\nevolution.\nFor one, there is the banking stress and the impact that it could have on credit conditions.\nHistory tells us that as banks evaluate the changing economic outlook and manage their liquidity\nand balance sheets, they are likely to tighten credit availability.\n5 According to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, higher prices have consistently been the most\ncited reason among respondents over the past 12 months who have indicated that their families were worse off\nfinancially than they were one year earlier. Furthermore, the number of Google searches for “inflation” continues\nto be elevated by historical standards.\n6 The consumer price index (CPI) and PCE price index have risen faster than average hourly earnings over the past\nyear. In addition, for full-time wage and salary workers, between the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of\n2022 (latest available), real weekly earnings fell for those at the 50th percentile and above when earnings are\ndeflated by the headline PCE index, and they fell for those at the 25th percentile and above when earnings are\ndeflated by the headline CPI index.\n3\n\nWe are already starting to see this in the data. Credit standards have risen over the past year\nand are expected to increase further in coming quarters.7 And recent data on lending activity\nalready point to declines in lending volumes in several sectors.8\nHow much credit tightening will ultimately occur is not yet known. What we do know is that\ntighter credit conditions translate into less spending and investment by households and\nbusinesses, resulting in a slower pace of economic growth. So we will need to monitor this\nimpact carefully as we determine our own policy path.\nA second factor affecting the economy and our decisions is developments in the global\neconomy. Global monetary policy tightening, international bank conditions, and greater fiscal\nrestraint abroad all translate into slower global growth.9 This serves as a headwind to U.S.\ngrowth and could also help temper commodity and goods price inflation. Again, the extent of\nthese global headwinds and their impact on U.S. growth and inflation is unknown, so careful\nmonitoring will be required.\nFinally, there is the impact of our own monetary policy actions. The FOMC has increased the\npolicy rates considerably over the past year, and it will likely take some time for those increases\nto take their full effect. But how much more time and how much additional slowing is coming is\nunclear. So like the other factors I have mentioned, we will need to carefully monitor the\nsituation as we assess what it means for policy.\nThe Prudence of Data Dependence\nIn all actions, the FOMC is guided by a commitment to our mandated goals of full employment\nand price stability. When we are off either of our goals, Americans bear the cost, and we have\nan urgency to restore balance. But that urgency must be coupled with an awareness of the\nuncertainty we are facing, and the risks it poses to the economy.\nLooking ahead, there are good reasons to think that policy may have to tighten more to bring\ninflation down. But there are also good reasons to think that the economy may continue to\nslow, even without additional policy adjustments.\n7 According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS), domestic banks have been tightening credit\nstandards for commercial and industrial loans to large and midsize firms, as well as for consumer loans over the\npast year.\n8 Over a two-week period following the recent banking stress, banks cut back corporate and real estate lending as\nthey experienced a large decline in deposits. Moreover, financial institutions participating in the Dallas Fed's\nBanking Conditions Survey reported a decline, on net, in total volume of lending in late March relative to early\nFebruary.\n9 Credit default swap spreads of several major European banks increased in response to recent conditions in the\nbanking sector. On fiscal policy, the European Commission indicated that it supports the pullback from broad-based\nstimulus (see https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_23_2010).\n4\n\nSo, we will need to make decisions calibrated by data. Not just last week’s data or last month’s\ndata, but all the data. Looking back and looking ahead as we navigate the uncertainty that\nsurrounds us. This is what prudent policymaking requires, and what restoring price stability and\nachieving both of our mandates demands.\nThank you.\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2023a. “Federal Reserve Board announces it will\nmake available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the\nability to meet the needs of all their depositors.” Press release, March 12.\nBoard of Governors. 2023b. “Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC.” Joint press\nrelease, March 12.\nFederal Open Market Committee. 2023. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”\nAdopted effective January 24, 2012; as reaffirmed effective January 31, 2023.\n5",

    "text": "FINAL\nLessons from History, Policy for Today\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nEconomic Club of New York Virtual Webinar\nNew York, NY\nMarch 2, 2021\n02:00 PM EST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nIn February of last year, right before COVID-19 hit our shores, I was in\nIreland. Walking around Dublin one day, I happened upon a converted\nwarehouse with artists selling their work. One of the artists had a wall of\nbeautifully colored, tiny framed prints. Each one was etched with the phrase\n“History Will Repeat Itself” followed by an arrow pointing to the future. It\nseemed a pessimistic, almost fatalistic view, so I asked him if he had painted it\nout of prophecy or fear. He answered, somewhat gruffly, “Both.”\nAs an unrelenting optimist, I saw something different in his work—the\npotential for agency. For people and institutions to learn from the past and\nuse those lessons to shape a better future.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have a practical test before us. With much\nwelcomed light at the end of the COVID tunnel, we must work to return the\neconomy to full employment and price stability. This is a tall order. Millions of\nAmericans are out of work and inflation remains well below our target.\nAt the same time, a swell of market and academic commentary has\nstarted to emerge about a quick snapback, an undesirable pickup in inflation,\n1\n\nFINAL\nand the need for the Federal Reserve to withdraw accommodation more\n1\nquickly than expected. I see this as the tug of fear. The reaction to a memory\nof high and rising inflation, an inexorable link between unemployment, wages\nand prices, and a Federal Reserve that once fell behind the policy curve.\nBut the world today is different, and we can’t let those memories, those\nscars, dictate current and future policy. We need to learn from history\nwithout letting it drive our actions. We must consider all the lessons from our\npast, not just the ones that frighten us.\nThis is what I will tackle today.\nBut before I go further, let me remind you that my remarks are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nStudents of History\nThe Old Normal\nI started at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 1996 and\nbecame deeply steeped in the standard macroeconomic logic that many of us\nlearned. It goes like this. There is a level of unemployment in the economy\nbelow which wage and price inflation will start to pick up. Once that begins,\nthe feedback loop between prices and wages and wages and prices will spiral\nand be hard to control. So, prudent central bankers should avoid that\nsituation, even try to stave it off. Given that monetary policy works with a lag,\nthis means we need to be forward-looking and respond to expected future\ninflation to ensure that actual inflation remains close to target.\n1\n2\nSee, for example, discussion in Casselman (2021) and Irwin (2021).\n\nFINAL\nIn this simple model, our key tool was, among others, the Phillips Curve,\nwhich captures the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. The\nPhillips Curve had the additional feature of delivering a non-accelerating\ninflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU, which could be used to gauge the\nexpectations\nlevel of full employment. We also applied expectations theory, which posits\nthat future inflation depends largely on about future inflation.\nWith these tools in hand, it felt straightforward to assess where the\neconomy stood relative to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals. If\nunemployment was below or projected to be below NAIRU, wage and price\ninflation would start to build and economic agents would begin to expect\nhigher future inflation. A responsive and proactive Fed would pull the reins\non growth and the labor market and broader economy would settle at our full\nemployment and price stability goals.\nOf course, many other factors made this very simple system work. First,\nthe real neutral rate of interest, or r-star, was well above zero, roughly in the\nrange of 2 to 3 percent. Combined with inflation expectations above 2\npercent, the Fed had plenty of room on both sides of the business cycle to\nadjust the federal funds rate and stimulate or restrain growth. Second,\ninflation was highly responsive to economic activity. In other words, the\nPhillips curve was steep. So, changes in policy that impacted growth and\nemployment had a concurrent and significant effect on inflation.\nThe New Normal\nCompared with this old normal, our new normal is almost an “opposite\nworld.” Here is what I mean. There is still some level of unemployment below\nwhich wage and price inflation will pick up, but it’s hard to know, a priori,\n3\n\nFINAL\nwhere it is. We saw this in the last expansion, when Fed policymakers\ncontinuously lowered their estimates of the longer-run rate of unemployment\nin the face of modest inflationary pressures.\nThe dynamics of inflation have also changed. Inflation is far less\nresponsive to movements in output and employment than in previous\ndecades. Indeed, despite a near eleven-year expansion and historically low\nunemployment, inflation has remained stubbornly below our 2 percent target\nsince the Great Recession.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThis reflects, in part, a weakening of the traditional links between\nunemployment, wages, and prices. A large literature confirms this, showing\n2\nthat the Phillips Curve has become quite flat in recent years. Declines in\nbargaining power for workers, fierce competition in product markets (think\nAmazon), and a labor force that is far more elastic than most imagined have all\n3\nplayed a role. Each of these factors are likely to continue to persist in the\ncoming years, requiring us to adjust our policies to adapt to the new\nenvironment.\nWe will need to make these adjustments in an environment that also\nlooks quite different than the old normal. The real neutral rate of interest is\nexpected to remain at very low levels, not much above zero, for some time. In\nthis world, keeping inflation expectations well-anchored at 2 percent will be\nessential. As I noted earlier, inflation expectations are an important\n4\ndeterminant of future inflation. So any drift down translates into lower\ninflation, a lower nominal funds rate, and fewer rate cuts when the economy\nneeds them. In this context, long periods of below-target inflation, like the one\nwe are experiencing, are costly.\nAdapting for Today\nThe lessons of the last decade and projections of our future conditions\ntell us that, for the foreseeable future, the Federal Reserve will face an uphill\nbattle using conventional monetary policy to keep the economy healthy, the\n5\nlabor market strong, and inflation at our 2 percent goal.\n2\nSee for example Blanchard (2016), Lansing (2019), Leduc, Marti, and Wilson (2019).\n3\nDaly (2019a, b).\n4\nJordà et al. (2019a, b).\n5\n5\nMertens and Williams (2019), Amano, Carter, and Leduc (2019).\n\nFINAL\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s new policy framework is an\n6\nexplicit recognition of these realities. It reflects the learnings of current and\npast FOMC participants, as well as inputs from our year-long review process\nthat included evidence from research and feedback from the businesses and\n7\ncommunities we serve.\nThe resulting revised framework reemphasizes our commitment to\nmaximum employment and stable prices and makes changes to our policy\nstrategy that will make each of these goals easier to achieve.\nClarifying Maximum Employment\nStarting with maximum employment, the new framework states that\npolicy decisions will be informed by “assessments of the shortfalls of\nemployment from its maximum level” rather than by “deviations from its\nmaximum level.” In other words, in the absence of inflationary pressures, we\nwill not pull back the reins on the economy in response to a strong labor\nmarket.\nThe statement also emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad\nand inclusive goal. In assessing whether it has been reached, there is no single\nnumber that tells the story. Instead, we will examine a wide range of\nindicators—measures like unemployment, labor force participation, job\nfinding, and wage growth—across a broad distribution of workers.\nAs we apply this strategy, our most important virtue will be patience.\nWe will need to continually reassess what the labor market is capable of and\n6 Fed Listens\nSee Board of Governors (2020)\n7\nSee the discussion of the initiative on the Board of Governors\nwebsite: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-\n6\nstrategy-tools-and-communications.htm\n\nFINAL\navoid preemptively tightening monetary policy before millions of Americans\nhave an opportunity to benefit. These efforts are critical to support the broad\neconomy and aid the inclusion of historically less advantaged groups,\nincluding people of color, those lacking college degrees, and others who face\n8\nsystemic barriers to equitable employment and wages.\nGetting to 2 Percent Inflation\nRegarding price stability, the new framework reaffirms the committee’s\ncommitment to a 2 percent inflation objective but adds that this means\nachieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time. To achieve this, the\nFOMC will employ flexible average inflation targeting. Specifically, following\nperiods when inflation is below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will\naim to move inflation above 2 percent for some time.\nThis will ensure that inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2\npercent, even when policy is more frequently constrained by the zero lower\nbound. This approach helps put a floor under inflation expectations,\nenhancing our ability to achieve our full employment and price stability goals.\nPractically, the new framework allows us to retain our vigilance against\ninflation that is too high, while improving our ability to keep inflation from\nfalling too low. It applies the lessons from all of our history and recognizes\nthat persistent misses on either side of the target can leave lasting damage on\nexpectations and the economy.\nAn Unwanted Test\n8\n7\nAaronson et al. (2019), Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n\nFINAL\nAlthough the evolution of the framework I just described predates the\npandemic, it is exactly what we need to support the economy through this\ndifficult time. In addition to its wrenching toll on health, the virus has\nseverely depressed economic activity. Millions of workers remain\nunemployed and hundreds of thousands of businesses shuttered, some of\nthem permanently. Digging beneath the aggregate numbers shows that a\ndisproportionate share of affected workers come from the lower half of the\n9\nwage distribution.\nConsistent with historical barriers to education and employment, these losses\n10\nare also concentrated among communities of color.\nInflation has also been pushed down by the pandemic. After falling\nsharply last year, it has improved as the economy has rebounded. But COVID-\n11\nsensitive sectors remain a drag on overall inflation. And even when those\nsectors have fully recovered, it will likely be some time before inflation is\nsustainably back to 2 percent.\n9\nSimilarly, losses are concentrated among those with less than a college degree, Daly,\nBuckman, and Seitelman (2020).\n10\nGould and Wilson (2020), Kochhar (2020), Powell (2021a).\n11\n8\nShapiro (2020).\n\nFINAL\nGetting fully past this crisis and back on track to achieve our dual\nmandate goals will require monetary policy to be accommodative for some\ntime. We must make sure that everyone who lost their job or left the labor\nforce to care for children or other family members has an opportunity to\n12\nreturn. We also need to offset the downward inflation pressures created by\nthe pandemic and get back to moving inflation towards our average 2 percent\ngoal.\nAnd this brings me back to the fearful swirl about spikes in inflation and\nthe need to preemptively offset them. Of course, we need to be vigilant\nagainst all the risks in the economy, but we also must weight them by their\nlikelihood and expected cost. As for the likelihood of runaway inflation, I\ndon’t see this risk as imminent, and neither do market participants.\nInstead, I view the recent rise in inflation compensation to roughly 2 percent\nas encouraging and in line with our stated goals. It suggests that our\n12\nLofton, Petrosky-Nadeau, and Seitelman (2021). Chair Powell also alluded to this issue in\n9\nthe Q&A following his most recent Congressional testimony (Powell 2021b).\n\nFINAL\ncommitment to flexible average inflation targeting has already gained\nsubstantial credibility.\nBut what about the costs? The memory of the 1970s and 1980s and the\npainful correction it required looms large. But that was more than three\ndecades ago, and times have changed. Today, the costs are tilted the other\nway. Running inflation too low for too long can pull down inflation\nexpectations, reduce policy space, and leave millions of Americans on the\nsidelines along the way.\nHistory Will Repeat Itself, Unless We Learn\nSo, I’ll end by returning to my Irish artist friend. I bought one of his\nprints and put it on my office bookshelf. I keep it as a reminder that the\nweight of the past can be a powerful force, pulling us back to what has been.\nTo shake its grasp requires diligence and intention, an active commitment to\nbe students of history but not victims of it.\nTo do otherwise will fall short, leaving us like the picture, destined to\nrepeat ourselves.\n10\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nBrookings Papers on Economic\nAaroAncstiovnit, yS tephanie, Mary C.

    "text": "Policymaking in a Time of Uncertainty\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Commonwealth Club of California\nSan Francisco, CA\nNovember 16, 2021\n12:30 PM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nThese are unusual times.\nThe very worst of the pandemic looks to be behind us—a welcome relief. But the impact of\nCOVID and its ongoing threat continue to disrupt and delay the full recovery of the economy.\nWorse perhaps is that we don’t know how long any of this will last. We are in flux—limbo—\nwaiting for the pandemic to be done so we can move on to whatever the new future holds.\nBut waiting is hard, and it’s tempting to want to act. To want to respond to what we see today\nas if it’s a clear signal of what we will see tomorrow.\nAction, after all, feels empowering.\nBut feeling empowered and empowering our future are two different things. Acting without\nclarity is risky. It can lead to decisions that have costly unintended consequences, box us into\noutcomes, and make the flux we feel today a more persistent feature of our economic future\nthan it needs to be.\n1\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about how the recognition of ongoing uncertainty affects monetary\npolicy and the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of price stability and full employment. And about\nwhy the Fed is taking a vigilant and measured approach as we navigate the long tail of the\npandemic.\nBut before I get too far along, I want to remind you that the views I will express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nTaking Stock of the Economy We Have\nInflation\nLet me start by taking stock of where we are today.\nHere is the headline: Inflation is high. Both overall and core inflation have been running well\nabove the Fed’s two percent goal. In fact, overall inflation is at its highest level in 30 years, with\nprice increases in some sectors hitting eye-popping rates.\nThe magnitude and persistence of these readings has come as a surprise, but it’s actually not\nthat mysterious. Standard theory tells us that inflation occurs when demand outstrips supply\nand prices rise to adjust.\nSo, the question is less about why it’s happening and more about how long it will persist.\nSpecifically, will it last beyond the pandemic? There are good reasons to think that it won’t. And\nI will focus on three of these reasons in particular—two related to demand and one related to\nsupply.\nLet me start with demand. COVID has changed how and where we spend our money. Public\nhealth policies aimed at stopping the virus—lockdowns, social distancing, mask wearing—have\nkept us from going to the gym, seeing a movie, traveling, and using a host of other services. So\nwe’ve taken to the internet and worked to recreate our normal lives at home. In economics\nparlance, we “rotated” spending, buying an outsized number of goods—things like home\nexercise equipment, video games, lawn furniture, and cars—while leaving behind spending on\nservices.\nThese individual actions, which I am sure feel familiar, show through to the aggregate data.\nOver the past 18 months, consumer spending has been historically tilted towards goods—\n2\n\nsomething you might have noticed when the load of packages stacked up at your door.1 The\nresult is higher prices for a range of things that we want more of today than usual, as we\nmanage our way through COVID.\nOf course, another unusual characteristic of the pandemic is that people have money to spend.\nSome of this reflects the fact that the pandemic has been a highly focused sectoral shock,\ndevastating certain parts of the economy that rely on in-person contact while boosting others\nthat enable working from home and connecting through technology. For workers in these\nthriving sectors, incomes have stayed steady or grown, supporting spending even as the\neconomy struggles.2\nFor other workers and households more negatively affected, financial challenges were met with\nunprecedented fiscal support. Cash grants and expanded unemployment insurance and child tax\ncredits helped those who’ve been hardest hit maintain their financial well-being through the\nworst of the pandemic.3 This has not only benefited workers and households, but it has also\nkept consumer spending high even as labor markets have lagged. In other words, during the\nworst economic shock in U.S. history, demand has remained resilient.\nUnfortunately, the resilience of supply and supply chains been far less robust. COVID-related\ndisruptions have episodically depressed production across the globe. City by city, plants have\nshut down or reduced shifts to curb infections. These disruptions have accumulated and\nsnowballed, leaving many goods in short supply.\nEven when goods are available, it’s been hard to get them delivered. Shipping containers are in\nthe wrong places. Trucking networks are lagging. And ports across the globe are struggling to\nclear backlogs of ships waiting to dock and unload.\nAnd we’re not out of the woods yet. With lagging vaccination rates in many countries, shutting\ndown is often the best way to fight surging infections. These policies, while necessary, leave a\nlong imprint. In fact, a port closure in Vietnam in August meant to curb surging Delta infections\ncontinues to be felt up and down the supply chain.\nPutting all of this together, it’s easy to see why prices are rising. Consumers with income to\nspend have demanded more goods than usual and suppliers have struggled to keep up. But\nwhat does it mean for future inflation?\n1 Data on monthly personal consumption expenditures (PCE) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) show\nthat the goods share of nominal PCE was slightly under 31 percent just before the pandemic and has risen about\n3.5 percentage points, to 34.3 percent (averaged over the past 18 months).\n2 BEA data show that monthly disposable personal income has been highly uneven over the past 18 months but is\nup on average since the pandemic started.\n3 Banerjee and Zipperer (2021).\n3\n\nGiven the factors boosting prices that I’ve just described, I expect a moderation in price\npressures as the pandemic recedes. Consumers will likely pivot back to their normal bundles of\ngoods and services—spending some time with their new home entertainment centers, but also\ngoing to movies, concerts, dinners and, hopefully, holiday parties.\nSimilarly, as fiscal support rolls off and many households move their savings back to historically\nnormal levels, demand will likely become more in sync with the overall strength of the\neconomy. Production and supply chains should also catch up and repair, reducing bottlenecks\nand easing the pressure on prices.\nAs these things happen, we should return to the typical dynamics that drive the economy.\nThe Labor Market\nBut what about the labor market? What’s its future?\nOn one hand, labor markets look tight. Unemployment is down, job openings are at all-time\nhighs, and wages are up in many sectors. Help wanted signs are everywhere and workers are\nquitting at record levels. These are all things we typically see only when the economy is “hot”\nand we are nearing full employment.\nOn the other hand, we’re still over four million jobs short of our pre-pandemic peak. And that\ndoesn’t count where we would have been if COVID had never occurred. That’s a number closer\nto six million missing jobs.4\nNow, some have speculated that this is the new normal—a great epiphany that work isn’t all it’s\ncracked up to be, so maybe we won’t work at all. While it’s hard to argue against epiphanies, I’ll\noffer a few alternatives.\nCOVID continues to affect schooling and childcare, workplace safety, transportation, and even\nthe ability of businesses to offer consistent hours and pay. Faced with these barriers, some\nindividuals, especially women and older Americans, have opted to leave the labor force\naltogether.5 Others have stayed but continued to search for jobs that feel safe, predictable,\nconvenient, or simply better suited to their aspirations and interests.6\n4 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016). Labor force participation trends prior to the pandemic suggest that the\nunderlying trend was at or above the high end of their estimated range.\n5 Lofton, Petrosky-Nadeau, and Seitelman (2021), Montes, Smith, and Leigh (2021).\n6 De Smet et al. (2021).\n4\n\nThese behaviors are understandable reactions to an unprecedented shock. As COVID recedes, I\nexpect people to settle in, land a job they want, and return to the labor market to support their\nfamilies and build a career.\nAnd history supports this prediction. Although labor force participation tends to lag behind\nfalling unemployment, workers do come back. We saw this in the last expansion and in most\nexpansions before that.7 In other words, it’s too early to count out the millions of people sitting\non the sidelines.\nTo summarize, although inflation is high and the labor market seems tight, when we dig into the\ndata, it’s easy to see that some of what we observe today reflects the ongoing effects of the\npandemic. This makes it harder to conclude that we are facing a completely new world that will\npersist once the worst of COVID is behind us.\nGetting to the Economy We Want\nOf course, the truth is, none of us is completely certain how the economy will evolve. We can’t\nsay for sure that the eye-popping rates of inflation won’t leave a more lasting imprint on overall\nprice setting. And we don’t know how long it will take for sidelined workers to come back.\nAnd this is a hard place for policymakers. We have the tools to support the economy if it needs\nit, and we have the tools to beat back inflation and cool the labor market if necessary. The\nquestion is, which of these scenarios will turn out to be true?\nIn the face of this uncertainty, many have argued that we should act preemptively—get ahead\nof things, rather than fall behind the curve.\nThis logic has some appeal. If the high readings on inflation last long enough, they could seep\ninto our psychology and change our expectations about future inflation. Households would then\nexpect prices to keep rising and ask for higher wages to offset that. Businesses, of course, would\npass those increases on to consumers in the form of higher prices, causing workers to ask for\neven higher wages. And on it would go, in a vicious wage-price spiral that would end well for no\none.\nAlthough this would be a deeply disturbing trend should it occur, so far, there is little evidence\nthat this is happening now. Despite the large jumps in measured inflation, inflation expectations\nin the longer run remain relatively stable and well-anchored around the Fed’s price stability\n7 Hobijn and Sahin (2021). See also Cajner, Coglianese, and Montes (2021).\n5\n\ngoal.8 This suggests that households and businesses expect inflation to moderate as the global\neconomy emerges from the pandemic. And most importantly, these readings suggest that\npeople understand that the Fed will act if inflation begins to look more persistent.\nBut why not take out some insurance—preemptively raise rates to make sure that a painful\ninflation spiral doesn’t occur? The main answer is that preemptive action isn’t free. Like all\ninsurance, there are costs. And policymakers must balance these costs against the risk of\nwaiting.\nMonetary policy is a blunt tool that acts with a considerable lag. So, raising interest rates today\nwould do little to increase production, fix supply chains, or stop consumers from spending more\non goods than on services. But it would curb demand 12 to 18 months from now. Should\ncurrent high inflation readings and worker shortages turn out to be COVID-related and\ntransitory, higher interest rates would bridle growth, slow recovery in the labor market and\nunnecessarily sideline millions of workers.\nWith the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, the Fed would have limited room to\nrespond to this type of forecast mistake. On the other hand, if we hold rates steady and\ninflation persists, we can raise rates later on. This policy asymmetry makes the potential costs of\nacting prematurely disproportionately high.\nAgainst this calculus, I come down on the side of waiting to gain greater clarity. The Fed is well\npositioned to act should inflation begin to look more persistent. It’s much harder to unwind a\npreemptive action that turns out to be wrong.\nBut “not now” for interest rates does not mean “not ever” for policy. In fact, earlier this month,\nwe announced that we will reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases in response to\nsubstantial improvement in the economy from the depths of the recession. This will slow the\namount of support we are adding to the economy, allowing it to function more on its own.\nOver the next several quarters, as tapering occurs, we will watch how the economy does and\nsee whether inflation eases and workers come back. As we get a clearer signal, we will be ready\nto act accordingly, continuing to provide or remove support as needed to ensure the economy\nsettles at a sustainable place.\nThe Bravest Action We Can Take\nLet me leave you with a few concluding thoughts. As a policymaker and a person, I’m biased\ntoward action. I like to solve problems. So, I understand the desire to immediately confront the\n8 Inflation implied by yields on 10-year and 5-year nominal and inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury securities has been\nrunning close to pre-pandemic values, consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation goal (see\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIFR).\n6\n\nchallenges in front of us. Action gives us a sense of agency, especially at a time when it feels like\nwe have none.\nBut not all motion is forward motion. Reacting in response to things that aren’t likely to last will\nmove us farther from—not closer to—our goals. And while it’s easy to mistake motion for\ncompetence or action for attention, running headlong into a fog can be costly. So in the face of\nunprecedented uncertainty, the best policy is recognizing the need to wait. Although this can be\nhard, in the end, patience is the bravest action we can take.\nThank you.\n7\n\nReferences\nBanerjee, Asha, and Ben Zipperer. 2021. “Social Insurance Programs Cushioned the Blow of the COVID-19\nPandemic in 2020.” EPI Working Economics Blog, September 14.\nBidder, Rhys, Tim Mahedy, and Rob Valletta. 2016. “Trend Job Growth: Where’s Normal?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2016-32 (October 24).\nCajner, Tomaz, John Coglianese, and Joshua Montes. 2021. “The Long-Lived Cyclicality of the Labor Force\nParticipation Rate.” Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2021-047.\nDe Smet, Aaron, Bonnie Dowling, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, and Bill Schaninger. 2021. “‘Great\nAttrition’ or ‘Great Attraction’?

    "text": "FINAL\nFrom Gaps to Growth: Equity as a Path to Prosperity\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUCLA Anderson Forecast Webinar\nSeptember 29, 2021\n10:05 AM PST\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nAs Americans, one of our most deeply held beliefs is that anyone, no\nmatter where they come from or who they are, can make it. They just have to\nwork hard and play by the rules. This assumption permeates our political\nsystem, our institutions and our economy.\nBut crises can be illuminating. The pandemic has shined a vivid light on\nthe deep roots of economic inequity, forcing us to recognize that the rules\naren’t the same for everyone. COVID has taken the most from the people and\ncommunities that are least able to bear it. And long standing gaps in economic\nopportunity and well-being have grown deeper and wider.\nAs humans, we are adaptive. We get used to things. We live a certain\nway for long enough, and we begin to believe that’s the way it’s supposed to\nbe. We forget that the gaps we see every day reflect accumulated inequities—\nthe long tail of policy, luck or inattention that has made it easier for some and\nharder for others to reach their potential. And then, an economy that leaves\nlarge numbers of people behind starts to seem normal.\n1\n\nFINAL\nToday, I’m going to talk about why this way of looking at the world\nlimits our potential, and how we can use the lessons of the pandemic to forge\na more equitable society—one with fewer gaps and greater prosperity for all.\nBefore I go on, I’ll remind you that the views I will express today are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nThe Bridle of Our Assumptions\nNow, before we imagine a more equitable world, it’s important to take\nstock of the one we have. Economists and many others generally assume that\nresources are allocated according to their most productive uses and that all\navailable resources are fully deployed. Unless there is blatant market failure—\ncollusion, discrimination or other obvious barriers to entry—we believe that\nany differences in initial conditions will smooth out over time. In other words,\nno matter where you are born or how you start out, the marketplace will\nensure that you land where you’re supposed to be.\nAnd there are many examples of this being true. Amazing stories of\npeople starting with little and doing a lot—confirming our belief that markets\nwork efficiently and human capital is put to its best uses with few mistakes.\nBut this can be misleading. It can make us think that the world we have\nis all it could ever be. And this bridles our economy’s potential. It leaves\ncountless people contributing less than their talents and interests would\nallow, sometimes sidelining them completely.\nGaps\n2\n\nFINAL\nTo get a sense of what we stand to gain from building a world with few\ngaps, it’s useful to review what some of the disparities look like. Many groups\nfare less well than the averages we hear about each day. But disparities for\nBlack Americans, many of whom bear the costs of both historical and current\ndiscrimination, are especially sizeable. So, their experiences are an important\nstarting point.\nThe differences start at a young age. The average Black child in the\nUnited States is about three times more likely than the average white child to\nlive in a poor household—one with resources below the official poverty line.1\nBlack children are relatively less likely to graduate from high school and even\nless likely to go onto college.2,3\nBlack students who do go to college don’t always finish. In fact, a recent\ncohort study found that at the six-year mark 45% had not graduated and were\nno longer enrolled. By comparison, only 27% of white students had left\nwithout graduating.4\nBut the gaps don’t end with education. They continue on into the labor\nmarket and beyond. Black college graduates are less likely to be employed\nthan white college graduates and, when they do find jobs, are more likely to be\nin occupations that do not utilize, or even require, their skills.5 All of this\n1 U.S. Census Bureau (2021).\n2 For example, in 2019 the high school graduation rate for Black students was 80%, compared to 89% for\nwhite students. National Center for Education Statistics (2021).\n3 In 2019, the college enrollment rate for recent Black high school graduates was a little over 50%, compared\nto roughly 67% for whites. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020).\n4 Shapiro et al. (2017). These differences in completion rates trace back to a variety of factors including\nfinances, academic preparation and support, and representation. National Center for Education Statistics\n(2019), Espinosa, Turk, Taylor, and Chessman (2019).\n5 Williams and Wilson (2019), Abel and Deitz (2019), Daly, Hobijn, and Pedtke (2020), Buckman, Choi, Daly,\nand Seitelman (2021).\n3\n\nFINAL\ntranslates into lower average earnings for Black Americans, even when they\nhave college degrees.\nPerhaps most troubling, college-educated Black workers lose ground\nover their careers. Indeed, in the work I’ve done, we found that the earnings\ngap between Black and white college-educated men doubles over the first 15\nyears of their professional life.6\nIn the end, this means that fewer Black men and women are\ncontributing their full potential to the economy. But it doesn’t stop there.\nHispanic Americans, women, indigenous Americans, people living in rural\nareas, and many other groups persistently fall behind, with lower rates of\neducation, employment and earnings than we might expect if opportunities\nwere equitably available.7\nLeaving these gaps unaddressed is clearly unfair. But it’s also\nunproductive. It keeps millions of people on the sidelines or underutilized,\nand sells the economy short. No entrepreneur would ever stand for it. The\nquestion is, why do we?\nFrom Gaps to Growth\nOne reason is that we don’t fully understand what we’re missing. We\ndon’t regularly calculate the losses from exclusion or the potential gains from\n6 Daly, Hobijn, and Pedtke (2020).\n7 Buckman, Choi, Daly, and Seitelman (2021), Shrider, Kollar, Chen, and Semega (2021), Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (2019), Blau and Kahn (2017), Marré (2017), Glaeser (2011), Akee (2021), Bengali, Daly, Lofton,\nand Valletta (2021). Some of the groups deviate from the general patterns described. For example, Hispanic\nAmerican men have higher employment rates than men from other racial and ethnic groups, and women are\nmore likely to hold college degrees than men.\n4\n\nFINAL\nbeing more inclusive—at least, not on an aggregate, economy-wide level. My\ncolleagues and I recently did just that.\nWe asked a simple question: what would the economic output of the\nnation be if gaps in outcomes by race and ethnicity were erased?8 For each\nyear from 1990 to 2019, we eliminated gaps in employment, hours, education\nand educational utilization. And we gave racial and ethnic minorities the\nvalues of their white counterparts. We then recomputed the potential output\nfor each year. What we found was significant.\nWhen gaps are closed, the gains from equity are nearly $23 trillion over\na 30-year period—a large piece of the economic pie unrealized or simply left\non the table by tolerating the gaps that we see.\nOther studies have found similar potential gains. For example, a 2014\nstudy found that closing racial gaps in income in 2012 would have increased\nGDP by $2.1 trillion that year.9 More recently, a study conducted by leading\nresearchers in the private banking sector found that closing gaps between\nBlack and white adults in wages, higher education, home ownership, and\nentrepreneurship would have led to a GDP boost of $16 trillion over the past\n20 years, and a projected $5 trillion gain over the next five years.10 In other\nwords, a range of studies, using different methods and closing different gaps,\nall point to the same thing: substantial gains from a more inclusive economy.\nBut how will we get there? A recent study done by scholars at Stanford\nUniversity and the University of Chicago provides some clues. They look back\nin time and examine the economic impact of taking down barriers to entry for\n8 Buckman, Choi, Daly, and Seitelman (2021).\n9 Truehaft, Scoggins, and Tran (2014).\n10 Peterson and Mann (2020).\n5\n\nFINAL\nwomen and Black workers in the fifty years spanning 1960 to 2010.11 They\nfind that better allocation of these workers throughout the economy—putting\ntalent where it was needed—accounted for between 20 and 40 percent of the\ntotal growth in U.S. output over the period. Moreover, they showed that most\nof this improvement came from reducing human capital barriers and labor\nmarket discrimination. Simply put, removing barriers for some improved\noutput for all.\nThese and other studies make it clear that using all of our resources\nmore fully improves aggregate prosperity. But the gains are likely to go\nbeyond a boost in the level of GDP. Reducing disparities could also increase\nthe economy’s long-run rate of growth.\nTo understand why, we need to go back to the 1980s, when future Nobel\nlaureate Paul Romer had an idea. He hypothesized that the driver of economic\ngrowth is really ideas—innovations in thinking that lead to the development\nof new technologies, higher productivity, and more and faster growth over the\nlong run.12 In other words, ideas determine how quickly the economic pie\ngrows.\nHis theory tells us that we can boost growth by investing in strategies\nthat foster the development and implementation of ideas. And not just of a\nfew, but of everyone.\nThe first and most obvious strategy to boost the generation of ideas is to\nincrease access to high-quality education and the academic supports needed\nto help students stay on course. Education equips people with the knowledge\n11 Hsieh, Hurst, Jones, and Klenow (2019).\n12 Romer (1990, 1994). See Jones (2019) for an overview of the original work and subsequent literature.\n6\n\nFINAL\nand the skills they need to innovate. And it doesn’t always take a four-year\ndegree. Think of all the computer programmers out there who started coding\nas kids. Investing in students at an early age and offering them a pathway to\nlearn is equally important.13\nAnother way to encourage idea generation is to create more equitable\nways to fund them. Wealth enables people to implement their ideas. But\nwealth gaps are large in our country, and racial and ethnic minorities are\nespecially far behind.14 Gaps in financing or borrowing to fund ideas are also\nlarge.15 This means that whole communities of people have less financial\nsupport for putting their innovations into practice.\nFinally, we need to increase diversity and inclusion in businesses and\ngovernment. A large and growing body of research shows that diverse teams\nenhance performance. Less diverse teams eat into profitability.16 I see this in\nmy own organization every day. The best teams are the most diverse teams—\nones that include a range of views, backgrounds and experiences.\nThe bottom line is this: making sure everyone has a chance to generate\nand nurture their ideas is good for growth, and ultimately delivers greater\nprosperity to us all.\nSwitching Our Lens\n13 García, Heckman, Leaf, and Prados (2020), Rolnick and Grunewald (2003).\n14 Bhutta et al. (2020).\n15 See Federal Reserve Banks (2021), Apgar and Calder (2005).\n16 See for example Kline, Rose, and Walters (2021), Herring (2009).\n7\n\nFINAL\nNow, I want to leave you with a story. A girl from a lower income family\ndoes well in school, reads a lot, likes to learn. But the family finances, and the\nfamily itself, fall on hard times. And the young girl, needing to assist, drops out\nof school. When she tells her teacher she is leaving, he doesn’t blink. He says\nhe always knew that she wouldn’t amount to anything, and that her decision\nhas just confirmed it.\nFast forward a few years, and the girl meets a woman named Betsy. And\nBetsy tells her that the job she wants, to drive a bus, requires a GED, and so do\nmany others. So, the girl gets one. Then, Betsy tells her that many more jobs\nrequire college and she should go. And on it goes, until one day the girl—now\na woman—earns a Ph.D. and heads off into the world to try and make a\ndifference.\nThat girl, as you might have guessed, was me. And I tell you that story to\nshow one thing: the lens we use determines what we do. My teacher and\nBetsy saw me differently. And because they saw me differently, they acted\ndifferently towards me. Betsy paid for my first semester of college. My teacher\nsimply erased me.\nWe can take for granted that the outcomes we see today are inevitable,\nand watch as the pandemic makes existing gaps deeper and our prospects for\nfuture growth even slower. Or we can see them as a sign that resources aren’t\nbeing used to their fullest, and that people with great potential are being kept\neach day from realizing it.\nThe choice is clear. The will is ours.\nThank you.\n8\n\nFINAL\n9\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAbel, Jaison, and Richard Deitz. 2019. “Underemployment in the Early Careers of College\nGraduates following the Great Recession.” Chapter in Education, Skills, and Technical\nChange: Implications for Future US GDP Growth, eds.

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUniversity of California, Irvine Virtual Event\nIrvine, CA\nOctober 13, 2020\n5:00PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n* This speech is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Laubach,\na devoted public servant and tireless advocate for crafting policy that works for everyone.\nIntroduction\nHello everyone. Thank you so much for the opportunity to join you\ntoday. It means more to me than you might expect.\nI’ve spent almost 25 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nAnd back in 2006, when I was working in our research department, I got a big\nopportunity.\nOur president at the time, Janet Yellen, was coming to UC Irvine to\ndeliver a speech on economic inequality right before the midterm election.1 I\nhad a chance to work on her remarks, and it was a defining moment in my\ncareer.\nSo to be here again, at UC Irvine, as the current president of the San\nFrancisco Fed, delivering a speech of my own on inequality, weeks before\nanother important election, feels like a full-circle moment for me. And I thank\nyou very much for the opportunity.\n1 Yellen (2006).\n1\n\nFINAL\nNow, I’d like to say that we’ve made a lot of progress since Janet’s\nspeech in 2006. But inequality is still a pressing issue for our nation—one that\nfeels even more urgent in the wake of the health and economic hardships\ncaused by COVID-19, and the social reckoning sparked by the deaths of George\nFloyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others.\nNot every American gets the same chance at life, liberty, and the pursuit\nof happiness. And this difference in opportunity translates into differences in\noutcomes. It leaves us with two Americas: one for those who have, and one for\nthose who have not. This is our shared reality, a reality we have to\nacknowledge and confront—as individuals, as institutions, and as a nation.\nAs a monetary policymaker and the leader of the San Francisco Fed, I’m\nregularly—and rightly—asked about how the Federal Reserve contributes to\nthe inequality we observe. So today, I will take this on directly: inequality, the\nrole of the Fed, and how we must collectively move toward a better, more\ninclusive economic future.\nBut before I begin, I’ll remind you that the remarks I’m delivering are\nmy own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the\nFederal Reserve System.\nThe root of the question\nLet’s start by looking at a few recent facts that suggest the Federal\nReserve might have a role in generating economic inequality.\nCOVID-19 hit our shores in January. And by March, we saw severe\nimpacts on health and economic activity. Both the Fed and Congress took\nimmediate and unprecedented action.\n2\n\nFINAL\nThe Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to close to zero and\nimplemented a wide array of measures to facilitate the flow of credit in the\neconomy.2 Congress provided almost $3 trillion in fiscal support to shore up\nhouseholds, businesses, and state and local governments. Together these\nmeasures were a bridge through the immediate economic hardships caused\nby COVID-19.\nBut what has happened since then?\nAs the economy has slowly reopened, employment growth has\nrebounded, exceeding most expectations. But this growth has erased only\nabout half of the original losses. In September, employment was still down by\nalmost 11 million people from its recent peak. Those are bigger losses than we\nsaw during the Great Recession. In contrast, after dropping nearly one-third of\ntheir value in February and March, financial markets have completely\nrecovered, with all major U.S. stock indexes retracing their declines.\nLooking at the two recoveries I have just described—the economic one\nand the financial one—it seems unfair. Another example of Wall Street\nwinning and Main Street losing. Of a few advancing while so many others fall\nbehind.3\nSo how do we alter this imbalance? What can we do to ensure the\nproceeds of economic growth are more equitably distributed in our society?\nThis is the right question to ask of policymakers. And while I can’t\nprovide a simple playbook or recipe, I will lay out the issues I see before us\nand discuss what the Federal Reserve, our fiscal agents, and each of us must\ndo if we are going to create a more equitable future.\n2 Board of Governors (2020a, 2020b).\n3 Kuhn, Schularick, and Steins (2020).\n3\n\nFINAL\nThis isn’t just a COVID-19 phenomenon\nFirst, it’s important to note that, while COVID-19 has spotlighted and\nmagnified the inequities in our nation, these disparities have existed for\ndecades. Income and wealth inequality in the United States have been rising\nalmost without pause since 1980. Let me offer a few illustrations.\nOver the past 40 years, the income of households near the bottom of the\ndistribution—the 10th percentile—rose by about 20 percent. In contrast,\nhouseholds near the top of the distribution—the 90th percentile—saw their\nincomes rise by 66 percent.4\nThese differences in returns have added up to more inequality. In 2019,\nthe top 10 percent of adults in the United States took home almost half of the\npretax income generated in the economy—nearly five times their share of\npopulation.5\nLooking at wealth, the disparities are even wider. About one-quarter of\nAmericans have essentially no wealth—near zero or even a negative net\nworth.6 The remainder of households have some wealth, but this is quite\nunevenly distributed. At the end of 2019, the top 10 percent of American\nhouseholds owned nearly 70 percent of all wealth held in the United States.7\nWe’re not the only country experiencing these trends. Inequality has\nincreased in countries with economic systems similar to ours, like the United\n4 Semega et al. (2020).\n5 Based on data from the World Inequality Database, developed by Thomas Piketty,\nEmmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman, and collaborators. https://wid.world/\n6 Bhutta et al. (2020).\n7 Calculated from the Federal Reserve Board’s Distributional Financial Accounts.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/efa/efa-distributional-financial-accounts.htm\n4\n\nFINAL\nKingdom. And it’s also happened, albeit to a lesser extent, in countries with\neconomic systems very different from ours, like Denmark and Sweden.8\nA range of structural factors have contributed to the worldwide\nincreases in inequality we observe. These include automation, growing\ndemand for college-educated workers, and globalized labor, product, and\ncapital markets.9\nBut global trends alone can’t explain the severe run-up in economic\ninequality we’re experiencing in the United States. We have additional and\nunique challenges—struggles we see play out on the news every day.\nSystemic biases related to race, ethnicity, gender, and class have led to\nunequal access to education, jobs, income, and wealth.10 And these inequities\nhave compounded over generations, as children born into poverty or low-\nincome households carry that disadvantage through to adulthood and pass it\non to their children.11\nThese trends—and their persistence over time—reflect fundamental\nchoices we’ve made about public education, taxation, and the social safety net.\nFundamental choices about how we manage our society.\nSo if these are our choices, what can institutions like the Federal\nReserve do to change the landscape? The answer is: quite a lot.\n8 See the World Inequality Database. https://wid.world/\n9 See, for example, Autor (2019), Nolan, Richiardi, and Valenzuela (2019), and Dabla-Norris\net al. (2015).\n10 See, for example, relevant chapters in Nolan, Salverda, and Smeeding (2011); also\nAliprantis and Carroll (2019), Butler, Mayer, and Weston (2020).\n11 Bengali and Daly (2013), Chetty et al. (2014).\n5\n\nFINAL\nInequality and monetary policy\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate—full employment and price\nstability. We achieve these goals primarily by adjusting the short-term\ninterest rate.12 Our interest rate decisions make it more or less expensive for\nconsumers and businesses to borrow money. This guides spending decisions,\nwhich impacts hiring, wages, and ultimately inflation.\nWhen it’s working well, our policies provide the foundation for a\npositive feedback loop—consumers spend, firms invest and hire more\nworkers, and a wide range of households build income and wealth. This is the\nvirtuous cycle of growth that ultimately delivers a strong, sustainable, and\ninclusive economy.\nBut how do our policies work in practice? To get a sense of this, let’s\nconsider the last expansion—the longest in recorded U.S. history. After taking\nsignificant measures to stabilize the economy in the wake of the 2008\nfinancial crisis, the FOMC committed to a period of sustained low interest\nrates to support the labor market and return inflation to 2 percent.\nThe benefits were material. The length and strength of the expansion\npushed the unemployment rate to near-historic lows. This created real\nopportunities for a large number of sidelined Americans, many of whom were\nthought to be permanently out of the labor force or lacking the right skills to\nwork in an evolving job market.13\n12 The Federal Reserve has a variety of additional tools beyond simple interest rate\nmovements. These include forward guidance and asset purchases, along with lender-of-\nlast-resort activities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. See the complete list\nhere: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policytools.htm\n13 Aaronson et al. (2019), Abraham and Kearney (2020).\n6\n\nFINAL\nThe expansion also boosted the prospects of people of color and those\nwithout a college degree. By early 2019, employers were hiring African\nAmerican and Hispanic workers at rates equal to or higher than those of white\nworkers.14 This reduced long-standing unemployment gaps, narrowing them\nto historic lows. The same thing happened for those with a high school\ndiploma: hiring rates rose, unemployment fell, and gaps narrowed relative to\ncollege-educated workers.15\nBy the end of the expansion, these improved employment outcomes\nwere leading to faster growth in wages and income. Between 2016 and 2019,\nmedian wage growth for low-wage workers was more rapid than for high-\nwage workers, reversing a pattern that had dominated in previous years. This\nnarrowed the relative gaps in wages between those in the lowest earnings\nquartile and all other groups.16\nThe better-than-average wage growth translated into better-than-\naverage growth in household incomes. In 2019, median household income for\nBlack and Hispanic households rose by more than 7 percent, compared to less\nthan 6 percent for white households.17\nFinally, these improvements also showed through to wealth. As the\neconomy continued to expand, so did the value of assets, including housing,\nbusinesses, and stock market holdings. Gains on assets were especially rapid\nfor those at the bottom of the wealth distribution.18 Between 2016 and 2019,\nfamilies with the lowest net worth saw the largest growth in their holdings.\n14 Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019).\n15 Aaronson et al. (2019)\n16 Robertson (2019).\n17 Semega et al. (2020).\n18 Bhutta et al. (2020).\n7\n\nFINAL\nThis late-cycle pattern gave less-wealthy households a chance to reap some of\nthe benefits that had been captured disproportionately by higher net-worth\nindividuals earlier in the cycle.\nNow, these are a lot of numbers. But they all point to a single thing:\nnearly 11 years of uninterrupted growth helped a broad range of Americans\nget a foothold in the economy—finding work, gaining income, and building\nwealth. These are unequivocally good outcomes.\nBut they are not enough. Simply chipping away at the mountain of\ninequality that has built up over the past several decades can only get us so\nfar. Even with a historically long expansion, large differences in earnings,\nincome, and wealth remain—especially for people of color. And these gaps are\nonly being widened by COVID-19.\nA framework for the future\nSo what more can we do? How can we build a society that delivers on\nthe promise of equal opportunity and inclusive success?\nFirst, the Fed has a critical role to play. Full employment, the idea that\neveryone who wants a job can get a job, is the foundation for ensuring more\nequitable outcomes.\nTo better achieve this goal, the Federal Reserve released a new strategic\nframework in August that lays out our approach to monetary policy for the\nnext several years.19 A key component of this framework is the recognition\nthat maximum employment is not a fixed target. It is a broad-based and\ninclusive goal that changes as the economy evolves.\n19 Board of Governors (2020c).\n8\n\nFINAL\nWe’ve committed to finding full employment experientially, by seeing it\nin wages and prices. When we’ve achieved 2 percent inflation on average, we\nwill know that we have approached our maximum and that the economy is\nfirmly on its sustainable path.\nIn other words, in the absence of sustained 2 percent inflation or\nemerging risks, such as to financial stability, we will not take the punch bowl\naway while so many remain on the economic sidelines.\nBut the most critical aspect of our new framework is not about specific\npolicies. Rather, it is about commitment. The commitment to regularly review\nour strategy to ensure it continues meeting the needs of the American people.\nThe ingredients of this ongoing review are simple. We need to listen,\nresearch, and engage. Keep our minds open to what we hear, bring the best\ndata and analysis to the problems we find, and have hard, action-oriented\nconversations around the issues holding us back from achieving our full\neconomic potential.20\nA job for all\nBut even with all of these actions, the Federal Reserve cannot fully solve\nthe inequity problems before us. For that, we need everyone.\nOur social safety net was originally crafted in the wake of the Great\nDepression. It collectively recognized that, at any point, any one of us might\n20 Recent Federal Reserve System efforts include the Fed Listens initiative, summarized at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications.htm, and the Racism and the Economy webinar sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, and Minneapolis,\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/events/2020/racism-and-the-economy-series-kickoff-\nevent.\n9\n\nFINAL\nneed help. That safety net and its expansions over time have become integral\nto the stability of the economy.21\nBut a net that simply catches people when they fall is no longer\nsufficient. Too many people are left out from the start—without resources,\nwithout opportunity, without a fair chance. So we need a net that lifts.\nHow do we build this? We invest in infrastructure—opportunity\ninfrastructure—that includes health, education, and digital connectivity.\nHealthy people are productive people. Education is a lifelong asset. And digital\naccess is a public good. Investing in this critical infrastructure will help level\nthe playing field, reduce inequality, and boost the potential output of our\nnation.22\nWe are a rich enough country that we can afford to do this.\nWe are a poor enough country that we can’t afford not to.\nThe challenge\nLet me conclude with a reflection. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about\nthe Pledge of Allegiance. I learned it in the first grade. I stood in the classroom\nwith my hand over my heart, and I said the words, “with liberty and justice for\nall.”\nI believed those words. I cherished those words. But the world has\ndisappointed.\nChange is hard. But our current situation is untenable.\n21 McKay and Reis (2016); Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2016); Boushey, Nunn,\nand Shambaugh (2019); Lansing and Markiewicz (2018).

Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nUtah Center for Financial Services at the David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nSeptember 24, 2025\n1:10 p.m. PT (2:10 p.m. MT)\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n1\n\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Spence, for that kind introduction.\nIt’s wonderful to be here today. I am honored to be speaking with a wide array of audiences—the\nparticipants of the 35th Annual Spencer Fox Eccles Convocation, members of the Utah Chapter of the\nNational Association of Corporate Directors, and members of the broader Salt Lake community. Thank\nyou so much for having me.\nI last visited Utah back in April. The new Administration had begun to provide early details of its\npolicy initiatives, and businesses, households, and communities were working hard to understand their\nimpacts. Uncertainty was a common refrain. Worries about paralysis, stagnation, even recession\ndominated the news. The national conversation had shifted from confidence to concern.1\nThen I landed in Salt Lake.\nDriving through town, I saw activity. Lots of it. Full parking lots, busy retail outlets, and, most\nnotably, construction cranes.\nCranes tell us a lot. It’s expensive to put up cranes and to keep them working. Businesses only\ndo it when they see promise in the future. Active cranes, and more being assembled, meant that people\nwere adapting, planning, and continuing to move forward. The world had changed, uncertainty had risen,\nbut it did not mean stasis—at least not here in Utah.\nThat dynamic, the ability to move forward even when things are evolving, is the topic of my\nremarks today. How to steadily keep moving in the face of change.\nBut before I go further, I want to remind you that the views I express today are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System.\n1 For example, small business optimism was high early in the year but deteriorated in March and April (National Federation of\nIndependent Business 2025).\n2\n\nSteps for Steadiness\nYou’ll notice, I said, steadily moving forward. Not heedlessly, recklessly, or haphazardly. But\nsteadily, taking time to consider the situation, assess the risks and the opportunities, and plot a course that\nworks in the evolving environment.\nIt turns out, that’s what businesses here in Utah had done. As I learned during my visit, they had\nstepped back, evaluated the changing landscape, and kept the cranes going. Purposefully and with\nintention.\nSo, how do you make those types of decisions, when uncertainty and change surround you? The\nfirst step is to know your goals. If you’re working on a degree program, your goals could be building and\ndeveloping your skills and interests. For businesses, it might be expanding your market or increasing\nbrand value. As a monetary policymaker, I’m focused on the dual mandate that Congress gave us: price\nstability and maximum employment.\nYour goals are your foundation. An anchor that keeps you tethered to your values and aspirations,\nand focused on what is important in times of change.\nWith those goals in mind, you assess. Understand the change you face. Is it going to affect you\ndirectly, is it going to last, what are the implications? As students, AI is probably on your mind. Asking\nhow it will impact your studies and your career goals is essential to making good decisions. As corporate\ndirectors, you’re likely also thinking about AI, as well as immigration, tariffs, deregulation, and taxes. As\na policymaker, I am focused on all of those developments and how they might shape the economy today\nand in the future.\nThis reflection, questioning, and analysis enables us to assess the tradeoffs and decide the next\nsteps. Take more classes. Put up a crane. Change the interest rate.\nAnd then it all begins again. Anchor. Assess. Decide. The virtuous cycle of remaining steady\nthrough change.\n3\n\nThe Path for Policy\nNow, you might wonder if this really works. Does steadiness really deliver reliable outcomes?\nI submit that Utah is proof. You can see it in the data. Utah is a national leader in growth and\nemployment.2 A place where entrepreneurs take smart risks—think Silicon Slopes, the Olympics, and\ncountless other businesses and initiatives. A role model for steadiness and success that lasts.\nMonetary policy makers also must practice steadiness. Making reasoned decisions that support\nour mandated goals over time.\nIndeed, we’ve relied on steadiness to navigate the changing economic landscape over the course\nof this year.\nAs I mentioned, Congress legislated two monetary policy goals for the Federal Reserve: stable\nprices and maximum employment. No matter what happens in the economy, these goals are our anchor.\nAll of our decisions are made in support of achieving those objectives for the American people.3\nThe challenge, of course, is determining how best to do that. Especially when the economy is\nrapidly evolving and we don’t have perfect clarity about how conditions will evolve. And this is where\nit’s important to step back and assess.\nEarlier in the year, there was a lot we didn’t know. Measures of uncertainty were rising sharply.4\nHouseholds and businesses were worried that tariff and immigration policies could rekindle inflation or\nslow the labor market and growth. Commentators and financial market participants wondered if the Fed\nwould need to step in, raising interest rates to combat inflation or lowering them to support growth.\nUp until last week, the FOMC did neither. Instead, we looked at inflation and how much it\nexceeded our goal for price stability. We looked at unemployment and how close it was to our maximum\n2 According to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, payroll employment growth in Utah was 1.7% over the 12\nmonths through August 2025, nearly double the national pace of 0.9%. The most recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis show\nthat Utah’s real GDP grew 3.4% over the four quarters through the first quarter of this year, well above the national pace of 2.0% over the same\nperiod.\n3 Board of Governors (2025a).\n4 See, for example, Mertens (2025).\n4\n\nemployment objective. We considered the Administration’s emerging policies, consulting history,\neconomic models, scenario analysis, and the range of incoming data. Most importantly, we talked to\npeople. We asked businesses how they were feeling, but also what they were doing. We talked to\nconsumers, workers, and communities, and listened to what they told us about their concerns and their\nactions.\nWhat we determined was that the economy was doing okay. We didn’t have to race in, but we\nneeded to continue to monitor. Risks were on the horizon, but there were also positives in the mix, and it\nwas appropriate to watch how conditions evolved. Most importantly, it was critical to stay focused on our\ncommitment to bring inflation back to our 2 percent goal. So, we left the interest rate unchanged, keeping\npolicy modestly restrictive, continuing to put downward pressure on inflation. And we actively watched\nthe labor market to ensure there were no signs of stumbling.\nDeciding to collect more information is not a passive state. It is prudent preparation for taking\naction when the time is right. That moment came last week. At our most recent FOMC meeting, we\nlowered the policy rate by 25 basis points. A decision I fully supported.\nThe decision was based on information and data. Growth, consumer spending, and the labor\nmarket had slowed, 5 and inflation had risen less than expected, remaining largely confined to sectors\ndirectly affected by tariffs.6 The risks to the economy had shifted, and it was time to act.\nManaging change isn’t a one-time thing. You must keep at it. Moving forward, it is likely that\nfurther policy adjustments will be needed as we work to restore price stability while providing needed\nsupport to the labor market. This comes through in our most recent projections, released last week.7 But\n5 Growth in real personal consumption expenditures fell from 3.1% last year to 1.0% for the first half of this year (annualized), while\nreal GDP growth fell from 2.5% to 1.4%. The annualized rate of payroll employment growth fell from 1.3% last year to 0.2% over the past four\nmonths (through August).\n6 Private forecasters have revised their inflation forecasts down in recent months (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 2025). Recent\nincreases in inflation have been evident primarily for goods (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 2025).\n7 The FOMC’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections shows that Committee members in general expect further cuts this year\nand next (Board of Governors 2025b).\n5\n\nthese are projections, not promises, and making good decisions will require us to anchor on our objectives,\nassess the tradeoffs, and decide, again and again.\nSteady, Not Static\nSo, let me return to where I began. Flying into Salt Lake last April. On the ride over, I caught up\non the news. It felt pessimistic, worried about change, nervous about uncertainty. The cranes said\nsomething different.\nAs you start your academic year, I want you to think about those cranes. Remind yourself that\nchange and uncertainty are normal parts of life. And that people move through them all the time.\nBut you can’t leave it to luck. Being steady through change takes intention. And it takes\ncommitment. Commitment to your goals, to collecting the evidence, to deciding. And most of all, it takes\na commitment to be humble. Willing to repeat the process of anchoring, assessing, and deciding each\ntime a new change comes your way.\nIn my view, this is the success of the Eccles family. It is the success of the businesses who put up\nthose cranes. And it is also your success. The success that you’ve started as you begin another academic\nyear.\nThank you and I look forward to our discussion.\n6\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2025a. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy.” Adopted effective January 24, 2012; as amended effective August 22, 2025.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2025b. “Summary of Economic Projections.” September 17.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. 2025. “Third Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 2025. “PCE Inflation Contributions from Goods and Services.”\nMertens, Thomas. 2025. “SF FedViews: July 17, 2025.” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nNational Federation of Independent Business. 2025. “Small Business Economic Trends.” August.\n7",

    "text": "“The Bumpy Road to 2 Percent: Managing Inflation in the Current Economy”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Commonwealth Club\nSan Francisco, CA\nMarch 26, 2019\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction and warm welcome. Good afternoon,\neveryone. The Commonwealth Club’s history of providing forums for healthy public\ndebate is well known, not only in the Bay Area but across the country. So it’s a real\nhonor to be addressing you today.\nI became President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\njust about six months ago. The monetary policy decisions we make at the Federal\nOpen Market Committee eight times a year have wide-ranging implications. In fact,\nour work touches the lives of every American and countless global citizens. So this is\na responsibility I take very seriously. And I’m here this afternoon to talk about how I\nsee our economic landscape and what I’ll be paying attention to in the year ahead.\nBut first, I need to issue the standard disclaimer: the remarks I’m about to\ndeliver are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the\nFederal Reserve System.\n1\n\nCurrent Conditions\nLet me begin by telling you about the Federal Reserve’s mission, and how we\njudge success. Our job is to promote a healthy and stable economy, and we do this by\npursuing two goals.\nThe first goal is maximum employment. This generally means that everyone\nwho wants a job can get one. The second goal is price stability, which the Federal\nReserve defines as an inflation rate of 2 percent.1 This allows the dollar in your pocket\nto hold its value over time. Taken together, we call this our dual mandate: maximum\nemployment and price stability.\nSo given that mandate and our two goals, it’s reasonable to ask, how’s the Fed\nbeen doing?\nLet’s start with the overall health of the economy. We’re on track to set a\nrecord for the longest period without a recession in U.S. history. It will extend past\nthe 10-year mark this summer. The economy looks to have grown just over 3 percent\nin 2018, well above its sustainable pace. And while I see some signs of slowing on the\nhorizon this year, I expect annual growth will come in around 2 percent—in line with\nits long-run trend.2\nThe strength of the economy has led to a robust labor market. In fact, the\nperformance of the labor market has been nothing short of extraordinary. For\nexample, last year we saw nearly 2.7 million jobs added to the payrolls. In addition to\nbeing a big number, that’s more than twice the amount we need to keep pace with\nnew entrants and reentrants coming in to the labor force.3 Meanwhile, unemployment\nremains near its 50-year low.\n1 Board of Governors (2012).\n2 Fernald (2019).\n3 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016).\n2\n\nEconomic models—as well as historical data—tell us that a\nprolonged economic expansion and a very tight labor market should be pushing\ninflation up to, or even above, our 2 percent goal. But that’s not what we’re\nexperiencing today. Inflation has remained low—lower than our 2 percent target—for\nmost of the past decade. We’ve grazed 2 percent here and there, including briefly last\nyear. But it hasn’t been sustainable.\nSo on our dual mandate report card, I feel good about where we are on\nemployment—but a little less so about inflation.\nDisrupted Links\nSo what’s up with inflation? Is it time to throw out our models and start from\nscratch? Have the fundamental laws of supply and demand broken down? And what\ndoes all of this mean for monetary policy? That’s what I’m going to spend the rest of\nmy time today addressing—the inflation puzzle and what we should make of it.\nLet’s start by considering how the links between employment and inflation\nhave traditionally functioned. To do that, we have to go back to Econ 101, and review\nhow monetary policy affects the economy.\nIn short, the Federal Reserve sets interest rates. These interest rates determine\nborrowing costs. Borrowing costs drive consumer and business spending, which in\nturn determines the level of economic activity. When economic activity is high, the\nlabor market heats up. A hot labor market allows workers to demand higher wages.\nAnd employers pass these wage gains on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\nThose are the basics of how things work—in theory, at least. But as a\npolicymaker, I have to focus on the practical. And in the real world, things crop up\nthat disrupt the simple linkages between monetary policy and the economy. Because\nI’m an economist, I like to call these things “wedges.” And understanding these\nwedges goes a long way toward understanding the inflation puzzle we’re facing.\n3\n\nWage and Price Wedges\nWhile there are several wedges that complicate the simple theory connecting\nmonetary policy to the economy, the ones I will focus on today relate to employment,\nwages, and prices.\nAs a Reserve Bank President, I spend a lot of time talking to businesses,\nworkers, and community members about what they’re experiencing. And what’s loud\nand clear these days is that the labor market is changing.\nAn example I hear again and again is the increasing demand from employees\nfor alternative forms of compensation. Employers are being asked to provide benefits\nlike free transportation, flexible workweeks, unlimited time off, and help with things\nlike student loan repayment and even housing. Many employers are providing these\nbenefits in an effort to attract and retain talent. And for some firms, they’ve become a\nmeaningful part of employee compensation packages.\nThe challenge for policymakers is that these alternative forms of payment aren’t\nbeing captured in the traditional measures we use to track wages and salaries.\nThis creates a wedge between the strong labor market we observe and our\navailable indicators of wage growth, and it mutes the signal we’re receiving about the\nstrength of the economy.\nAnother important wedge that’s been evolving over several decades is the loss\nof worker bargaining power.4 Declining unionization—along with increased\nautomation and globalization—have made it harder for workers to push for higher\npay, even in very healthy job markets.5 This weakens the link between employment\nand wage growth.\nOf course, workers aren’t the only group affected by these changing dynamics.\nMany firms have lost pricing power in a global marketplace, facing ever-increasing\n4 Krueger (2018) and Farber et al. (2018).\n5 Haldane (2018).\n4\n\ncompetition to hold onto customers.6 This means they have a harder\ntime passing along rising costs, such as wages, to final goods prices.\nAll of these wedges are contributing to the situation we have today: a strong\neconomy with a tight labor market—but muted inflation.7\nThe Fed Wedge\nThere’s another wedge weakening the link between economic activity and\ninflation, and it might surprise you. It’s the Fed.\nThe actions of the Federal Reserve—and the success of its monetary\npolicymaking decisions—have played an important role in keeping inflation tethered\naround 2 percent, in good times and bad.\nTo explain how, we need to go back to one of those bad times. In the 1970s, a\nseries of economic shocks hit. One shock was an oil embargo that pushed up oil\nprices. Because of the cost-of-living adjustments written into many workers’ contracts,\nthis automatically translated into wage increases. These wage increases led to price\nincreases. And when the Fed didn’t react aggressively enough to stem the rising\ninflation, a vicious cycle began.\nPeople started to think high inflation was just a fact of life. Inflation eventually\npeaked in the double digits. It wasn’t until the Fed raised interest rates dramatically\nthat inflation finally started to decline. But, as some will remember, that was a painful\nprocess.\nOnce inflation was under control, the Fed committed to keeping it that way.\nThis commitment became a well-known and accepted position that people could\ndepend on. And it ushered in the conditions that dominate today—the era of well-\nanchored inflation expectations.\n6 Cavallo (2018), Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido (2010), and Rogoff (2006).\n7 Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi (2019), Galí and Gambetti (2018), Leduc and Wilson (2017), Blanchard (2016), and Coibion\nand Gorodnichenko (2015).\n5\n\nWe see this shift in the data. Inflation expectations—of both\nbusinesses and consumers—started trending down in the late 1980s, and have\nremained close to the Fed’s 2 percent target since the mid-1990s.8\nWell-anchored inflation expectations have great benefits. When people know\nthat the Fed is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent, they’re more likely to see\ninflation fluctuations as temporary, and stop short of building them into contracts like\nwage and rental agreements.\nIn other words, when the Fed is credible, it’s easier for the economic system to\nabsorb shocks. This keeps inflation from plummeting when the economy is weak, and\na lid on inflation when the economy is strong.9\nBut here’s the twist. When the Federal Reserve is doing its job well, the link\nbetween economic activity and inflation is weaker—much like we see today. This is\nthe essence of the “Fed wedge.”\nMaintaining Credibility in a Low-Inflation Environment\nSo what does all of this mean for monetary policy?\nAs I mentioned earlier, inflation has generally been low for the past decade. In\nfact, for the past seven years, inflation has consistently come in below our 2 percent\ntarget.\nThis may not seem like much of a problem at first glance. After all, isn’t it a\ngood thing when prices stay roughly the same?\nBut too-low inflation has its own risks. It makes the chance of deflation—or\nnegative inflation—more likely. And it makes it harder for the Fed to adjust interest\nrates in the face of economic shocks.10\n8 Andreasen and Christensen (2016), Nechio (2015), and Williams (2006).\n9 Jordà et al. (2019).\n10 Bernanke (2002).\n6\n\nThe bigger problem is that the Fed has explicitly stated that 2\npercent is our goal, and that this goal is symmetric. This means we care just as much\nabout long periods of too-low inflation as we do about long periods of too-high\ninflation.11\nInflation consistently below target tugs at inflation expectations. While there is\nno sign today that the anchor has drifted down significantly, we are seeing signs that\ninflation expectations are edging lower.12 This bears close watching.\nWe need to be vigilant on this front, and work to deliver 2 percent inflation on\na sustained basis. The Federal Reserve’s continued credibility with consumers and\nbusinesses depends on it.\nConclusion\nLet me end with a few closing thoughts. The Federal Reserve’s credibility is\none of our most important assets. It isn’t just about having people believe the things\nwe say—though of course that’s important. Fed credibility is the foundation of our\nability to make effective monetary policy.\nThe American people put a lot of trust in the Federal Reserve System. We\nworked hard to earn that trust. We intend to keep earning it every day.\nThank you.\n11 Board of Governors (2019).\n12 Daly (2019), Williams (2019), and Cao and Shapiro (2016).\n7\n\nReferences\nAndreasen, Martin M., and Jens H.E.

    "text": "The Singularity of the Dual Mandate\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nBoise State University\nBoise, ID\nSeptember 29, 2022\n1:45pm MDT\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back here in Boise and to be on campus at Boise State.\nSo, thank you very much for the opportunity. I look forward to your questions and to our\ndiscussion.\nI’d like to start by talking briefly about the Federal Reserve’s congressionally mandated goals,\nwhich together form what is known as our dual mandate. One part of that mandate is full\nemployment. The other is price stability.1\nNow, these goals are often characterized as tradeoffs. More of one means less of the other.\nBut for most people, they are deeply intertwined.\nI know this from my many years as a policymaker. But I also know it from experience.\nI grew up in Ballwin, Missouri, during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. Rapidly rising prices\nmade it hard for working families like mine to afford the things we needed. Eventually, the\nFederal Reserve raised interest rates and inflation came down. But the abruptness and\nmagnitude of the response caused two painful recessions. Unemployment soared. Jobs\nbecame tough to find. And one impossible situation gave way to another.\nI didn’t know it then, but this experience would teach me an enduring lesson, one that I would\ncarry with me over the course of my career as a policymaker. The lesson is that economic\nsecurity depends on both jobs and stable prices. Together, these two pillars form the\nfoundation for everything else.\n1 In August of 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released a long-run statement that defined full employment\nand price stability goals (see Board of Governors 2022a).\n1\n\nSeen in this light, the Federal Reserve actually has a singular purpose: to keep the economy on\na sustainable path by delivering low, stable prices and durable labor market strength.\nToday, I am going to discuss this singular purpose and how price stability and full employment\nwork together to support it. But before I continue, let me remind you that the views I will\nexpress are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal\nReserve System.\nInextricably Linked\nIf you travel almost anywhere in the United States these days, you’ll hear two things about the\neconomy. The first is that the labor market is strong. The second is that inflation is high.\nBoth of these things are true.\nVirtually anyone who wants a job can find one.2 Unemployment is extremely low and has been\nso for some time. Job growth continues to run well above 300,000 per month, about 200,000\njobs more than we need to keep pace with new graduates and others entering the labor force.3\nAll of this adds up to about twice as many vacant positions nationwide as there are people\nwanting to fill them. As any business owner will tell you, this puts considerable pressure on\nwages and salaries.\nSo it’s a great time to be a worker, right?\nWell, not so much. Inflation is high, running well over the Fed’s average 2 percent target for\nwell over a year now. This can be traced back to a number of factors, but it boils down to a\nlarge and persistent imbalance between demand and supply. Demand has been supported by\npandemic-related monetary and fiscal relief, robust household savings and, over the past year,\na very strong labor market. At the same time, domestic and global supply have been highly\nconstrained, hit by a series of negative shocks, including the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and\nsevere labor shortages.\nPersistent high inflation across a broad range of goods and services is eroding the purchasing\npower of earnings, even those that are rising. This erosion is insidious—a gradual, but\npersistent chipping away of living standards. The picture makes this clear (see Figure 1). Price\ninflation measured by the consumer price index, or CPI, has been rising far faster than average\n2 As of July 2022, there were 1.98 job openings per unemployed worker. And the economy has been adding about\n487,000 jobs per month on average over the past year.\n3 About 80,000 new jobs are needed to keep the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent over the next year, according\nto the Atlanta Fed Job Calculator (https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/calculator).\n2\n\nhourly earnings. Indeed, average real wages, which take account of inflation, have declined by\n9 percent over the past two years. This means that the average worker in the U.S. economy has\nlost rather than gained ground, all while the labor market remains historically strong.\nThe story is even starker when we look at prices for basic necessities like food and energy.\nThese prices have been climbing about twice as fast as overall inflation and around three times\nas fast as average hourly earnings. The toll of this type of inflation falls on everyone, but it does\nnot fall uniformly.4 It lands hardest on those with low and moderate incomes, who spend a far\nlarger fraction of their monthly budget on basic needs.5\nThis corroding of real wages is more than just painful. It also undermines the basic American\npromise, which says that if you work hard, you can get ahead. Inflation traps people in an\nendless loop of running fast and falling behind, unrelated to effort or input.\nEventually, this sense of falling behind starts to affect decisionmaking.\n4 Low- and moderate-income families spend, on average, about 75 to 80 percent of their budgets on necessities,\ncompared to 65 percent for high-income families (see Council of Economic Advisors and Office of Management\nand Budget 2021).\n5 Inflation also erodes savings in fixed-income assets. This cost is not shared equally across the population since\nportfolio compositions differ across groups (see, for example, Diwan, Duzhak, and Mertens 2021). In particular,\nolder and less wealthy citizens tend to have a higher share of checkable deposits as a fraction of their financial\nassets (see Board of Governors 2022c).\n3\n\nDistortions and Decisions\nAs people struggle to keep up with rising prices, earning money becomes the central factor in\ndetermining which jobs they choose.\nNow, in some ways this seems fine. We work so we can buy things—to support ourselves, take\ncare of our families, and give back to our communities. But when wages dominate all other\nconsiderations, like the type of job we do or the chance for future mobility, they become a\nwedge—putting space between what people need today and what they want for their future.\nWorkers everywhere are facing these choices. I recently heard an example at a gathering of\nlocal business leaders. One of them was from a large restaurant group with locations in\nmultiple cities. It offered competitive salaries, health benefits, and lots of opportunities for\nprofessional growth. But longtime employees who had been advancing through the ranks and\nbuilding careers with the organization were suddenly leaving. When the owner asked them\nwhy, he learned they were no longer able to afford rent near the city and had to move much\nfarther away. Then gas prices started to rise and commuting so far became unsustainable. So\nmany of them left to take lower-paying fast-food jobs nearer to where they lived. These jobs\nhad fewer benefits and little opportunity for upward mobility. But what choice did they have?\nThey had to manage their short-term budget pressures, even when it meant giving up jobs with\nbrighter long-term prospects.\nThe effect of these choices, multiplied across large numbers of workers, has an impact on firms.\nBusinesses are experiencing considerable churn in their employee base, often losing workers as\nfast as they can train them.6 Their response is predictable: raise wages as much as possible to\ntry and retain staff; divide jobs into simpler tasks that require less training; and accelerate the\nsearch for ways to automate or outsource in order to reduce future worker demand. In the\nmeantime, produce less and expand more slowly.\nUnfortunately, the distortions from high inflation don’t stop there. They also influence longer-\nterm decision making in a way that lingers well after inflation has come down. One of the\nclearest examples of this long-term impact can be seen in trends in postsecondary schooling.\nEnrollments in two and four-year colleges, certification programs, and technical training are all\nfalling.7 This is happening for many reasons, but two key factors are affordability and\nopportunity cost. Postsecondary education is already expensive. But it is even more costly\nwhen people have to give up earnings and still pay more for gas, food, and rent. And when\n6 According to the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, more people have been quitting\ntheir jobs over the past year than in any year since the survey started in December 2000\n(https://www.bls.gov/jlt/).\n7 Enrollment in postsecondary education has declined as of the spring of this year (see National Student\nClearinghouse Research Center 2022).\n4\n\nfirms are avidly bidding up wages to compete for workers, the equation just doesn’t add up.\nAnd so young people are taking jobs and delaying or opting out of school.8\nAnd here again, these individual choices bubble up to firms. Their strategic decisions about\nwhere to locate, expand, and invest are shaped by the projected availability of workers,\nespecially skilled ones. As they plan for their future, declining school enrollments will factor\ninto all of these decisions.\nIn other words, persistently high inflation is painful and it's disruptive. It seeps into everything,\nincluding investment, production, and growth. Over time, it accumulates into a mountain of\nmisallocations and lost opportunities. And it adds up to a smaller economic pie for all.\nAnd this is why price stability is so crucial. It allows households and businesses to make\ndecisions based on preferences, ideas, drive, and talent and lays the foundation for sustainable\ngrowth and durable expansion now and in the future. Price stability is like an asset that pays\ndividends year after year. And protecting it supports everyone.\nReturning to Two Percent\nBut when you have been far away from something for a while, it can seem hard to find your\nway back. And this is the concern that many have about inflation. People worry that\nsomething has been lost, and the only way to regain it is to induce a painful recession like the\nones we saw in the 1980s.9\nBut the circumstances back then were different. Policymakers had two major problems. One\nwas that inflation was high and rising. Another was that inflation had been elevated for more\nthan a decade and had seeped into the psychology of American consumers and businesses.\nEveryone expected high inflation to continue. So as inflation went up, longer-term inflation\nexpectations went up with it.10 The Fed had no choice but to “rip the Band-Aid” off and\ndramatically slow the economy in order to reset inflation psychology.11\n8 A hot labor market can tilt incentives towards short-run economic gains at the expense of longer-term\nsustainable progress (Aaronson et al. 2019). For example, as shown by Blom, Cadena, and Keys (2021), business\ncycle conditions affect college students’ choice of their major. And changes in labor markets and overall economic\nactivity affect enrollment rates (see, for example, Dellas and Koubi 2003 and Dellas and Sakellaris 2003).\n9 Goodfriend and King (2005) describe the recessions in the early 1980s that followed the pursuit to lower the rate\nof inflation.\n10 The co-movement between inflation expectations and inflation can be found in Daly (2022). Erceg and Levin\n(2003) show that learning about persistent versus transitory shifts in the interest rate rule can account for this\neffect.\n11 For an account of the Volcker disinflation, see Silber (2012).\n5\n\nToday, we are in a better place. Of course, inflation has been too high for too long, coming in\nabove target for more than a year. But inflation expectations, especially at the longer end,\nhave remained stable and well anchored around the Fed’s 2-percent inflation goal. This means\nthat, so far, inflation psychology has not been lost and the public continues to believe the Fed\nhas the tools and the resolve to restore price stability.12\nBut we cannot take this for granted. The longer inflation remains high, the more likely it is to\nchange people’s expectations and undermine confidence.13 14 And that is a problem we must\navoid.\nThe question of course, is how?\nNavigating the economy toward a more sustainable path necessitates higher interest rates and\na downshift in the pace of economic activity and the labor market. But for now, inducing a\ndeep recession does not seem warranted by conditions, nor is it necessary to achieve our\ngoals.\nAnd this is crucial. Decades of research show the heavy toll that deep recessions take on\npeople and families.15 Whole generations of workers feel lasting effects. The impact is striking\n(see Figure 2). People who enter the labor market during a recession come in on lower rungs of\nthe career ladder and earn wages well below their peers who enter during expansions.16\nEveryone is affected; college graduates, non-college graduates, all genders and races. But\nthose historically less advantaged, including those with less than a high school education and\npeople of color, are especially hard hit.17 And these effects are not short-lived. They persist\nthroughout an individual’s career. The more severe the recession, the greater the potential\nharm.\n12 Empirical evidence points to anchored long-term inflation expectations (see, for example, Armantier et al.\n2022).\n13 People tend to form inflation expectations based on the inflation experience during their lifetime (see\nMalmendier and Nagel 2016).\n14 For example, Jordà et al. (2022) shows that wage inflation responds to inflation expectations. Lansing (2022)\npoints out the risk that inflation might become more persistent.\n15 There is a long literature on the cost of economic fluctuations (see, for example, Okun 1973, Lucas 1987, and\nHassan and Mertens 2017). The cost of recessions falls primarily on households at the lower end of the wealth\nspectrum (see Krueger, Mitman, and Perri 2016).\n16 Recessions have a particularly detrimental and long-lasting effect on the career trajectories of young workers\n(for example, von Wachter 2012, Altonji, Kahn, and Speer 2016, and Schwandt and von Wachter 2019). People\nentering the labor market during a recession earn persistently lower wages throughout their career and enter into\nlower-level occupations (see Kahn 2010 and Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2012).\n17 For increases in unemployment rates across subgroups, see Duzhak (2021). Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller (2012)\nstudy the Great Recession in comparison to previous recessions.\n6\n\nAvoiding this kind of harsh recession will not be easy, but we must try.\nAnd we’ve done it before. The expansion that started in the 1990s is a notable example.18\nAfter the Fed tightened policy to keep prices stable, growth slowed but no recession ensued.\nAnd a decade of sustained growth followed.\nNo doubt, the job will be harder this time. We are facing a myriad of risks. Ongoing battles\nwith COVID globally, the war in Ukraine, and impending recession in Europe, all while central\nbanks across the globe are tightening monetary policy to combat high and rising prices.19 These\nrisks, combined with stubbornly persistent supply chain issues, ongoing strength in the labor\nmarket, and robust consumer spending, narrow the path for a smooth landing. But they do not\nclose it.20\nResolute to our goals, the Fed has raised the benchmark interest rate rapidly this year, and\nprojects additional increases will be needed.21 These are necessary and appropriate\nadjustments, taken to put the economy back on a solid footing.\n18 For an account of the end of tightening cycles, see Blinder (2022).\n19 Policy tightening by central banks around the world can lead to more restrictive policy in the United States (see\nObstfeld 2022).\n20 Past recessions have been preceded by an inversion of the yield curve (see Bauer and Mertens 2018). The most\nreliable measure currently does not indicate an inversion, suggesting that a relatively soft landing is still possible\n(see Bauer and Mertens 2022). Bok et al. (2022) discusses the possibility of a reduction in the number of\nvacancies without a pronounced increase in the number of unemployed workers.\n21 See the latest Summary of Economic Projections (Board of Governors 2022b). The FOMC has raised the federal\nfunds rate in 75 basis-point steps three times and, together with other rate hikes, by a total of 3 percentage points\nthis year.\n7\n\nWe are already starting to see the effects—housing markets are cooling, the labor market is\neasing, and projections of future growth are softening. Of course, the full impact of our policies\nwill unfold over time.22 So, we will need to remain attentive to the data, and recognize the\nsigns that enough has been done or more is needed. History tells us that the costs of errors are\nhigh. Too little could allow inflation expectations to drift, requiring even more difficult policy\nactions in the future. And too much could end in overtightening and an unnecessary and\npainful downturn. Successful policy will require vigorous analysis, extreme data dependence,\nand a resolute commitment to delivering on our mandate.\nTwo Mandates, One Goal\nThe enduring lesson of my childhood is that people need both jobs and stable prices. That is\nwhy the dual mandate is not a choice between two desirable things. It is a balance meant to\ndeliver on a singular goal—a sustainable and expanding economy that works for everyone.\nThat is the foundation of economic security. And that is what the Federal Reserve is working to\nachieve.\nThank you.\n22 For a discussion of the lag in monetary policy, see, for example, Greenspan (2004). Empirical estimates can be\nfound in Barnichon and Matthes (2018).\n8\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie R., Mary C. Daly, William Wascher, David W.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:15 a.m. PDT\nJune 22, 2025\nDynamic Central Bank Communication\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nWestern Economic Association International Annual Conference\nSan Francisco, California\nJune 22, 2025\n10:15 a.m. PDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\n1\n\nIntroduction\nGood morning and welcome to San Francisco.\nIt’s a complete pleasure to be here today and an honor to be speaking at the WEAI 100th annual\nconference. That’s quite a milestone, and a testament to the association’s enduring contributions to\neconomic research. So, well done and happy anniversary.\nNow, when Maury first invited me to speak, I thought of many topics worthy of focus. But one\nrose above all others, perhaps because it’s perennial, and that is central bank communication.\nAs researchers, and educators, you understand the importance of communicating. It is a large part\nof your jobs.\nFor central bankers, this value has often been harder to recognize. Even doubted.\nCommunication has always come with questions: Should we communicate? How often? And what should\nwe say?\nOn the question of “should we,” my answer is simple. Absolutely. Public institutions have an\nunequivocal obligation to share information. Central banks are no exception. It is a duty of public service\nto be transparent about and accountable for our actions.\nBut this itself is not a license to reflexively do more and more. Communication is also a\nresponsibility, and it comes with an imperative to improve understanding. How to balance these\nobjectives is the topic of my remarks today. I look forward to an active discussion.\nBefore I go any further, I would like to remind you that the views I express today are my own and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the\nFederal Reserve System. I also want to emphasize that today I'm speaking broadly about central bank\ncommunication—my remarks are not about the Fed's ongoing framework review.\n2\n\nThe Evolution of Communication\nNow, to understand where central banks might go, it is useful to know where we’ve been. And\nhere I will narrow my focus to the Federal Reserve and the FOMC.\nFor most of its history, the FOMC has worked under a veil of secrecy. This was intentional.\nFederal Reserve officials were either silent or purposely vague,1 letting financial markets learn about\npolicies through inference, by watching movements in market interest rates.2 The prevailing view was\nthat less transparency promoted candid internal debate, minimized disruptive financial market reactions,\nand provided flexibility to respond to unexpected events.3 Moreover, many policymakers thought that\nthey needed to surprise markets for policy to have an effect.4\nToday, the Federal Reserve is significantly more transparent, an evolution that has taken place\nover the past 30 years. This timeline tells the story.5 The FOMC now publishes meeting statements and\nminutes, economic projections and projected interest rate paths, a statement on longer-run goals and\nmonetary policy strategy, and of course, an explicit inflation target.6 The Chair also holds post-meeting\npress conferences, and FOMC participants regularly provide their own commentary and views during\ninter-meeting periods.\n1 As late as the June 2003 FOMC meeting, then-Chair Alan Greenspan advised participants to be “very vague” in response to questions\nabout the conduct of monetary policy. See Federal Open Market Committee (2003). Chair Greenspan generally adhered to this approach,\nreputedly joking to reporters that “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said” (Appelbaum 2012).\n2 The FOMC released its first post-meeting statement in February 1994 and began to release a statement after every regularly\nscheduled meeting in May 1999.\n3 See the discussion in Federal Reserve History (2024) and Blinder et al. (2024).\n4 Poole (2005).\n5 For a broad overview of the evolution of transparency see Daly (2022).\n6 Board of Governors (2024).\n3\n\nThese enhanced communications have had considerable benefits. First, they have increased the\npublic’s understanding of the Federal Reserve’s mandates and commitments. Second, as research has\ndocumented, clear monetary policy communication has helped anchor inflation expectations and helped\nthe FOMC navigate economic shocks more effectively.7 Finally, these communications have allowed\nhouseholds, businesses, and financial markets8 to understand how policy makers see the economy and\nhow they might react if things evolve differently than expected. Ultimately, improving their ability to\nmake good decisions.\nTogether this has improved transparency, credibility and accountability.9 All of which have\nhelped build trust.\n7 Bundick and Smith (2023).\n8 For instance, Swanson (2006). Also, recent work at the San Francisco Fed shows that the quarterly release of participant projections\non the outlook for the economy and interest rates reduces investor uncertainty about the future path of interest rates. This effect is especially large\naround and following recessions, when uncertainty may be higher. The research will be discussed in a forthcoming FRBSF Economic Letter by\nAbdelrahman, Fresquet Kohan, Mertens, and Oliveira, based on past work by Mertens and Williams (2021).\n9 The reaction function of the FOMC is largely communicated through FOMC statements, the public remarks of the Chair and other\nFOMC participants, and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).\n4\n\nGiven the success, many have asked if we should do more. Academics, analysts, and policy\nmakers have offered a variety of suggestions.10 The ideas range from publishing details about the forecast\nand the risks, to doing scenario analysis,11 to simplifying the message and using social media to build\nunderstanding.12\nThe question is, how should we balance the need for transparency with the responsibility of\nimproving understanding? To answer this question, I return to two periods of economic history.\nHistory Lessons\nLet me start with the Global Financial Crisis, or GFC. As you likely remember, the recovery from\nthe recession was painfully slow. Then-Chair Ben Bernanke and others grappled with how to implement\nmonetary policy that was constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates. Borrowing from\nacademic research, they implemented a variety of alternative tools, including regular communications and\nstrong forward guidance. This helped guide policy expectations toward a more accommodative stance,\nwhich helped support the recovery.13\nThese detailed and definitive communications made sense. After all, inflation was below target,\nemployment growth was weak, and markets weren’t sure how long the FOMC would be accommodative.\nIn fact, markets regularly assumed interest rates would rise faster than FOMC participants expected.\nFOMC communications made the policy path clear and offered the support the economy needed to move\nback toward the dual mandate goals.\nIn that moment, the problem was clear, and the treatment was forceful. The success installed\nmany of the communication tools as permanent features of the FOMC.\n10 See the presentations at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Second Thomas Laubach Research Conference.\n11 Several central banks have started using scenarios in their communication with the public, including the Bank of Canada (2025),\nBank of England (2025), and Sveriges Riksbank (2025). But only Sweden’s Riksbank has included a policy path in the scenarios. Former Fed\nChair Ben Bernanke (2025) proposed the FOMC follow a similar tack.\n12 Gorodnichenko, Pham, and Talavera (2025).\n13 See Campbell et al. (2017) and Bernanke (2020).\n5\n\nThen, about a decade later, the pandemic hit. Economic activity plummeted and financial markets\nteetered. The Fed cut interest rates close to zero and took emergency steps to support the flow of credit\nand liquidity. We committed to using the full range of our tools until the crisis had passed and economic\nrecovery was well under way.\nNotably, that included a commitment to keep interest rates near zero until we were confident that\nthe economy was on track to achieve our employment and price stability goals.14 We were very specific\nin our guidance, following what we had learned from the Global Financial Crisis. Our policies and\ncommunications helped stabilize markets, threw a lifeline to businesses and households, and put the\neconomy on a quicker path to recovery.15\nThis all worked, until it didn’t.\nYou know what happened. In 2021, inflation surged, and we needed to pivot. We raised rates\naggressively and communicated strongly that we were resolute to restore price stability. These efforts\nhave been successful and inflation is now near our 2 percent goal.\nBut looking back it could have been easier, especially on the people we serve. Our strong forward\nguidance in the aftermath of the pandemic firmly set public expectations, but then when the economy\nshifted, and inflation soared, it left people unsure about how we would respond.16 While there were many\ndrivers of the global runup in inflation, and the subsequent rise in inflation expectations, our guidance\nlikely didn’t help, at least initially.17\nThe lesson for me from that period is that being definitive in highly uncertain times comes with a\nprice. And we need to evaluate that price as we make future decisions about what to say. Words have\npower, which is a great tool. But words can be harder to reverse than the interest rate. They set\nexpectations, which can be hard to change in the event the economy evolves differently than we expect.18\n14 Powell (2020).\n15 Milstein and Wessel (2024) and Clarida, Duygan-Bump, and Scotti (2021).\n16 This concern fed into the rise in short- and medium-term inflation, which rose precipitously in this period.\n17 Glick, Leduc, and Pepper (2022). See Bernanke and Blanchard (2023) for a full review of the post-pandemic inflation episode.\n18 Walsh (2025).\n6\n\nPrinciples of Communication\nSo, what do these two periods of history tell us? Mostly this: There is no single, simple answer.\nEffective communication requires a dynamic approach and continuous evaluation. What works in one\nsituation may not work as effectively in another. Communication must be consistent enough that people\ncan follow, and dynamic enough that it can adjust to the circumstances we face.\nSo, how should we choose when and what to do? For this, I look to principles.\nThe first is clarity. Anything we do should improve the public’s understanding of our goals,\nexpectations, risks, or reaction function. We should always have a purpose for communicating and a way\nto evaluate our effectiveness. Second, any communication should enhance transparency, revealing how\nwe think, how we make decisions, and why we reach the conclusions we do. This is the foundation of\naccountability. The final principle is flexibility. The economy is dynamic, and our communications must\nmatch it. Providing guidance about what we know, humility about what we don’t, and a commitment to\nrespond to the world we get, even if it is different from the one we expect.\nLike many things, these principles will sometimes be in tension, and central banks will have to\nbalance the tradeoffs. In those moments, we need to return to why we do this at all. To be open and\naccountable to the public we serve.\nConclusion\nI started at the Fed in 1996. I quickly learned that we were an institution that did a lot and said\nlittle. But that didn’t always serve the public. So, we changed.\nBut our journey shouldn’t stop here. Public institutions, like the Fed, have a responsibility to\ncontinually revisit how we communicate and how we can do better. It’s the right thing to do, and as\nhistory has taught us, it’s the best thing to do.\n7\n\nAnd with that I would like to turn it over to Emi and Ellen. Thank you and I look forward to our\ndiscussion.\n8\n\nReferences\nAppelbaum, Binyamin. 2012. “A Fed Focused on the Value of Clarity.” New York Times News Analysis,\nDecember 13.\nBank of Canada. 2025.

    "text": "Monetary Policy: Progress Is Not Victory\nMary C. Daly\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, NY\nOctober 5, 2023, 12 PM EDT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nGood afternoon. It’s terrific to be here and be speaking once again to the Economic Club of New York.\nSo, thank you very much for the invitation, and I look forward to a great discussion.\nBefore we get started, I would like to take a few minutes to describe how I see the current economic\nenvironment and the uncertainties and tradeoffs we face as we calibrate policy. The key takeaway is\nthat the moment calls for optionality. We must keep our minds open so that we can respond to\nconditions as they evolve. Vigilance and agility are paramount to finishing the job—the job being, of\ncourse, to restore price stability as gently as we can.\nThe good news is—at this point—we have time to get it right. The economy and policy are in a much\nbetter place. Growth and inflation are gradually slowing and the risks to the outlook are largely\nbalanced. Monetary policy is restrictive and financial conditions are tight. So, we don’t have to rush to\nany decisions.\nBut progress isn’t victory. And we must remain resolute to finish the job. A gradual return to 2 percent\ninflation is in our sights, but it is not yet in our grasp. That is the final mile.\nBut before I go further, let me say that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily\nreflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nProgress to Date\nI mentioned that the economy and policy are in a better place. So, let me begin by taking stock of where\nwe have been and how far we have come.\n1\n\nAs you may remember, in March 2022—just 18 months ago—the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) had a problem. Headline and core inflation had risen to multidecade highs and were projected\nto keep rising. Inflation expectations, especially at the short end, were close behind.1 And there were\nconcerns that this could generate a more worrisome increase in medium- and longer-run inflation\nexpectations.\nSo, the FOMC began to rapidly adjust monetary policy.2\nSince that time, we have raised the federal funds rate by 525 basis points to its highest level in 22 years.3\nThese cumulative increases have moved policy into restrictive territory. Indeed, the real federal funds\nrate, as measured by the nominal funds rate less one-year-ahead inflation expectations, exceeds almost\nall measures of its neutral value.4\nWe are seeing the effects of this tightening on the economy. Headline and core inflation have both\ndeclined significantly, bringing us much closer to our 2 percent target.5 As my contacts in the Twelfth\nDistrict tell me, this is having an immediate positive effect on households, businesses, and communities\nwho have been struggling on the treadmill of constantly rising prices and falling purchasing power. The\nrelief they’re seeing in their wallets is translating directly into more positive views about future inflation.\nWe see this nationally in short-run inflation expectations, which have been falling almost one for one\nwith the declines in inflation.6\nPerhaps most encouragingly, the welcomed decline in inflation has come without significant\ndeterioration in economic growth or the labor market. The economy and labor market are slowing, but\nnot severely or abruptly. These developments have led market participants, businesses, and households\nto replace fears of recession with hopes for a soft landing, a sea change from earlier this year.7\nThis is unequivocally good news. But to ensure that we fully achieve the outcomes we want—sustainable\nprice stability and a healthy and balanced labor market—we need to finish the job.\nSo, what will this require?\n1 Household expectations of near-term inflation began rising following a surge in commodity prices in 2021. For more information, see Glick et\nal. (2021).\n2 The FOMC first signaled that policy would need to be tightened in November 2021. It started the tightening cycle in its March 2022 meeting.\n3 The current range of the federal funds rate is 5.25 to 5.5 percent.\n4 A range of common measures for business and consumer inflation expectations currently puts one-year-ahead inflation expectations between\n2.5 percent and 3.6 percent, leading to a real funds rate between 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent. This is notably above the median Summary of\nEconomic Projections (SEP) estimate of the neutral rate of 0.50 percent.\n5 Federal Open Market Committee (2023) specifies the 2 percent target as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index\n(PCEPI). As of August 2023, the 12-month change in overall PCEPI moderated to 3.5 percent from a high of 7.1 percent in June 2022. Similarly,\ncore PCEPI, which excludes volatile food and energy categories, fell from a peak of 5.6 percent to 3.9 percent.\n6 Business and consumer short-term inflation expectations have fallen notably since the beginning of the current tightening cycle. For example,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Business Inflation Expectations shows one-year-ahead expected inflation moderating from 3.8 percent in\nMarch 2022 to 2.5 percent in the latest reading. Similarly, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers show a moderation in one-year-\nahead expected inflation from 5.4 percent in March 2022 to 3.2 percent in the latest reading.\n7 For example, the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers’ index for expected business conditions, which measures household sentiment\nfor economic growth in the coming year, improved notably since earlier this year and reached its highest value since the beginning of the\ncurrent tightening cycle as of September 2023. Additionally, the latest Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional Forecasters\nshows respondents placing less probability on a downturn in real GDP in the second half of 2023 relative to earlier in the year.\n2\n\nA Balanced Approach\nVigilance and agility.\nLet’s start with vigilance. We need to be vigilant in assessing the odds that the good data we’ve been\nseeing is a new trend, rather than just a temporary relief that will stall out too early, leaving us short of\nour goals. Either is possible.\nI’ve discussed the recent positive data and the progress we’ve made. But why might these positive\ndevelopments plateau? Put simply, the economy still has considerable momentum and a ways to go to\ncome back into balance.\nHeadline data tell the story. In the labor market, even with the recent slowing, job growth remains well\nabove what is needed to keep pace with labor force growth, and other indicators point to ongoing\nstrength.8 Inflation is similar. While overall inflation has fallen a lot, it continues to be almost 2\npercentage points higher than our target.\nNow, it’s possible that the slowing we are seeing will translate into a steady march toward our goals. But\nin the case of inflation, there are real risks to this projection. Many components are coming down just as\nexpected and should continue to slow. But nonhousing core services, often called supercore, has been\nrelatively sticky and remains far above its pre-pandemic level.9 Although it often lags other inflation, we\nwill need to see some progress in this category to be fully confident we are on the path back to price\nstability. 10, 11\nWhat does this mean for policy? Well, this is where agility comes in. We need to be positioned and\nprepared for however the economy evolves. We need to have options.\nIf we continue to see a cooling labor market and inflation heading back to our target, we can hold\ninterest rates steady and let the effects of policy continue to work. Importantly, even if we hold rates\nwhere they are today, policy will grow increasingly restrictive as inflation and inflation expectations fall.\nSo, holding rates steady is an active policy action.12\nLikewise, if financial conditions, which have tightened considerably in the past 90 days, remain tight, the\nneed for us to take further action is diminished.\nIn contrast, if the deceleration of growth and inflation stalls, activity begins to reaccelerate, or financial\nconditions loosen too much, we can react to those data and raise rates further until we are confident\nthat monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to complete the job.\n8 About 100,000 new jobs per month are needed to keep the unemployment rate at its current level of 3.8 percent over the next year, according\nto the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Jobs Calculator. The U.S. economy added an average of 150,000 jobs over the three months ending in\nAugust 2023.\n9 The 12-month change in the price index for core nonhousing services has been above 4 percent since April 2021.\n10 In August 2023, consumer spending on core nonhousing services was about 50 percent of total spending. Moreover, this category contributed\naround 2.1 percentage points, or 60 percent, to the 12-month change in overall PCEPI inflation.\n11 If the contribution of core nonhousing services to the 12-month change in overall PCEPI inflation remained at its current level and\ncontributions from all other categories returned to their pre-pandemic (2016–2019) averages, overall inflation would only moderate to\napproximately 2.6 percent.\n12 The restrictiveness of policy is measured by the real interest rate, which is the nominal federal funds rate less one-year-ahead expected\ninflation. If the nominal funds rate is held steady while inflation and inflation expectations continue to moderate, the real interest rate will rise,\nmaking monetary policy more restrictive.\n3\n\nIn other words, rather than a prejudged path of what policy will be, we need an open mind and\noptionality.\nThe Final Mile\nWhen I travel around my District and across the nation, I see the progress we’ve made in the past year.\nAnd that is worth acknowledging.\nBut as I said at the start, progress alone is not victory. And it will take vigilance and agility to complete\nthe final mile.\nThank you.\nReferences\nFederal Open Market Committee. 2023. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”\nAdopted effective January 24, 2012; as reaffirmed effective January 31, 2023.\nGlick, Reuven, Noah Kouchekinia, Sylvain Leduc, and Zheng Liu. 2021. “Do Households Expect Inflation\nWhen Commodities Surge?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2021-19, (July 12).\n4",

    "text": "FINAL\n“Becoming Owners: The Business Case for Customer-Centered Banking”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSymposium on Asian Banking and Finance\nSingapore\nJune 3, 2019\n9:45AM SGT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction, Ravi, and for being the gracious\nhost of this year’s symposium.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco have partnered on this event for the past several years. But this\nis my first time making the trip to Singapore – and I’m really excited to be\nhere.\nNow, before I begin, I have to give the standard disclaimer: the remarks\nI’m about to deliver are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of\nanyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\nNavigating headwinds\nBanking for the common good. It’s a natural evolution of the\nconversations we’ve been having at this event, and many like it, for the past\nseveral years.\n1\n\nFINAL\nBeing more customer-focused… using finance to create inclusive\ngrowth… understanding the role that organizational culture plays in all of it…\nthese are hot topics for both the financial services industry and regulatory\ninstitutions.1 And progress has been made.2\nYet consumers remain wary – even a little skeptical – of financial firms.\nI’ve got a front row seat for this in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are a lot\nof people willing to turn to Big Tech – and away from Big Banks – when it\ncomes to managing their finances. A study last year found that 58 percent of\nAmericans would be willing to move their banking to non-traditional financial\ncompanies like Amazon or Google.3\nAnd it makes sense. Banks are still repairing the breach of trust caused\nby the global financial crisis. Repeated scandals showed that banks weren’t\nalways good actors. Poor corporate culture and profit-first practices created\nsignificant consequences for consumers.4 People lost homes, retirement\nsavings, college funds… a sense of security. It left deep scars.\nSince then, much-needed regulations have improved the resiliency of\nthe financial system, making future crises less likely. This has helped boost\nconfidence in the industry.\nBut the world didn’t stand still while banks worked to recover their\ncredibility with the public. Technology-based competitors emerged with\ncustomer-centric approaches to finance.\n1 Bailey (2018), Menon (2019), and Lagarde (2019).\n2 De Nederlandsche Bank (2015) and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (2016).\n3 Center for the Digital Future at USC Annenberg (2018).\n4 Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2018) and Williams (2018).\n2\n\nFINAL\nThey offered targeted products, tailor-made to serve the needs of a\ndiverse customer base. They worked to keep costs low, and efficiency and\nconvenience high. Notably, these firms also talked about the broader good,\nand how their business models help promote a better future.5\nPutting these things together, traditional financial institutions are facing\nsome pretty strong headwinds. And they’re headwinds that can’t be addressed\nthrough regulatory guardrails alone.\nSo what can be done?\nHere’s my view: banks – large and small – need to become owners.\nOwners who are committed to – and accountable for – doing right by their\ncustomers and their communities.\nYou might be thinking that sounds like a lot. Or maybe that it’s even too\nhigh of a standard. But speaking from experience, I can tell you: it is possible.\nBecoming owners\nThe Federal Reserve System faced its own challenges in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis. Public trust in our institution plummeted, and it’s been slow to\ncome back.6 And like private-sector firms, we face an ever-changing\nlandscape, and a highly competitive environment for the best ideas and talent.\nThis was especially true at our Bank, with its proximity to Silicon Valley.\nSo about four years ago, the San Francisco Fed decided to take a hard\nlook at our own organization. What was working? What wasn’t? Our culture\nsoon emerged as one of the biggest areas in need of improvement. So we\ndecided to change it.\n5 Menon (2019).\n6 Saad (2019) and Gallup (2019).\n3\n\nFINAL\nWe started with the basics. We focused not only on what employees do,\nbut also how they do it. And we emphasized skills and behaviors that would\nenable our best work… things like collaboration, emotional intelligence,\ninfluence, and critical thinking.\nThis was our starting point – our foundation. But something was still\nmissing.\nTo really get to the next level, it became clear we needed to do more. We\nneeded to become owners. Ready to hold ourselves accountable to our\nmission, vision, and values – no excuses. Prepared to trust our employees to\ndo the right thing – even when no one is watching, and even when there isn’t a\ndetailed rulebook to follow.\nThis transition to a culture of owners hasn’t been easy. And we’re far\nfrom done. But embracing this mindset has changed us – and for the better. So\nI want to share with you what we’ve learned.\nDefining your values\nThe first step in becoming an owner is defining your values. What do\nyou believe in? How will you go about achieving your mission and vision?\nAt the Federal Reserve, we’re tasked with a dual mandate – promoting\nfull employment and price stability. We also support safe and sound banking\nand payment systems. That’s our mission.\nAt the San Francisco Fed, we want to be the best in public service. That’s\nour vision.\nOur values are something different – but equally important.\n4\n\nFINAL\nThey’re spelled out on a banner that greets every person who walks into\nour lobby each day. It says: “Our work touches every American and countless\nglobal citizens.”\nThat’s our core value – service. Service to the people and the\ncommunities we represent. That’s the reason we show up to work every day.\nThat’s our touchstone.\nBuilding trust\nDefining your values is essential. But it’s only the beginning of building a\nculture of ownership.\nTo give values life, and make them real for every individual you work\nwith, you have to take action. And those actions have to be rooted in trust –\nthe trust that your people will act in the interest of others and the\norganization.\nLet me give you an example. This is what the San Francisco Fed’s\nemployee handbook used to look like. It was created with the best of\nintentions: to help people become successful members of our team. But what\nit turned into is pretty intimidating.\nIt’s heavy. It has a lot of rules. Worst of all, it sends the message that we\nneed to micro-manage and monitor the very people we’re counting on to be\nour ambassadors – our employees.\nThis is the opposite of trust.\nSo we threw the whole thing out.\nHere’s the new one. Big difference. I can carry it around with me, for one\nthing.\n5\n\nFINAL\nGone are the lists of dos and don’ts. In their place is a new mindset – one\nthat defaults to the positive. It describes our values, and calls on employees to\nuphold them using their best judgment. Most importantly, the new handbook\nmoves away from solving for potential bad behavior, and instead emphasizes\nthe expectation of good behavior.\nWe followed the new handbook with more radical moves. We told\npeople they could “dress for their day,” and “flex for their day,” and “stop\ndoing it” if certain processes no longer added value.\nNot surprisingly, all these changes caused some heartburn. You might\nbe thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if people take\nadvantage? What if we can no longer get our work done?\nI get it. Conducting business this way requires a lot of trust at every\nlevel of the organization. And people are going to bump into each other as\nthey figure things out.\nSo it’s important to have a plan in place for mitigating those conflicts.\nPart of this can be achieved by simply acknowledging that growing pains are a\nnatural part of the process.\nBut it’s equally important for leaders to model how situations should be\nevaluated when judgment – rather than a rule book – is the deciding factor.\nEmployees take their cues from the top, especially during times of change.\nSo it’s essential for all of us to hold ourselves accountable to the values\nwe’ve defined, even if it’s uncomfortable or unpopular in the short term.\nIf you’re willing to do this, I know you’ll be pleasantly surprised.\nLiving without a detailed rulebook is possible – if you’ve defined the\nright values, and empowered employees to act in the best interest of your\norganization and its customers.\n6\n\nFINAL\nThey’ll do the right thing – even if no one is watching, and even when\nthey face uncharted territory.\nCommitting to a growth mindset\nSo once you’ve defined your values, and built an environment of trust,\nhow do you keep growing? How do you stay agile?\nThere are two essential ingredients for success: diversity of thought,\nand inclusion of ideas.\nNow, I’m not talking about optical diversity, where you simply set the\ntable with people who look different. I mean true diversity, where you\nencourage new ideas and differences of opinion, and include them equally in\nthe discussion.\nPut simply: listening to a wide variety of viewpoints produces better\noutcomes. It ensures you’re considering all angles. And it makes you aware of\nissues and problems that aren’t even on your radar.\nI’ve found this particularly valuable as a new leader.\nI’m naturally a fast talker. I love nothing more than batting ideas back\nand forth like a ping pong ball. I’ll get excited, interrupt, draw on a whiteboard\n– it’s an event, a brainstorming mania.\nBut I recently had an epiphany. Not everyone is like me. And in my\nexcitement to jump in first, I was crowding out lots of other good ideas. I was\ninadvertently pushing people onto the sidelines.\nSo I started writing notes to myself, reminding me to slow down. I’ve\nworked harder to include more introverted voices, or remote employees who\nfind it difficult to interject on the phone. And I’ve told others around me to\nhold me accountable to this goal.\n7\n\nFINAL\nIt’s a work in progress. But I’m happy to report that a number of quieter\nvoices have emerged and become valuable contributors at my table. And\nthey’re helping to transform our organization.\nMaking the business case\nThis is what’s working for us at the San Francisco Fed.\nBut you may be thinking: Sure, this sounds great for a public service\norganization. Your job is to pursue the common good. How would this work in\nthe private sector, at a profit-making bank?\nAnd I’d like to answer that question with two stories.\nThe CEO of the online retailer Zappos once wrote an article in the\nHarvard Business Review to explain how his company had earned its\nreputation for delivering best-in-class customer service.7 And he told a story\nabout a woman who called in after forgetting to mail back a pair of shoes she’d\nplanned to return. There’d been a death in her family. So the Zappos rep sent\nher flowers.\nThat’s the kind of thing that’s possible when employees are empowered\nto act as ambassadors for your values. Yes, that phone rep may have spent $50\nto do the right thing – but as the CEO himself said: “now she’s a customer for\nlife.”\nThis works for shoes. And I can tell you from personal experience that it\nalso works for banks.\nWhen I was 16 years old, I needed a checking account. I was working\nfull-time and needed to pay rent and utilities – and they only took checks.\n7 Hsieh (2010).\n8\n\nFINAL\nSo I found myself at a bank in Ballwin, Missouri, where I grew up. And\nwhen I talked to the new accounts clerk, I found out that minors couldn’t open\nan account without a parent’s signature – bank policy.\nBut both of my parents were out of the picture. When I explained my\nsituation to the clerk, she decided to take a chance.\nShe opened my account. Helped me fill out the deposit form, and select\nmy checks. She even took a few minutes to explain the basics of banking, so I\ncould avoid any overdrafts and fees.\nShe wasn’t a manager. She didn’t have to do this. But she did. She led\nwith her values, and the values of her organization. She put my need for a\nchecking account at the center of her business.\nAnd that stuck with me. I stayed a customer at her bank for almost 20\nyears.\nAligning interests\nWe have a phrase in economics – incentive compatibility – that\ndescribes this situation. It’s the moment when the planets align, and what’s\ngood for me, is good for you, is good for society.\nWe’re at that moment now for the financial services industry.\nIf you’re willing to become an owner… if you’re willing to put your\ncustomers and communities at the center of your business… banking for the\ncommon good will move beyond the title of this conference, and become the\nnew industry norm.\nThank you.\n9\n\nFINAL\nReferences\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority. 2016.

    "text": "FINAL\n“Ambassadors of Hope”\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nThe Preuss School Graduation\nVirtual Presentation\nJune 18, 2020\n4:00PM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nHi everyone. I’m honored to be your graduation speaker today. It’s truly\na gift to me.\nNow typically, graduation speeches have a certain rhythm to them.\nThere’s a little humor, some advice, lots of celebration, big congratulations.\nAnd almost always, there’s a central theme tied around encouragement,\naspiration, or maybe perspective.\nBut today, I’ve decided to depart from the usual rhythm and go straight\nto what we all need most right now: HOPE. Hope for ourselves, hope for our\nworld, hope for a brighter future.\nI know I’m not alone in needing hope. I saw it in your words that you\nsent in last month – on how you felt about graduating during a global\npandemic.\nIn the midst of the expected emotions at graduation, the ones I’ve seen\nand felt myself – things like accomplished, motivated, excited – there were\nothers that reflect the times we’re in. Words like, anxious, disappointed… one\nperson said robbed.\n1\n\nFINAL\nAnd these were your feelings when we were only dealing with COVID-\n19. Before the pain, the tensions, and the unrest surrounding the deaths of\nGeorge Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. Deaths that underscore\nand spotlight the systemic racism, inequality, and injustice that plague our\nsociety.\nI’m guessing that if I asked you today, you might not even have the\nwords to fully describe how you feel anymore. And that’s okay. I’ve been\ntrying to figure out my own feelings, and find my own right words, for weeks.\nIt’s understandable. Our world is in a hard place right now. And we have\nno clear sense of when and how better days will emerge.\nBut to better days we must go. Not by accident. But with purpose and\nconviction. As agents of change. As ambassadors of hope.\nWhy hope? What makes hope the foundational element for change? It’s\nactually very simple: hope is the stubborn – and I mean double-underlined\nstubborn – belief that whatever is happening today does not have to\ndetermine tomorrow. Hope is what allows you to set an intention for change\nand know that change is possible. So at its heart, hope is agency.\nYou start off with loads of hope when you’re young. I know I did. Just\nthink of all the things you’ve done with complete abandon, knowing in your\nheart that they would work out in the end.\nThen the disappointments come, and the frustrations. You learn that\nchange can be slow, and that maybe goals aren’t as easy to reach as you\nexpected. And these experiences leave little dents… maybe a bruise. And they\ncan chip away at your hope.\n2\n\nFINAL\nBut here’s the thing I came to tell you. Hope is not a rock or some other\ninanimate object that erodes or diminishes over time, outside of our control.\nHope is a living thing. And we must choose to nurture it. It takes care and\nintention to thrive.\nSo how do you do it? How do you maintain hope? How do you make it\ngrow, and get bigger and stronger over time?\nYou keep a box of diamonds.\nYou might remember my box of diamonds. I talked to you about it when\nI visited Preuss in October. They’re the memories from my life, big and small,\nthat make me feel joyous, filled up, boundless. They remind me of my\nhumanness, of my goodness, and of the kindness in the world. They remind\nme that, no matter what’s going on, I belong.\nSometimes my diamonds are physical – like my grandfather’s pocket\nknife, or the last $20 bill my grandma gave me for groceries before she passed\naway. Sometimes they are small and fleeting moments, like the compassion of\na UPS driver who saw I was upset one day and stopped his truck to ask if I was\nokay. And sometimes they are grand, like the day I married my wife.\nThe best thing about diamonds is that they are everywhere. You just\nhave to remember to stop and collect them. You have to be intentional about\nspotting them, and reflecting on them, and putting them in your real or virtual\nmemory box. All so they will be ready to take out when you need them – to\nhelp you through frustration or anger, to fill you back up, to soothe your grief\nwhen the world feels lost.\nThis is the practice of choosing hope.\n3\n\nFINAL\nI’ve been taking out my box of diamonds a lot over the past few months.\nLooking at each one. Recalling where I got them and how I felt when I found\nthem. All trying to feel strong in these challenging times.\nSo it’s fitting that I am here today to give your graduation speech.\nBecause last October, I had the enormous joy of meeting you. On that day, we\ntook a picture together. I rushed home and printed that picture, and it still\nhangs on my wall. It was a day I won’t forget. It is one of my diamonds.\nToday, more than anything, I want to say thank you. And I want you to\nremember that you make a difference even when you don’t realize it. You give\nothers strength and fortitude just by being who you are. By graduating in a\npandemic. By being the first in your family to head for college. And for being\nbrave and vulnerable enough to allow yourselves to feel excited, anxious,\nmotivated, disappointed, and even robbed all on the same day.\nBut before I close and for just a moment, I want you to put every other\nemotion aside except for one. I want you to only feel joy. Because today is your\nday. It’s filled with love, and pride, and gratitude from your families, from your\nfriends, from your teachers, and from your community. You have\naccomplished so much, and today is your day to celebrate.\nThe world will be here when you’re done – and it will need you to be\nstrong and ready. It will need you to show up, speak out, and fight for a better\nfuture on whatever path you choose to take.\nBut that’s for tomorrow.\nSo take today. Hold on to it. Let it fill you up. And then, let’s join together\nto be ambassadors of hope. The world needs us.\nThank you – and congratulations. I can’t wait to see what you do.\n4",

    "text": "Getting It Right: Meeting Uncertainty with Conditionality\nMary C. Daly, President and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCommonwealth Club World Affairs of California\nSan Francisco, CA\nJune 24, 2024\n11 AM PT\nRemarks as prepared for delivery.\nINTRODUCTION\nThank you, Alex for that kind introduction. And thank you to the Commonwealth Club World\nAffairs of California and the San Francisco Press Club for hosting this event. I’m really looking\nforward to a lively discussion.\nNow, the last time I was here, the world looked considerably different. It was November 2021,\nand we were still struggling to come out of the pandemic. Inflation was high, the labor market\nwas rebounding, and the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s primary interest rate tool,\nwas near zero.\nThings have clearly changed. The federal funds rate is now above 5 percent, inflation has\nreceded, although not completely, and the labor market has more than recovered and is now\nslowly moving towards a more sustainable level.\nThat’s a lot of improvement and we should acknowledge it. But we are not there yet. So, we\nmust continue the work of fully restoring price stability without a painful disruption to the\neconomy.\nToday, I will review where we stand and discuss what it will take to finish the job.1\nAs always, the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone\nelse in the Federal Reserve System.\n1 Board of Governors (2020).\n1\n\nCLOSING IN\nSo, where are we? Well, we are still in the fight to bring inflation to our 2 percent target. We’ve\nmade a lot of progress, but there is still work to do.\nAs this figure (Figure 1) shows, since March of 2022, when the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) began raising interest rates, inflation has come down substantially, from a bit over 7\npercent at its peak to just under 3 percent in the most recent readings. Importantly, as actual\ninflation has fallen, inflation expectations—what we all believe about the future—have followed\nsuit, confirming that households, businesses, and markets know that the Federal Reserve is\ncommitted to reaching its inflation goal.2\nFigure 1: Inflation and unemployment since March 2022\nPercent\nPCE inflation\n7\n6\n5\nSEP u* = 4.2%\n4\nMay\nUnemployment rate\n3\nApril\n2\n2% inflation goal\n1\n0\nMar‐22 Jun‐22 Sep‐22 Dec‐22 Mar‐23 Jun‐23 Sep‐23 Dec‐23 Mar‐24 Jun‐24\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe decline in inflation owes to many factors, including improvements in supply chains,\nproductivity, and labor force growth.3 Indeed, research by the San Francisco Fed shows that\nthese supply factors were a key reason inflation fell, especially early in the period.4\n2 Bundick and Smith (2024), Powell (2024).\n3 These improvements include spanned both goods and labor supply. Bernanke and Blanchard (2023, 2024), Guerrieri, et al. (2023), Shapiro\n(2024).\n4 In the 12 months following the first policy rate adjustment in March 2022, about two thirds of the decline in overall personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) inflation was from supply‐driven inflation (based on the framework from Shapiro 2024). This share has fallen as demand\nfactors have risen in importance.\n2\n\nAs higher interest rates have taken hold, however, demand factors have become more\nimportant. Since the second half of last year, demand, rather than supply, has been the key\ndriver of falling inflation.5\nOf course, as demand has slowed, so has the labor market. And this has translated into slightly\nhigher unemployment as the blue line indicates. So far, however, the rise in unemployment has\nbeen modest compared with the decline in inflation. The unemployment rate currently sits just\nbelow what many judge as its longer‐run value, the level that reflects full employment.6\nIn other words, so far, so good. Both supply and demand have contributed to the decline in\ninflation. And progress has come without a significant disruption to the labor market.\nMonetary policy is working, but we need to finish the job.\nBALANCED GOALS\nAnd this will take balance.\nThe bumpiness of inflation data so far this year has not inspired confidence.7 Recent readings\nare more encouraging, but it is hard to know if we are truly on track to sustainable price\nstability.\nAnd we can’t count on all the supply factors that helped us last year. Now that supply chains\nare largely mended, and domestic labor force participation has fully recovered, we are unlikely\nto get as much help from those forces. We have to remain open to positive supply\ndevelopments, but increasingly, restrained demand, rather than improved supply, will likely be\nneeded to get inflation down to target.\nAnd that brings the labor market into the conversation. As I showed earlier, so far, the labor\nmarket has adjusted slowly, and the unemployment rate has only edged up. But we are getting\nnearer to a point where that benign outcome could be less likely.\nAlthough job growth remains strong, most other measures of labor market conditions have\nreturned to their pre‐pandemic levels. In particular, the balance between the demand and\nsupply of workers has largely normalized.\n5 From March 2023 to April 2024, supply‐driven inflation only accounted for one‐fourth of the decline in overall PCE inflation.\n6 See the FOMC’s June 2024 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240612.htm).\n7 Research offers many reasons why progress on reducing inflation might be uneven. These include: the long and variable lags of the effects of\nmonetary policy on economic activity (Dupor 2023, Bengali and Arnaut 2024); changes in the relative importance of persistent versus transitory\nshocks to inflation (Stock and Watson 2007, Lansing 2022, Almuzara, Kocaoglu, and Sbordone 2023); and changes in the slope of the Phillips\ncurve that governs the responsiveness of inflation to changes in economic slack (Ball, Leigh, and Mishra 2022, Harding, Lindé, and Trabandt\n2023, Benigno and Eggertsson 2023, and Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky‐Nadeau 2023).\n3\n\nAn easy way to see this is in something called the Beveridge curve (Figure 2), a curve that’s\nreceived a lot of attention of late. It captures the relationship between job vacancies (demand\nfor workers) and unemployment (supply of workers).8\nThe black line in the figure is the historical path of the curve.9 The dots show the history in gray\nand the more recent experience in red.\nFigure 2: Beveridge curve (unemployment and job vacancies)\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics and FRBSF Staff calculations.\nLooking at the top of the red dots, you can see that in the aftermath of pandemic lockdowns,\nfirms posted historically large numbers of job vacancies. Firms were scrambling, if you\nremember, trying to manage hiring and turnover to meet ever‐surging consumer demand.\nVacancies rose rapidly, firms chased a limited pool of workers, and the labor market felt\nfrenzied. In Beveridge curve terms, we moved up the steep portion of the curve.\nThen, as interest rates rose and things became less frenzied, vacancies reversed. Firms settled\ndown, posted fewer jobs, and we moved back down the Beveridge curve. All of this occurred\n8 Updated from Bok, et al. (2022).\n9 The model is fitted on January 1999 through February 2020 data.\n4\n\nwithout a significant increase in unemployment—as shown by the lower red dots.10 At this\npoint, we have a good labor market, but not a frothy one.\nGoing forward, this tradeoff may not be as favorable. The latest job market data, the large red\ndot (April 2024), shows that we are getting very near the flatter portion of the Beveridge curve.\nThis means that future labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms\nneed to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.11\nAll this is to say that at this point, inflation is not the only risk we face. We will need to keep our\neyes on both sides of our mandate—inflation and full employment—as we work to achieve our\ngoals.\nSCENARIO PLANNING\nSo, what does this mean for policy? Simply put, we need to be vigilant and open.\nWe have two goals, one tool, and a lot of uncertainty. So, being definitive and predetermined is\nnot that helpful.\nWhat is helpful, is planning. Evaluating scenarios that could play out and understanding how\npolicy should respond.\nIn other words, to be appropriate, policy has to be conditional. And we have to think in\nscenarios.\nFor example, if inflation turns out to fall more slowly than projected, then holding the federal\nfunds rate higher for longer would be appropriate. If instead, inflation falls rapidly, or the labor\nmarket softens more than expected, then lowering the policy rate would be necessary. Finally,\nif we continue to see gradual declines in inflation and a slow rebalancing in the labor market,\nthen we can normalize policy over time, as many expect.\nThe truth is any of these scenarios are in the realm of reasonable—they are all possible.\nAnd we need to be ready to respond to however the economy evolves.\n10 The possibility of this adjustment via vacancy reductions rather than unemployment increases was discussed in Figura and Waller (2022) and\nBok, et al. (2022).\n11 Moreover, the economy may also be moving onto a flatter portion of the Phillips curve, implying it will take a larger upward movement in\nlabor market slack to achieve further downward movements in the inflation rate. See Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022), Harding, Lindé, and\nTrabandt (2023), Benigno and Eggertsson (2023), Crust, Lansing, and Petrosky‐Nadeau (2023), and Furman (2024).\n5\n\nPEOPLE WANT BOTH\nLet me end where I started. This is not 2021, or 2022, or even 2023. We are in a very different\nplace. Inflation has come down, the labor market is solid, and businesses and households\nbelieve that we can finish the job.\nBut we’re not there yet.\nWhether you call it the final mile, completing the work, or simply delivering fully on our dual\nmandate goals, there is more to do.\nBut we will need to exhibit care. To really thrive, people need both price stability and jobs.\nI know this from my own experience. I grew up in Ballwin, Missouri in the 1970s, the last period\nof high inflation. In my world, many people struggled. Inflation imposed a corrosive tax,\neroding earnings, making it hard to pay bills or invest in anything other than the day to day.\nWorst of all, there was no end in sight.12\nThe Volcker disinflation remedied that. But the medicine was harsh. And my family, and\nmillions of other American families, went from being constrained by high inflation to hampered\nby job loss.\nLooking back, that medicine seemed necessary, reflecting the specific circumstances of the\ntime.\nBut we are not in that world. The Federal Reserve has credibility that it didn’t back then.13\nPeople know the Fed will bring inflation down.\nAll of this means that our journey today can be different. Not just avoiding a painful recession,\nbut balancing policy to protect full employment while restoring price stability.\nThat is the economy we are striving for, and that is the one we are working to deliver.\n12 Inflation expectations in advance of the Volcker disinflation were unanchored, moving up nearly one to one with actual inflation. This tight\nconnection meant inflation was self‐reinforcing, hence there was no end in sight. See Daly (2022) for discussion.\n13 As noted earlier, longer‐run inflation expectations are well‐anchored.\n6\n\nREFERENCES\nAlmuzara, Martin, Babur Kocaoglu, and Argia Sbordone. 2023. “Where Is Inflation Persistence Coming\nFrom?” Liberty Street Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, July 6.\nBall, Laurence, Daniel Leigh, and Prachi Mishra. 2022. “Understanding U.S. Inflation During the COVID\nEra.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Fall), pp. 1–54.\nBengali, Leila, and Zoë Arnaut. 2024. “How Quickly Do Prices Respond to Monetary Policy?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2024‐10 (April 8).\nBenigno, Pierpaolo, and Gauti B.
