    "text": "Welcome\n\nGood morning.  I am very pleased to welcome you all to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the launch of Investing in America’s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and  Employers .  I would like to thank our  colleagues across the Federal Reserve System, the Heldrich Center for Workforce  Development at Rutgers University, the Ray Marshall Center at the University of  Texas at Austin, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research for  collaborating with us on this initiative.\n\nMy colleagues and I are proud  to co-sponsor this event today and appreciate everyone who contributed their  time and effort to making the Investing  in America’s Workforce publication a reality.\n\nWith over 100  contributors, pulling this together was not an easy feat.  I recognize the value of sharing knowledge and  resources and am pleased that we can help facilitate this effort.  I congratulate my colleagues and our partners  for this accomplishment and believe this is just the beginning of our work to  support the workforce field.  There is a  tendency to try to re-invent the wheel and overlook past experience, but by  taking a step back and learning from one another, we can have a much greater positive  impact in our communities.\n\nRoadshow Workforce Experience\n\nSustainable economic  growth and thus broad-based prosperity is dependent on a healthy job market,  one in which employers can find the skills they need and workers find jobs that  allow them to grow and move up the economic ladder.  The challenge is developing a system that  encompasses both and is accessible to all those seeking a job.  Our workforce development initiative aims to  promote dialogue and a greater understanding of promising policies and programs  that allow workers, especially those in low and moderate-income communities, to  develop in-demand skills and connect them with employers.  We can achieve this by connecting with  workforce stakeholders through policy forums, roundtable discussion sessions, and  examining areas through our research and outreach.\n\nOne of the best aspects  of my job is the opportunity to visit communities across our Second District.  The skills gap and the uneven economic  recovery among different communities are consistent themes I hear, not just in  the Second District but also in my previous job on the West Coast.  I also have heard about a variety of policies  and programs that seem to be making an impact and could have broader potential  that are worth sharing.\n\nEarly in my tenure I  visited Brooklyn P-TECH and met with a dedicated and focused group of young students  learning IT skills for middle-skill jobs. This partnership between IBM Corporation,  the New York City Department of Education, the City University of New York, and  the NYC College of Technology, provides an instructive model. It takes kids  from high school through an associate’s degree with corporate support and real-life  experiences.\n\nAnd it’s working.  Their first class of 91 students entered the  program in September 2011 and almost all have since earned their high school diplomas  and about half have earned an associate’s degree in a STEM field.  IBM has  hired 23 graduates and continues to offer paid summer internships. 1\n\nIn a few weeks, I will be  visiting Per Scholas, a tuition-free workforce training program in the Bronx and  in other parts of the country. It seeks to break the cycle of poverty by  providing free technology career education, training, placement, and  advancement services to people in underserved communities.  Approximately 90% of Per Scholas trainees are  people of color, with the large majority representing Black/African American  and Hispanic/Latino individuals -- groups with historically low representation  in IT and the financial services industry.\n\nThis workforce program is  unique in that it seeks to re-train adult workers for successful careers as  technology professionals and works with employers in crafting unique training  programs for their business.  In 2017,  Per Scholas NY enrolled 502 students and 406 graduated, of which a substantial majority  reported being placed with an employer with an average starting wage of more  than $20 an hour. 2\n\nEarlier this year, the New York Fed partnered with Per Scholas NY to support our own Diversity  & Inclusion efforts focused on career paths in IT, cybersecurity, and data  science in the financial services industry. I am proud to say that the New York  Fed was recognized by Per Scholas as a Major Partner in its recent 2018 annual update  report.\n\nI mention these two  examples as they reflect the theme of today’s event and the book—workforce  development is about investing in work, workers and systems leading to greater  employment opportunities for all.\n\nEmployer Engagement by  Community Colleges in New York State\n\nAnother important issue is  the role of employer engagement with community colleges.  By working directly with local employers,  community colleges can more effectively prepare students for available jobs,  and at the same time, help employers find and retain workers with the skills  they need.\n\nIn an effort to better  understand the level and types of employer engagement activities taking place  in our region, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently conducted a survey  of all of the community colleges in New York State. Next Wednesday, we will be  releasing a report that details our findings.\n\nOur report does show that  employer engagement by community colleges in New York State has become the  norm.  The typical community college  engages with more than 100 employers, spanning a broad range of industries,  including healthcare, manufacturing, utilities, and tourism, just to name a  few.  It is also quite common for  community colleges to actively assess local labor market needs, often with the  help of local employers.\n\nAs part of these engagement  efforts, employers provide a wide range of education and training support to  community colleges, offer various forms of work experience, and help students  prepare for the job market. Employer engagement is a promising and important  undertaking for community colleges, local employers, students, and workers.\n\nInvesting in America’s  Workforce\n\nThese are just a few  examples of the work being done across the Federal Reserve System and beyond,  which is one of the reasons we have come together under the Investing in  America’s Workforce umbrella.  This  initiative started in 2017 as a way to identify new approaches, opportunities,  and challenges in the various areas of workforce development.  Led by the Federal Reserve System alongside  other educational and nonprofit institutions, Investing in America’s Workforce  has encompassed 52 regional meetings held across the country last year, a capstone  conference held in Austin, TX last October, and a three-volume book highlighting  workforce development efforts as investments for economic and community growth,  which the Fed and our partners are releasing today.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, the New  York Fed held seven regional meetings in our District, and one in Orlando, FL  in partnership with our Atlanta Fed colleagues after the influx of Puerto  Ricans to the mainland post-Hurricane Maria.  We found that all of these communities shared  certain needs, including to: develop training programs that lead more directly  to available jobs; make the public workforce system less complicated; and find  a consistent way to document and collect data on individuals who participate in  training to assess the effectiveness of the programs.\n\nI hope this book will  help find solutions, recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution or  approach.\n\nSo what’s in the book? Investing  in America’s Workforce: Improving Outcomes for Workers and Employers is a  collection of more than 65 essays from national and regional workforce experts  about systemic barriers to employment and how further workforce investments can  overcome those barriers. Staff from the New York Fed contributed two chapters  in the publication. One piece—on partnership development as a key workforce  strategy— includes a look into how three employers in New York and Puerto Rico  developed partnerships with post-secondary institutions to make progress in  overcoming the skills gap issue. By detailing some of the factors that  contributed to employers’ partnering with educational institutions, this  chapter aims to provide insight to employers seeking to engage with educational  partners to address labor market concerns and support the development of skilled  industry talent. The second piece examines the high child poverty rate in  Puerto Rico and its impact on the long-term economic sustainability of the  island and its ability to recover from Hurricane Maria. The island’s child  poverty rate is almost three times higher than that of mainland, and has  remained stagnant even during times of economic growth, suggesting the issue is  not just rooted in labor demand. This chapter discusses the dual programmatic  and policy strategy of the Boys and Girls Club of Puerto Rico and its sister  organization the Youth Development Institute.\n\nBefore I conclude my  remarks, I would like to provide a quick overview of today’s sessions. First, my  colleague Patrick Harker, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of  Philadelphia, will discuss key shifts in perspective needed to see workforce  development as an investment. Then there will be three panel sessions, each  dedicated to the overarching focus of a volume in the publication – investing  in workers, investing in work, and investing in systems. The day will then end  with a luncheon panel discussion where speakers from various sectors will  discuss what needs to happen to realize the goal of seeing workforce  development as an investment in inclusive economic growth that benefits  workers, employers, and communities.\n\nI am thrilled that we can bring  together national and regional leaders representing the private, public, and  nonprofit sectors to engage in a dialogue that can inform workforce development  programming across the country and learn from one another about the  opportunities for investing in America’s workforce. We look forward to a  productive day and continuing the conversation after the event. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you so much for this award. It’s a genuine honor to be recognized in this way. And allow me to add my congratulations to all the other organizations and individuals that have been commended this evening. The work that you’re doing—particularly in the area of corporate social responsibility—is so important.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point. 1 This action was in response to the evolving risks the coronavirus poses to the U.S. economy. Tonight, I’ll use my remarks to provide more context around that decision and about our response as we look ahead.\n\nBut before I give this evening’s remarks I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nTo start, let me emphasize that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. We’ve seen continued solid job growth, unemployment is at a historically low level, and we entered 2020 with very good momentum. After a year that was characterized by uncertainties, global growth appeared to be stabilizing, and geopolitical risks receding. And monetary policy was well positioned to support the economic expansion and the achievement of the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. Risks to the Economy However, during the past month the outbreak and subsequent spread of the coronavirus has brought with it new risks to the economic outlook. This is first and foremost a human tragedy, and my deepest sympathies are with those who have lost loved ones. The virus and the necessary scale of the response to address the public health challenge will have near-term effects on the global economy. These repercussions have been especially strong in the hardest-hit countries, including China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. We are now also hearing reports that some businesses here in the United States are being affected by supply disruptions and weakening demand. As people take precautions, we’re seeing concerns around the tourism and travel sectors, in particular. Disease outbreaks require a multifaceted approach, and the coronavirus is no different. This is primarily a public health issue, which will be fought on the front lines by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. Governments will also need to step in to support the healthcare response, and, if needed, to provide targeted relief to affected industries and workers through fiscal measures. Monetary Policy Central banks like the Federal Reserve also have an important role to play in addressing the economic effects of the coronavirus, ensuring that financial markets function effectively and providing support to the economy. These actions cannot address the health issues, but can help manage near-term risks to the economy in a highly uncertain time. Earlier this week, the FOMC voted unanimously to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. This strong policy action provides meaningful support to the economy and will help sustain the economic expansion. The outlook is evolving and highly uncertain. In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. As part of our response, my colleagues and I in the Federal Reserve System are coordinating with our counterparts around the world. Tuesday’s phone call between G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, the subsequent statement, and policy actions by central banks are clear indications of the close alignment at the international level. Financial Markets Turning to the specific responsibilities of the New York Fed, we are tasked with the implementation of monetary policy. Our goals are to keep the federal funds rate within the target range and foster stable conditions in short-term funding markets. We will ensure that the supply of reserves in the banking system remains ample, consistent with the FOMC’s direction. 2 Treasury bill purchases continue to add to the underlying level of reserves, and repo operations are keeping reserve levels ample. We are monitoring conditions in money markets closely. We remain flexible and ready to make adjustments to our operations as needed to ensure that monetary policy is effectively implemented and transmitted to financial markets and the broader economy. Conclusion I’ll conclude with this: The coronavirus poses evolving risks to the U.S. economy. Our policy action this week positions us well to support the economic expansion. We are carefully monitoring the effects of the coronavirus on the U.S. economic outlook and will respond as appropriate. Our focus remains trained on serving the American people by pursuing our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability. Once again, thank you for this evening’s award.\n\nRisks to the Economy\n\nHowever, during the past month the outbreak and subsequent spread of the coronavirus has brought with it new risks to the economic outlook.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. It’s  wonderful to be with you here in Frankfurt. In our interconnected global  economy, it’s important to have opportunities like this to learn from the perspectives  and experiences of others, whether we are academics, market participants, or  practitioners of central banking.\n\nThe theme of my talk is  the theory and practice of monetary policy implementation. Central banks differ  in their objectives, strategies, and approaches to monetary policy  implementation—all of which influence how they supply reserves, manage balance  sheets, and control short-term interest rates.\n\nBut like Neapolitan and  New York-style pizzas, central banks also share similarities. These were  spotlighted in the ways they responded to the global financial crisis and the  onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many central banks expanded their balance  sheets through various quantitative easing programs funded in large part by  increases in central bank reserves.\n\nThese experiences fundamentally  changed the ways many central banks approach the provision of reserves while maintaining  control of short-term interest rates. As a result, central banks have reviewed,  and in some cases modified, their strategies for supplying reserves and  controlling interest rates in ways that reflect the unique features of their jurisdictions.  Although their approaches differ in specifics, they share common elements that  reflect the fundamental factors that shape the supply and demand for reserves. 1\n\nToday I will talk about  the monetary policy implementation frameworks that central banks use to manage  the supply and demand for reserves, emphasizing the common features and  mechanisms of these approaches. I’ll also discuss in more detail the Federal  Reserve’s ample reserves framework.\n\nBefore I go any further,  I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine  alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFraming the Frameworks\n\nMonetary policy implementation  frameworks are critically important to the conduct of monetary policy. They  encapsulate the mechanisms and tools used to steer operational targets in line  with the desired policy stance and provide liquidity to the financial sector. 2\n\nIn supplying reserves to  the banking system, central banks have multiple goals that frequently involve  trade-offs. 3 First and foremost, they target a level of the policy interest rate and aim to  minimize the variability of the policy rate around that target. In addition,  they have objectives related to supporting financial stability and the smooth functioning  of financial markets. For example, central banks may see advantages or  disadvantages to interbank lending in money markets, as well as costs and  benefits related to central bank lending into markets.\n\nThe core of any  operational framework is the central bank’s supply of reserves, which ranges  from a low level, or “scarce,” to “ample” and “abundant.” The “price” of  reserves is the spread between the market interest rate and the rate earned for  holding reserves at the central bank. When reserves are scarce, the slope of  the demand curve for reserves is steep, as illustrated in Figure 1 . A small  change in the quantity of reserves results in a meaningful change in the  spread. When reserves are ample, the slope of the demand curve flattens but  still slopes downward, so that small changes in the quantity of reserves have  modest effects on the spread. And when reserves are abundant, the demand curve  is essentially flat.\n\nA central bank has two sets  of tools it can use to supply reserves. These are illustrated in Figure 2 . First,  it chooses an ex ante aggregate level of reserves to supply to the banking  system, labeled “X” in the figure. Second, it may make available a lending  facility to the banking system that offers loans to financial institutions at an  interest rate determined by the central bank. This is labeled “L” in the figure.  If the ex ante supply of reserves is sufficiently low, the additional demand at  rate L will be met by the lending facility. Note that both tools are a means to  supply reserves: In the first, the supply is set in advance, while with the  latter, it adjusts endogenously to market conditions.\n\nCentral banks deploy various  combinations of tools depending on the institutional and market structures in  their jurisdictions as well as preferences over the trade-offs involved in their  use. 4 These choices represent different  points among the set of options for using the two tools. Despite differences in  tactics, each of the approaches can achieve the goals of strong interest rate  control and smooth market functioning. It is worth emphasizing that the two  tools can be mutually reinforcing in achieving desired outcomes. For example,  lending facilities limit upward movements in interest rates on days of high  demand, thereby reducing the ex ante supply of reserves needed to control  short-term rates. 5\n\nThe European Central  Bank, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of Australia have chosen to  operate with a relatively small amount of ex ante reserves supply and provide  additional reserves as demanded at a rate near the policy target rate.  Counterparties can then draw upon as much or as little as they choose based on  their needs, subject to their ability to provide eligible collateral. 6 In this way, even with a  smaller ex ante supply of reserves, tight interest rate control is maintained amid  significant movements in the demand for reserves. In the case of the Bank of  England, its weekly Short-Term Repo facility sees regular sizable use. In  October of this year, it averaged around £85 billion. 7\n\nFederal Reserve: Ample Reserves and  Tools\n\nLike that of other  central banks, the Fed’s operational framework has evolved over time,  reflecting its experience with large balance sheets since the global financial crisis. 8 In January 2019, when the  decline in the Fed’s asset holdings implied that the quantity of reserves would  soon fall below an “abundant” level, the FOMC formally adopted an ample  reserves strategy. 9\n\nThe FOMC has defined this  framework as one in which “control over the level of the federal funds rate and  other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of  the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the  supply of reserves is not required.” 10 Accordingly, the ex ante  supply of reserves is chosen to be sufficiently large to meet the demand for  reserves on most days.\n\nOne important tool the  FOMC has established to ensure interest rate control is the overnight reverse  repo facility (ON RRP), which, alongside the interest paid on reserve balances  (IORB), helps set a floor for the federal funds rate. Through the ON RRP,  eligible counterparties “lend” to the Federal Reserve at the rate set by the  FOMC, currently at the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate. Usage  of the ON RRP adjusts automatically to market conditions, rising and falling  with supply and demand, which is particularly important in a dynamic market.\n\nThe ON RRP has proven to  be a very effective and flexible tool to support interest rate control to the  downside. When Federal Reserve asset holdings push reserves above ample, the ON  RRP relaxes the tight relationship between balance sheet size and reserves and  acts as a safety valve in supporting smooth transmission of monetary policy to  markets. As the size of the balance sheet falls, market rates rise above the rate  offered at the ON RRP and, as a result, usage of the ON RRP declines to very  low levels. This dynamic is seen in Figure 3 , which shows average monthly usage  of the ON RRP from 2016 through October of this year. The ON RRP was used  extensively when it was economically sensible for the Fed’s counterparties to  do so. By contrast, it has very limited usage when repo rates are well above  the ON RRP rate, as is the case today.\n\nIn 2021, the Federal  Reserve introduced the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), which nicely complements  the ON RRP by providing interest rate control to the upside. 11 The SRF rate is set at  the top of the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate. This combination  of an ample supply of reserves and an SRF rate at the top of the target range  reduces the day-to-day reliance on the facility except during periods of significant  upward pressure on rates resulting from strong liquidity demand or market  stress.\n\nBy ensuring that adequate  liquidity will be available in a wide variety of circumstances, the SRF plays a  critical role in capping temporary upward pressure on rates and assures markets  of effective interest rate control and smooth market functioning. It is best  thought of as a way of making sure that the overall market has adequate  liquidity consistent with the FOMC’s desired level of interest rates. In that  regard, it differs from other lending facilities—such as the discount window—that  aim to provide individual banks with liquidity when the need arises.\n\nThe SRF has been  effective as reserves have moved from abundant toward ample. Over the past two  months, SRF usage has risen from essentially zero to having greater frequency  and higher volume of take-up, especially on days of temporary repo market  pressures, as shown in Figure 4 . Like the ON RRP facility, the SRF’s  effectiveness relies on market participants availing themselves of the SRF  based on market conditions, free of worries about stigma or other impediments. I  fully expect that the SRF will continue to be actively used in this way and  contain upward pressures on money market rates.\n\nFederal Reserve: The Way Forward\n\nAt the onset of the  pandemic, the Fed, along with central banks around the world, responded quickly  to restore market functioning, 12 causing reserves to rise well  above ample, as they did in many jurisdictions.\n\nIn June of 2022, the Fed  began the process of reducing the size of its balance sheet to transition toward  an ample level of reserves. 13 The FOMC said it intended  to stop balance sheet runoff when it deemed reserves were somewhat above ample,  and then allow reserves to decline further as other liabilities, such as  currency, grow.\n\nThe process has worked according  to plan. The Fed’s securities holdings have shrunk from a peak of about $8-1/2  trillion in 2022 to $6-1/4 trillion today. At its meeting last week, the FOMC  decided it would conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings on  December 1. 14 This decision was based on clear market-based signs that we had met the test of  reserves being somewhat above ample. 15 In particular, repo rates  have increased relative to administered rates and have exhibited more  volatility on certain days. Accordingly, we have been seeing more frequent use  of the SRF. And the effective federal funds rate has increased somewhat  relative to the IORB after years of that spread being at a stable level. These  developments were expected as the supply of reserves closed in on ample. 16\n\nLooking forward, the  next step in our balance sheet strategy will be to assess when the level of  reserves has reached ample. It will then be time to begin the process of  gradual purchases of assets that will maintain an ample level of reserves as  the Fed’s other liabilities grow and underlying demand for reserves increases  over time. Such reserve management purchases will represent the natural next  stage of the implementation of the FOMC’s ample reserves strategy and in no way  represent a change in the underlying stance of monetary policy.\n\nDetermining when we are  at ample reserves is an inexact science. I am closely monitoring a variety of  market indicators related to the fed funds market, repo market, and payments to  help assess the state of reserve demand conditions. Based on recent sustained  repo market pressures and other growing signs of reserves moving from abundant  to ample, I expect that it will not be long before we reach ample reserves.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe FOMC’s  implementation framework combines an ample supply of reserves with facilities  to maintain strong interest rate control and flexibility regarding changes in  the size of its balance sheet. This operational framework has proven to be  highly effective—and it continues to work as designed.\n\nOther central banks use different  approaches that operate equally well. We all face common goals and issues. Like  the delicious delicacies particular to individual countries, the similarities outweigh  the differences.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Albert Einstein famously said, \"Life is like  riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.\" While  charming advice to live by, it is also particularly salient when it comes to the  rebalancing and movement taking place in the U.S. economy today.\n\nIn my remarks this evening, I'm going to discuss inflation, the continued  imbalances between supply and demand, and the  effects that monetary policy is having on different sectors of the economy.  I'll share what this means for the economic outlook in the United States, and  how the Federal Reserve's policy actions support our bedrock commitment to  price stability.\n\nBefore I do that, I want to thank the Fixed Income Analysts  Society for putting together this wonderful program.  It's  great to stay local, even if it means dodging rush hour traffic in Midtown.  Although times like these make me wonder if I should take Einstein's bike  riding advice more literally!\n\nI should also give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInflation  Indications and Implications\n\nI'll start by saying that although we are seeing some signs that  inflation is moderating, it remains far too high, and it is my No. 1 concern going  into 2023. Rapidly rising prices continue to have an immense impact on families  and businesses, especially when it comes to essentials like food, utilities,  and housing.\n\nHigh inflation is a new reality for many people. For the three  decades preceding the pandemic, the inflation rate averaged almost exactly 2  percent, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.  But that changed dramatically in the spring of 2021, when inflation suddenly  soared, ultimately reaching a 40-year high of 7 percent last June. While the inflation  rate has since come down to 5-1/2 percent, it's still higher than any pre-pandemic  reading since 1982 and far above the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nPersistently high inflation undermines the ability of our economy  to perform at its full potential, so  it is critical for the  Federal Reserve to bring inflation back down to our goal  . We are firmly committed  to doing so.\n\nShifts  and Realignment\n\nThose who have been following my speeches lately will know that  I've been quite devoted to a recurring theme: using the  layers of an onion to describe inflation. 1 But with the new year, I thought I would switch gears. I didn't have to look  too far, because the mechanism of shifting gears is exactly what's going on in  the economy. It also explains the effects that monetary policy is having on the  economy and how that's helping to bring inflation back down.\n\nDuring the pandemic and its aftermath, we saw an enormous swing in  demand, away from services like travel and entertainment and toward goods and  housing,  as people adjusted to work from home and avoided  contact-intensive activities. More recently, we are seeing a rotation in  demand from goods back into services. But through all these shifts, overall  demand has remained very strong and has far exceeded supply.\n\nThis misalignment of supply and demand is true for the labor market  as well. Although several indicators of labor demand—such as job openings,  quits, and hiring—have stepped down from their very high levels of the first  few months of 2022, they show that demand still far exceeds available supply. And  the unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is historically low.\n\nThe same dynamics play out in the Federal Reserve's Second  District, the region that the New York Fed represents. Our regional business  surveys indicate that activity is slowing, with an especially sharp decline in  the manufacturing sector. That said, many businesses continue to add staff, and  consumer confidence is strong. Overall, inflationary pressures in the region are  moving downward, but are still quite high.\n\nGears  Are Turning\n\nWith inflation running persistently above its longer-run goal of 2  percent, the FOMC has taken strong actions to align demand with supply in the  economy and bring inflation down. You can think of monetary policy as a large  gear that is connected to smaller gears representing different sectors of the  economy. But not all gears move at the same pace. Some turn more quickly, while  others are slower, meaning they experience longer lags between policy actions  and effects.\n\nThese effects of monetary policy are showing up in prices at  different speeds. For example, the prices of globally traded commodities have  already declined and are now well below levels we saw earlier last year. This reflects  in part the effects of lower demand resulting from tighter monetary policy here  and abroad.\n\nSimilarly, prices for many goods have started to plateau or even  decline, reflecting weaker demand, lower import costs, and an easing of global  supply disruptions that developed during the pandemic. For example, prices of  used cars—a big driver of inflation during the first year of the pandemic—have  been retreating toward more normal levels over the past few months. The  combination of the general rotation of demand from goods to services and the  effects of higher interest rates on demand for goods should contribute to  further downward pressure on the prices of many goods this year.\n\nOne gear that is moving at a far slower pace is the price of non-energy  services. The ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in this sector  continues to contribute to inflationary pressures. But there is some good news  on this front as well. One of the biggest drivers of the rise in inflation for  services has been shelter costs, which soared as demand for housing increased during  the pandemic. Recent data for newly-signed leases indicate that the tide is  turning on rents, and we should see shelter cost inflation start to slow later  this year. That said, inflation for other services besides shelter has remained  high, and this gear is only starting to turn.\n\nInflation expectations represent another gear that is turning at  an encouraging speed. Longer-run inflation expectations remain remarkably  stable at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. 2 After  rising moderately last year, households' three-year-ahead inflation  expectations are now back to where they were in January 2021, and  one-year-ahead inflation expectations have started to reverse the rise seen  over the past year and a half. 3\n\nThe  FOMC's Policy Actions\n\nWith inflation still high and indications of continued  supply-demand imbalances, it is clear that monetary policy still has more work  to do to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal on a sustained basis.\n\nAt its meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for  the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent, the seventh consecutive  increase.  The FOMC's December 2022 Summary of Economic  Projections showed that a large majority of participants saw the federal funds  rate reaching a level between 5 and 5-1/2 percent by the end of this year  .\n\nThe FOMC statement indicated that \"the Committee anticipates that  ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a  stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation  to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the  target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of  monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity  and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\" 4\n\nBringing  inflation down is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some  softening of labor market conditions. But restoring price stability is  essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer  term, and it is critical that we stay the course until the job is done.\n\nI'll also add that the framework announced last May for  reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is working well, \nand the Committee will  continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency  mortgage-backed securities as planned. 5\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWe are seeing  the shifting gears of tighter monetary policy having the desired effects.  Broad indicators  show that financial conditions have become significantly less supportive of spending.  As a result, I expect real GDP growth  to be modest this year at around 1 percent.\n\nRobust hiring,  low unemployment, and strong nominal wage growth mean the labor market remains  remarkably tight. But with growth slowing, I anticipate the unemployment rate to  increase from its current level of 3-1/2 percent to around 4-1/2 percent over  the next year.\n\nTurning to  inflation, I expect cooling global demand and supply improvements to result in  declining inflation for goods. These factors should contribute to inflation  slowing further from its current rate to  around 3 percent \n  this year.  While services inflation is still a  sticking point, I expect overall inflation to come back down to 2 percent in  the next few years as further tightening of monetary policy realigns the  balance between demand and supply.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll close by saying that the monetary policy gear is turning. But  it will take time for supply and demand to come back into proper alignment and  balance, so we must keep moving. While the route ahead is still uncertain, I am  fully confident we will return to a sustained period of price stability.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. I always appreciate the opportunity to speak before  members of the Council on Foreign Relations. 1\n\nBefore I get started, let me give the standard Fed disclaimer that  the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nJust as you’d expect, I’ll be speaking today about the “e” word—by  which, of course, I mean the economy. I’ll talk about where it’s headed, and the  process of getting supply and demand in better balance and bringing inflation  back down to the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal. I’ll also discuss the  progress made toward the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals of maximum  employment and price stability, as well as the path ahead for monetary policy.\n\nThe  Fed’s Dual Mandate\n\nI’ll start by discussing where the economy stands right now,  broadly speaking.\n\nSince it’s back-to-school season, I’ll throw out another “e” word that  you may find on a middle school vocabulary list. This word is a little less  commonly used—at least in my own conversations. And that word is “equipoise.”\n\nThe definition, according to Merriam-Webster, is “a state of equilibrium.”  If I were asked to use it in a sentence, spelling bee-style, I’d say: “The  significant progress we have seen toward our objectives of price stability and  maximum employment means that the risks to the two sides of our dual mandate have  moved into equipoise.”\n\nThis is because supply and demand imbalances have dissipated, labor  market conditions have eased from being exceptionally tight, and inflation has  come down significantly. Many factors have contributed to this favorable set of  circumstances, including the Federal Reserve’s strong actions to restore price  stability.\n\nThe  Inflation Onion Is Back\n\nNow let me delve deeper into the two sides of our dual mandate  that have moved into equipoise: inflation and the labor market.\n\nWe’ll go in alphabetical order, so let’s start with inflation.\n\nI’ve been using the analogy of peeling an onion’s layers to  describe inflation—both how it rose and how it has since moderated. 2 In  my “inflation onion,” there are three layers. Each layer represents a major  category of inflation: prices of globally traded commodities; prices of products  or durable goods like appliances, furniture, and cars; and prices of core services.\n\nThe sharp rise in inflation that we saw in 2021 and 2022 was in  large part due to aftereffects of the pandemic, as well as Russia’s war on  Ukraine and consequent actions. Once those effects began to dissipate, the  layers of the onion started to adjust in turn. While each inflation layer  normalized at a different speed, they all moved in the right direction. This  broad-based downward movement has brought the overall inflation rate back down  closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nThis disinflation process shows up clearly in the data. The  12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price  index has declined from its 40-year high of just above 7 percent in mid-2022 to  2.5 percent in July. Measures of underlying inflation, like core PCE inflation  and the New York Fed’s Multivariate Core Trend inflation, similarly show a  sizable decline over the past two years to around 2-1/2 percent today. 3 The  decrease in inflation has benefited from a moderation in demand and improvements  in supply that together have reduced supply-demand imbalances, both here in the  U.S. and internationally.\n\nEqually reassuringly, inflation expectations remain well anchored.  The New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) shows that inflation  expectations have remained in their pre-Covid ranges at all horizons in recent  months. 4 Other measures of inflation expectations, both survey- and market-based, give a  similar signal. And the Atlanta Fed’s measure of business inflation  expectations, which reflects the thinking of businesses in setting prices, has  similarly returned to levels near its average over the 2012-2019 period. 5\n\nThe disinflation phenomenon is not unique to the United States.  Canada, the United Kingdom, and most European economies experienced  historically high inflation over the past few years and have similarly seen  rapid declines. The global supply disruptions experienced following the  pandemic and war in Ukraine amplified the rise in inflation, and the  restoration of supply and demand balance has accelerated its decline.\n\nLabor  Market\n\nNow let me turn to the labor market. Even as the economy has grown  at a solid pace, a wide range of indicators have pointed to a continued  normalization in the labor market following the red-hot period in 2021 and  2022. Today, most of these measures have moved from the tightest they’ve been  in over two decades to levels more consistent with the good labor market that  existed in the period before the pandemic.\n\nOne measure that understandably gets a lot of attention is the  unemployment rate, which has risen by nearly a percentage point from its very  low reading in early 2023. Still, it remains relatively low by historical  standards, and some of this increase reflects a cool-down in the labor market  from an overheated state. In addition, the increase in unemployment has  occurred in the context of a strong increase in labor supply, rather than from elevated  layoffs.\n\nTo get the full picture of the labor market and what it means for  monetary policy, it’s important to monitor a wide range of data in addition to  the unemployment rate. For example, I take the temperature of the labor market  by looking at surveys of both households and businesses; the rates of quits,  hiring, and job vacancies; and the job-to-job transition rates and flows  between unemployment and employment states.\n\nTaken together, these data indicate that the labor market is  now roughly in balance and therefore unlikely to be a source of inflationary  pressures going forward.\n\nMonetary  Policy\n\nWhat does this mean for monetary policy?\n\nIn its July statement, the FOMC said it “judges that the risks to  achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better  balance”, and that it is “attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual  mandate.” 6 Regarding  the path of policy going forward, the Committee said it “will carefully assess  incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks” and that it  “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has  gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2  percent.”\n\nThe accumulated evidence has increased my confidence that  inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. The current restrictive  stance of monetary policy has been effective in restoring balance to the  economy and bringing inflation down. With the economy now in equipoise and  inflation on a path to 2 percent, it is now appropriate to dial down the degree  of restrictiveness in the stance of policy by reducing the target range for the  federal funds rate. This is the natural next step in executing our strategy to  achieve our dual mandate goals. Looking ahead, with inflation moving toward the  target and the economy in balance, the stance of monetary policy can be moved  to a more a neutral setting over time depending on the evolution of the data,  the outlook, and the risks to achieving our objectives.\n\nIn terms of the  Fed’s balance sheet, the Committee began to slow the pace of decline of our  securities holdings in June. That process is going smoothly and as planned, and  the level of reserves remains well above ample.\n\nThe  Economic Outlook\n\nBefore I close, I’ll share my forecast for the other “e,” the  economy. I expect GDP growth this year to be around 2 to 2-1/2 percent. I  expect the unemployment rate at the end of this year to be around 4-1/4 percent,  and thereafter to move gradually down to my estimate of its longer-run level of  3-3/4 percent. With the labor market in balance, I expect the process of  disinflation to continue. Specifically, I expect overall PCE inflation to  moderate to around 2-1/4 percent this year and to be near 2 percent next year.\n\nThat’s my base case. But it’s important to emphasize that the  outlook remains uncertain, and I am attentive to signs of a shift in economic  conditions. Three areas are particularly in focus. One is the possibility of a  significant further weakening in the U.S. labor market. The second is a sharp  slowdown in global growth that could spill over onto our shores. And third, the  experience of the past year shows that the process of disinflation is not  always smooth and can surprise both to the upside and downside.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe’ve come a long way from the  unacceptably high inflation and overheated labor market that we experienced two  years ago. Monetary policy has been unequivocally focused  on returning inflation to our 2 percent longer-run target. The risks to our two  goals are now in better balance, and policy needs to adjust to reflect that  balance. Of course, one clear lesson of the past several years is that the  future is highly uncertain. Therefore, our decisions will be data-dependent,  with a keen eye on the achievement of our maximum employment and price  stability goals.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIt’s  a pleasure to be able to join you all from my apartment in Manhattan. I  sincerely look forward to the day when we can again meet in person.\n\nIn a  short period, our lives have changed in unimaginable ways: things that we took  for granted—like eating at a restaurant, or going to a movie—are no longer  possible in many places. For the first time in our lifetimes, governments  around the world have had to take the extraordinary action of shutting their  economies down. Those workers who continue to deliver essential services face  very real risks, and my deep gratitude is with all those working in hospitals,  law enforcement, transportation, and grocery stores. All essential workers have  the thanks of everyone at the New York Fed.\n\nWhat  started as a healthcare crisis has had profound consequences for the U.S. and  global economies.\n\nWe  all know the incredible strain that New York City has been under, with numerous  patients still being diagnosed with COVID-19 on a daily basis. But Upstate New  York has also been deeply affected—not just by the spread of the virus, but  also by the profound economic fallout.\n\nThe cause  of this recession—a global pandemic—means that our economic future will be  determined in large part by the path of the virus. It’s impossible to know  exactly how and when workers and businesses will be fully back to work and when  consumers will return to the businesses that are open.\n\nDespite  the uncertainty, I’m going to spend some time today discussing what the scale  of the challenge looks like for New York State, and for the U.S. economy as a  whole. I’m also going to outline the Federal Reserve System’s response. The Fed  is well-known for setting interest rates. But we play a number of other roles, and  have a key responsibility for ensuring that the financial system is working to  support the economy, which has been crucial during this crisis.\n\nBefore  I continue, let me give the Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine  alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee  or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Diverse State\n\nOne  of the particular strengths of New York State is its diversity—and this is  especially true from an economic perspective. In Western and Central New York  there are top-tier universities, manufacturing businesses, a thriving  professional services industry, as well as popular tourist destinations.\n\nSince  the 2008 financial crisis, the declining population trend in Upstate New York of  earlier decades had largely stabilized. In recent years, new businesses had  sprung up and unemployment had fallen to historic lows.\n\nAll  of this was against the backdrop of a strong national economy. At the start of  the year, most forecasts anticipated continued moderate growth throughout 2020  and into 2021.\n\nAccording  to the data for April, the unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 14.7  percent—a figure I hoped that I would never see in my lifetime, and one that is  sure to get worse before it gets better. If I think back to the economic  picture of February, nobody could foresee this would be our reality within a  few short months.\n\nIt’s  likely that the latest numbers do not reveal the full extent of the financial devastation  faced by millions of American families. The data don’t capture those who had to  leave their jobs, either for their own health or to take care of loved ones.\n\nMany  more people have had their hours reduced or have been forced to take a pay cut.  It’s going to be some time before we have a detailed understanding of the full economic  effects of the public health measures necessary to combat the coronavirus.\n\nWhat  we do know is that the pandemic has put a large question mark over the positive  trends experienced in our state, as well as the nation as a whole. As social  distancing measures are relaxed, we will get a better understanding of how  different industries are affected. We know that travel, hospitality, and retail  have all been hard hit.\n\nWhat  we don’t know is what the shape or timescale of the recovery will be. It’s  going to be some time before we have a clearer view of the effects on other  industries, including autos, higher education, manufacturing, and professional  services.\n\nOur Response\n\nDespite  this extraordinary uncertainty, at the Federal Reserve we worked quickly to put  measures in place to support the economy and set the foundation for a strong  recovery.\n\nDuring  the first half of March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) brought the  target range for the federal funds rate to near zero. 1 The FOMC has indicated  that it expects to keep interest rates at this level until it is confident that  the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum  employment and price stability goals. 2\n\nBringing  interest rates down to near zero serves two purposes. First, low interest rates  make it easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing needs.  Second, they foster broader financial conditions that will help promote the  rebound in spending and investment needed to return the economy to full  strength.\n\nThe New York Fed\n\nThe New York Fed has important and unique responsibilities in  supporting liquid and well-functioning financial markets. Working alongside our  colleagues in the Federal Reserve and other agencies, we are taking rapid and  significant actions to supply liquidity and to stabilize critical parts of our  financial system.\n\nBy conducting large-scale repo operations and purchasing sizable  quantities of U.S. Treasury securities and  agency mortgage-backed securities, we are providing funding and stability at  a time of extraordinary volatility in markets. 3 These actions averted a  potential shutdown in the availability of credit, which would have made the  current economic crisis even more severe.\n\nIn addition to stabilizing financial markets, the Federal Reserve  is standing up programs to support the flow of credit to households,  businesses, and state and local governments. These actions will enable them to  continue to do their work, both now and when normal life resumes. 4\n\nOur efforts supporting the provision of credit include a number of  programs aimed at different parts of the economy and work through different  channels. One set of programs supports the availability of credit to households  and businesses—importantly, including small and medium-sized businesses. A second  set of programs targets the availability of credit to states and  municipalities.\n\nFiscal policy is also playing a critically important role. In  particular, it can do what monetary policy cannot: provide for the public  health response and transfer income to those most affected by the outbreak.  Fiscal policy is also a vital partner in the delivery of our own programs,  supplying the financial support necessary for the extraordinary scale of the  credit facilities we’re operating.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll  conclude with this: These are extraordinary times, and the Fed is taking  extraordinary actions to ease the economic pain. This is anything but a typical  recession, and it has called for a new set of measures to address the economic  consequences of the virus.\n\nAmid  all the change we’re experiencing, you can be assured of one thing: our unwavering  commitment to limit the economic damage from the pandemic and foster conditions  for a strong and sustained recovery.",

    "text": "Thank you for the kind introduction and the  opportunity to speak this morning. It’s a particular pleasure to be sharing the  stage with Andrew Bailey, who has played such an important role in leading  efforts on establishing robust references rates to replace the London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR). This critical undertaking traverses markets and  transcends jurisdictions, making international cooperation and coordination  essential for success.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to give the  standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in  the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhere Have  We Come From?\n\nToday I’m going to talk about the progress  we’ve made, and the path that lies ahead. But first, given that 12 years have  passed since LIBOR first became an acute area of concern, it’s important to  remember why replacing it is so critical.\n\nLIBOR is based on submissions from individual  banks. The volume of actual transactions that term LIBOR is based on is very  small—totaling around $500 million on a typical day. To most people, $500  million may sound like a lot, but given that $200 trillion of financial contracts  reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, it’s really a drop in the ocean. 1\n\nAs a result, submissions are largely based on  judgment, as opposed to real numbers. When the LIBOR scandal erupted, it became  clear that there had been fraud and collusion, both within and across financial  services firms, in the pursuit of profit.\n\nThe reliance on expert judgment, rather than  actual data, makes the rate too vulnerable to manipulation. It’s readily apparent  to all those in the industry—both firms and regulators—that LIBOR is  fundamentally broken.\n\nConsequently, banks are increasingly reluctant  to provide LIBOR submissions, adding to the level of risk around using the  rate. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reached an agreement with  banks to keep submitting rates through the end of 2021, but in 2022 the  existence of LIBOR will no longer be guaranteed. In other words, LIBOR’s  survival is assured for only another 901 days.\n\nThose in the market know the full scale of the  risks this creates for the financial system. LIBOR isn’t just the rate that  banks use to borrow from one another—it’s also the underlying rate on numerous  derivatives and loan contracts. The $200 trillion figure I mentioned earlier is  the approximate total exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR. That’s about 10 times U.S.  gross domestic product.\n\nNone of what I am telling you is new, but it’s  worth reminding ourselves just how significant reference rates are to the  functioning of financial markets, both in the United States and around the  world. There’s broad recognition that exposure to LIBOR is a leading risk to  financial stability. 2 We  need to treat it as such.\n\nProgress Has  Been Made\n\nAnd, to date, significant progress has been made, moving us toward a safe  and sound reference rates regime. What’s more, there’s been notable momentum in  recent weeks.\n\nBut first, let’s take a look back at some of  the more significant accomplishments.\n\nBack in 2014, the New York Fed and the Board  of Governors convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), which  is made up of market participants. In an important milestone, the ARRC selected  the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative to U.S.  dollar LIBOR in 2017.\n\nSince April 2018, the New York Fed has  produced SOFR every day. It is based on much higher volumes than LIBOR, and  compliant with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks set forth by the International  Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). 3 SOFR  is based on transactions—not judgment—making it much more robust.\n\nAll of this points to the good work that can  happen when the private and official sectors come together.\n\nNow, there has been some criticism leveled at  SOFR, most notably the lack of a term rate, and not enough liquidity in the  market.\n\nBut liquidity has begun to develop in  derivatives and cash markets. And, earlier this year Federal Reserve Board  economists published research demonstrating how forward-looking term rates can  be derived from SOFR futures and swaps markets.\n\nHowever, we are still some time off from a  point at which a robust, IOSCO-compliant term rate can be created, and use of such  a term rate should be limited to certain segments of the loan market and to  fallbacks for new contracts. I want to emphasize that the industry must not  wait for a SOFR term rate to transition away from LIBOR.\n\nIn my view, the biggest challenge isn’t  liquidity or the creation of a term rate, it’s a willingness on the part of the  market to stop using LIBOR.\n\nWe need a mindset shift where firms realize  that every new U.S. dollar LIBOR contract written digs a deeper hole that will  be harder to climb out of.\n\nIf companies are going to use LIBOR, they need to start including robust fallback  language in the contract, so that if LIBOR ceases to exist, chaos does not  ensue.\n\nThis is an area of recent progress I mentioned  earlier. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has led  great work on the development of contingencies for some derivatives products  for the scenario where U.S. dollar LIBOR ceases to exist. The public  consultation on fallback language for some non-U.S. dollar derivatives  contracts took place last year. The corresponding consultation for U.S. dollar  and some other non-U.S. dollar derivatives contracts closed just last week, and  I look forward to hearing the results and next steps.\n\nUniversal changes to derivatives contracts  will take out about 95 percent of the exposure—the $200 trillion number. If the  market signs up to the ISDA protocol when it’s published early next year, it  will be a huge step in the right direction.\n\nIn addition, the ARRC has released four sets  of recommended fallback language for different types of cash products. This  fallback language clearly stipulates trigger events, replacement rates, and  spread adjustments, and the triggers are close to those that ISDA has consulted  on for derivatives.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) staff issued a statement highlighting risks and disclosures  for market participants to evaluate proactively as they transition away from  LIBOR.\n\nWhile derivatives and institutional cash  markets make up the bulk of LIBOR-based contracts, consumer products are a  critical area where the industry needs to focus. Ensuring a fair transition  away from LIBOR is going to be particularly challenging, and it’s important  consumers understand what the changes being made mean in real terms.\n\nLast week the ARRC published potential paths  forward for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). These include a set of guiding  principles for ARMs and other consumer products, draft fallback language for  new ARMs referencing U.S. dollar LIBOR, and a framework for use of SOFR in new  ARMs.\n\nMuch progress has been made, but there is  still much to do. The ARRC transition plan is well underway, but we need to see  certain developments in the U.S. financial industry for a smooth transition.\n\nMilestones for the future include deeper  liquidity in SOFR derivatives markets, greater issuance of SOFR-linked cash  products, a reduction in the issuance of LIBOR-linked cash products, and the  closing out of legacy positions on cash products, to name a few.\n\nThese all require the partnership and  perseverance of the market.\n\n2022 Is Just  Around the Corner\n\n2022 feels like it’s a long way away, but  believe it or not 901 days can disappear, almost in an instant.\n\nAnd I don’t always sense urgency among market  participants on this issue. Tellingly, contracts referencing U.S. dollar LIBOR,  without robust fallback language, continue to be written.\n\nMy message: don’t wait for term rates to get  your house in order. Engage with this issue now and understand what it means  for your operations. Recognize where your exposure lies and deal with the  contracts that mature after 2021 that lack robust fallback language.\n\nThis is a problem you have the opportunity to  get ahead of now. Don’t wait until January 1, 2022 to manage your business’  transition away from LIBOR, because it’s going to be too late.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll conclude with this: Reference rates are a  complex issue, with numerous countries, a wide range of public and private  entities, and trillions of dollars involved. Progress has been made, and the  way forward is clear. But we are now at a critical point in the timeline. The  very complexity of this issue is why the industry cannot afford to wait any  longer. The clock is ticking, and there are 901 days left.",

    "text": "It’s a great honor for me to participate  in this event commemorating the centenary of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. I  want to start by congratulating Julio and everyone at the Bank on this special  and significant anniversary. I am looking forward to a time, hopefully soon, when  we can come together, enjoy some ceviche, and celebrate in person.\n\nAnd while it’s not nearly as enticing as  a gathering over fine Peruvian food, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer  that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nGiven this special occasion, let me  begin with some reflections on the importance of communication and engagement in  central banking.\n\nShared Concerns\n\nAs central bankers, we have long understood  the value of engaging with colleagues around the world on the challenges we face  in our own countries. We all operate in a highly interconnected  global economy and financial system. And we have many of the same goals, including price stability, vibrant economies, and financial stability. Many of  the issues we face are not unique to any one of us, but  rather are shared across the region and the globe.\n\nRecent events, from the COVID-19  pandemic to the war in Ukraine, have only underscored the importance of active  dialogue and transparency among central banks. Beyond the global economic impact  of these events, it’s important to emphasize that the pandemic is first and  foremost a public health crisis, and that the Russian invasion is inflicting tremendous  hardship and suffering on the Ukrainian people.\n\nIn terms of economic impacts, all of us in  the Americas were affected by lockdowns and shutdowns at the start of the  pandemic. All of us have faced supply-chain bottlenecks and imbalances, as  people around the world shifted their spending habits—buying more goods and spending  less on services. And many of us are now confronting a sharp rise in inflation,  especially for food and energy, which is hardest on our most vulnerable  populations.\n\nOf course, each country is facing its  own set of circumstances, and each has its own domestic mandates. But it’s  important to remember that the policies we implement can affect our neighbors,  just as developments that take place outside our borders can impact our ability  to achieve our domestic goals. The actions we take can also affect  the flow of capital across countries.\n\nAs  central bankers, it is vitally important that we clearly communicate our policy  strategies and reasoning for our actions as we carry out our mandates. Clear communication reduces the risk of  confusion, volatility, and spillovers, and helps others prepare for challenges  that may lie ahead. Experience has demonstrated that transparency in monetary  policy can both increase its effectiveness and reduce unintended  consequences.\n\nShared Insights and Analyses\n\nThat  is why the perspectives we gain through ongoing dialogue with our counterparts  are so valuable. Across the globe, many central banks—including the Federal  Reserve—are moving to unwind the highly accommodative policies they put in  place at the start of the pandemic. And we are doing this at  a time when the economic implications of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine remain  highly uncertain.\n\nAs  we all take these steps, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has provided  an indispensable venue for sharing insights, analyses, and concerns. By  engaging with each other, we are able to stay ahead of the trends and issues  that affect other economies and their financial markets. And that is true not  only when it comes to policy development and execution, but also in  understanding economic and financial developments across the globe.\n\nA  particularly apt example of the value of dialogue is the BIS’s Consultative  Council for the Americas, which I’ve had the pleasure of  chairing since 2020. Agustín, Julio, Roberto, and our  colleagues from Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico are participants  in meetings of the Council. Suffice to say, we’ve had a great deal to discuss  over the past two years. And to do so, we have significantly increased the  frequency of our meetings.\n\nThese  meetings provide us with opportunities to communicate the reasoning and  implications of our policy strategies, goals, and actions, and to hear how  these affect other economies in the region. We exchange perspectives on shifting  policy imperatives, and we share experiences and insights related to managing  risks.\n\nThrough  the BIS, we also jointly meet with members of the private sector, including bank  CEOs and chief economists from the region, to hear their views about the  economy. This is another valuable aspect of our work as central bank governors,  and it’s insightful for all of us to hear from leaders beyond our own  organizations and the borders of our countries.\n\nGlobal Issues\n\nI  touched on many topics—the pandemic, the war, and inflation. These are global  issues with domestic implications, and when we address them to fulfill our own  mandates, we affect the economies of other countries in the region as well. In  this regard, the work of the BIS in bringing central banks together has never  been more important. I look forward to continuing our dialogue and engagement  in the future.\n\nAgain,  congratulations to the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, and best wishes for your second century.",

    "text": "John  Maynard Keynes quipped, “Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite  exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct  economist.” I wonder whether Keynes would see this as a feature rather than a  bug in light of his enduring influence on the profession more than 70 years  after his death.\n\nThe theme  of my talk today is that during my quarter century as a researcher and  policymaker at the Fed, we have not been overly beholden to defunct economists.  Quite the contrary. A quick scan of FOMC memos, briefings, and meeting minutes  provides ample evidence that a wide range of economic research—new and old,  conventional and outside the box—regularly enters into our debates and  influences our decisions. This represents a rich two-way dialogue between researchers  and policymakers, with both sides probing for new answers to old questions.\n\nI could  list a long catalog of examples of the synergistic relationship between  research and policymaking at central banks. Instead, I will focus my comments  today on one specific topic: the zero lower bound on interest rates, or ZLB for  short. This topic has obvious importance to central bank practice past,  present, and future. In addition, the Journal  of Money, Credit and Banking ( JMCB ),  the 50th anniversary of which we are recognizing today, played a very important  role in shaping how we think about the ZLB. Today I’d like to highlight how  this work has influenced my own thinking, as a researcher and policymaker.\n\nBefore I  proceed any further, I should give the usual disclaimer that everything I say  today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or anyone  else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Zero Lower Bound Emerges Although  the ZLB was not a new idea by any means, three circumstances—two empirical, one  theoretical—came together to reignite interest in this topic by researchers and  policymakers in the 1990s. 1\n\nThe first  was the achievement of low inflation in the United States, which, all else  equal, implied lower interest rates. The second was Japan’s lengthening period  of deflation and near-zero interest rates. 2 The third was renewed curiosity  about the theory of monetary policy as decision rules for interest rates,  following the publication of John Taylor’s “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice.” 3\n\nAlthough that paper did  not mention the ZLB, it fundamentally transformed how many economists,  including one impressionable Stanford grad student, thought about monetary  policy. Indeed, the very logic of the Taylor rule—that interest rates systematically  move up and down with changes in economic conditions—forced macroeconomists to  come to terms with the presence of the ZLB. Put simply, if you run macroeconomic model simulations with a Taylor rule, you will eventually encounter the ZLB and face the decision of what, if anything, to do about it.\n\nThis  tension is evident in research papers on monetary policy rules from this era,  in which authors either sidestepped the ZLB or ignored it altogether. In fact,  I’ll plead guilty as charged when it comes to my own research during this  period. At the same time, a small cadre of researchers at the Fed and in  academia started to take the ZLB head-on and explore its effects in macro  models. 4\n\nResearch on  the ZLB quickly made its way to policymakers. The ZLB was analyzed in a note to  the FOMC in the summer of 1998 and discussed at the subsequent FOMC meeting in  July. 5 That discussion led to  interest at the Fed in having a research conference to provide a broad set of  views and perspectives on the ZLB.\n\nThis convergence  in interest between researchers and policymakers resulted in a Federal Reserve  conference on “Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment” held in  Woodstock, Vermont, in October 1999. The conference proceedings were  subsequently published in a special issue of the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking in November 2000. The goal of  the conference was to bring together academic and Fed researchers and  policymakers to study the implications of low inflation and the ZLB from a  variety of perspectives. 6\n\nLooking  back, what stands out the most from this conference was the richness and  diversity of thought brought to a topic that had lain mostly dormant for many  decades. There were papers on the historical experience with very low inflation  and interest rates, and on financial market functioning in such an environment.  The conference concluded with an international policymaker panel.\n\nWhat is  striking rereading these papers today is how all authors took for granted that  the ZLB was a real problem that needed addressing, and how they approached it  in novel and different ways. This despite the fact that the economy was in the  midst of a productivity-driven boom, the longest expansion on record, and the  prevailing federal funds rate was 5.25 percent. These papers and the ensuing  discussions and debates planted seeds that would germinate in research and  policymaking. Central banks across the globe ultimately used variations of  nearly all of the tools discussed at the conference. Indeed, the topics of  interest rate policies, targeting asset prices, asset purchases, and negative  interest rates are among the most prominent discussions in monetary economics  today.\n\nImportantly,  this research made its way straight to policymakers within a few years—a quick  turnaround by central bank standards! In January 2002, Marvin, Dave, and I  reprised our roles from the conference in briefings to the FOMC. 10 And in June 2003, Vince  Reinhart briefed the FOMC on alternative monetary policy approaches—including  asset purchases and forward guidance—to mitigate the effects of the ZLB. 11 This was followed by a  flurry of further research by academics and central bank economists that delved  deeper into these topics. 12\n\nPutting Research into Practice This research had  important practical lessons for policymakers in the United States and abroad following  the global financial crisis. One lesson was that short-term rates should be cut  aggressively when deflation or a severe downturn threatens. 13 That is, do not “keep your  powder dry.” A second lesson is that short-term rates should be kept “lower for  longer” as the economy recovers. 14 A third is that  large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) can complement conventional policy  actions by making financial conditions more favorable for growth even when  short rates are constrained by the ZLB. 15\n\nArmed with  these insights, policymakers were prepared and able to act quickly and  decisively when the financial crisis hit. A great deal was learned about the  ZLB and unconventional policy tools along the way. 16 Indeed, another conference  organized by the Boston Fed was held in October 2010 to assess lessons learned,  and the proceedings of that conference were published in a special issue of the JMCB in February 2012. For me, the  most interesting aspect of that conference  was that participants took the ZLB as a defining feature of the landscape: what  was once viewed as primarily theoretical had become grounded in practice and  experience.\n\nThe ZLB in 2019 This brings  me to today. The Federal Reserve has embarked on a review of its monetary  policy strategic framework. As was the case 20 years ago, the question is how to  best achieve our monetary policy goals in the context of low inflation and the  ZLB. Indeed, the policy questions we are grappling with today are exactly the  ones laid out in Woodstock. The one fresh wrinkle is that with estimates of the  neutral real interest rate much lower than those that prevailed 20 years ago,  the ZLB is likely to be an even more powerful force than was imagined in 1999. 17\n\nIn  approaching this question today, we should take lessons from the conference  held in Woodstock 20 years ago: Bring together leading researchers and  policymakers, draw out the best and most creative thinking, and take a long-run  view of how we can navigate the environment before us. I am happy to say that  this process is already in train, with the Fed’s framework review incorporating  perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders, culminating in an academic  conference next week in Chicago.\n\nConclusion In closing,  I want to add a personal thanks to Ken West for all he has done to promote  outstanding research that is both innovative and relevant to the real-world  problems that central banks face. And my best wishes for the JMCB , which I hope may continue its  illustrious record for the next 50 years. As a researcher and policymaker, the  one thing I am certain about is that fostering an open and active dialogue  between researchers and policymakers is the best way for us to succeed in our  work.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to give my thanks to Columbia  University's School of International and Public Affairs for partnering with the  New York Fed once again and for hosting us today. It's wonderful to be here and  to see so many colleagues who have traveled from near and far to attend this workshop.\n\nWe'll have many important conversations over the next two days. To  kick us off, I'm going to share some observations on the digital transformation  of money and payments. I'll also discuss the potential implications for monetary  policy implementation and for central banks more broadly.\n\nBefore I begin, I must give  the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express here are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone  else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI will get to payments technology in a  minute. But first allow me to take you back to the year 1877. You're amazed at  the sound of music coming out of a new invention—the phonograph. Fast-forward a  century, and you're listening to your favorite band on a cassette tape. In the 1980s,  it's a CD. In the 2000s, you're scrolling through the greatest hits on your  iPod. And today, perhaps even on your way here, you listened to a streaming  service on your phone or watch using voice commands.\n\nThere's been much innovation over the  years, and many improvements in terms of convenience and costs, but at the most  basic level we are still doing the same thing: enjoying music. It's how we're  doing it that's changed.\n\nThe same is true with money and  payments. Both are fundamentally changing through technological transformations.  As happened with the delivery of music, the pace of technological advancement is  accelerating, and it's clearing the way to do things faster or more  efficiently. On top of that, the development of digital currencies has boomed. This  includes cryptocurrencies that are not fully backed by other assets. It also  includes stablecoins that are fully backed by safe and liquid assets, and central  bank digital currencies (CBDC). Both stablecoins and CBDC that are fully backed  by safe assets have the potential to be a new way to hold money and make  payments. While all of this innovation opens up possibilities to do things  differently than the past, it also carries risks.\n\nJust like listening to music, the \"how\" may  change, but the \"what\" will remain the same. As we look ahead, it's important  to remember that even as the technology changes, the role of the central bank  has not. It is and will always be to supply money and liquidity to bring stability  to the economy and financial system.\n\nTherefore, it's critical that we  understand how these transformations could affect the economy and the financial  system, as well as monetary policy implementation and central bank balance  sheets. In addition, we must think carefully about proper regulation to protect  consumers and investors and ensure the stability and safety of the financial  system. 1\n\nSo, what are some of the things that the  New York Fed should be thinking about? To start, digital transformation could  have implications for markets and for our interactions with counterparties, as  well as how we carry out monetary policy.\n\nLike in the example of music, change is  already underway. Take the Fed's overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility, for  example 2 .  The ON RRP facility has broadened the set of our counterparties and diversified  the type of instruments on the liability side of our balance sheet. This facility  has supported the control of short-term interest rates according to the FOMC's  policy direction.\n\nThis has had profound effects on the  composition of liabilities on our balance sheet. Traditionally, the Fed's  liabilities have primarily been paper currency and reserves held by banks at  the Fed. For example, a decade ago, paper currency totaled $1.1 trillion and  bank reserves $1.5 trillion. But since then, we've seen a dramatic change in the  makeup of the liability side of our balance sheet. Today, in addition to $2.3  trillion of currency and $3.3 trillion of bank reserves, there are $2 trillion  in overnight reverse repos, representing funding from nonbank sources such as money  market funds.\n\nTurning to the  future, the big question is what a world of digital currencies like stablecoins  and CBDCs would mean for the implementation of monetary policy. How will central banks anticipate and adapt to the  changing landscape brought on by the possibility of digital currencies?\n\nThere is much more to discuss about  these important considerations in a fast-changing world. As central bankers,  it's critical that we remain focused on carrying out our responsibilities,  while keeping pace with the world around us.\n\nAnd that's what brings us here today. This  workshop is an important part of learning and understanding the challenges and  opportunities that lie ahead so that we can be prepared for and successful in  the future.\n\nThank you all for participating in what  will surely be thought-provoking and constructive discussions.",

    "text": "It's a pleasure to be here this morning at the University of  Puerto Rico's beautiful Mayagüez campus. Thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nThis visit is part of the New York Fed's broader commitment to  serving the diverse economies in the Federal Reserve's Second District,  which—in addition to Puerto Rico—includes the U.S. Virgin Islands, New York  State, northern New Jersey, and parts of Connecticut.\n\nHere in Puerto Rico, we supervise four commercial banking  organizations that account for a large part of the deposit and lending  activities on the island. We also provide cash services  to depository institutions located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To take one example, the  New York Fed coordinated an extensive effort to keep cash operations on the  island functional following Hurricane Maria, ensuring adequate supply and  meeting the demand for much-needed currency.  We also study issues that affect the communities here, and  our economists monitor economic conditions that inform our work. 1\n\nI'll start by saying that I am so pleased that in many respects the  Puerto Rican economy has recovered strongly from the hurricanes and the  pandemic. Over the course of my visit, I've had the opportunity to hear firsthand  from business, government, and community leaders about what is happening on the  island. I met with government officials to discuss the Commonwealth’s economic plan and pandemic recovery. I  also heard from executives about how the banking sector is faring. And I met with leaders of cooperativas to hear about  what they're doing  to help residents improve their access to credit and  financial services. I took a short flight here from San Juan after a full day  of engagements yesterday, and I spent the earlier part of this morning at the  Aeronautical and Aerospace Institute of Puerto Rico, where I learned about this  growing industry. Needless to say, the views from the ground and the air have  been delightful.\n\nThe U.S. economy has experienced a tremendous rebound since the  darkest days at the onset of the pandemic. But now, inflation is sky-high, and it  is the number one danger to the overall health and stability of a  well-functioning economy. The war in Ukraine and the recent lockdowns in China,  on top of the ongoing supply challenges and demand shifts, have led to  inflation rates we have not seen in four decades.\n\nThe priority for monetary policy is clear. The Federal Reserve is strongly  committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Price  stability is absolutely essential for the economy to achieve its potential and sustain  maximum employment over the medium term. I want to be clear: this is not an  easy task. We must be resolute, and we cannot fall short.\n\nThis morning I'm going to talk about the uncertainty that high  inflation poses to the economic outlook. I'll also share more about the labor  market, both here in Puerto Rico and in the country more broadly. Then, I'll  describe how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions are aimed at  bringing down high inflation and restoring balance to the economy.\n\nBefore I continue, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that  the views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nDual  Mandate\n\nI know many of you here are studying  economics, so you may be familiar with the Fed's dual mandate, or the two goals  Congress has set for us: to promote both maximum employment and price  stability.\n\nTo better understand what affects our mandate, we look at  data—lots of it. We study everything from food and gas prices to retail sales  and inventories, from labor costs and employment figures to semiconductor  inventories and shipping expenses, and from the demand for goods and services  to readings on public health.\n\nSlowing  Growth\n\nSo, I'll start with the data that we are seeing as it relates to  one half of our dual mandate: maximum employment. Although there are some signs  that job growth has slowed in recent months, the labor market remains incredibly  tight.\n\nDuring the first six months of this year, the economy added 2-3/4 million jobs, as  businesses added staff to keep up with demand. The unemployment rate has been steady  in the past few months near its historical low and was 3.6 percent in June. There are now far more  job openings than people looking for work, and employers are still struggling  to fill roles.\n\nThe economy experienced a rapid recovery from the pandemic last  year, but I expect growth to slow considerably this year as  the waning effects of fiscal stimulus, less favorable financial conditions, and  slower growth abroad all weigh on our economy.  Specifically, I currently  expect real GDP growth in the United States to be below one percent this year,  and then to rebound slightly to around 1-1/2 percent next year. With overall  growth slowing to below its trend level, I expect the unemployment rate to move  up from its very low current level, reaching somewhat above 4 percent next  year.\n\nEconomic  Conditions in Puerto Rico\n\nSimilar to the mainland, employment in Puerto Rico has rebounded  quickly and strongly. Before the pandemic, the economy was just showing signs  of emerging from a decade-and-a-half-long economic slump, during which both the  population and employment had fallen by about 16 percent. Then, in the spring  of 2020, employment tumbled another 14 percent, a far steeper decline than  after Hurricane Maria in 2017. The subsequent turnaround has been astounding.  Today, total employment is up 5 percent from pre-pandemic  levels and is at a nine-year high, and the unemployment rate is at a record  low.\n\nThe recovery has been broad-based, but we've seen particular  strength in certain industries like professional business services,  transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing. Tourism rebounded significantly  too, with hotel occupancy rates reaching above 75 percent.\n\nSoaring  Inflation\n\nAll in all, maximum employment has been achieved.  But inflation remains unacceptably high, and we are far from  the Fed's longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.\n\nSince early last year, inflation has increased rapidly to levels  many of you have not seen in your lifetimes.  This  experience is not unique to the United States; nearly all countries around the  world are seeing rising costs, and central banks everywhere are working to  contain them.\n\nThe rise in inflation has been extraordinary. In December 2020,  overall inflation, as measured by the 12-month percent change in the personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was 1.3 percent. In May of this  year, it was 6.3 percent. A significant portion of this sharp rise reflects  global increases in food and energy prices. But, even excluding those costs,  the \"core\" inflation rate has increased from 1.5 percent a year and a half ago to  4.7 percent today.\n\nIt's more than just numbers. High inflation is incredibly harmful,  especially to those that can least afford to shoulder the escalating costs of  necessities like food, fuel, and housing. A recent study by New York Fed  economists shows that high inflation hits Black and Hispanic Americans particularly  hard. 2 I  am resolutely focused on restoring price stability, which is the foundation for  a vibrant and healthy economy.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve's Policy Actions\n\nWhile monetary policy actions won't directly reduce fuel or food  costs, they will reduce overall inflationary pressures that arise in an economy  where demand exceeds the available supply, like we are experiencing today.  Higher interest rates reduce demand for goods and services. This is especially true  for those sectors that are most sensitive to interest rates, such as durable  goods and housing, where we have seen the greatest imbalances between demand  and supply.\n\nTherefore, in support of our goals of achieving maximum employment  and inflation at a rate of 2 percent over the longer run, the FOMC last  month decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1‑1/2 to  1-3/4 percent and said it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target  range will be appropriate. 3 In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury  securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described  in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that  were issued in May. 4\n\nRaising the federal funds rate by 75 basis points was the largest single  increase that the Federal Reserve has put forth since 1994. This decision was a  critical step in moving monetary policy expeditiously away from the very accommodative  stance that we put in place early in the pandemic.\n\nThe  Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent  objective. In determining how quickly and how high to  raise the rates in the future, we'll watch closely to see how the economy  responds to tightening financial conditions and how inflation, inflation  expectations, and the economic outlook evolve. As always, we will be  data-dependent and nimble in our approach.\n\nWith tighter monetary policy in place, supply and demand will be  brought back into balance, and inflation will return to our 2 percent  longer-run goal. This may take some time and may well be a bumpy road.\n\nClosing\n\nI'll close with this: Inflation is  far too high, and price stability is absolutely essential for a strong economy.  We have the tools to get the job done and are one hundred percent committed to achieving  our goals.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "My  wife is a professor of nursing, and she says one of the best things you can do  for your children is to get them vaccinated. It’s better to deal with the  short-term pain of a shot than to take the risk that they’ll contract a disease  later on.\n\nI  think about monetary policy near the zero lower bound—or ZLB for short—in much  the same way. It’s better to take preventative measures than to wait for  disaster to unfold.\n\nToday  I’m going to talk about three things: first, the heightened relevance of the  ZLB for monetary policy; second, the strategies designed to mitigate the  effects of the ZLB in an economic downturn; and finally, why these strategies  are so important for achieving our monetary policy goals.\n\nI’ve  already referred to monetary policy several times. So, before I go any further,  I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are  mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Global Economic Context\n\nOver  the past quarter century, a great deal of research has gone into understanding  the causes and consequences of the zero lower bound. 1 The achievement of low inflation in the United States—which, all else equal,  implied lower interest rates—coupled with Japan’s long period of deflation and  near-zero interest rates, reignited concern about the ZLB back in the 1990s.  And the experience of the global financial crisis and its aftermath—with many  advanced economies facing, or in some cases, crossing the zero lower bound—has  moved this from a mostly theoretical exercise to a very practical one.\n\nAn  added impetus to this research has been the growing evidence that the neutral  rate of interest rate has fallen significantly. I, working with various  coauthors, have devoted a significant chunk of my academic career to studying  r-star, or the long-run neutral rate of interest, and its implications for  monetary policy.\n\nOur  current estimates of r-star in the United States are around half a percent.  That’s actually now lower than at any time before the Great Recession. 2 We’ve seen similar declines in r-star in other advanced economies, including in  Japan and the euro area.\n\nAs  shown in Figure 1 , the weighted average of estimates of r-star for Canada, the euro  area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States is now also half a percent,  nearly 2 percentage points below where it stood at the turn of this century.\n\nThese  very low neutral rates are a result of long-term structural factors slowing  growth. They’re driven by demographic changes and slow productivity growth,  which are unlikely to reverse any time soon.\n\nLow  r-star implies that many central banks will be grappling with the challenges of  life near the ZLB, which is why it’s so critical to consider how the ZLB alters  strategies related to monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy Near the ZLB\n\nAnd  that’s exactly the question we looked at around 20 years ago. In a paper and  subsequent FOMC briefing in January 2002, my colleague Dave Reifschneider and I  evaluated the effects of the ZLB on the macro economy and examined alternative  monetary policy strategies to mitigate the effects of the ZLB. 3\n\nThis  work highlighted a number of conclusions based on model simulations. 4 In  particular, monetary policy can mitigate the effects of the ZLB in several  ways:\n\nThe  first: don’t keep your powder  dry—that is, move more quickly to add monetary stimulus than you otherwise  might. When the ZLB is nowhere in view, one can afford to move slowly and take  a “wait and see” approach to gain additional clarity about potentially adverse  economic developments. But not when interest rates are in the vicinity of the  ZLB. In that case, you want to do the opposite, and vaccinate against further  ills. When you only have so much stimulus at your disposal, it pays to act  quickly to lower rates at the first sign of economic distress.\n\nThis  brings me to my second conclusion, which is to keep interest rates lower for  longer. The expectation of lower interest rates in the future lowers yields on  bonds and thereby fosters more favorable financial conditions overall. This  will allow the stimulus to pick up steam, support economic growth over the  medium term, and allow inflation to rise.\n\nThese  first two conclusions featured in my paper with Dave Reifschneider from 2000. In  that paper, these ideas were described as modifications of an otherwise  standard Taylor rule for monetary policy. The “forward-looking adjustment” to  the Taylor rule illustrated the idea of moving in advance of a downturn to  provide timely stimulus. The “backward-looking adjustment” illustrated the idea  of keeping interest rates lower for longer.\n\nFinally,  policies that promise temporarily higher inflation following ZLB episodes can  help generate a faster recovery and better sustain price stability over the  longer run. 5 In model simulations, these “make-up” strategies can mitigate nearly all of the  adverse effects of the ZLB.\n\nOne  particular benefit is that such strategies can be highly effective at keeping  inflation near the target on average, thereby anchoring inflation expectations  at the desired level.\n\nThe Gravitational Pull of the ZLB\n\nBut  why are these measures so important close to the ZLB?\n\nThe  Fed has two goals: maximum employment and price stability. Our goal for  prices—as I’m sure you’re aware—is two percent. The short answer is, in order  to achieve our goals.\n\nThe  long answer centers on inflation and inflation expectations. I’m going to give  you the long answer!\n\nIn  the last decade it’s proven particularly challenging to keep inflation at our  two percent goal. Japan and the euro area have faced similar challenges in  terms of sustaining inflation at their goals.\n\nOne  reason it’s been hard to sustain inflation at the target rate is that  persistently low inflation due to policy being constrained by the ZLB can feed  into inflation expectations. If inflation gets stuck too low—below the 2  percent goal—people may start to expect it to stay that way, creating a  feedback loop, pushing inflation further down over the longer term.\n\nThe  lower average level of inflation translates into a lower level of interest rates cuts  available during a downturn, making it even harder for policymakers to achieve  their goals. 6\n\nIn  1980, when core PCE inflation reached a peak of 10 percent, it was hard to  conceive of a world where inflation that’s too low would be the preoccupation  of central banks.\n\nBut  the 10 years since the Great Recession demonstrate just how much low r-star has  changed the economic environment. Unprecedented monetary stimulus in advanced  economies supported economic recoveries and significant declines in  unemployment, with unemployment rates today near, or in many cases well below,  those seen before the crisis. 7 Bold monetary policy actions surely played an important role in averting far  greater catastrophes and aided economic recovery.\n\nDespite  these actions and this success at bringing unemployment to low levels,  inflation rates have persistently been below central banks’ goals. The fact  that inflation has been running below target in most advanced countries suggests  that this challenge is not due to factors specific to a single country.  Instead, there are more systemic factors at play, with the root cause being a  combination of low neutral interest rates and the lower bound on interest  rates.\n\nInvestors  are increasingly viewing these low inflation readings not as an aberration, but  rather a new normal. This is evidenced by a broad-based decline in market-based  measures of longer-run inflation expectations since the mid-2000s, with the UK providing the exception, as shown in Table 1 .\n\nThis downward slippage of longer-run inflation expectations, if it persists, implies that in the future central banks start further from their inflation goals and have even less room to maneuver, making the problem of low r-star and the ZLB even more difficult.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  ZLB has been a topic of study for nearly two decades. But recent history and  the outlook for the longer-term future, make it more relevant than ever.\n\nLow  inflation expectations, very low r-star, and slower growth all point to a  challenging world where policymakers need to make the best use of the tools at  their disposal to achieve their goals of strong economies and price stability.\n\nThe  key lessons from this research hold today and in the future. First, take swift  action when faced with adverse economic conditions. Second, keep interest rates  lower for longer. And third, adapt monetary policy strategies to succeed in the  context of low r-star and the ZLB.\n\nThese  actions, taken together, should vaccinate the economy and protect it from the  more insidious disease of too low inflation.\n\nThank  you.\n\nPresentation",

    "text": "For over 125 years, economists have  grappled with a dilemma: How can a concept at the very heart of monetary theory  be so vexing to quantify? I’m talking, of course, about r-star, the natural  rate of interest. The quotations listed in Table 1 reflect the age-old  challenges surrounding it. 1 Recently, r-star has been in the spotlight once again.\n\nToday, my remarks will focus on  longer-run r-star, which is the real interest rate expected to prevail when  shocks to the economy have receded and the economy is growing at its potential  rate.\n\nBefore I go further, I’ll provide the  standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThree Approaches\n\nSubsequent to Milton Friedman’s claim to  the contrary, 2 there are now three common approaches to inferring r-star from data: using a  statistical method to extract a longer-run trend, basing it on financial market  or survey data, or looking at r-star’s effects on economic data. Each provides  useful information, but each also poses significant challenges. As discussed in  one of my papers with Thomas Laubach, univariate statistical methods do not  adequately control for economic factors that influence interest rates. And these  estimates can be overly influenced by large macroeconomic disturbances, such as  the inflation of the 1970s or the pandemic. 3 Financial market and survey data are subject to measurement issues and, in any  case, tell us what people are thinking about r-star, rather than act as an  independent source of information on r-star. This is what I have referred to as  a “hall of mirrors.” 4\n\nFor these reasons, I will focus my  remarks on estimates of r-star gleaned from macroeconomic models that do not  rely on financial market or survey data—in particular, the Holston-Laubach-Williams  (HLW) model, which infers the natural rate of interest through the behavior of  interest rates, inflation, and GDP. 5 Or, as the economist John H. Williams put it, “by its works.” 6\n\nA Global Supply and Demand for Savings\n\nOur estimates of r-star in the euro area  and the United States fell dramatically over the quarter century leading up to  the pandemic, and they are currently near the estimates from prior to the  pandemic. Figure 1 shows the time series of r-star estimates for the euro area  and the United States. I’ll focus first on the euro area.\n\nThe estimate of r-star in the euro area is  0.5 percent in 2023, equal to its average over the five years prior to the  outbreak of COVID. This assessment of a very low r-star is broadly consistent  with analysis by ECB economists using a variety of models. 7\n\nThe sizable decline in estimates of  r-star during the decades prior to the pandemic is common to many advanced and  emerging economies. It reflects developments related to the global supply  and demand for savings. 8 These include falling birth rates and relatively low productivity growth that both  reduce demand for savings, as well as increases in longevity and wealth  inequality that increase the supply of savings. I emphasize the word global, because in a world of open capital markets, one should expect r-star to be  highly correlated across countries. Indeed, there is evidence that r-star  estimates are highly interconnected in advanced economies, although local  factors play a role as well. 9\n\nThe role of common and idiosyncratic  factors is seen by comparing the estimates for the euro area to those for the  United States, also shown in Figure 1 . Although the two sets of estimates display  some shorter-term wiggles, the dominant shared feature is the sustained two-percentage-point  decline in r-star over the past 30 years. The same pattern is true of our  estimates for Canada. Hence, according to these estimates, the low r-star  regime endures.\n\nIs R-Star Rising?\n\nThis finding runs counter to recent  commentary suggesting that r-star has risen due to persistent changes in the  balance between the supply and demand for savings, such as higher investment in  AI and renewable energy, as well as larger government debt. In fact, some measures  of longer-run r-star have risen to levels well above those directly prior to  the pandemic. For example, market-based measures of five-year,  five-year-forward real rates for the euro area and the United States have risen  well above the HLW estimates, as shown in Figure 2 .\n\nTwo things stand out from this figure.  First, until recently, far-forward real rates displayed a broadly similar pattern  of decline as the model estimates of r-star. Second, the market-based measures  are volatile. Indeed, in the years before the recent rise, they had fallen to  very low levels, well below the corresponding model estimates. This points to a  significant time-varying risk premium, which interferes with taking  market-based measures at face value in assessing what markets are telling us  about their perceptions of r-star. For example, based on the D'Amico, Kim, and  Wei term structure model, the estimated rise in U.S. far-forward expected real  yields since the onset of the pandemic is significantly smaller than that  implied by a direct read of real yields. 10\n\nWhere does this leave us regarding  r-star? Although the value of r-star is always highly uncertain, the case for a  sizable increase in r-star has yet to meet two important tests. First, owing to  the interconnectedness of r-star across countries, plausible factors pushing up  r-star on a sustained basis are likely to be global in nature. This highlights  a tension between the evidence from Europe that r-star is still very low and  arguments in the United States that r-star is now closer to levels seen 20  years ago.\n\nSecond, any increase in r-star must  overcome the forces that have been pushing r-star down for decades. 11 In this regard, recent data reinforce the continuation of pre-pandemic trends  in global demographics and productivity growth. One lens through which to see  this is our model estimates of potential GDP, or y-star, which is a key factor  that affects r-star. Many of the explanations arguing for a higher r-star would  likely show up in higher potential output growth. However, the HLW estimates of  euro area and U.S. trend potential GDP growth in 2023 are nearly unchanged from  their respective 2019 values. This is consistent with other estimates of  potential GDP growth for the euro area and the United States. 12\n\nR-Star and Monetary Policy\n\nI will end with a brief comment on the  usefulness of estimates of r-star for policymaking. First, as the Swedish  economist Knut Wicksell and others have stressed, r-star is either explicitly  or implicitly at the core of any macroeconomic model or framework one can  imagine. Pretending it doesn’t exist or wishing it away does not change that.  In that context, it is important that we do our best to understand the factors  that affect r-star and the uncertainties related to it, so that we have the  best understanding possible of the forces affecting the longer-term evolution  of the economy.\n\nSecond, and equally important, as shown in my work with Athanasios Orphanides, the high degree of uncertainty about r-star means that one should not overly rely on estimates of r-star in determining the appropriate setting of monetary policy at a given point in time. 13 Instead, such determinations must be, and are, based on a wide range of information and assessments, including those related to risks.\n\nPresentation",

    "text": "Thank you for that  kind introduction. As chair of the Economic Club of New York, I often have the  honor of introducing speakers to our forums. It's a special privilege for me to  speak to the Club today.\n\nI'm  also pleased to be here during my favorite month of the year. The weather is  warmer… Baseball season is well underway… And it's the month when people around  the world celebrate \"Star Wars,\" one of the all-time great  franchises. I am often asked whether I am fan of \"Star Trek\" or \"Star Wars,\"  and my definitive answer is, \"yes.\"\n\nNow, I promise I won't spend my time talking about the  weather or baseball. What I do want to talk about is inflation.\n\nInflation remains too high, and high inflation is  hardest on those who can least afford to pay higher prices for food, shelter,  and transportation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to bringing inflation  down. As the Mandalorian would say, \"Price stability.\n\n\"This is the way.\"\n\nBefore  I continue, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntrinsically  Linked, One with the Force\n\nThe  FOMC is mandated by Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability.  The goals of our dual mandate are intrinsically linked. Specifically, price  stability is essential for the economy to reach its full potential and to  sustain maximum employment over the long term.\n\nSince  the pandemic, imbalances between demand and supply have persisted throughout  the economy, leading to high inflation and a tight labor market. Although we  have seen some signs of a gradual cooling in the demand for labor—as well as for some goods and commodities—overall demand  continues to exceed supply.\n\nI'll  first discuss what this means for employment.  At the  national level, job growth has been robust, with monthly job gains averaging about  220,000 over the past three months.  Other indicators show that labor demand  is gradually slowing, yet remains very strong. For example, job openings have  come down from their peak level in March of last year. Still, the ratio of job  openings to unemployed far exceeds levels prevailing before the pandemic, when  the labor market was very strong. Similarly, quit rates have been gradually  declining, but are above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn  addition, the unemployment rate is at a historically low level of 3.4 percent.  And in April, the employment-to-population ratio for those between the ages of  25 and 54 reached the highest level since 2001.\n\nThe  strength of the labor market is evident in parts of the Federal Reserve's  Second District. Fairfield County in Connecticut has fully recovered from the  pandemic. Northern New Jersey is above where it was in 2019. And New York City  has also shown remarkable progress, with employment closing in on pre-Covid levels. 1\n\nNationally, we are also seeing improvements on the  supply side of the labor market. As you'll recall, when businesses reopened  after the 2020 pandemic shutdowns, many faced a dire shortage of workers.\n\nSince then, we have seen a rebound in labor force  participation, with the 25-to 54-year-old age group slightly above pre-pandemic  levels. Although overall participation is below where it was before Covid,  economists at the New York Fed have found that this shortfall is more than  fully accounted for by the aging—or what I prefer to  call \"maturing\"—of the workforce. 2\n\nThis increase in labor force participation has helped  alleviate some of the imbalance in the labor market. But with baby boomers  increasingly reaching retirement age, population aging will continue to put  downward pressure on participation in the medium term.  Increases  in the labor force from immigration, which has picked up from its pandemic  lows, can partially offset this, but it is unlikely to fully undo the impact.\n\nThe Force Is  a Balance\n\nAchieving  balance on the inflation side of our mandate has been more challenging.\n\nLast  June, inflation spiked to a 40-year high of 7 percent, as measured by the  personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. Since then, inflation has  moderated to 4.2 percent, in large part due to a decline in energy prices.  That's much better than 7 percent, but still more than double our longer-run  goal of 2 percent.\n\nThis  inflation target is an important bedrock principle for the FOMC. It provides a  \"North Star\" for policy decisions and helps improve the public's  understanding of our goals and actions. 3 It has also  helped to keep various measures of longer-run inflation expectations remarkably  well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run goal. 4\n\nAlthough  short- and medium-term inflation expectations rose during the pandemic, these  measures have since come down.  Indeed, based on the latest  reading of the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations, three-year-ahead  expectations have returned to a level nearly identical to its average between  2014 and 2020.  Although one-year-ahead inflation expectations in the survey  remain elevated, they have declined considerably from the peak level reached in  June 2022. 5\n\nTo  understand why inflation remains too high, it's instructive to examine inflation  developments in various sectors of our economy. So far, inflation has declined  in many categories of commodities and goods, which tend to be more sensitive to  interest rate increases.\n\nIn  addition, supply chains, which were severely constrained after the pandemic's  onset, have improved considerably. This is something I hear from business  leaders from across the Federal Reserve's Second District. And the New York  Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index has declined to a level that indicates  supply chain pressures are now actually somewhat lower than normal. 6\n\nAt  the same time, the March price data indicate some moderation in overall rent  inflation. And rents for new leases have been showing slower rates of increases,  which should bring down shelter inflation in coming months. This is important  because shelter inflation had been a significant driver of higher inflation  over the past year.\n\nBut  the most persistent area of inflation is in core services excluding housing,  which has been running around 4-1/2 percent since last August  .  This is driven by a continued imbalance in overall supply and demand, and it  will take the longest to bring down.\n\nBringing Back  the Balance\n\nIn \"The Rise of Skywalker,\" Anakin urged Rey to \"bring back the  balance.\" The FOMC has been  taking strong actions to do just that.\n\nLast  week, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5-1/4  percent, its tenth consecutive rate increase. In its post-meeting statement, the  FOMC indicated that \"in determining the extent to which additional policy  firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the  Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy,  the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation,  and economic and financial developments.\" 7\n\nIn  addition, the FOMC indicated it will continue to reduce its holdings of  Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities,  according to the framework announced a year ago. 8\n\nThe  FOMC also said that the \"Committee will closely monitor incoming information  and assess the implications for monetary policy.\" I will be particularly  focused on assessing the evolution of credit conditions and their effects on  the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation.\n\nAlways in  Motion Is the Future\n\nBecause  of the lag between policy actions and their effects, it will take time for the  FOMC's actions to restore balance to the economy and return inflation to our 2  percent target. I expect inflation to decline to around 3-1/4 percent this  year, before returning to our longer-run goal of 2 percent over the next two  years.\n\nAs  tighter monetary policy continues to take effect, I expect real GDP to grow  modestly this year, with growth then picking up somewhat next year.\n\nAnd  I anticipate slow growth will continue to cool the labor market, with  unemployment gradually rising to about 4 to 4-1/2 percent over the next year.\n\nKnowledge  Lights Our Way\n\nI  am confident we are on the path to restoring price stability. As always, I'll  be monitoring the totality of the data and what it implies for the achievement  of our goals.\n\nTo  paraphrase the wise philosopher Yoda, \"A little more knowledge lights  our way.\"",

    "text": "Hello,  everyone. I'm really pleased to be joining your meeting today. Your work in bringing  together leaders and visionaries in support of Black communities across our  city is invaluable.\n\nWe're  approaching the one-year mark since the pandemic took hold. At this time last  year there was an increasing sense of fear and uncertainty about the future. And  the events since then have posed tremendous challenges to families, communities,  and the economy. The ongoing human toll is a tragedy we won't forget in our  lifetimes.\n\nWhat  has been an extraordinary public health crisis also has had profound  consequences for the American and global economies. The cause of this  recession—a global pandemic—means that our economic future will be determined  in large part by the path of the virus and our collective success in overcoming  it.\n\nWe  still face many hurdles on the road to recovery from both COVID-19 and the  severe economic hardship that has ensued. A lot depends on the success in  quickly getting a large part of the public vaccinated against a backdrop of the  spread of emerging new strains of the virus.\n\nDespite  these challenges and uncertainties, I have become more optimistic about the medium-term  outlook for the economy. I don't expect our lives to look like they did a year  ago—our sense of \"normal\" may be forever altered—but with vaccinations well underway  and a significant decline nationwide in confirmed new cases, I do expect that  we can start to look toward a time that will be \"more like normal.\"\n\nIn  my remarks today I'll set the scene for the economic picture locally, and for the  U.S. economy as a whole. I'll also highlight some of the disparities we are  seeing in the labor market. Finally, I'll share more about the Federal Reserve's  response and how I view the path forward.\n\nBefore  I continue, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDual Mandate\n\nPrior  to sharing the outlook, I think it's important to take a step back and explain some  of the key factors that my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve consider in  reaching our policy decisions. The Fed has what we call a \"dual mandate,\" which  are two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWith  these goals in mind, our focus is understanding developments that affect labor  markets, inflation, and economic growth. But we also collect and analyze  enormous amounts of other information, both in the form of data and reports  from members of the communities we serve, to help us assess the state of the  economy and inform our decision-making.\n\nThe Economic  Outlook\n\nI'll  start off with the most common measure of the overall economy: gross domestic  product, or GDP. I expect inflation-adjusted, or real, GDP to rebound sharply  this year. Indeed, with strong federal fiscal support and continued progress on  vaccination, GDP growth this year could be the strongest we've seen in decades.  Such a robust rebound would be very welcome after the toughest period for the  economy in living memory and a winter where the pandemic has been particularly severe.\n\nThe  resurgence of COVID-19 over the past few months caused consumers to pull back  on spending, resulting in significant job losses in some sectors—especially in  leisure and hospitality. In past recessions, we have typically seen a decline  in manufacturing jobs, while the service sector—establishments like hotels,  bars, and restaurants—was not affected to the same extent. But the pandemic has  flipped the script in that regard. Indeed, this time, both the manufacturing  and housing sectors have rebounded sharply since last spring, while much of the  service sector remains depressed.\n\nThe  pandemic has had a truly devastating effect on employment. Overall, as of  January of this year, we are down nearly 10 million jobs from the pre-pandemic  level, a greater shortfall than we saw even at the worst point of the aftermath  of the Great Recession.\n\nLocally,  we've experienced considerable strain, given that much of New York City's economy  hinges on the leisure and hospitality industry. Job losses have been dramatic: New  York was hardest hit at the start of the pandemic, and almost a year later the  data still show a city under stress. While national employment was 7 percent  below pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2020, employment in New York City was  12 percent lower. 1 I hope that as workers return to their offices and the weather turns warmer we  will start to see people frequenting the small businesses that are the  lifeblood of our city.\n\nUnfortunately,  job losses have not been only highly concentrated in particular industries, but  also more concentrated among certain demographic groups. The pandemic and the ensuing economic downturn have done disproportionate  harm to women, communities of color, younger workers, and the lowest paid. 2\n\nThe  data are particularly sobering when we look at communities of color. Recent  research by my colleagues at the New York Fed shows that more Black and  Hispanic workers lost jobs compared to white workers, and Black workers have  been more likely to drop out of the labor force entirely, making it more  challenging to rejoin in the future. 3 The Black-white  unemployment gap, which had reached historical lows in 2019, widened  considerably during the spring and summer, undoing much of the progress of the past  decade. While the gap has narrowed some since, closing this gap further will be  an important part of a full recovery.\n\nBlack-owned businesses have also  suffered disproportionately. 4 A report released by the New York Fed in August found that Black-owned  businesses have been almost twice as likely to shutter during COVID-19 as  white-owned firms. 5\n\nA key area of our focus is to better understand what  contributes to economic inequities and to finding solutions. 6 Through our  economic research and outreach efforts, we are working to understand how racial  disparities play out in the labor market, and what can be done to change these  outcomes.\n\nNow  I'll turn to inflation, the other half of our dual mandate. Although we have  seen swings in some prices from the effects of COVID, overall the inflation rate  has been running below our 2 percent goal. With our economy and the global  economy still far below full strength, I expect underlying inflationary  pressures to remain subdued for some time. An encouraging sign is that measures  of longer-run inflation expectations have retraced earlier declines as the  economic outlook has brightened and are now at levels seen a few years ago. As  the economy fully heals and reaches maximum employment over the next few years,  I expect inflation will sustainably move to levels consistent with our 2  percent longer-run goal.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nWhile  the short-term outlook for the economy is highly uncertain, the longer-term picture  is more favorable. With the ongoing vaccine rollout, more people will be able  to travel, eat out, and shop in person safely.\n\nIn  addition, the fiscal package enacted in December provides much-needed support  to households and businesses until vaccinations are more widespread. Moreover,  additional measures are currently being discussed in the Congress. Fiscal  support, combined with highly favorable financial conditions and steady  progress on vaccinations, are all reasons to be optimistic the economy will  experience a strong recovery this year.\n\nBut  the speed of the recovery will also depend on the global picture. We are seeing  a slower rollout of immunizations in parts of Europe and a more subdued rebound  in other parts of the world, which will have an effect on the United States. In  addition, the emergence of new strains of the virus could slow the path to a  post-COVID world.\n\nOur Response\n\nGiven  all the factors I mentioned earlier, in January the FOMC decided to maintain  the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to ¼ percent. The FOMC  stated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range  until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with its  assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is  on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. 7 In addition, the Federal  Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at  least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at  least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made  toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nIn  other words: Despite uncertainties, we are fully committed to supporting the  economy through this period and reaching our maximum employment and price  stability goals. We will continue to watch and learn and remain committed to  using our full range of tools to help assure that the recovery will be as  robust as possible.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll  conclude with this: Despite the progress so far in recovering from the  recession, some of the numbers that I've shared are staggering. Families,  businesses, and communities are struggling. Almost a year into the pandemic,  there is still so much uncertainty.\n\nBut  despite the near-term challenges, the longer-term outlook for the economy has  improved, and our actions of the past year position monetary policy well to support  a strong, full recovery and achievement of our goals of maximum employment and  price stability. With this progress in mind, I am hopeful for a time soon that  looks \"more like normal.\"\n\nThank  you.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood  afternoon. It’s a privilege to speak at this lecture series in honor of Professor  Suresh Tendulkar, the esteemed economist and policymaker. And I’m pleased to be  here with my counterparts at the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nWe all operate  in a highly interconnected global economy. So, meeting with and learning from  central bankers and other experts from around the world is an important part of  my job. Many of the issues we face are unique, but many are similar, too.\n\nOne  theme that spans the globe has to do with managing the “known unknowns” of monetary  policy. Alan Greenspan, the former Chair of the Federal Reserve, once said: “Uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the  monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that  landscape.” 1\n\nThat  certainly sums up our experience since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic four  and a half years ago. And uncertainty will continue to be the defining  characteristic of the monetary policy landscape for the foreseeable future.  This is especially true as we face issues like artificial intelligence, climate  change, deglobalization, and innovations in the financial system—not to mention  the perennial challenges of measuring the so-called star variables such as  r-star.\n\nToday,  I’m going to discuss several key principles that are at the heart of inflation  targeting strategies and have proven foundational and invaluable in managing extreme  uncertainty. These include accountability, transparency, and well-anchored  inflation expectations. While my remarks in important ways are based on the  experience of the U.S., these principles have much broader application in  preparing policymakers for an uncertain future.\n\nBefore  I go further, I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I  express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Pandemic Shocks\n\nTo  start today’s discussion, I want to set the context by illustrating the impact  of just one facet of the extraordinary shocks and extreme uncertainty we’ve  faced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, I’ll look at the  path of the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which gauges global  supply-chain disruptions. 2\n\nIn the  spring of 2020, this index shot up to a level more than three standard  deviations above its historical average. That fall, it plummeted to normal  levels. By late 2021, it rose to more than four standard deviations  above the historical average. It finally returned to normal levels last year.\n\nTo put  the rarity of such events in perspective, a single four-standard-deviation  event would occur about once every 2,500 years based on a standard normal  distribution.\n\nGlobal supply-chain  disruptions, along with acute imbalances between supply and demand exacerbated  by Russia’s war on Ukraine, caused inflation to skyrocket around the world. Inflation  began to rise in 2021, peaking at over 7 percent in the U.S. in June 2022, 3 the highest rate recorded  in over 40 years. It followed a similar pattern in most OECD economies. But its  trajectories were different across Asia. For example, in India, inflation was mostly  fueled by rising food prices.\n\nWhile  there are important differences in the sources of inflation, many central banks—including  the Reserve Bank of India—have been faced with the same issue: How to restore  price stability at a time when so many parts of our economies are spinning in  unpredictable ways?\n\nOwning the Responsibility\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we did this by  relying on central tenets of inflation targeting practiced in the U.S. and many  other countries. In  particular, I will emphasize three key principles that contributed to a  prolonged period of price stability in the U.S. during the quarter century  leading up to the pandemic. 4\n\nThe  first principle is responsibility: Central banks must own  the responsibility to deliver price stability and have independence to act to  achieve it.\n\nThis is  a shift in thinking in many economies from prior decades, particularly the  1970s. During that time, many central bankers believed monetary policy could  only play a minor role in reducing inflation. Others thought lowering inflation  was completely outside of their control. 5 This led to finger-pointing and confusion about whose job it was to restore  price stability. The end result was persistent high inflation and economic  stagnation.\n\nBut history  taught us that central banks can be more successful at delivering sustainably  low inflation when they are accountable and independent. 6 , 7 Today, regardless of  economic shocks, changes in fiscal policy, or globalization and deglobalization  swings, central banks recognize that attaining and maintaining price stability  is their job to do.\n\nIn the  U.S., this responsibility is crystal clear. 8 Price stability and maximum employment together make up the FOMC's dual mandate.  When inflation rose persistently above our target, we acted decisively to bring  inflation back down.\n\nCommitment to  Transparency\n\nThe  second principle that helped us manage the known unknowns is transparency—including  the clear communication of a central bank’s strategy, policy decisions, and an  explicit numerical longer-run inflation target.\n\nFor  central banks, transparency enhances accountability and keeps them clearly focused  on achieving their goals. For households and businesses, an explicit and  credible inflation target helps take some of the uncertainty off the table so  they can focus on planning for their future without having to worry about what  will happen to inflation. By improving the public’s understanding of a central  bank’s goals and actions, the central bank can enhance the effectiveness of  monetary policy at stabilizing inflation and the economy. 9 , 10 , 11\n\nFor the  Federal Reserve, these concepts—including a 2 percent longer-run inflation  target—are outlined in the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary  Policy Strategy, which it first announced in January 2012. 12 In public communications  throughout this latest inflationary episode, the FOMC has clearly,  consistently, and repeatedly emphasized its strong commitment to its 2 percent  inflation target, as well as its monetary policy strategy and decisions to  achieve that goal. 13\n\nInflation  is now around 2-1/2 percent, so we have seen significant progress in bringing it  down. But we still have a way to go to reach our 2 percent target on a  sustained basis. We are committed to getting the job done.\n\nImportance of Inflation  Expectations\n\nThe third  key principle is well-anchored inflation expectations. This principle has  become a bedrock of modern central banking, as economic analysis and history  have shown that anchoring inflation expectations is important in maintaining low  and stable inflation. 14 , 15\n\nIt is  now evident that in the 1960s and 1970s, both short- and longer-term inflation  expectations in the U.S. became unmoored, rising as actual inflation rose. 16 This made it even more  difficult for policymakers to maintain stable prices amid the shocks of that  period.\n\nIn  contrast, well-anchored inflation expectations short-circuit so-called  second-round effects in wage and price setting that exacerbate and prolong the  effects of shocks like we saw during the 1970s. They also create a more  favorable short-run trade-off in balancing inflation and employment objectives. 17\n\nCentral  banks help anchor expectations by owning the responsibility to deliver price  stability, publicly committing to an explicit inflation target, and taking the  actions needed to ensure price stability. The  connections between policy communications and actions, inflation outcomes, and  expectations are at the core of policy strategies that are robust to extreme  uncertainty, a topic that Athanasios Orphanides and I studied in a sequence of  research papers. 18\n\nUnlike the stylized textbook model of  monetary policy, this approach recognizes the high degree of uncertainty in the  economy. It also views the anchoring of expectations, or the lack thereof, as  the outcome of monetary policy actions and communications. We show that when  uncertainty is extreme, policies that are focused on keeping inflation near  target—and do not rely too much on hard-to-measure variables like the natural  rates of unemployment and interest—perform well at stabilizing inflation and  unemployment.\n\nSo, what do well-anchored inflation  expectations look like? In practice, short- and, to some extent, medium-term  expectations will be sensitive to economic shocks, rising and falling as  inflation increases and moderates, even with well-anchored expectations. But if  a central bank has credibility in achieving price stability, longer-term  expectations should remain consistent with its inflation target, and the  deviation of short- and medium-run expectations from levels consistent with the  target should be temporary. 19\n\nWe saw this pattern reflected in the data  from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations. As inflation started  to rise in 2021, medium- and particularly short-term expectations increased  considerably. But despite the severity of the shocks, longer-term inflation  expectations remained remarkably stable and close to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. 20 Medium-term expectations returned to pre-pandemic levels  in 2022. And short-term expectations followed suit in 2023.\n\nWhen the Facts Change\n\nOur  three principles provide a strong framework to manage shocks and uncertainty.  But they are not meant to be overly prescriptive on tactics. In monetary policy, it’s important to be nimble in  execution even as one is steady in strategy.\n\nAs John Maynard Keynes  is often credited with saying, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What  do you do, sir?”\n\nHere  again, anchored in clear longer-run goals and strategy, communication is key.\n\nPolicymakers  base their decisions on the totality of the data. When the facts dictate a  change, it’s crucial to discuss the reasons behind the changes and explain how  we anticipate the economy will evolve. The FOMC does this through  its post-meeting statements, the Chair’s press conferences, the quarterly Summary  of Economic Projections, detailed FOMC meeting minutes, and policymaker  speeches.\n\nUncertainty in the Years  Ahead\n\nI have  talked about how the key tenets of inflation targeting—ownership  of price stability and independence of action, transparency about goals and  strategy, and a focus on anchored inflation expectations—have served us well in  managing the extreme shocks and uncertainty of the past four and a half years.  But uncertainty does not only dwell in the past.\n\nDespite the very best efforts of economists  and others to understand how the economic environment is changing and what it  means for monetary policy, we must accept that uncertainty will continue to  define the future.  These principles and lessons provide a strong foundation for monetary policy  that is robust to uncertainty. And I am confident they will continue to serve  us well against any challenges and uncertainties we may face ahead.",

    "text": "Good  morning, and welcome. We are pleased that so many of you have joined us today for  this important discussion about food insecurity.\n\nIt  is not lost on me that we are holding this event just five days after  Thanksgiving, a holiday that is largely centered around food—the turkey, the  stuffing, the mashed potatoes, the pumpkin pie. For some of us, the big concern  coming out of the weekend was whether we had eaten too much. But for far too  many, the much bigger concern is that they and their families did not—and still  do not—have enough to eat.\n\nThat's  what brings us here today. Our mission at the New York Fed is to make the  economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all. But we can't  have a healthy economy without a healthy workforce. And that is why  health—along with household financial well-being and climate change—is a focal  point for our Community Development team.\n\nBefore  I continue, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFood  insecurity has long been a systemic problem. Here in the Federal Reserve's  Second District, many households in both our urban and rural communities are  vulnerable financially. And since the onset of the pandemic, access to quality,  nutritious food has been greatly impeded. After many businesses were forced to  shut down in the spring of 2020, food banks were quickly overwhelmed. In addition to an  abrupt increase in need, there was also the challenge of distribution. I'm sure  many of you remember the long lines to food pantries that stretched through  neighborhoods. And many of our schools shifted from providing free lunches to  students to offering grab-and-go meals to entire families.\n\nNow,  we are facing another economic challenge: higher food prices. Transportation  and labor costs—along with supply-chain disruptions—are driving up the price of  many staples, such as beef, poultry, eggs, peanut butter, and produce. Food is  not only becoming far more expensive for families, but also for food banks—which,  at the same time, are reporting fewer donations.\n\nThe result  of all of this is that food insecurity is becoming more widespread—and more  difficult to resolve. The ripple effects expand across the economy, as food  insecurity drives economic inequality, which in turn is a barrier to  cultivating a healthy workforce. And a healthy workforce is what we need to  keep our economy strong.\n\nAt  the New York Fed—and across the Federal Reserve System—one of our key areas of  focus is to better understand the economic drivers and social determinants of  health. We have been hosting a series of events that bring together experts on  economic inequality and the needs of low- and moderate-income communities in  our District. Today's event on food insecurity is part of that larger effort.\n\nBut we  recognize it's not enough to merely study the issue. The role of our Community  Development team is to champion promising solutions by connecting people,  programs, and proposals with funding. Up to 40 percent of food produced in the  United States goes to waste each year, so there is a huge opportunity to  distribute that unused food to those who need it. You'll be hearing more about  that later today.\n\nBut  first, we'll start off with a presentation from Professor Tashara Leak. She'll  frame the discussion by talking about how food insecurity affects the health of  children—and how that, in turn, shapes their economic prospects as they grow  older.\n\nThen,  we'll convene a panel of business and government leaders, along with impact investors,  who will spotlight some of the innovative work being done to make healthy and  affordable food more accessible.\n\nThank  you all for joining us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Professor Leak.",

    "text": "When plans for the New York Fed’s headquarters here at 33  Liberty Street  were developed in 1921, the building committee compiled 33 pages of  requirements for potential architects. 1 I  can assure you that our appreciation for bureaucracy has endured the test of  time!\n\nJoking  aside, the focus of many of those requirements was specifications for the building’s  gold vault. Beneath our feet lies a triple-tiered vault system with 122 separate  compartments for storing gold bars. For those of you who are Harry Potter fans,  it’s as close to Gringotts Bank as you’ll find anywhere in the world—although  for security reasons I am not allowed to confirm or deny that we have a dragon  down there.\n\nThe  whole building was constructed around the vault. Engineers had to excavate 117  feet down to the bedrock for a foundation that could support the weight of the  construction.\n\nWhy  am going into so much depth about the gold? There is a reason!\n\nBut  before I explain, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I  express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhen  the building was planned and constructed during the early part of the twentieth  century, the gold was seen as a real vulnerability. It was conceivable that  someone would try to rob the Bank and steal the gold.\n\nThe  only time that’s happened was in the Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 3, which, to  be clear, was only a movie!\n\nA  lot of that owes to the skill of the architects of the building, and the law  enforcement who protect it. But the other reason is that the risks we face  today in 2019 look very different to the ones we were planning for in 1921.\n\nFor  a thief today, it’s easier to use a laptop to buy some stolen credit card  details online and commit fraud than it is to plan a Hollywood-style bank  heist.\n\nAnd  that’s what I’m going to say a few words about—the changing nature of  risk—before handing over to this evening’s keynote speaker, John Dugan, Chair of  Citigroup.\n\nIn  previous decades it was easier to identify risk and what to do about it. You  could see it, measure it, and fortify against it. But, as the world has changed,  so have the risks that demand our attention and our resources. The new risks  are harder to predict and inherently ambiguous: Steel and concrete can do  little to protect us.\n\nOur  reliance on technology means we need to think differently about cyber risk. The  importance of innovation and intellectual property means we need to look for  new approaches to talent and culture. And the threat posed by climate change means we need to give serious consideration to the resilience of our physical and digital infrastructure.\n\nThe  New York Fed has the appearance of an historic institution, but behind the  stone façade we’re grappling with these issues in the same way that you are. In  our economic research, our supervision of financial institutions, the payments  systems we operate, in short – in all that we do.\n\nTalent,  technology, and innovation challenge us every day. They create incredible  opportunity, but they also test us by exposing new vulnerabilities.\n\nI  know that over the next couple of days there will be lots of valuable insights  shared by experts about how to handle the challenges posed by big data,  cryptocurrency, and climate change.\n\nBut  first, to kick off the conference, it’s my pleasure to introduce John Dugan,  Chair of Citigroup. Citigroup has operations in over 150 countries, with about  200 million customer accounts worldwide. 2 As  head of a global employer with complex, international operations, John is no  stranger to the changing nature of risk.\n\nJohn  became Chair of Citigroup at the start of this year. Prior to that he was chair  of the Financial Institutions Group at the law firm Covington & Burling  LLP, where he spent much of his career. He has also held a number of public  sector roles, including Comptroller of the Currency during a critical time for  our financial system and economy, from 2005-2010.\n\nI’m  looking forward to his insights and I know they will be the catalyst for some  rich discussion.\n\nPlease  join me in welcoming John Dugan.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning everyone. I wish every conference I went to had such an incredible opening—Joe’s certainly a hard act to follow. I have a son who’s a very talented artist, but he didn’t get those genes from me. So I’m going to stick to what I know—monetary policy.\n\nToday I’ll talk about the economy, how I’m assessing the outlook, and what that means for monetary policy. It’s early in the day, so I’ll try and keep the recitation of facts and figures to a minimum. But I know there are a lot of bankers in the room and that the direction of interest rates plays a vital role in your business, so, rest assured, I won’t skimp on that topic.\n\nGiven that I’ve promised to talk about interest rates, before I say another word I’ll give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nI want to start this morning by reminding everyone what the goals of the Federal Reserve are. It’s easy to think of the Fed as just setting interest rates, and of course that’s a major part of what we do. But we do so in order to achieve two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. In Fed-speak it’s called the dual mandate.\n\nThere are serious debates taking place amongst economists and policymakers about what maximum employment actually looks like, and they probably deserve another speech of their own. But I promised not to deluge you with numbers, so I’ll focus on a few highlights.\n\nThe unemployment rate last year averaged just under 4 percent, the lowest such annual figure since 1969. The latest jobs numbers also showed very strong growth, with over 2.6 million jobs added last year. The ongoing strength in the labor market has led to encouraging gains in wages. No matter how you cut it, the labor market is strong, consistent with our maximum employment goal.\n\nWhen we say price stability, our goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent. 1 Those of you who are of my generation will remember the runaway inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. Obviously that’s something we must avoid repeating. But the challenge of more recent years actually hasn’t been too high inflation. Instead, it’s been inflation that’s persistently too low . Over the past decade, inflation has more often than not come in below our goal.\n\nBut things are looking better. Underlying measures of inflation have been running just below 2 percent over the past 12 months, and I expect them to be right at 2 percent this year. And I don’t see any worrying signs of inflationary pressures building. So, from the perspective of the Fed’s dual mandate as a whole, things are looking very good.\n\nOf course, for this healthy jobs market and low and stable inflation to persist, we need solid growth in the economy. While GDP growth in 2018 looks to have been a robust 3 percent, we’re hearing anxiety both in the markets and the commentary, about what’s to come in 2019.\n\nI wish I could now tell you with certainty what will happen to the economy, but anyone who promises they can see into the future is a charlatan. However, what I can do is provide you with some insight into how I assess the health of the economy and what that means for my view on the monetary policy decisions before us.\n\nData Dependent\n\nI often say I’m data dependent, and I’ve talked about the major economic indicators, GDP growth, inflation, and employment. But these headline numbers aren’t the only things that inform my view on monetary policy, or the economy more broadly. I’m looking at a whole raft of information about what’s going on and where risks may be lurking.\n\nEmployment and unemployment numbers provide a useful summary measure of what’s happening in the labor market. But “data” doesn’t stop there. There are many sources of information on labor market conditions that I regularly consult. They range from very granular data that zero in on individuals’ experiences in the labor market, to indices of job openings, how many people are quitting their jobs, and labor market participation, to name a few.\n\nBut it’s not just these hard numbers that matter. I also find surveys of households and businesses provide valuable and timely perspectives about economic conditions. For example, there’s a questionnaire that asks people whether jobs are “hard to get.” It’s helpful because it gives the perceptions of normal people (and not economists!) about whether there are a lot of open positions. This survey continues to report that it’s relatively easy to find work, which is a very good sign about the strength of the economy. 2\n\nBeyond the economic data and surveys, financial market indicators are a critical source of up-to-the minute information on how investors view the economy. In addition, stock prices and interest rates affect the spending decisions of households and businesses, and the value of the dollar affects demand for exports and imports, so these are important factors shaping the economy’s trajectory.\n\nMore broadly, I look at a wealth of data on international financial market developments and banking conditions, which feed into my understanding of the global outlook.\n\nFinally, and perhaps least well known, I spend a great deal of time speaking with members of the public, at our Board and Advisory Group meetings, community and business leader forums, and events like today’s. I get immense value from their insights, whether it’s the challenges they face in filling positions, their plans for capital investments, or how global developments are influencing their decisions. These discussions provide a huge amount of detail and texture to the economic picture. One of the great strengths of the Federal Reserve System is our extensive networks of contacts in our communities, and we share what we learn from these conversations when we meet at the FOMC.\n\nBeing \"data dependent\" means taking this holistic view when thinking about the economy and monetary policy. Not all of these types of data draw headlines the way shifts in the stock market do, but together they provide a much richer and more complete depiction of what’s happening. And they also tell me whether the signals we’re getting from the markets are reflected in the economy as a whole.\n\n2018 Tailwinds\n\nIn thinking about where the economy is heading, it’s worth reflecting on where we were 12 months ago.\n\nAt the start of last year the message I was getting—from business leaders, economic data, and the markets—was one of overwhelming positivity. This reflected three tailwinds: strong global growth, fiscal stimulus, and quite accommodative financial conditions. Each of these was giving the economy an extra boost. Indeed, these tailwinds provided even more of a boost over most of 2018 than forecasters had anticipated.\n\nFast forward 12 months and indicators in Europe and Asia point to less optimism about global growth. The initial lift from the fiscal stimulus will likely wane over the course of this year. And financial conditions have become less accommodative over the past several months. In addition, we are now seeing some emerging headwinds to growth from the partial government shutdown in the United States and elevated geopolitical uncertainties abroad.\n\nOther “data” confirm that the winds in our sails have calmed. The headlines have been about investors’ concerns around growth, which have contributed to volatility in markets. This is also showing through in surveys of households and businesses, who say that they are somewhat less confident about future economic prospects. For example, the latest Empire State Manufacturing Survey and New York Fed Business Leaders Survey both point to slowing growth in the region. And there is no doubt that my colleagues and I are hearing the same thing directly from our business and financial market contacts, who are more focused on the possibility of a weaker economic outlook this year. 3\n\nBut let me be clear: a softer economic outlook doesn’t mean we should prepare for doom and gloom. On the contrary, it’s likely we’ll see GDP growth somewhere between 2 and 2½ percent this year. That’s a step down from 2018, but still consistent with a healthy, growing economy.\n\nSupporting a Strong Economy\n\nSo, how should the Fed respond to an outlook of slowing growth and one that’s less certain than, say, this time last year? In a word: carefully.\n\nAt the start of 2018, when the economy was growing well above trend and interest rates still were still quite low, gradually raising rates was the obvious and necessary choice. Twelve months later, the tailwinds have lost their gust, interest rates are closer to normal levels, and inflation is tame. The approach we need is one of prudence, patience, and good judgment. The motto of “data dependence” is more relevant than ever.\n\nIf growth continues to come in well above sustainable levels, somewhat higher interest rates may well be called for at some point. However, if conditions turn out to be less robust, then I will adjust my policy views accordingly.\n\nI assure you that I have my eyes wide open and my ear to the ground when it comes to thinking about how the economic outlook will unfold in the year ahead, and as ever I’ll be guided by the data in all its forms.\n\nThe Balance Sheet\n\nAside from my views on interest rates, the other issue I get asked about is the normalization of the balance sheet. When we first announced our plans in June 2017, I was poised to expound on them in great detail. 4 But when I raised the topic I was sorely disappointed to be met with glazed eyes and general indifference. Sadly, nobody seemed to care!\n\nNow that’s changed, and I’m getting more interest on this topic.\n\nIt’s important to remember why the Fed took unconventional monetary policy actions in the first place. Large-scale asset purchases, forward guidance on the future path of interest rates, and seven years where the federal funds rate hovered close to zero, were all measures necessary for the full recovery from the Great Recession.\n\nA decade later and the FOMC has slowly but surely been moving monetary policy “back to normal.” We’ve moved interest rates closer to neutral, scaled back on forward guidance, and are over a year into the process of winding down the balance sheet. 5\n\nOur goals throughout the policy normalization process have been twofold. First and foremost, to support a strong, sustainable expansion of the economy. Second, to do this in a predictable and transparent way that creates as little disruption as possible. 6 So far, this plan has worked very well, with the economic expansion nearing record duration.\n\nBut it is important to stress that if circumstances change, I will reassess our choices regarding monetary policy, including the path of balance sheet normalization. Data dependence applies to all that we do. And, as always, if the outlook deteriorates in a material way, we stand prepared to deploy all our policy tools as appropriate in support of the economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’d like to conclude where I began, with the dual mandate. There’s sometimes a view that Fed policymakers are fixated on two data points: inflation and employment. And the reason is that’s how we’re judged by Congress at doing our job.\n\nBut underpinning these is a strong economy, and ultimately that’s what we’re always using monetary policy to support. So, as the year unfolds I’ve got my eyes wide open, looking at the data and listening to experience—whether it’s coming from household surveys, market indicators, or from leaders in my District.\n\nThe economy is strong, the outlook is healthy, and my number one priority is using monetary policy to keep it that way. In short, I’m watching, listening, and prepared to adjust my views depending on the data.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon. It’s a  privilege to be a part of the celebration of Banco de México’s Centennial. I  was especially honored when Governor Rodriguez asked me to discuss a favorite  topic of mine—and one that economists have obsessed over for even longer than a  century. Of course, I am talking about r-star, the natural rate of interest.\n\nWhat’s fascinating about  variables like r-star is that while they are unobservable, they go to the very  heart of monetary theory and practice. Just as the septillion stars we cannot  see are vital to the existence of the universe, the constellation of economic stars  is critical to our understanding of the economic universe we inhabit.\n\nToday I will address three  questions pertaining to the importance, measurement, and use of time-varying unobservable  variables at central banks. While I will focus primarily on r-star, I should  emphasize from the start that most of what I’ll talk about is applicable to a  range of variables—including the closely related u-star and y-star.\n\nMy remarks will center around the stars  from a “longer-run” perspective—that is, the “normal” values expected to  prevail after cyclical fluctuations have fully played out and the economy is  expanding at its trend rate in the absence of upward or downward pressures on  inflation.\n\nBefore I go further,  I’ll provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are  mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or any others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhy Central Banks Care\n\nI’ll start with the  first question: If r-star, u-star, and y-star cannot be observed or directly measured,  why do central banks care so much about them? Are they too abstract and elusive  to be of practical value?\n\nThe short answer is that  they play a central role in macroeconomic theory and have important  implications for the conduct of monetary policy. R-star is the real short-term  interest rate that is expected to prevail when the economy is at full strength  and inflation is stable. Y-star is potential GDP. And u-star is the level of  unemployment when an economy is at its potential. When the stars perfectly  align, it means the economy has reached an equilibrium where its resources are  fully utilized. As seen in Figure 1 , y-star and r-star tell us what the economy  looks like in that equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the star  variables provide key benchmarks for the economy and, in the case of r-star,  the stance of monetary policy. 1 This role of the stars is  nicely illustrated by the Taylor rule, which stipulates that the interest rate  should depend on the inflation rate, the deviation of output from y-star, and r-star. 2 In addition, r-star has another  important implication for monetary policy: A low r-star implies the economy can  encounter more frequent and longer periods when monetary policy is constrained  by the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, potentially impeding  the achievement of a central bank’s inflation goals and other macroeconomic objectives. 3\n\nUncertainty Clouds the Sky\n\nThe central role of the  natural rate of interest has long been recognized by leading monetary theorists  ever since the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell wrote about it in 1898. 4 And in the 1960s, the  concepts of y-star and u-star gained attention in the context of macroeconomic  stabilization policy. 5\n\nThrough the decades,  economists routinely stressed that natural rates are neither fixed in time nor  easy to discern. 6 Regarding r-star, the economist John H. Williams said in 1931 that “the natural  rate is an abstraction; like faith, it is seen by its works.” 7 Milton Friedman noted in  1968 that economists had yet to devise a method to accurately estimate both the  natural rate of interest and unemployment, observing that “the ‘natural’ rate  will itself change from time to time.” 8 And in our paper on  estimating r-star and y-star, Thomas Laubach and I concluded with: “Estimates  of a time-varying natural rate of interest, like those of the natural rates of  unemployment and output, are very imprecise and are subject to considerable  real-time mismeasurement.” 9 The uncertainty surrounding  the stars is not a failure of theory or data. Rather, it is inherent to the problem  of estimating a time-varying, potentially nonstationary, unobserved variable in  a dynamic and constantly changing global economy.\n\nThis uncertainty  complicates policymaking in practice. Figure 2 updates a chart from my work  with Athanasios Orphanides that illustrates this challenge. 10 It compares real-time and  retrospective estimates of the natural rate of unemployment in the United  States for 1960 to 2025. Gaps between real-time and ex post estimates of u-star  have been sizable and highly persistent. And this comparison likely understates  the problem for policymakers because even with hindsight, we lack 20/20 vision  of the stars.\n\nThe challenges in  measuring natural rates can have profound policy and economic consequences. Indeed,  monetary policymakers’ overreliance on what turned out to be mistaken views of  natural rates contributed to poor macroeconomic performance and unmooring of  inflation expectations in the U.S. during the late 1960s and 1970s. 11\n\nMeasuring the Stars\n\nSo, given the uncertainty  around the stars, how do central banks measure them?\n\nThere is a large  existing literature on measuring y- and u-star, so I will devote my limited  time to measuring r-star. This issue gained in importance in the 1990s when  people started using versions of the Taylor rule for monetary policy analysis. The  original Taylor rule assumed r-star was 2 percent, which prompted a number of  natural questions—pardon the pun—from policymakers: Is 2 percent the right  number? Does it change over time? And how would we know? 12 These questions also led  to a surge of research on these topics, including my own.\n\nTo infer r-star from  data, three approaches have emerged: 1) using a statistical method to extract a  longer-run trend, 2) basing it on financial market or survey data, and 3) looking  at r-star’s effects on economic data. 13 Each potentially provides  useful information, but each also poses significant challenges.\n\nAs shown in one of my  papers with Thomas Laubach, univariate statistical methods such as the HP  filter generally do not provide reliable measures of r-star. In particular, these  estimates can be overly influenced by large macroeconomic disturbances, such as  the inflation of the 1970s or the pandemic. 14\n\nFinancial market and  survey data are more promising sources of information in that they can tell us  what people think about r-star. That said, market participants face the same  challenges in measuring the stars that economists do, and therefore they do not  really serve as truly independent sources of information on r-star. This is  what I have referred to as a “hall of mirrors.” 15 Indeed, market- and  survey-based measures can give a false sense of precision since the reported  values do not convey the uncertainty underlying them.\n\nIn addition, financial  market measures of r-star are contaminated by liquidity and risk premiums,  making a direct read of “what the markets think” elusive. Various term  structure models have been developed that aim to provide a better measure of  r-star, but these estimates can vary widely. 16 In any case, recent  research suggests that market-based measures have not been better predictors of  future interest rates than model estimates, and as such are not particularly  useful independent guides to r-star. 17\n\nThat  leaves us with model-based estimates of r-star that, in the spirit of the quote  from John H. Williams, aim to infer r-star by its “works”—that is, from its  effects on the economy. A variety of such models have been developed over the  past quarter century. Although they differ in details, the core assumption is  that aggregate demand depends in part on the difference between the real  interest rate and r-star. Thus, by observing the movements of demand, real  interest rates, and other relevant macroeconomic variables, one can infer the  likely value of r-star.\n\nWith open capital  markets, r-star is inherently a global phenomenon affected by global movements  in supply and demand for savings. For that reason, I will focus on global  trends affecting r-star rather than on differences across countries.\n\nModel-based estimates of  r-star in many countries exhibited a sizable downtrend over the quarter-century  leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic. 18 Figure 3 shows  GDP-weighted averages of estimates of trend GDP growth and r-star from the  Holston-Laubach-Willams (HLW) model for Canada, the Euro Area, the United  Kingdom, and the United States for 1986 to 2025. 19 A variety of factors  contributed to this decline in r-star, including fundamental shifts in  demographics and productivity growth.\n\nTwo powerful demographic  trends have affected r-star: People are generally living longer, and birth  rates are declining. Overall life expectancy in member countries of the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has increased dramatically  over the past several decades and is expected to grow further. At the same  time, falling birth rates have led to stalling population growth. For example,  among OECD economies, population growth averaged about 1 percent during the  1970s and 1980s, but it is now averaging about one-quarter of a percent per  year. And this figure is expected to turn negative in about 15 years. 20\n\nAmid these demographic  shifts, the growth in global labor productivity—the amount produced per worker  hour—has slowed. For example, productivity growth for the four economies shown  in Figure 2 decreased from about 2 percent over 1996 to 2005 to about 1 percent  over 2006 to 2023.\n\nThe combination of  slowdowns in population and productivity growth implies a slower rate of trend  GDP growth and therefore less demand for investment to support a growing  economy than before. This slowdown in trend growth of potential output is seen  in the HLW estimates shown in the figure. In addition, greater longevity boosts  the supply of savings as households build larger nest eggs for their longer  period of retirement.\n\nThe big question today  is whether the era of low r-star will endure. The global demographic and  productivity growth trends that pushed r-star down have not reversed. As seen  in the figure, the HLW estimates of trend growth for four economies remain relatively  low, similar to the levels that prevailed directly before the onset of the  pandemic.\n\nOf critical importance,  the GDP-weighted estimates of r-star for these four economies—Canada, the Euro Area,  the United Kingdom, and the United States—are around half of a percent, similar  to the comparable real-time estimates from the period prior to the onset of the  pandemic. 21 This finding that r-star has not meaningfully rebounded is in line with  evidence from a variety of models of r-star in the U.S., which show a  relatively modest increase of one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point in  real-time estimates of r-star between the third quarter of 2018 and the first  quarter of 2025. 22 Based on this evidence, the era of low r-star appears far from over.\n\nPutting the Stars to Work\n\nSo, I’ve talked about why  central banks care about star variables and how they measure them.\n\nNow I will address the  third and final question: How are star variables used by central banks?\n\nDespite the uncertainty  around these time-varying unobservablevariables, model-based estimates of  r-star, u-star, and y-star provide valuable information on how the economy and  interest rates will likely evolve over the medium term. And, as I mentioned, estimates of r-star are  foundational to considering the potential effects of the effective lower bound  and strategies to mitigate its effects. 23\n\nIn addition to their role in internal analysis, the stars  have increasingly become an aspect of central bank transparency and communication.  Transparency—including the clear communication of a central bank’s strategy and  reasoning behind policy decisions—is a key principle in conducting monetary  policy. As Alan Taylor  recently noted, “there is value for central banks in communicating  policymakers’ beliefs about the neutral interest rate whether it be some  collective view or that of any individual member.” 24\n\nMany central banks now regularly communicate their analyses  of star variables, including r-star, u-star, and y-star. For example, the Banco  de México, Riksbank, Norges Bank, and Central Bank of Brazil publish ranges of estimates  of r-star. 25 The  Bank of Canada and European Central Bank publish ranges of staff estimates. 26 And the FOMC publishes policymakers’ estimates of the natural rates of interest  and unemployment as part of the Summary of Economic Projections. 27\n\nAlthough these estimates  are useful for analysis and transparency, policymakers are well advised to  avoid placing too great confidence in precise estimates of the stars in making  real-world assessments and decisions. Given the wide range of uncertainties,  acting as if one knows the star variables when making policy can lead to  persistent deviations of inflation from the target that risk unmooring inflation  expectations. 28\n\nFortunately, research  has shown that approaches that don’t rely as much on estimates of starred  variables and instead “follow the data” perform well when uncertainty is very  high. One such approach is “difference rules,” where the short-term nominal  interest rate is raised or lowered in response to inflation and changes in  economic activity. Hybrid approaches that combine some aspects of the response  of Taylor-type rules and difference rules have been shown to perform well in  models in the presence of a wide range of uncertainties. 29 Of course, in the end, policy  decisions must be based on the totality of information and assessments,  including those related to risks. 30\n\nDon’t Give Up\n\nI’ll end my remarks where  I started. For over 125 years, economists have grappled with a dilemma: How can  a concept at the very heart of monetary theory be so vexing to quantify? The  star variables are either explicitly or implicitly at the core of any  macroeconomic model or framework one can imagine. Wishing away the economic stars  does not change that.\n\nIn that context, it is  important that we do our best to understand the factors that influence the  stars and the uncertainties related to them. In this way we can attain the best  understanding of the forces affecting the evolution of the economy and monetary  policy as we carry out our mandates.\n\nThese issues have been  challenging central bankers since even before the founding of Banco de México. For  the past quarter century, central banks have been at the forefront of this  research, and I very much hope that will continue. Thank you.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nLet me add my welcome to the New York Fed, and heartfelt thanks to  our speakers and panelists for an incredible afternoon. Over a few short hours,  we’ve heard about innovative strategies that will affect real people every day.  We’re all leaving this room with a list of action items, and now the real work  begins.\n\nBefore we close out the day, I want to share why identifying and  making missing markets is a way to better deliver investments to  under-resourced communities. And I’ll discuss why the New York Fed is the ideal  institution to convene this work.\n\nBefore I go on, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the  views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nWhat  Is a Missing Market?\n\nThe New York Fed is no stranger to “markets.” In fact, we  have whole floors of people in this building who are tasked with the unique  responsibility of carrying out the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy through our  global market operations. But those markets are not the topic of our conference  today.\n\nSo, what do we mean when we say that there are “missing” markets,  and why do we need to “make” them?\n\nAs my colleague David Erickson described at the start of our  program, many communities across this country experience a similar set of  vulnerabilities. There is a high correlation between gaps and deficiencies,  including those relating to climate, health, and economic investment.\n\nFortunately, there are sizable resources available to address  these vulnerabilities. Trillions of dollars in government grants and  philanthropic efforts are marked specifically for these purposes. There is a  great deal of research on these issues, and work is ongoing to identify  potential solutions. And networks and partnerships are actively pursuing a  variety of initiatives.\n\nDespite the availability of these resources and the good work  being done, there is something missing: effective cross-sector interventions are  more the exception than the rule. Efforts can often take the form of one-off  interventions that lack the adequate dose, duration, or intensity to significantly  improve conditions in the community. What’s missing is a holistic coordination and  deployment of resources to get at the causes of the vulnerabilities and their  interconnections. That’s why a key goal of today’s discussion has been to bring  together people who are focused on how to make this a practical, operational process.\n\nConnecting  Supply with Demand\n\nAs an economist, I naturally think about the missing market issue  through the lens of the most fundamental economic principle: supply and demand.\n\nA simple supply and demand curve appears as an “X,” with supply  and demand intersecting at some point in the middle. In the scenarios we’re  looking at, there’s a lot of supply on one axis, and a lot of demand on the  other. But finding the intersection point—the one that leads to the broadest  and most effective outcome—can be the biggest challenge.\n\nHere’s an example. A few years ago, as  part of my regional visit to the North Country area of New York, I spoke with leaders  who said that a lack of access to affordable broadband internet was causing a  deep digital divide. 1 High-speed internet is no longer a  luxury or a “want to have”; today, it’s essential for people and families for  things like telehealth appointments, online banking, remote work, schoolwork,  and more. 2 And unfortunately, access to broadband  services has been slow to reach many communities, especially in rural areas.\n\nIt’s a health  equity issue. It’s a workforce issue. It’s a banking issue. And it’s an  education issue. It’s all of the above and more.\n\nEven with the  support of billions of dollars made available under the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Deal, funding broadband is still a tremendous hurdle. Many  capital providers—including foundations, impact investors, private equity, and local  anchor institutions—have yet to fully understand the opportunity and benefit of  investing in community broadband. That’s why one working group—or “Design Team,”  as we are calling such groups—is seeking to create a new asset class for this  purpose. This way, we can show capital providers that each has a role to play  in the capital stack that could fund this missing market. In  essence, our goal is to plug these inputs into our supply and demand equation  and find exactly where “X” marks the spot.\n\nThe  New York Fed and “The Capital of the World”\n\nThe supply and demand framing explains why an economist is  speaking about missing markets. But why an economist at the New York Fed?\n\nOur mission is to make the U.S. economy stronger and the financial  system more stable for all segments of society. Our work around making missing  markets is not an extension of our mission—rather, it is an actualization of  it.\n\nLike the supply and demand curves, our community development  efforts are at the intersection of many of our institution’s critical roles.  Our team engages with a network of government and business leaders in our  region, as well as experts and practitioners at educational institutions and  nonprofit organizations. We rely on our leading economic research to inform our  understanding of the challenges and opportunities in these areas. And we are in  New York, which has an enormous supply of capital and expertise that can be  tapped in support of these efforts.\n\nOur work starts with raising awareness by detailing the Making Missing  Markets Initiative and publicizing our strategy. We recently released a report on  this as a precursor to today’s conference. 3 In  just one afternoon, we learned about climate and health challenges in the South  Bronx. We heard about incentivizing private equity to fund population health  and about the uniqueness of markets in tribal lands. And we explored the role  of secondary markets and CDFIs.\n\nThis is only the beginning. We’re mobilizing Design Teams of all  kinds—just like the one focused on broadband access—to enhance coordination of  public and private investment across issue areas. We’re highlighting  opportunities for additional private investment by banks and other investors.  And we’re monitoring and reporting the results so that we can learn to make  this work sustainable.\n\nThe  Jenga Tower\n\nI’ve said in the past that prosperity is like a Jenga tower. 4 Each individual piece matters to the stability of the entire structure. If one essential  piece is removed, the entire thing can collapse. We must not view issues in  isolation, but as interrelated and stacked one on top of another. This approach  will help communities tap into the funnel of funds that is out there.\n\nWe need to make the case to capital providers to view the benefits  as interconnected, too. The effects can be great, and everyone benefits in thriving,  opportunity-rich communities.\n\nToday’s meeting was just one data point in our larger strategy to  bring people together to partner on these efforts. As we continue to join  forces, we will find the missing intersection points that can build a better  economy for all.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. It’s a  pleasure be here to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Central  Bank of Chile. The topic of my remarks today is inflation targeting, which is  both an important part of Chile’s central banking history and a core foundation  of successful monetary policy.\n\nMost central banks  around the world have adopted inflation targeting regimes over the past 35  years, and Chile was among those leading the way. Although specifics vary  across jurisdictions, these strategies share three principles: independence and  accountability, transparency and the clear communication of an inflation target,  and well-anchored inflation expectations, gained from the credibility that central  banks build over time. 1\n\nToday I will discuss the  success of inflation targeting strategies in helping central banks achieve  price stability and better economic outcomes. I’ll also talk about how these  strategies were critically important in managing uncertainty after the onset of  the COVID-19 pandemic—and how they helped countries bring inflation down while  minimizing disruptions to financial markets and economies.\n\nBut first, I must give  the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and  do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAutonomy, Transparency, and Confidence\n\nInflation targeting is  like guiding an excursion through the Andes. Independence gives the central  bank the ability to choose the best path to meet its objectives. Transparency ensures  that people understand where they are headed and why the route may change. And a  central bank earns public confidence by consistently reaching its goals, even  amid sudden detours and a jagged course, laying the groundwork for maintaining well-anchored  inflation expectations.\n\nInflation targeting strategies  were introduced and have evolved as central banks sought to avoid repeating  prior mistakes. Too often in the past, some central banks behaved as if they  were powerless to control inflation in the face of shocks. Over time, they found  they could be more successful at delivering price stability when they owned the  responsibility for that goal and had the independence of action and tools to  achieve it.\n\nTransparency—including  clear communication of an explicit numerical inflation target—reinforces public  accountability for price stability and focuses the internal policy debate on  how best to attain that objective. The Central Bank of Chile established a 3  percent inflation target when it formally adopted its current framework in  1999. 2 And the Federal Reserve set  an inflation goal of 2 percent over the longer run, which it announced in an FOMC  statement in January 2012. 3\n\nBy communicating an  explicit inflation target—and then delivering inflation consistent with that goal—central  banks establish and reinforce trust with the public. But transparency does not  stop with declaring a destination. It also means describing the road ahead to  reach that goal. Many inflation-targeting central banks, including the Central  Bank of Chile, provide detailed analyses of their economic situations, outlooks,  and risks. 4\n\nTransparency about  goals, strategy, and what that means for policy helps to anchor inflation  expectations, which, in turn, contributes to low and stable inflation. 5 , 6 The feedback loop  between effective policy actions and communications, well-anchored  expectations, and price stability is now a core tenet of modern central  banking. It short-circuits so-called second-round effects in wage and price  setting that exacerbate and prolong the effects of shocks.\n\nPut to the Test\n\nInflation targeting  regimes were instrumental in bringing about a prolonged period of price stability  in many countries through 2020. But it wasn’t until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  that they were truly put to the test.\n\nThe pandemic, followed  by Russia’s war on Ukraine, dealt the most dramatic supply shocks to the world’s  economy in generations. Starting in 2021, global supply-chain disruptions,  along with acute imbalances between supply and demand, led to inflation  skyrocketing around the world. Inflation peaked at over 7 percent in the U.S. 7 and at over 14 percent in Chile. 8 Other Latin American  countries, as well as Canada and Europe, followed similar patterns.\n\nWhile the sources of  inflation were comparable across countries, they affected countries  differently. For example, supply-chain bottlenecks and higher commodity prices  hit Chile and other countries especially hard. In addition, inflation  accelerated earlier and with greater force in Latin American countries than in  advanced economies. 9\n\nIn response, central  banks leaned into their inflation targeting strategies to guide their economies  to bring inflation down. Many benefited from the public trust built from years  of low and stable inflation. As a result, longer-term inflation expectations  remained well anchored in the U.S., Chile, and other Latin American countries. 10 This was  a key difference between this episode and bouts of high inflation in the past,  boding well for disinflation to occur.\n\nThe connections between  policy communications and actions, inflation outcomes, and expectations are at  the core of policy strategies that are robust to extreme uncertainty, a topic  that Athanasios Orphanides and I studied in a sequence of research papers. 11 If a central bank has  credibility in achieving price stability, longer-term expectations should  remain anchored at levels consistent with its inflation target.\n\nCarving Their Own Paths\n\nDuring my tenure at the  Fed, the comment I’ve heard most often from economists and central bankers in  emerging market countries is that the Fed’s actions have meaningful effects on  the capital flows and exchange rate movements in their countries. We saw this  in action during the so-called taper tantrum in mid-2013. After Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke indicated that the FOMC might start tapering the pace of its asset  purchases later that year, U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply, causing  significant volatility in global financial markets—particularly for emerging  market economies.\n\nWhat is striking to me  is that after the onset of the pandemic, those concerns were not nearly so top  of mind. Until COVID-19, central banks in emerging economies, including many in  Latin America, typically had followed the lead of the Fed when responding to  shocks. This time, because they did not want to risk a new episode of very high  inflation and thus potentially lose their hard-earned credibility, they moved  first. 12 Latin American central  banks acted quickly and decisively to tame high inflation by raising interest  rates, starting with Brazil in the spring of 2021, followed by Chile, Colombia,  Mexico, and Peru later that summer. 13 In contrast, central  banks of many advanced economies—including the Bank of England, the Federal  Reserve, the Bank of Canada, and the European Central Bank—raised rates later  and by smaller amounts.\n\nAround the world,  inflation—and the responses of central banks—largely rose and fell along the  same path. Following central banks’ actions, inflation declined across  the board, and economies weathered the disinflation much better than  anticipated. And despite  big movements in interest rates across countries, disinflation occurred without  dramatic disruptions to capital flows, exchange rates, or financial markets. It’s  a true testament to the success of inflation targeting.\n\nThe Current Situation\n\nThis brings me to the  current situation. As I have emphasized, inflation targeting is a strategic  framework that provides the foundation for effective policy decisions and  communication. The decisions and actions themselves depend on the circumstances  that policymakers face.\n\nHere in Chile, in the  United States, and across the globe, strong actions have proven effective at  restoring price stability. In some cases, inflation has returned comfortably  back to target levels, while in others, including the United States, the job of  bringing inflation sustainably back to target is not yet complete.\n\nI’ll comment briefly on the current economic situation in the U.S. and what it means for monetary policy. Economic growth has slowed from its pace last year, and the labor market has gradually cooled. In particular, indicators of the balance between labor demand and supply, including the unemployment rate, have gradually softened over the past year, reaching levels seen prior to the pandemic when the labor market was not overheated. I would emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a significant rise in layoffs or other indications of a sharp deterioration in the labor market.\n\nInflation declined from  a peak of 7-1/4 percent in mid-2022 to 2-3/4 percent in 2024. Looking back at  FOMC participants’ projections in December of last year, the median expectation  was for inflation to slow to 2-1/2 percent this year and approach 2 percent  next year. Since then, the effects of trade policies and other developments  have boosted U.S. inflation somewhat, offsetting the expected downward  trajectory. As a result, progress toward our 2 percent goal has temporarily  stalled, with the latest available data indicating that inflation remains  around 2-3/4 percent.\n\nIt is not possible to  measure the effects of trade policy actions on inflation with precision. My  estimate is that increased tariffs have contributed about one half to three  quarters of a percentage point to the current inflation rate. I do not see any  signs of tariffs contributing to second-round or other spillover effects on  inflation. In particular, inflation expectations are very well anchored, no  broad-based supply chain bottlenecks have emerged, labor markets are not  creating inflationary pressures, and wage growth has moderated. As a result, I  expect the effects of tariffs on inflation will play out over the rest of this  year and the first half of next year. Inflation should thereafter get back on  track to 2 percent in 2027.\n\nGiven this backdrop,  monetary policy is very focused on balancing the downside risks to our maximum  employment goal and the upside risks to price stability. My assessment is that  the downside risks to employment have increased as the labor market has cooled,  while the upside risks to inflation have lessened somewhat. Underlying  inflation continues to trend downward, absent any evidence of second-round  effects emanating from tariffs. For these reasons, I fully supported the FOMC’s  decisions to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis  points at each of its past two meetings.\n\nLooking ahead, it is  imperative to restore inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained  basis. It is equally important to do so without creating undue risks to our  maximum employment goal. I view monetary policy as being modestly restrictive,  although somewhat less so than before our recent actions. Therefore, I still  see room for a further adjustment in the near term to the target range for the federal funds  rate to move the stance of policy closer to the range of neutral, thereby  maintaining the balance between the achievement of our two goals. My policy  views will, as always, be based on the evolution of the totality of the data,  the economic outlook, and the balance of risks to the achievement of our  maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, central  bank independence and accountability, clear communication and an explicit  inflation target, and well-anchored inflation expectations have proven to be  invaluable in ensuring price stability in the face of unexpected shocks and  extreme uncertainty.\n\nSharp turns and unpredictable  terrain have been an unavoidable part of our journey, and we must accept that  shocks and uncertainty will continue to define our future. I am confident that inflation  targeting strategies will continue to serve us well against any challenges we  may face ahead.",

    "text": "Thank you. It’s great to be here at  Housatonic Community College today. Fairfield County in Connecticut is part of  the Federal Reserve’s Second District, which also encompasses New York State, Northern  New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAn important, and enjoyable, aspect of my job is to  meet with members of the community—students, educators, and business and civic leaders—from  throughout the Second District, so I can hear firsthand about their experiences  on issues like the economy, housing, and, of course, inflation.\n\nHigh inflation hurts everyone, but it’s  hardest on those who can least afford to pay more for groceries, rent, and gas.  Persistently high inflation also undermines the ability of our economy to reach  its full potential.\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about  inflation, which remains a top concern. I’ll also give my views on the economic  outlook and monetary policy.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to  give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone  and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee—what  we call the “FOMC”—or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Series of Events\n\nOver the past three years, our economy  has endured a remarkable series of events that have added to economic  uncertainty. First came the pandemic, which caused huge and prolonged  imbalances between demand and supply that are still with us today. Then Russia’s  war on Ukraine fueled higher global energy and food prices.\n\nMore recently, stresses in parts of the  banking system are likely to result in a tightening of credit conditions that  will in turn reduce spending by businesses and households. The magnitude and  duration of these effects, however, is still uncertain.\n\nThe FOMC is responsible for setting  monetary policy. We are mandated by Congress to promote maximum employment and  price stability. On the employment side, the U.S. labor market has been extremely  resilient. Job growth has been strong, job vacancies are plentiful, and at 3.6  percent, the national unemployment rate is near half-century lows. I should also  note that Connecticut’s unemployment rate has fallen to a low level of 4  percent.\n\nInflation is another story. The FOMC  defines price stability as 2 percent inflation, as measured by the personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. 1 Our commitment to 2 percent inflation is an important bedrock principle,  providing a “North Star” for policy decisions and helping to improve the  public’s understanding of our goals and actions.\n\nInflation reached a 40-year high of 7  percent this past June. While it has since moderated to 5 percent, it is still well above our  longer-run goal. Without price stability, we cannot achieve maximum employment  on a sustained basis. That is why it’s so important for the FOMC to use its  monetary policy tools to bring inflation down.\n\nThe Inflation Gears\n\nOur  most important policy tool is the setting of the target range for the federal  funds rate, which influences demand for goods and services by affecting  borrowing costs.\n\nTo  show how this is helping to reduce inflation, I’ve been using an analogy of a  mechanism, such as a watch, that is powered by gears.\n\nThe  watch represents the economy, and its gears are different sectors. To keep time  accurately, the gears need to turn at the right speed. But the ones that drive  inflation have been spinning at different rates.\n\nThe  first inflation gear relates to globally traded commodities, such as lumber,  steel, and grains. Thanks in part to tighter monetary policy here and abroad,  demand has eased, and commodity prices have moderated.\n\nThe  second gear, which represents goods such as cars, appliances, and furniture, is  turning nearer where it needs to be, as higher interest rates have helped curb  demand. Supply-chain bottlenecks that plagued the economy earlier in the  pandemic have receded, which is also helping bring goods price inflation down. 2\n\nThe gear that’s having the most trouble turning  represents non-energy services excluding housing. It’s influenced by the  balance of overall supply and demand for these services and labor, and it will likely  take the longest to bring inflation in this sector down fully.\n\nWell-Anchored Expectations\n\nOne aspect of inflation that’s important for achieving  and sustaining price stability is the anchoring of inflation expectations. Various measures of longer-run inflation expectations have remained  well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent goal. 3\n\nInflation expectations for the next few years, which increased as  inflation was rising, have come down in recent months. The New York  Fed’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that  three-year-ahead inflation expectations are back to where they were in early  2021, and one-year-ahead expectations have decreased sharply. 4\n\nFOMC Actions\n\nWith all this in mind, last week, the  FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent,  its ninth consecutive increase. The FOMC said it “will closely monitor incoming  information and assess the implications for monetary policy.” It also said it “anticipates  that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a  stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation  to 2 percent over time.” 5 , 6\n\nI will be particularly  focused on assessing the evolution of credit conditions and their effects on the  outlook for growth, employment, and inflation.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWhile the FOMC has taken decisive steps  to bring inflation down, lags exist between policy actions and their effects. It  will take time for all of our inflation gears to move at a pace that takes us to  our 2 percent target. I expect inflation to decline to  around 3-1/4 percent this year, before moving closer to our longer-run goal in  the next two years.\n\nI expect real GDP to grow modestly this  year and for growth to pick up somewhat next year. Slower  growth and tighter monetary policy will likely lead to some softening in the  labor market. So, I anticipate unemployment gradually rising to about 4-1/2  percent over the next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe economic outlook is uncertain, and  our policy decisions will be driven by the data and the achievement of our maximum  employment and price stability mandates. I am confident that our actions will  bring inflation down to our 2 percent longer-run goal.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI would like to begin by thanking the Puerto Rico Chamber of  Commerce for co-hosting today’s event. Visiting Puerto Rico is always a  highlight for me, and yesterday I had the pleasure of seeing Ponce for the  first time.\n\nI’m on the island as part of the ongoing engagement the New York  Fed has with communities across the Federal Reserve’s Second District. In our  discussions, business and community leaders have shared their perspectives on  Puerto Rico’s economy. In turn, I've been able to place what’s happening here  in the context of the broader U.S. economy.\n\nI’d like to continue that conversation this morning. But before we  get to the Q&A portion of the program, let me take some time to discuss the  economy and monetary policy in the context of a changing and uncertain  landscape. I’ll talk about what the data are telling us and how the Federal  Reserve is working to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  I’ll also share some observations about Puerto Rico’s economy.\n\nBefore I go further, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that  the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nThe  Economy of Yesterday and Today\n\nSo, what can we expect for the economy? That question is top of  mind for many—particularly those trying to plan for the future at a time of  heightened uncertainty.\n\nThe answer is multifaceted, but I will do my best to address it over  the next 10 minutes or so.\n\nTo start, I’ll say that the economy entered the year on firm  footing. This was a result of strong growth fueled by robust gains in the labor  force and productivity. After a period of cooling, a wide range of labor market  indicators, including the unemployment rate, have stabilized at levels  consistent with a solid labor market. 1\n\nOn the inflation front, the disinflationary process has been on a  path toward the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent. Based on the  12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures price index, inflation  was 2-1/2 percent in February, reflecting a broad-based deceleration over the  past few years. This is tremendous progress given that in mid-2022, inflation  reached a 40-year high of over 7 percent. But we are still not at our 2 percent  goal, and I remain committed to bringing inflation back to that goal on a  sustained basis.\n\nUnderstanding  Uncertainty\n\nDespite this strong start, the future is highly uncertain. I am  not alone in saying this. In fact, “uncertainty” was the overwhelming theme in  the latest Federal Reserve Beige Book, a report about economic conditions  across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Measures of policy uncertainty have  increased sharply in recent months. For example, between October of last year  and this March, the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has nearly tripled,  reaching the highest level recorded over the past 40 years, outside of 2020. 2 Unsurprisingly, the Trade Policy Uncertainty Index has  skyrocketed to levels never before seen in data going back 65 years. 3\n\nThis pervasive sense of uncertainty is becoming increasingly evident,  especially in so-called soft data such as surveys and information from business  contacts. There’s been a sharp decline in consumer sentiment, and business  sentiment measures have weakened, too.\n\nShifts in sentiment can occur for a multitude of reasons, so  understanding their source is key. While uncertainty about the economic outlook  reflects many factors, the effects of tariffs and trade policy on the economy are  certainly at the top of the list. For example, my business and financial market  contacts highlighted that this has made it more difficult to plan for  investments and hiring.\n\nThis gives us insight into the reality that businesses and  consumers are faced with, many of whom speak of taking a wait-and-see approach.  It’s a concept economists call the “option value of waiting.” At times of great  uncertainty, consumers may put off making big decisions like buying a home or  car, and businesses may delay investing until they have a better sense of what  the future holds. And when households and businesses cut back on spending,  economic growth slows.\n\nInflation  Expectations\n\nIn addition to the effects of uncertainty and trade policy on  sentiment, we are seeing increasing signs of effects on near-term expectations  of inflation. For example, market-based measures of inflation expectations—which  reflect what investors are willing to pay to be protected against  inflation—have risen at shorter horizons but have remained stable at longer  horizons. New York Fed surveys indicate that Second District businesses expect  higher cost increases, particularly among manufacturing firms and businesses  that rely heavily on imported goods and products. While year-ahead inflation  expectations of firms also moved up, their longer-term expectations remained  stable. 4\n\nDuring times of turbulence and uncertainty such as these,  well-anchored longer-run inflation expectations are critically important for  ensuring sustained price stability.\n\nAn  Eye on Puerto Rico\n\nThe story here in Puerto Rico is consistent with what we’re seeing  elsewhere. The island’s economy has been doing quite  well. Employment numbers are impressive, with private sector employment at an  all-time high. There’s been strong growth across industries. And, after decades  of decline, the island’s population appears to have stabilized. Despite this  strength, Puerto Rico is not immune to the effects of uncertainty, as I’ve  heard from business leaders here.\n\nMonetary Policy Amid High Uncertainty\n\nConsidering  the high degree of uncertainty about what the future holds, another question  often asked is what this means for monetary policy.\n\nThe answer is  that the current modestly restrictive stance of monetary policy is entirely  appropriate given the solid labor market and inflation still above our 2  percent goal. Importantly, it gives us the opportunity to assess incoming data  and developments, and ultimately positions us well to adjust to changing  circumstances that affect the achievement of our dual mandate goals.\n\nThat’s why, at  its most recent meeting, the FOMC decided to leave the target range for the  federal funds rate unchanged at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In the accompanying  statement, the Committee noted that uncertainty around the economic outlook has  increased, and said it is attentive to risks to both sides of its dual mandate. 5 The Committee reaffirmed its strong  commitment to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2  percent objective, and its policy decisions will be based on a careful  assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of  risks.\n\nThe Committee  also decided to slow the pace of reduction in its holdings of securities, with  a net effect of reducing the monthly pace of balance sheet runoff by about  half. This is a natural next step to smooth the transition from abundant  reserves to a level that is somewhat above ample. This action has no  implications for our intended stance of monetary policy or for the ultimate  size of our balance sheet.\n\nThe  Economic Outlook\n\nIt’s hard to know with any precision how the economy will evolve. Given  the uncertain effects of recently announced tariffs and other policy changes,  there is an unusually wide range of outcomes that could transpire. That said,  the broad contours of the outlook are becoming a bit clearer.\n\nGiven the combination of the slowdown in labor force growth due to  reduced immigration and the combined effects of uncertainty and tariffs, I now  expect real GDP growth will slow considerably from last year’s pace, likely to somewhat  below 1 percent. With this downshift in the pace of growth, I expect the unemployment  rate to rise from its current level of 4.2 percent to between 4-1/2 and 5  percent over the next year. I expect increased tariffs to boost inflation this  year to somewhere between 3-1/2 and 4 percent.\n\nAlthough the economic outlook for this year is coming into better  focus, what happens after that remains unclear. A key  question is the extent to which this year’s higher inflation spills over into  subsequent years and how that may affect expectations. Another question is  how the global economy will respond to the change in trade policies. As I  stressed in a recent speech, the world’s economies are highly interconnected,  and what happens in our country affects other countries and vice versa. 6\n\nConclusion\n\nElevated uncertainty poses many questions about the future of the  economy and the path of monetary policy. It is simply too early to know the  answers. But as we learn more about the effects of tariffs and other policies, we’ll  continue to carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the  balance of risks to our goals.\n\nMonetary policy is in the right place to manage those risks as  best we can. Despite the recent rise in short-term inflation expectations,  longer-term expectations have remained well anchored. It is critically  important to keep inflation expectations well anchored as we pursue our goals  of maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent longer-run objective.",

    "text": "Thank you for the kind  introduction. It’s a great honor to speak at this event recognizing our esteemed  colleague and friend, Klaas Knot.\n\nAs is often the case  among central bankers, Klaas and I first met on a rubber raft floating down the  Snake River in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park. It was August 2011. Klaas  was a rookie monetary policymaker at the time, having been in his role as  president of the Dutch National Bank for less than two months. I, on the other  hand, was a relatively grizzled veteran with nearly six months under my belt as  president of the San Francisco Fed.\n\nWhile we were leisurely cruising  downstream, enjoying the wonderful views of nature, our raft suddenly came upon  a black bear and two cubs who were—equally leisurely—crossing the river right  ahead of us. Carefully, the raft pilot steered us near enough to the bears for  close-up photos, but not so near as to get between the mama bear and her cubs—the  one thing even a city slicker like me knows never to do. We didn’t appreciate it  at the time, but this adventure was an omen for the many challenges we would  face navigating the unexpected in the years to come.\n\nSince that momentous raft  trip, I have had the great privilege of working closely with Klaas as he wore  his various hats: as president of the Dutch National Bank, as a member of the  board at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and in the leadership  roles he held at the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nIn all the years I have  known Klaas, I have been impressed by the consistently high standards to which  he holds himself and others. A high standard of grounding decisions in principles  and strategy. A high standard of disciplined and impartial thought and analysis,  one in which the evidence leads to the conclusion rather than the other way  around. And a high standard of clear and concise communication—often with quintessentially  Dutch directness. I experienced all of these high standards firsthand at many BIS  meetings, when Klaas respectfully but pointedly probed my analysis or  conclusions.\n\nToday, I will do my best  to meet Klaas’s high standards as I describe key principles that have been  critically important for successful monetary policy in the past and are  essential for navigating the uncertain waters ahead. To cut to the chase, when  it comes to monetary policy, central banks must prepare for the unexpected.\n\nBefore I go further, I  need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are  mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nExpect the Unexpected\n\nA key lesson of the past  20 years is to expect the unexpected. Over that period, we’ve faced the global  financial crisis, the euro crisis, the long period of zero or even negative  interest rates, COVID-19, Russia’s war on Ukraine, and most recently, seismic  shifts in the global trade and geopolitical environment.\n\nUnpredictable change and  uncertainty will certainly continue to be with us for the foreseeable future. Consider,  for example, the effects of ongoing global demographic shifts, artificial  intelligence, and potentially transformative innovations in our financial  systems.\n\nIf history teaches us to  expect the unexpected, then what does that mean for monetary policy? First and  foremost, it underscores the need for principles and strategy that provide the  foundation for decision-making across a wide range of circumstances. This does  not mean a playbook for every conceivable situation—that is doomed to fail. Instead,  it is a consistent overarching strategy that shapes and informs decision-making.  Second, it means having the ability and readiness to act as needed for any  situation that arises. Third, it implies being clear-eyed and disciplined in  adapting to and communicating the changing economic landscape and resulting  policy trade-offs and decisions. It’s important to be  nimble in execution even as one is steady in strategy.\n\nI  am happy to say that all three of these features are foundational to the recent  reviews of monetary policy frameworks conducted by the European Central Bank  and the Federal Reserve, as well as policy frameworks used by many other  central banks. 1\n\nSo far, I have stayed at  a very high level. I will now get into some specifics of how these observations  translate into real-world practice. I will organize this discussion across three  broad categories, corresponding to three key principles of successful monetary  policy: accountability, transparency, and well-anchored inflation expectations. 2\n\nOwning  the Responsibility\n\nI will start with  accountability: Central banks must own the  responsibility to deliver price stability and have the independence of  action and the ability to achieve it.\n\nIn the distant past,  many central bankers believed that monetary policy could only play a minor role  in reducing inflation, while others thought that inflation was completely  outside of their control. 3 The end  result was persistently high inflation and economic stagnation. History has taught  us that central banks can be more successful at delivering sustainably low  inflation when they are accountable for their decisions and can act independently. 4 , 5 Today, central bankers  around the world recognize that attaining and maintaining price stability is  their job to do.\n\nBut it is not enough to  be accountable and independent: central banks must have the appropriate tools  to carry out their mandates. Outside of the hallways of central banks, monetary  policy is commonly understood through the overly narrow lens of setting the current  short-term interest rate. All the attention is on what the ECB, the Fed, or another  central bank will “do” at its next policy meeting.\n\nOf course, this focus is  not entirely surprising since central banks generally use the short-term  interest rate as the primary policy instrument. And the academic literature,  including the Taylor Rule and all of its variants, has reinforced this notion that  equates monetary policy to setting of the short-term rate. Indeed, there even has  been a label attached to it: “conventional monetary policy.” By implication,  other monetary policy actions that have been used—such as forward guidance and  balance sheet policies—are deemed “unconventional,” and therefore somewhat  suspect.\n\nHowever, this narrow understanding  of monetary policy is alien to the history of monetary economics and central  bank practice. A reading of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz’s pathbreaking  history of the Federal Reserve during the Great Depression dispels the notion  that monetary policy is limited to setting the short-term rate and instead  emphasizes broader measures of liquidity and longer-term interest rates. 6 The same is true for Alan  Meltzer’s detailed history of the Federal Reserve. 7\n\nIn this regard, I am  reminded of Ben Bernanke’s speech from 2002, titled “On Milton Friedman's  Ninetieth Birthday.” In it, Ben provided a clear and succinct overview of the  Friedman and Schwartz critique of Federal Reserve policy during the Great  Depression. 8 Of particular note is the example of the spring of 1932, when the Fed briefly  engaged in open market purchases to support broad liquidity, which was  beginning to have an effect on the economy. But this policy was soon abandoned,  as the Fed reverted to the view that the low level of nominal interest rates  indicated an expansionary monetary policy. Ben famously finished the speech by  acknowledging these mistakes. And he promised not to repeat them—a vow he would  soon uphold through leading the Fed’s actions during the global financial  crisis.\n\nAround the same time,  and well before “unconventional” policies had that name, monetary economists  from different schools of thought—including Ben McCallum, Athanasios Orphanides  and Volker Wieland, Gauti Eggertsson and Mike Woodford, Ben Bernanke and Vicent  Reinhart, Alan Auerbach and Maury Obstfeld, and my own work with Dave  Reifschneider 9 —described  how monetary policy could be effective even in situations where nominal short-term  rates were very low. These are not “emergency,” “crisis,” or “break-the-glass”  policies, but those that are well within the long tradition of monetary theory  and practice. Of course, how and when to use policies depends on the circumstances  and the risks policymakers are facing. But this is a matter of tactics and  implementation, not of principle or strategy.\n\nCommitment to Transparency\n\nThe second principle is  transparency—including the clear communication of a central bank’s framework,  an explicit numerical longer-run inflation target, and the reasoning behind  policy decisions.\n\nFor central banks,  transparency enhances accountability and keeps them clearly focused on  achieving their goals. For households and businesses, an explicit and credible  inflation target helps take some of the uncertainty off the table so they can  focus on planning for their future. By improving the public’s understanding of  a central bank’s goals and actions, the central bank can enhance the  effectiveness of monetary policy at stabilizing inflation and the economy. 10 , 11 , 12\n\nBased on a foundation of  clear goals and strategy, central banks are better able to communicate their  thinking behind policy decisions and how they relate to policy goals. This is  often done through economic forecasts, reports, and speeches. Transparency around  the factors that influence policy decisions can, in turn, improve the public’s  understanding of the policy reaction function, thereby enhancing the  effectiveness of policy. 13 Indeed, many central  banks have increasingly provided detailed macroeconomic analyses of factors  relevant for monetary policy, including staff or policymaker estimates of the  output gap and the natural rate of interest. 14\n\nThere is no single best  way to achieve transparency—this is not one size fits all. Instead, the  approach must conform to the institutional structures and practical realities  of each jurisdiction. The Monetary Policy Reports of the Riksbank and Norges  Bank, to name two examples, provide very clear summaries of the views of their  policy committees, including their assessments of the distribution of the path  of future interest rates. 15 In contrast, central  banks with large committees or a mix of internal and external members have not  done so. Such differences across central banks may be more a feature than a  bug: One of the benefits of greater transparency and the variety of different  practices is that we can all learn from each other’s experiences as we strive  to further improve communications consistent with our institutional structures  and needs.\n\nImportance of Inflation Expectations\n\nThe third key principle of  successful monetary policy is well-anchored inflation expectations. This  principle has become a bedrock of modern central banking, as economic analysis  and history have shown that anchoring inflation expectations is important in  maintaining low and stable inflation. 16 , 17\n\nWell-anchored inflation  expectations short-circuit so-called second-round effects in wage and price  setting that exacerbate and prolong the impacts of the kinds of shocks we saw  during the 1970s. They also create a more favorable short-run trade-off in achieving  inflation and employment objectives. 18\n\nCentral banks help  anchor expectations by owning the responsibility to deliver price stability,  publicly committing to an explicit inflation target, and taking the actions  needed to ensure price stability. The connections  between policy communications and actions, inflation outcomes, and expectations  are at the core of robust policy strategies. 19\n\nUnlike  the stylized textbook model of monetary policy, a robust policy approach  recognizes that the economy is changing and uncertain. It also views the  anchoring of expectations, or the lack thereof, as the outcome of monetary  policy actions and communications, not an assumed fact.\n\nWhen the Facts Change\n\nI have talked about the importance of three key principles: ownership of price  stability and independence of action, transparency about goals and strategy,  and a focus on anchored inflation expectations. But like that family of black  bears on the Snake River, the unexpected is always waiting around the bend. These principles and lessons provide a strong foundation for monetary policy  that prepares us for the unexpected challenges and uncertainties we face ahead.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Bill. It's great to be  with you today, at least virtually, and I am looking forward to our discussion.  But before we dive in, I thought I would offer some thoughts on the  announcement made last week about the completion of the Federal Open Market  Committee's review of its monetary policy framework and the issuance of a new Statement  on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. 1\n\nBefore I continue—and you know what comes next, Bill—let  me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else  in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAllow me to add one last \"before\" caveat. Before I  explain the new statement, it is important to reflect on the context in which the  original statement was issued. Then I'll share how the monetary policy  framework of today positions us best to achieve our goals and manage the very  challenging environment that lies ahead.\n\nThe original consensus statement was issued back in  January 2012 and represented an important step in the Committee's progress  toward greater transparency around its goals and strategy. It incorporated key  aspects of flexible inflation targeting, a monetary policy framework that had  gained wide acceptance around the world.\n\nThis framework served us well,  but the need for change was clear. In the past eight years, basic facts that  shaped the original framework have fundamentally changed.\n\nFirst and foremost is the dramatic  decline in the neutral interest rate, that is, the short-term interest expected  to prevail when the economy is operating at its full potential and inflation is  at its longer-run target. Since January 2012, FOMC participants' median  estimate of the neutral nominal rate has fallen by 1-3/4 percentage points,  from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent. A similar decline is seen in private sector  forecasts and bond yields. 2 This secular decline in interest rates is not limited to  the United States—we're seeing it across the globe—and it reflects longer-run  trends in demographics, productivity, and other factors that are unlikely to  reverse anytime soon. 3\n\nLower neutral interest rates  constrain the ability of monetary policy to offset negative shocks to the  economy. This effect has been seen most clearly in the behavior of inflation.  Over the past decade, inflation in the United States has been below our 2  percent longer-run target most of the time, and measures of inflation  expectations have drifted down.\n\nThese declines in trend inflation  and inflation expectations can create a pernicious feedback loop of reduced  policy space and even lower inflation expectations. Again, this experience is  not unique to the United States, indicating that it stems from factors common  across countries, rather than issues unique to our economy. Indeed, most  inflation-targeting advanced economies have struggled to achieve their inflation  goals on a sustained basis over the past decade.\n\nThis brings us to last week's  announcement and the issuance of a new consensus statement of our policy  framework. It is a culmination of extensive outreach and conversations with  communities and stakeholders across the country, careful and thorough analysis,  and active discussion and debate among Committee participants. 4 , 5 We took important lessons from the experience of the past decade, reassessed  the evidence, and looked at the challenges ahead of us. All this effort was  worth it: this new statement means we are better positioned to achieve our  goals. In fact, the process worked so well, we've committed to repeating it  roughly every five years!\n\nThe new framework statement directly  and effectively addresses the problems caused by a low neutral rate and  persistently low inflation.\n\nFirst, it stipulates that, following  periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, a  temporary overshooting of the longer-run inflation target will likely be  desirable to keep inflation and inflation expectations centered on 2 percent.  Second, it makes clear that we seek inflation that averages 2 percent over  time, consistent with our longer-run target. Finally, the statement makes  unequivocally clear that we seek maximum employment and will aim to eliminate shortfalls from this broad and inclusive  goal. These changes are mutually reinforcing and will meaningfully improve our  ability to achieve both of our dual mandate goals in an environment of a very  low neutral rate.\n\nI'll conclude with this: The new  framework represents both an important evolution in our thinking about how to  achieve our goals and another step toward greater transparency. It reaffirms  key aspects of the original statement that have stood the test of time and  refines others in line with experience and evolving practices. It also makes some  more significant changes in light of developments and lessons learned in recent  years. And most importantly, it positions us for success in achieving our  maximum employment and price stability goals in the future.",

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction. I'm so pleased to join you today.  As business leaders and business owners, you are integral to the U.S. economy. So,  it's fitting for me to have this opportunity to talk to you about the state of our  economy, as well as a topic that's on everyone's mind: inflation.\n\nFrom Main Street to Wall Street—and to  Liberty Street, where the New York Fed is headquartered—inflation is the No.  1 concern. Clearly, inflation is far too high, and persistently high inflation undermines  the ability of our economy to perform at its full potential. The Federal  Reserve has two goals: maximum employment and price stability. History teaches  us that price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment over the  longer term. We at the Federal Reserve are therefore taking strong actions to restore  price stability as a foundation for sustained economic prosperity.\n\nToday I will talk about why high inflation broke out last year,  how it has evolved, and why I am confident that we are taking the necessary  actions to bring inflation down.\n\nBut before I do, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the  views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nInflation's  Disparate Impact\n\nThe FOMC's price stability objective is for  inflation to average 2 percent over the longer run, as measured by the personal  consumption expenditures price index. 1 In the three decades before the pandemic, this inflation rate averaged almost  exactly 2 percent. But that changed dramatically last year, when inflation  suddenly soared. It  has reached four-decade highs in recent months, and now stands at over 6  percent.\n\nHigh inflation  spares no one. It makes it more expensive to feed families, heat homes, and pay  rents. While everyone feels the pain, not everyone is affected equally. Those  who can least afford the essentials—like food, gas, and  housing—suffer the most.\n\nInflation also  has a disparate impact across ethnic groups. Economists at the New York Fed  found that since 2021, Black and Hispanic households have faced higher  inflation than the national average—and Hispanic families have been affected  the most. 2 This is largely because on average, Hispanic  households spend a larger share of their budgets on items most affected by the  recent high inflation.\n\nThe Inflation Onion\n\nThe sources of high inflation are many and complex, and they stretch  across the globe. Nearly all economies are experiencing unusually high rates of  inflation. To better understand how that happened and what  it portends, it is useful to think of inflation in  terms of three distinct layers of an onion.\n\nIn this analogy, the onion's outer layer consists of prices of  globally traded commodities—such as lumber, steel, grains, and oil. They have experienced  a surge in demand as the global economy has rebounded from the pandemic downturn.  In addition, Russia's war on Ukraine and the resulting actions have caused  energy prices to soar. These higher costs get passed on as higher prices for consumers.  I am sure everyone in this room has been forced to manage skyrocketing costs on  important supplies over the past two years.\n\nThe middle layer of the inflation onion is made up of products—especially  durable goods like appliances, furniture, and autos—that have been affected by severe  supply-chain disruptions. Many of you have also had first-hand experience with  the impact of shutdowns and supply-chain bottlenecks. There haven't been enough  inputs to produce products, and not enough products to sell—all at a time when  demand has been sky-high. Many of you have also had customers lining up at your  doors—but not enough products in stock.\n\nThis imbalance between supply and  demand has contributed to large price increases. To give some examples, prices  for furniture rose over 13 percent last year, new cars were up nearly 12  percent, and used vehicles skyrocketed an astounding 50 percent.\n\nThe innermost layer of the onion consists of underlying inflation,  which reflects the overall balance between supply and demand in the economy. Therein  lies our biggest challenge. Prices for services have been rising at a fast rate  as the economy has recovered from the recession. In particular, rents for new  leases have climbed rapidly. And labor shortages are everywhere, leading to  higher labor costs. Indeed, inflation pressures have become broad-based across  a wide range of goods and services.\n\nGood  News and Bad News\n\nWhat does the future hold? I will start with some good news. First,  prices of many commodities, such as lumber, are in retreat. Absent further supply  disruptions, I expect slowing global growth, in part reflecting tighter  monetary policy here and abroad, will continue to reduce demand for these  products. This should put downward pressure on commodity prices and help ease inflationary  pressures, especially for goods and services that are heavily reliant on  commodity inputs.\n\nSecond, we have seen significant improvement in global supply  chains, and I expect this to continue. At the New York Fed, economists have  developed the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which measures the extent of global  supply-chain disruptions by summarizing a variety of  data, including reported delivery lags and the costs of transporting goods. The  Index soared to unprecedented levels late last year but has now reversed about two  thirds of its rise. Although significant supply-chain problems are still  affecting some industries, such as autos, improvements in supply should help  ease supply-demand imbalances and result in lower prices for affected products. 3\n\nUnfortunately, that's it for the good news on inflation. The fact  is, lower commodity prices and receding supply-chain issues will not be enough by  themselves to bring inflation back to our 2 percent objective. The demand for  durable goods remains very high—beyond what can be produced and brought to  market, even with improved supply chains. And the demand for labor and services  is far outstripping available supply. This is resulting in broad-based  inflation, which will take longer to bring down.\n\nTaking Strong Actions\n\nTo help rein in demand to levels consistent with supply—and  therefore bring inflation down—monetary policy needs to do its job. The FOMC is  taking strong actions toward that end.\n\nAt its most recent meeting, in September, the FOMC raised the  target range of the federal funds rate to 3 to 3-1/4 percent, its fifth  consecutive increase. 4 And the Committee said it anticipates that ongoing increases will be  appropriate. According to the median view from the FOMC's Summary of Economic  Projections, the projected appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the  end of next year is 4.6 percent. 5 In  addition, the FOMC continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and  agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. 6\n\nImportantly, the Fed is not alone. Many other central banks are also  taking steps to reduce inflation. Since many sources of inflation are global, these  actions should speed the process of restoring balance to global supply and  demand, alleviate supply-chain issues, and reduce inflationary pressures.\n\nThere are other factors in our favor. First, the Fed's commitment  to achieve and sustain 2 percent inflation is a now bedrock principle. This was  not always the case. It's only been 10 years since the FOMC defined 2 percent  inflation as its longer-run goal. 7 This transparency about our objectives provides a \"North Star\" for policy  decisions and communications. It likewise improves the public's understanding  of our goals and actions.\n\nIt has also served us well in keeping longer-term inflation  expectations well anchored. For example, the most recent Survey of Consumer  Expectations shows that consumers expect inflation to decline over the next  three years. 8 And market-based measures of inflation expectations have also remained well  anchored. This anchoring of longer-term expectations is critical to keeping high  inflation from becoming embedded in the psychology of consumers and businesses,  which we know from the past is costly to undo.\n\nEconomic  Outlook\n\nSo, what does  tighter monetary policy mean for the economy? We are already seeing some of the  effects. Broad measures of financial conditions, including borrowing and  mortgage rates and equity prices, have become significantly less supportive of  spending. This has led to a decline in activity in the housing market and signs  of slowing in consumer and business investment spending. As this continues, I  expect real GDP to be close to flat this year and to grow modestly in 2023.\n\nAs  a result of slowing growth, I anticipate the  unemployment rate will rise from its current level of 3.7 percent to around 4-1/2  percent by the end of 2023.\n\nAnd with regard to inflation, I expect the combination of cooling  global demand and steady improvements in supply to result in falling rates of  inflation for goods that rely heavily on commodities, as well as for those that  have been most affected by supply-chain bottlenecks. These factors should contribute  to inflation declining to about 3 percent next year.\n\nBringing down underlying inflation—the inner layer of the  inflation onion—will take longer, but with monetary policy helping to restore  balance between demand and supply, I see inflation moving close to our 2  percent goal in the next few years.\n\nConclusion\n\nTighter monetary policy has begun to cool  demand and reduce inflationary pressures, but our job is not yet done. It will  take time, but I am fully confident we will return to a sustained period of  price stability.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure  to be here today to discuss a timely and important topic: the anchoring of inflation  expectations. Against the backdrop of the stormy seas of  the global inflation of the past year and a half, a steady anchor is more  critical than ever. But,  what does it mean for inflation expectations to be well anchored, and how would  we know if they are? In my remarks, I will describe three criteria for  well-anchored inflation expectations. I will then provide an initial assessment  of the behavior of inflation expectations in the United States against these  three criteria since inflation surged in the spring of last year. I should  emphasize the word “initial,” since we are still in the midst of the storm, and  definitive conclusions on the anchoring of expectations will await the ship’s safe  return.\n\nThis is the  perfect time to give the usual Federal Reserve disclaimer that everything I say  reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe critical  importance of anchoring inflation expectations is now enshrined as a bedrock  principle of modern central banking. One way central banks have sought to anchor  expectations is through a commitment to an explicit longer-run inflation goal. For  example, the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and  Monetary Policy Strategy, issued in January 2012, set a 2 percent  longer-run inflation goal. It declared: “Communicating this inflation goal  clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly  anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest  rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in  the face of significant economic disturbances.” 1 The 2 percent longer-run goal and the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations  were reaffirmed in the FOMC’s updated Goals and Strategy statement released in  2020. 2\n\nTheory\n\nIt is one thing to say that anchored inflation expectations are  important, but what do we mean by well-anchored expectations, and how would we  know if they are well anchored? I will start by describing some theoretical  implications of well-anchored inflation expectations, and then turn to an  empirical assessment based on U.S. data from the past few years.\n\nMy thinking on  this issue is based largely on a series of research papers I wrote with  Athanasios Orphanides. We used models with adaptive learning to contrast the predicted  behavior of inflation and inflation expectations in two environments: when the  public anchors its expectations on the central bank’s long-run target and when the  public’s perception of the central bank’s target evolves depending on incoming  data. 3\n\nThis analysis  and related studies imply three criteria for well-anchored inflation  expectations: “sensitivity,” “level,” and “uncertainty.” Let me take each  in turn.\n\nThe sensitivity criterion states that although near- and medium-term inflation expectations  may respond to economic shocks, expectations of inflation far in the future  should not. Well-designed monetary policy will generally allow for some  response to shocks of short- and medium-term inflation expectations in order to  balance competing objectives, but long-run inflation expectations should not be  affected. In a formal sense, this criterion is about the very long-run response  of inflation to shocks, but as shown in my research with Orphanides, the  beneficial effects of anchored expectations on macroeconomic performance only  occur when the inflation response to a shock is not expected to extend over many  years. As Keynes admonishes us, in the long run we are all dead, and the notion  of long-run expectations cannot be too long.\n\nThis sensitivity criterion  requires long-run inflation expectations to be invariant to shocks. In  contrast, the level criterion applies the more stringent standard that the  rate of long-run inflation expectations be consistent with the central bank’s long-run  inflation target. In other words, it demands that expectations not just be anchored,  but anchored to the right spot. These first two criteria are present in the  FOMC’s statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which stresses  the anchoring of longer-run inflation expectations at the target level  and recognizes that short-run trade-offs between inflation and economic  activity may arise.\n\nThe  third criterion— uncertainty —requires that uncertainty about future  inflation increases less than linearly with the forecast horizon. Transitory  responses of inflation to shocks imply uncertainty about future inflation, even  far in the future. The uncertainty criterion is about the relationship between  the magnitude of uncertainty and the forecast horizon. It is closely related to  the sensitivity criterion, in that permanent shocks to inflation are ruled out.  The counterexample is if inflation follows a random walk process, whereby  shocks have permanent effects on inflation, then uncertainty, as measured by the  standard deviation from the distribution of future outcomes, rises linearly  with the forecast horizon.\n\nApplying Theory to the Real World\n\nIn the years up  to and including the first year of the pandemic, inflation had been running consistently  below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run target. Then, in the spring of 2021,  inflation readings surged, bringing the personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  inflation rate to around 6 percent, where it has remained through the first  nine months of 2022. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose by even more. This  episode represents a unique opportunity to assess the three criteria of well-anchored  expectations during a period of high and volatile inflation. 4\n\nIn empirically assessing the sensitivity and level of longer-run  inflation expectations, one must specify what forecast horizon corresponds to  the “long run.” Surveys don’t typically ask about inflation in the “long run,”  but rather the inflation rate over a specific period of time. A reasonable and  oft-used benchmark of longer-run inflation expectations is to look at inflation  five or more years in the future. Such a forecast horizon is sufficiently long enough  for typical business cycle dynamics and the effects of monetary policy on  inflation to have played out, although under some circumstances, this may fall  short of the “long run” implied by theory.\n\nOver the past year and a half, measures of longer-run  inflation expectations have been insensitive to the rapid rise in  inflation. Figure 1 shows the time series of these  measures of longer-run inflation expectations. This includes median expectations from the  Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for inflation measured by the PCE  price index 6-10 years in the future; breakeven inflation rates 6-10  years in the future as implied by nominal and inflation-protected U.S. Treasury  securities; and the University of Michigan survey of inflation expected over  the next 5-10 years. 5 Realized 12-month CPI inflation is also shown in the figure for  reference.\n\nAs seen in Figure 1 , SPF longer-run inflation expectations have remained  remarkably stable over the past year and a half, while the market-based measure  and the Michigan survey rose modestly during 2021 before retracing some of  those gains this year. Because the Michigan survey asks about inflation over  the next 5-10 years, it is a mixture of short-run and longer-run expectations,  which may be related to its modest sensitivity to inflation. Market-based  measures include a time-varying risk premium that may explain the modest movements  in that measure. 6\n\nIn contrast to longer-run expectations, short-run and, to a lesser  extent, medium-run inflation expectations responded to the sharp rise in  inflation. The lower portion of Table 1 reports summary  statistics for one-year-ahead inflation expectations from the Michigan survey  and one- and three-year-ahead expectations from the New York Fed’s Survey of  Consumer Expectations (SCE). Consistent with past experience,  one-year-ahead inflation expectations have been highly sensitive to incoming  inflation during the recent period. The sensitivity of three-year-ahead  inflation expectations is far less than that for one-year-ahead expectations.  And they have been significantly less sensitive to incoming information during this  period of high inflation than during the period before the pandemic. This suggests  households view the run-up in inflation in 2021 as likely being less persistent  than in prior episodes. 7\n\nAlthough the SPF includes a longer-run forecast of PCE price inflation,  most other measures of inflation expectations do not exactly correspond to the PCE  price index that the FOMC has stipulated for its long-run goal. This complicates  a direct comparison of these measures to the FOMC’s stated goal. For example,  the SCE refers to the “rate of inflation,” and the Michigan survey refers to “prices  in general,” rather than referring to a specific price index. Similarly,  “breakeven inflation” measures derived from inflation-indexed Treasury  securities are based on the CPI and include time-varying risk and term premiums  in addition to expectations of inflation. 8 To address the lack of direct comparability of different measures  of inflation expectations, I compare readings over the past two years to the  levels observed during 2014-2020, after the FOMC’s announcement of a 2 percent  long-run goal and before the onset of rising inflation in the spring of 2021.\n\nThe level of longer-run expectations in the SPF has  consistently stayed very close to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. The other measures  have generally stayed within pre-pandemic ranges, with most recent readings  only slightly higher than corresponding average levels from 2014-2020. The  upper portion of Table 1 provides statistics on these comparisons. Interestingly,  during the period of sustained low inflation before the pandemic, the  market-based and Michigan measures declined, and their current levels are similar  to those seen prior to that decline.\n\nAssessment of the uncertainty criterion for well-anchored  inflation expectations is more challenging given data limitations. In theory,  prices on inflation options contracts could be used to infer investors’ distributions  of beliefs about future inflation. 9 However, there have been virtually no trades recorded in the U.S.  market for inflation caps and floors since 2015. Over that time, the “prices”  reported for these options were based on models—not transaction prices—and cannot  be used to measure investors’ inflation uncertainty during the current episode.  Instead, I will turn to the SCE, which asks about consumers’ uncertainty of  inflation expectations, as well as options on future interest rates, which  provide some indirect insights into markets’ uncertainty of future inflation.\n\nOver the past year and a half, two  aspects of increased inflation uncertainty are evident in the SCE: an increase  in disagreement in mean expectations across respondents and an increase in the  width of respondents’ reported inflation distributions. Although disagreement does not directly correspond to uncertainty,  research has identified it as a useful indirect indicator. 10 Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the increase in disagreement  across SCE respondents over the past several years. Figure 2 shows the share of  respondents who have deflation expectations—that is, they expect inflation to  be at or below zero percent—either one, three, or five years in the future. 11 As discussed in research with my colleagues  at the New York Fed, 12 there has been a  striking increase over the past year in the share of respondents who expect  deflation three and five years in the future. 13 At the same time, as shown in Figure 3 , the share expecting  inflation above 4 percent grew, but part of the increase has since reversed. Based on the most recent reading in September 2022, about a  quarter of respondents have deflation expectations five years in the future, nearly  as large as the share expecting inflation above 4 percent at the five-year  horizon.\n\nFollowing the onset of the pandemic, aggregate uncertainty—which  combines disagreement and individual uncertainty—increased but has also become  more symmetric. Figure 4 shows the aggregate distributions of inflation three  years in the future based on the SCE. 14 Two-thirds of the widening of distributions reflect greater dispersion  across respondents, and the remainder is due to greater uncertainty reported by  individuals. 15 Interestingly, the distribution of aggregate uncertainty before and during the  first year of the pandemic was skewed to the upside, as seen in Figure 4 . Since  then, the rising share of those who report deflation expectations has caused  the overall distribution to become more symmetric relative to the median.\n\nIn terms of the  uncertainty criterion, uncertainty does not increase linearly with the forecast  horizon in the SCE. Figure 5 shows the distributions of aggregate uncertainty  for one-, three-, and five-year-ahead inflation forecasts from September 2022.  As Figure 5 shows, the distributions are very similar for the different  forecast horizons. This seems consistent with the evidence that many  respondents view the inflation surge as reflecting a unique set of  developments. 16\n\nAn additional,  albeit indirect, measure of inflation uncertainty is provided by the distribution  of expectations of interest rates from options. 17 Although future interest rates depend on a variety of factors, the expectations  about inflation are a key determinant. Therefore, changes in the distribution  of beliefs about future inflation should affect the distribution of beliefs  about future interest rates as well.\n\nMarket-based  uncertainty of far-future interest rates has increased relative to the  immediate pre-pandemic period. Figure 6 shows the options-implied distributions  of short-term interest rates seven years in the future. Note that these  distributions are truncated by the lower bound on interest rates. Compared with  early 2019, the median interest rate expectation is about the same, but the  upper tail of the distribution is now much wider, and the probability of being  at the lower bound has increased somewhat. To the extent that this reflects an  increase in inflation uncertainty, it is also consistent with the pattern of  greater aggregate uncertainty about future inflation, both to the upside and  downside, as seen in the SCE.\n\nDistributions of  future interest rates also appear consistent with the uncertainty criterion. Figure 7 shows the options-implied distributions for up to 10 years in the  future, as of September 2022. Although the implied standard deviation of  interest rates increases with the forecast horizon, this relationship is less  than linear. 18\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  importance of maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations is a bedrock  principle of modern central banking, but its precise meaning and validation has  been open to interpretation. My goal today has been to use economic theory to  identify empirical criteria that can be used to assess the anchoring of  inflation expectations during the ongoing episode of high inflation. The news is  mostly good—longer-run inflation expectations in the United States have  remained remarkably stable at levels broadly consistent with the FOMC’s  longer-run goal. Inflation uncertainty has increased, but this  does not appear to be due to unmoored longer-run expectations. The one surprising  wrinkle worth further study is the increasing divergence in views about future  inflation, including the high share of those expecting deflation, and what this  portends for the future.\n\nTable and Figures\n\nReferences\n\nArmantier, Olivier, Fatima Boumahdi, Gizem  Kosar, Jason Somerville, Giorgio Topa, Wilbert van der Klaauw, and John C.

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nIt’s a great honor for me to be addressing members  of the Economic Club of New York today, the first time I’m doing so since becoming  the Club’s Chair.\n\nToday’s event was scheduled to take place in person,  and we were really looking forward to the opportunity to come together. But  predicting the future is nearly impossible, and here we are meeting  virtually. I say it’s “nearly” impossible to predict the future because I plan  to share my outlook for the U.S. economy with you all over the next few minutes!\n\nWe’re not the only ones that expected business  to be “more like usual” at this point in time. But the direct and indirect effects  of the virus continue to shape the way we live our lives, do our work, and come  together with others. On top of that, signs of the Delta variant’s impact are  showing up in the incoming data, contributing to more uncertainty about the  future. Business, in fact, is unusual in many ways, and continues to  reflect the extraordinary nature of the pandemic.\n\nIn my remarks today I’ll share more about how  these effects relate to the economic outlook for the nation and right here in  New York. I’ll also go into some detail about the outlook for inflation. Finally,  I’ll discuss what this means for monetary policy and the road ahead.\n\nBefore I  continue, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today  are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nI’ll start by saying that the headline of our  economic story is good news: the recovery continues to show solid momentum. But  the subheading is that we’ll need to be patient. Even with the strong pace of  growth we experienced much of this year, a full recovery from the pandemic will  take time to complete. The adjustment to rapidly changing circumstances, along  with a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, is affecting consumer spending and jobs,  sustaining supply bottlenecks in sectors such as autos, and delaying a full  reopening of the service sector.\n\nSo, to  continue with the news analogy, here’s the lede: I expect gross domestic  product, or GDP, to increase around 5 ½ to 6 percent this year. My current forecast  accounts for strong growth in the first half of 2021, but also balances some  slowing of growth in the remainder of the year relative to the first half.\n\nNow I’ll turn to employment, something I know many  of you as business leaders watch closely. Job gains by and large have been  strong in recent months. On average, 750,000 jobs were added per month over the  three months through August, and the unemployment rate now stands at 5.2  percent.\n\nAt the same time, we’re seeing indications  that the labor market recovery is being impaired by the recent COVID surge. Job  gains slowed noticeably in August, with the weakening concentrated in sectors  most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality. Health  concerns, early retirements, and childcare challenges continue to weigh on  labor supply. Anecdotally, a lack of immigration and work visas is affecting  labor supply as well.\n\nAnother storyline that’s taken hold is the  cycle of hires and quits in the labor market. Clearly, demand for workers is  very high—we see this in an elevated number of job postings and hires. At the  same time, people are leaving their jobs in large numbers, either to look for  new work or exit the labor force altogether. These conditions reflect the  extraordinary nature of the pandemic, and also illustrate that we still have a  long way to go until we achieve the Federal Reserve’s maximum employment goal. In  fact, there are over five million fewer jobs today than before the pandemic,  and the unemployment rate is still far above levels reached early last year.\n\nWhen tracking progress toward maximum  employment, it’s important to take two points into consideration. First, even  if job postings are at a record high, job postings are not jobs. These  vacancies won't be filled instantly—it takes time for employers to find the  right workers. And second, a full recovery means a recovery in employment ,  not just lower unemployment. Employment dynamics are driven by both the  unemployment cycle and the labor force participation cycle. Because employed  workers are more likely to remain attached to the labor force, these cycles are  interrelated, as lower unemployment raises participation by reducing labor  force exits. This relationship also means that the participation cycle lags  behind the unemployment cycle, which is an important feature to keep in mind in  assessing the state of the labor market. 1\n\nEven with this in mind, demand for workers and progress on hiring remain strong, and I expect some pandemic-related factors to diminish as progress is made on containing the virus both here and abroad. Therefore, I am confident that we will continue to see meaningful job gains and continued progress toward maximum employment.\n\nInflation and Inflation Expectations\n\nThe last aspect of the outlook that I’ll speak  about is inflation. Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation,  which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has averaged about 2-3/4  percent since the start of the pandemic. This is above the Federal Reserve’s 2  percent longer-run goal.\n\nWe saw some very high monthly inflation  readings in the second quarter of this year, reflecting pandemic-related supply  bottlenecks and imbalances, but more recent data have shown that the inflation  rate is moderating. The earlier spike in inflation largely reflects the effects  of the rapid reopening of the economy, which pushed supply and demand in  extreme ways. In  fact, we are now seeing some of the pandemic-related spikes retrace, including prices  for lumber, used vehicles, and rental cars. This process of adjustment may take  another year or so to complete as the pandemic-related swings in supply and  demand gradually recede. As the economy  gets through these highly unusual dynamics, I expect inflation to come back  down to around 2 percent next year.\n\nOne reason I  expect inflation to moderate is that measures of underlying inflation and longer-term  inflation expectations have been relatively stable during this period of  otherwise volatile inflation readings.\n\nThere are two  important aspects of longer-term inflation expectations: their level and their  sensitivity to economic conditions and, in particular, to inflation. In terms  of the level of inflation expectations, survey- and market-based measures of  longer-term inflation expectations have reversed the declines of the past  several years and are now around levels seen seven or eight years ago. They currently  appear to be well aligned with our 2 percent long-run inflation goal.\n\nA second  issue is how well anchored inflation expectations truly are, and whether there  is a risk that they could drift higher in response to the elevated rates of  inflation we have been experiencing. A group of economists at the New York Fed  took a closer look at recent behavior of inflation expectations from the Survey  of Consumer Expectations. In particular, they looked at longer-term inflation expectations  and found that expectations of inflation five years in the future have barely  budged over the past two years. 2\n\nThis  evidence is reassuring that, despite the highly unusual swings in inflation  over the past year and a half, inflation expectations are still well anchored. In addition, measures of underlying inflation that are not overly  influenced by the effects of the pandemic have remained stable. With underlying  inflation and inflation expectations running at levels consistent with our 2  percent longer-run goal, I expect inflation to decline to about two percent  next year as the pandemic-related effects on prices subside. Still, there is a  great deal of uncertainty about the inflation outlook, and I will be watching  the data on inflation and inflation expectations closely.\n\nNew York Conditions\n\nThese numbers  tell the story of the economic outlook on a national level. But the New York economy  faces unique challenges, and they may be more serious relative to other parts  of the country.\n\nNew York  State’s unemployment rate is well above the nationwide rate, and New York  City’s is almost double the national figure. Private sector employment in the  state is down nearly 10 percent, with the hard-hit leisure and hospitality  sector down 27 percent. That said, the most recent data show signs of improvement:  employment across the state grew at roughly double the nationwide pace in  August, with outsized growth in New York City. Looking ahead, I expect the New  York economy to continue to strengthen along with the national economy over the  next few years.\n\nThe Fed’s Policy Response\n\nThis  brings me to the Fed's policy response. In its December 2020 statement, the  FOMC said it would continue asset purchases at the current pace until it sees  substantial further progress toward our maximum employment and price stability  goals. 3\n\nGiven what I have  said, I  think it's clear that we have made substantial further progress on achieving  our inflation goal. There has also been very good progress toward maximum  employment. Assuming the economy continues to improve as I  anticipate,  a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted.\n\nIt  is important to remember that even after the asset purchases end, the stance of  monetary policy will continue to support a strong and full economic recovery  and sustained attainment of 2 percent average inflation.\n\nIn  particular, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue to hold the target  range for the federal funds rate at its current level until the economy reaches  conditions consistent with its assessments of maximum employment, and inflation  has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some  time. There is still a long way to go before reaching maximum employment, and  over time it should become clearer whether we have reached 2 percent inflation  on a sustained basis.\n\nConclusion\n\nI began by  saying that it’s nearly impossible to predict the future. The economy remains  tied to the extraordinary and unpredictable nature of the pandemic. But with  continued progress on the economic recovery and a reversal of some of the  pandemic’s unusual dynamics, I anticipate that we will soon reach a time when business  will be more like usual.\n\nI  look forward to the Q&A portion of today’s program, and very much look  forward to seeing many of you when we are able to be together again.",

    "text": "The Phillips curve is the connective tissue between the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Despite regular declarations of its demise, the Phillips curve has endured.  It is useful, both as an empirical basis for forecasting and for monetary policy analysis.\n\nThe paper by Peter Hooper, Rick Mishkin, and Amir Sufi—HMS for short—provides an in-depth analysis of key aspects of inflation dynamics in the United States and how they may have changed.  This study is particularly timely against the backdrop of an emerging consensus that the Phillips curve has become nearly flat.  If this is true it would fundamentally alter the employment-inflation trade-offs the Fed confronts.\n\nThere is a lot to like about this paper: It synthesizes existing research, new analysis, and bridges the study of wages and prices.  Too often these are studied in isolation.  But most significant, as someone who has discussed papers at the USMPF that reached the century mark in page count, this year’s paper came in at a relatively svelte 65 pages.  I hope this represents a durable structural shift, and isn’t merely a reflection of the fact that this year’s paper has three authors rather than the usual four.\n\nThe paper covers a lot of ground, so I will only summarize a few key takeaways.  First, HMS find evidence of asymmetric effects of unemployment on both price and wage inflation, with very low rates of unemployment leading to disproportionately large movements in inflation.  That is, the Phillips curve is very much alive in very tight labor markets.  Second, they find that the dynamics of price inflation have changed in important ways; specifically, it has become less sensitive to the business cycle and less persistent.  Finally, they draw the policy conclusion that Fed policymakers should not be complacent about the possibility of a resurgence of inflation in the context of a tight labor market.\n\nIn my remarks, I will discuss two issues.  First, that price inflation dynamics have changed significantly in recent decades.  I will argue that a number of structural factors have contributed to the appearance of a flattening of the Phillips curve and that a modified formulation that accounts for these changes displays little sign of the Phillips curve flattening.  Second, I will turn to the issue of anchoring of inflation expectations and the need for the Fed to be vigilant in maintaining the anchor in the right place.  Before I continue, I’ll give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHas the Phillips Curve Changed, or Is it a Trick of the Data?\n\nThroughout the paper, HMS use a reduced-form Phillips curve regression as a basis for their analysis.  For my remarks, I simplify the specification and assume the inflation rate depends on the unemployment gap (and variants thereof), four lags of inflation, and a constant (relative to HMS, I have dropped the import price and inflation expectations terms).\n\nOverall, the results for the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index inflation using this simplified specification are quite similar to those reported in HMS.  The full-sample (1961-2017) estimated coefficients using the core PCE price inflation rate are reported in the first column of the upper part of Table 1.  The second column reports results corresponding to the “spline” specification of HMS, where positive values of the unemployment gap are added to the equation to capture asymmetry in the response of inflation to labor market tightness versus slack.  The third and fourth columns of Table 1 report the corresponding estimation results for the subsample of 1961-1987, and the final two columns report the results for the subsample 1988-2017.  Like HMS, the latter sample shows far less intrinsic persistence in inflation and a severe flattening of the Phillips curve relative to the full-sample results.\n\nInterestingly, I find evidence in the early (pre-1988) sample that suggests that inflation was, if anything, more sensitive to the unemployment gap when unemployment was high, rather than low.  Although these estimates are imprecise, this pattern is the opposite of the claim by HMS, which relies on full-sample estimates to draw conclusions.  This also runs counter to HMS’s historical narrative about the 1960s and the dangers of a red-hot labor market.  I will not dwell on this further, but it is a reminder that findings of nonlinearities in Phillips curves are often not robust.\n\nThe apparent breakdown in this simple price Phillips curve in the past 30 years reflects a number of structural changes in the U.S. economy.  The Federal Reserve’s success in re-anchoring inflation expectations at a low level can explain the decline in inflation persistence seen in the data. 1 However, the role of well-anchored expectations in flattening the Phillips curve is not obvious, and as HMS note, this flattening is not as clear in the wage inflation equations.  This suggests other forces are at work.\n\nSeveral usual suspects come to mind, including the effects of supply shocks, increased globalization of goods markets and supply chains, and changes in the market structure for consumer goods.  For example, Alberto Cavallo has shown how Amazon and other online retailers have fundamentally changed price dynamics for consumer goods, with prices changing more rapidly and more affected by exchange rate changes. 2 In today’s globalized and rapidly changing economy, standard reduced-form Phillips curve models that focus primarily on the demand-driven movements in inflation are less relevant.  Other factors besides the state of the business cycle dominate price movements for a wide variety of goods.\n\nCSI to the Rescue\n\nIn theory, one could try to modify the model to account of these factors, but for the present purpose, a more straightforward approach is to focus on prices for categories of consumer spending that are less susceptible to supply shocks, international trade, and changing market structure.  This approach follows in the tradition of “core” measures of inflation that remove the categories that are particularly prone to supply shocks. 3 A number of related measures have been developed along these lines, including work at both the New York and San Francisco Feds. 4\n\nIn my remarks I will use the “Cyclically Sensitive Inflation” measure, or CSI, developed by Jim Stock and Mark Watson. 5 By design, CSI includes the categories that are cyclically sensitive and less prone to measurement error or other non-cyclical drivers.  In practice, this measure more heavily weights services with well-measured market-based prices and significantly down-weights goods.  Figure 1 compares the four-quarter moving averages of CSI to that of core PCE price inflation, with the shaded regions indicating NBER-dated recessions.\n\nRegression results using CSI display neither a flattening of the short-run Phillips curve nor signs of nonlinearities.  The lower part of Table 1 reports the estimation results using CSI inflation.  Starting with the linear specification, the full-sample and early-sample results are very similar to those using core PCE price inflation.  This is not altogether surprising since the two series track each other closely during the first half of the sample.  The big difference is in the later sub-sample, where the coefficient on the unemployment gap is not that much smaller than in the early sample, and larger than in the full-sample estimation.  Moreover, there is little evidence of nonlinearity in the Phillips curve relationship in either the full or later samples.  Evidently, both the flattening of the Phillips curve and evidence of nonlinearities depend on including goods and other categories that are primarily influenced by non-cyclical factors.\n\nThese results suggests that the Phillips curve is alive and kicking when inflation is measured using categories that are cyclically sensitive, rather than buffeted by supply and other shocks.  Based on this analysis, the trade-offs between employment and inflation the Fed faces haven’t fundamentally changed.\n\nThat does not imply there have not been meaningful changes in inflation dynamics—inflation persistence has fallen significantly for the CSI as well.  This means that transitory shocks no longer get embedded in inflation expectations, but instead have relatively short-lived effects on inflation.  This is a very favorable development for the economy and monetary policy, which can safely “look through” transitory shocks.\n\nAnchoring Inflation Expectations at the Target\n\nThis brings me to my second point of the importance of anchoring inflation expectations at the target level.  As HMS correctly stress, policymakers cannot take for granted that inflation expectations will remain well anchored.  They highlight the risk that very tight labor markets could eventually lead to a resurgence of inflation and unmoor expectations, as in the 1960s.  I concur that we must remain vigilant regarding a sustained takeoff in inflation.\n\nWe must be equally vigilant that inflation expectations do not get anchored at too low a level.  So far during this expansion, core and overall PCE inflation has averaged about 1.5 percent, well below the Fed’s 2 percent target.  Taking a longer perspective, over the past 25 years, core and overall inflation have both averaged 1.8 percent.\n\nThis persistent undershoot of the Fed’s target risks undermining the 2 percent inflation anchor.  In this regard, research by Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel is sobering. 6 They find that inflation expectations are heavily influenced by the inflation experience in one’s own lifetime, which implies that decades of too low inflation can become embedded in expectations.  Indeed, we have seen some worrying signs of a deterioration of measures of longer-run inflation expectations in recent years, as seen in Table 2.\n\nImportantly, this sustained undershoot of the inflation target is likely to be a recurring dilemma for the Fed and central banks in Japan and Europe that have had similar experiences over the past decade.  This problem of inflation running chronically below the target stems in part from the limited ability of central banks to offset economic downturns due to the lower bound on interest rates in a low-neutral-rate environment. 7\n\nImplications for the Monetary Policy Framework\n\nThe risk of the inflation expectations anchor slipping toward shore calls for a reassessment of the dominant inflation targeting framework. 8 A number of alternative frameworks and strategies have been proposed that hold the promise of better achieving the inflation goal and holding fast the inflation anchor. 9 In this regard, I am very pleased that the Federal Reserve is undertaking a review of our policy framework this year, a topic that Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Clarida will discuss in his lunch remarks today.\n\nIn summary, the Phillips curve is alive and well.  I wholeheartedly agree with the authors that we must not be complacent about inflation expectations becoming unmoored, whether at too high or too low a level.\n\nTables and Figures",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIt’s great  to be back at Pace University—particularly here at 15 Beekman. I’ve watched this  building rise from the ground, and it’s been wonderful to see it develop as a  new focal point for the school.\n\nThe New  York Fed has a number of connections to Pace. We’re close neighbors and anchor  institutions here in Lower Manhattan. More than 100 of our employees are proud Pace  alumni. And through the years, Pace students have represented the Second  District well in the College Fed Challenge competitions.\n\nI’m  sure the members of the Economics Society who are here today have come armed  with thought-provoking questions about the economy and monetary policy. And I look  forward to answering them. But first, I’m going to take this opportunity to talk  about where the economy’s been, where it is today, and where it’s going. I’ll  discuss how the Fed is working to achieve its dual mandate of maximum  employment and price stability. And I’ll give my economic outlook.\n\nBefore  I go further, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhere We’ve Been\n\nNow  that most economic data for 2024 have come in, it’s a good time to talk about the  key developments of the past year and what they mean going forward. In a  nutshell, what the data tell us is that 2024 is the year the economy returned  to balance, or “equipoise” as I like to say.\n\nThe  FOMC defines price stability as 2 percent inflation over the longer run. And  the 12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures price  index—the measure the FOMC uses to gauge inflation against its goal—ended 2024 at  just above 2-1/2 percent.\n\nWhile inflation  remains somewhat elevated, and the path to 2 percent has been bumpy at times, we  have made significant strides since June of 2022, when inflation reached a  40-year high of 7-1/4 percent. And the disinflation process has been broad-based,  across all the major categories of goods and services.\n\nWe’ve  also made great progress on the employment side of our mandate. The labor  market—red hot in 2021 and 2022—has cooled considerably and is back to more  normal levels. And over the past six months, several labor market indicators  are showing signs of stabilizing. For example, at 4 percent, the unemployment  rate is little changed from the middle of last year.\n\nDespite  the cooling of the labor market, the economy has continued to grow at a solid  rate. Real GDP increased 2-1/2 percent in 2024, on the heels of more than 3  percent growth in 2023. This strong growth has been powered by robust gains in  the labor force and productivity.\n\nSince the  Federal Reserve’s mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability,  we want to see demand in line with supply and keep the risks to achieving our  goals in balance. Now that balance has been achieved, our job is to ensure the  risks remain in balance.\n\nAgainst  this backdrop, the FOMC began moving its monetary policy stance from one that  tightly constrains demand to one that is less restrictive. Over the course of  three meetings in the latter part of 2024, the Committee lowered the target range  for the federal funds rate by a total of 100 basis points.\n\nWe are  not alone in this. Other central banks around the world have made similar policy  moves. In many countries, inflation rose in 2021 and 2022 and has since come  down. Central banks have responded to the global disinflationary process by shifting  monetary policy to a less restrictive posture.\n\nWhere We Are Now\n\nAs we  enter 2025, the economy is in a good place. Growth has remained solid, supported  by robust consumer spending.\n\nAnd from  where we are now, a number of signs indicate that inflation will continue to  move toward our 2 percent longer-run goal—although it will take time before we  can achieve that target on a sustained basis.\n\nFirst, with  the labor market now in balance, we have seen wage growth slow to levels  broadly consistent with productivity trends and 2 percent inflation. Based on  the latest reading of the New York Fed’s Heise-Pearce-Weber Tightness Index,  the labor market is now about as tight as it was in in the first half of 2017,  a period when wage growth and price inflation were low. 1 In short, the labor market  is not a source of inflationary pressure today.\n\nSecond,  measures of underlying persistent inflation have moved in the right direction. For  example, the New York Fed’s Multivariate Core Trend inflation estimate has fallen  to about 2-1/4 percent. 2 Although the decline has  been choppy at times and has slowed over the past year and a half, this measure  is well below the high of 5-1/2 percent that it reached in the summer of 2022.\n\nAnd  third, inflation expectations remain well anchored. Well-anchored expectations  are a bedrock of modern central banking and are important to ensuring low and  stable inflation. Survey- and market-based measures currently show that longer-term  expectations remain at levels consistent with our 2 percent target. In  particular, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations shows inflation  expectations are within their pre-pandemic ranges across all horizons. 3\n\nThat’s  where things stand in terms of our price stability mandate. On the employment  side of our mandate, as I said earlier, the labor market is in a good balance.  Importantly, the cooling from unsustainably tight conditions a few years back  appears to have mostly run its course. Overall, the labor market looks solid,  although some indicators, such as the rates of hires and quits, are a touch  below where they were in the final years before the pandemic.\n\nWith  the labor market in balance and inflation moving toward our price stability  goal, the FOMC decided at its most recent meeting in January to leave the  target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. 4 In terms  of the Fed’s balance sheet, the process of gradually reducing our securities  holdings is proceeding smoothly.\n\nWhere We’re Going\n\nSo,  where do I expect the economy will go in 2025 and beyond?\n\nBased  on the data we have today, I anticipate the growth rates of supply and demand will  continue to slow while staying in balance. I expect real GDP growth to move to  around 2 percent in 2025 and 2026, which is near my estimate of its long-run  potential rate.\n\nWith  growth in supply and demand well balanced, I anticipate the unemployment rate  to remain essentially flat at around 4 to 4-1/4 percent.\n\nAnd I  expect overall inflation to remain around 2-1/2 percent this year, and then  decline to our 2 percent goal in the coming years.\n\nMonetary  policy is well positioned to achieve maximum employment and price stability. The  modestly restrictive stance of policy should support the return to 2 percent  inflation while sustaining solid economic growth and labor market conditions. But  it’s important to note that the economic outlook remains highly uncertain,  particularly around potential fiscal, trade, immigration, and regulatory  policies.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom  where the economy has been to where it’s going, one commonality is that it’s  faced tremendous uncertainties. From where we are now, the economy is in a very  good place. The labor market is in balance. And inflation is on a path to reach  our 2 percent longer-run goal over the next few years.\n\nThe  Committee’s decisions on future monetary policy actions will continue to be  based on the totality of the data, the evolution of the economic outlook, and  the risks to achieving our goals.\n\nI  remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target on  a sustained basis, while being watchful to risks to both sides of our dual  mandate.\n\nWith  that, I look forward to taking your questions.",

    "text": "It's a great pleasure once again to be sharing a platform  with Andrew Bailey as we discuss the transition away from the London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR).\n\nWhile it's no surprise that our work often brings us  together, Andrew and I have joined forces on this issue to such a great extent because  the LIBOR transition is essential to the integrity of the global financial system. Given its ramifications for institutions, markets, and economies  around the world, strong cooperation at the international level is of critical  importance.\n\nAs the saying goes, time flies, and it's hard to believe  that we've reached 2021. It's been more than a decade since LIBOR has been  exposed as a flawed and unreliable reference rate. And, with only 235 days  until January 1, 2022, I am pleased to say that the endgame for LIBOR is clearly  in sight. 1\n\nThis transition has been a monumental feat. The enormous  amount of progress was made possible by a significant and coordinated effort  across the globe, as well as in the United States. I must also mention that the  Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has done outstanding work in preparing  for the move off LIBOR and, equally important, positioning us with a safe and  strong foundation for the post-LIBOR world. 2 And even as I acknowledge all the progress that has been achieved, it's  important to remind everyone that there is still a lot to be done to move off  LIBOR by the end of the year.\n\nThis morning I'm going to talk about key principles that  we should keep in mind as we build a successful post-LIBOR world.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the  usual disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nMeasure Twice, Cut Once\n\nI want to take you back to only a  few years ago, when I was in junior high school. At that time, ticktock was the  sound coming from the clock on the wall, and a mobile device was a transistor  radio.  I was a young student—not of economics, but woodworking. With tools and planks  in hand, I learned the number one rule of that craft: “measure twice, cut  once.”\n\nFast forward to today, and I have yet to pursue a career  in carpentry. But as we prepare for a post-LIBOR world, the same adage runs  through my mind. We must take great care, because the decisions made today will  determine if the LIBOR transition is ultimately successful.\n\nThe past decade has shown us that the problem with using  LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate has been an extremely risky one to have—and  to solve. 3 It's important that we focus not only on making the transition, but also on getting  the transition right. We've learned how challenging and costly it is to move  away from a widely used unsound reference rate. It's essential that we move  forward in a way that ensures that we do not have to go through such a  transition again in our lifetimes. I know I wouldn't wish that on anyone.\n\nA Foundation for the Future\n\nThis  adage has many applications, but it's especially important to keep in mind when  laying a foundation—because the foundation is everything.\n\nBack when I lived in California, we bought a Victorian  house built in the 1890s. The attraction of the house was that it had lots of rooms  and spaces for the family to live. But, the existing foundation was crumbling  and not even attached to the house. In a major earthquake, the house would have  quickly toppled over. We had a new foundation installed, and my mother asked to  see before and after pictures. I responded that one picture would do since all  the work was done underground and out of sight. The difference was that this  house would last another 100 years, while the old house would have lasted only until  the next earthquake.\n\nI see the current juncture in the transition away from  LIBOR to a new reference rate regime in much the same way. We have seen the  development of several reference rates that may meet various needs, including  credit-sensitive rates. 4 Separately, the ARRC just announced the indicators that it will consider in  recommending a forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) term  rate, which with continued market progress, it believes can be achieved  relatively soon. 5\n\nThese are valuable steps in the transition to the new  post-LIBOR world—but in my house metaphor, these represent the rooms of the  house. They're important, but more critical is that they be built on top of a  robust foundation that will withstand any storm or earthquake. And the  foundation must be built to the highest standards and with the very best  materials. 6\n\nThe reason is clear. If you build on a foundation that is  not absolutely sound, you are risking trouble at some point in the future. Unfortunately,  the cracks in the LIBOR foundation ran deep. The short-term bank funding  markets that LIBOR is based on have withered away since the global financial  crisis. Worse, they can dry up completely under stress, as we saw last spring. 7\n\nThis means we need to have a strong and deep foundation  of reference rates that we are confident will be rock-solid, holding up our  financial system under all contingencies, foreseen or unforeseen. For this  reason, in 2017, the ARRC recommended SOFR as the main U.S. dollar reference  rate for the post-LIBOR world. 8 No other rate has the depth of transactions of the repo market that underlies  SOFR, which proved to be resilient even during the market stress last spring. 9 That is essential as a foundation for the enormous markets such as the hundreds  of trillions of dollars of derivatives currently based on LIBOR.\n\nAs we move forward to the post-LIBOR world, we must make  sure that we are building a house with a sturdy foundation with the most robust  reference rates available. With that foundation securely in place, we can build  a house with an assortment of reference rates that can meet the specific needs  of particular borrowers and lenders. Best practices have been developed for the  use of reference rates that are fit for different purposes. 10 11\n\nConclusion\n\nTo close, I'll say that as we look toward a world without  LIBOR, we need to not only count down, but also measure up. In preparing for  the transition, it's time to dig out the tape measure from your toolbox and use  it twice. It's critical that we reflect on how we got here and make decisions  that won't land us back in the same situation we've worked so hard to solve. As  each of you make your own decisions around the LIBOR transition, realize that  together, you are drawing the blueprint that will serve as the foundation for  our global financial system. This is the house we're going to live in for a  long time. Let's build it to last.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. Thank you, Charles,  for that introduction. And thanks to Richard Haass for  the opportunity to speak with the members of the Council on  Foreign Relations once again.\n\nFor the past two years, I’ve begun my remarks by saying how much I  wish we could meet together in person. This time, I really was hoping for a  chance to rewrite the script. After seeing so much progress on vaccinations  over the past year and a moderation in COVID-19 infections during the fall,  just a short time ago many of us had expected that we’d soon be turning the  page.\n\nThe story of the pandemic is a complicated one. It is writing  itself as we live it, and the storyline has been far from predictable. This is,  first and foremost, a health crisis. The unusual and extraordinary nature of  the situation means that circumstances are constantly evolving.\n\nFor the economy, this has meant that what we’ve experienced is  unlike any recession or recovery we’ve seen—or read about—in the past. While  there have been significant improvements in the overall economy, setbacks  persist in some areas, and new challenges have appeared.\n\nI’ll always take an opportunity to quote something from the Lord  of the Rings canon, so I’ll continue with the story analogy and say that for  many people, these past few weeks have felt like we’ve been “There and Back  Again.”\n\nWe again find ourselves in a period of extraordinary difficulty.  The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the United States and  around the world are resulting in new peaks of COVID infections and  hospitalizations, as well as severe strains on the healthcare and essential  services workforce. This is a reminder that the path of economic recovery  continues to be driven by the course of the virus.\n\nIn my remarks this morning, I’ll share more about what we’re  seeing in the incoming data and how it relates to the economic picture in the  United States and the world more broadly. I’ll also highlight the significant progress  we’ve seen in the labor market and my outlook for inflation. Finally, I’ll  discuss the Federal Reserve’s recent policy actions and what they mean for the  future.\n\nBefore  I proceed, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic  Outlook\n\nWhen  I look at the economy, it is through the lens of the Federal Reserve’s “dual  mandate.” These are two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price  stability. Given these goals, my focus is to study and understand the wide  range of developments that affect employment, unemployment, and inflation as  they play out in real time.\n\nAs we start a new year, it’s worth highlighting the key economic  developments of last year, which were defined by a very strong recovery, both  here and abroad. Although we don’t have all the data yet, I expect that U.S.  inflation-adjusted, or real, gross domestic product (GDP) increased by about  5-1/2 percent last year, which would be the strongest growth rate between  fourth quarters in over 35 years.\n\nThe economic snap-back here and abroad has led to global  supply-chain bottlenecks and imbalances between supply and demand that have  contributed to a sharp rise in inflation. Inflation in the United States, based  on the personal consumption expenditures price index, will likely exceed 5  percent in 2021, and inflation rates are elevated in many other countries, too.\n\nLooking ahead, I expect the current Omicron wave to slow growth in  the next few months as people once again pull back from contact-intensive  activities. I also expect that the Omicron wave will temporarily prolong and  intensify labor supply challenges and supply-chain bottlenecks that we have  been experiencing. Current staffing challenges for essential service workers in  the healthcare, transportation, and education sectors will likely have a ripple  effect too. But, once the Omicron wave subsides, the economy should return to a  solid growth trajectory and these supply constraints on the economy should ebb  over time.\n\nConsidering the effects of Omicron on the economy in the  first part of the year, I expect real GDP to increase around 3-½ percent this year. While this is not quite the  blockbuster growth we saw in 2021, it is still well above its long-run trend  and supportive of continued improvement in the labor market. Of course,  experience has taught us not to be overly confident in predictions about COVID  and its effects on the economy, and uncertainty around the economic outlook  remains high.\n\nThe  Labor Market\n\nNow I’ll turn to the employment side of our mandate, where the  picture improved dramatically over the past year. About 6-1/2 million jobs were  added last year, and the unemployment rate plummeted by 2.8 percentage points. In fact, with the unemployment  rate now at 3.9 percent, we have retraced 96 percent of the COVID recession  rise in less than two years. This is lightyears faster than the more than seven years it took for unemployment to  retrace to the same degree after the global financial crisis. With the economy  registering solid growth, I expect the unemployment rate will continue to come  down further to 3-½ percent this year.\n\nThe  strength in the labor market is seen in a wide variety of indicators, including  job openings, quits, and wage growth. The labor market has been especially  robust in recent months for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution. And  female labor force participation and employment have improved, especially for  women with young children.\n\nInflation  and Supply-Chain Challenges\n\nOne  of the foremost concerns surrounding the outlook is inflation, which rose  considerably last year.\n\nThere  are two main contributors to the current high inflation: very strong demand,  especially for goods, and supply bottlenecks. Both have been prevalent  throughout the pandemic. The shutdown of  factories—particularly those in Asia—and widespread lockdowns led to  disruptions to logistics networks, elevated shipping costs, and prolonged  delivery times. A new index created by New York Fed research staff shows  that global supply-chain pressures shot up last year, reaching historically  high levels. 1\n\nThese  challenges are not just top of mind for companies selling their goods or  consumers waiting for their purchases to be delivered. Elevated prices have  real life consequences for so many, particularly for people who are struggling  to cover the rising costs of food, housing, and transportation.\n\nThe  circumstances we are facing today are unlike anything we’ve experienced in the  past. Typical historical episodes cannot be used as reference points for  current conditions. As an example, the very large increases in prices that we  see today are primarily for durable goods. This is a striking turnaround from  the past 25 years when those prices had been trending lower. In contrast, even  with the recent increases, prices on services and non-durable goods are now  fairly close to their longer-run trends. And, even though the Omicron wave is  posing new obstacles, some supply issues are starting to work themselves out as  the economy adjusts to the changing circumstances.\n\nJust  as the pandemic has followed its own script, I anticipate that the dynamics of  inflation will also be different than previous cycles. With growth slowing and  supply constraints gradually being resolved, I expect inflation to drop to around 2-1/2 percent this year, much closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent  longer-run goal. And looking further ahead, I expect inflation to get close to  2 percent in 2023.\n\nPolicy  Actions\n\nThese developments in the labor market and for inflation inform  the Federal Reserve’s policy response and recent actions. In its December 2021  statement, the FOMC said that it would keep the target range for the federal  funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. 2 With inflation having exceeded 2 percent  for some time, the FOMC said it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this  target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with  the FOMC’s assessments of maximum employment.\n\nBecause of inflation developments  and the notable improvement in the labor market, the FOMC also decided to  reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases.\n\nWith our actions, we have started  the process of adjusting the stance of monetary policy away from one of  providing maximum support for the economy. This movement in policy reflects the  gains the economy has made since the beginning of the pandemic and the evolution  of the risks to the achievement of our goals.\n\nThe next step in reducing monetary  accommodation to the economy will be to gradually bring the target range for  the federal funds rate from its current very-low level back to more normal  levels. Given the clear signs of a very strong labor market, we are approaching  a decision to get that process underway. The timing of such decisions will be  based on a careful consideration of a wide range of data and information, with  a clear eye on our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we turn a page on the new year, it’s clear that we have not yet  reached the end of this pandemic story. But despite the challenges, I am  hopeful of a continued strong recovery this year.",

    "text": "Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to join you today. While virtual  meetings like these do have some benefits—I haven't gotten stuck in Midtown  Manhattan traffic or experienced a flight delay in over a year—I know we are all  looking forward to meeting again in person when it's safe to do so.\n\nDuring this pandemic, we have now made an entire trip  around the sun, and then some. The events since March of last year have been  devastating on many levels. The ongoing human toll is a tragedy we will never forget.  The shutdown of a wide range of everyday economic and social interactions posed  tremendous challenges to families, businesses, and communities. And this  extraordinary public health crisis has also had profound economic consequences across  the globe.\n\nOf course, we continue to be affected by the pandemic in  so many ways. But if you look out your window today, the view is very different  than it was a year ago. Now, more than half of  American adults have received at least one vaccine dose, and millions more are  receiving vaccines every week. More people are becoming increasingly  comfortable resuming activities in person, and this is starting to show up in robust consumer  spending, job gains, and economic growth.\n\nSo, now that we are on our second trip around the sun  during this pandemic, many are looking to answer the most common question raised  when traveling by car. And that is, \"are we there yet?\"\n\nWith respect to the virus, I'll leave that question to  the public health experts to answer. But with respect to the economy, I will  say this: while I am optimistic that the economy is now headed in the right  direction, we still have a long way to go to achieve a robust and full economic  recovery.\n\nIn my remarks today I'll set the scene for both the U.S. and  global economies. I'll also highlight a few of the factors I consider when  evaluating the outlook for the economy. Finally, I'll explain what that means  for our monetary policy decisions.\n\nBut before I continue, I need to give the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nLet me begin by saying that despite the challenges and  uncertainties we've faced since the pandemic took hold, the economy is now positioned  to grow quickly. In fact, with accommodative financial conditions, strong  fiscal support, and widespread vaccinations, I expect that the rate of economic  growth this year will be the fastest that we've experienced since the early  1980s. And that's not only a forecast—we are already seeing signs of this pivot  to strong growth in the economic statistics, as I'll discuss in a minute.\n\nIf  this sounds like good news, that's because it is. But robust economic growth  this year by itself isn't enough to achieve the truly strong and full economic  recovery that we are aiming for. We are still far from our goals of maximum  employment and price stability, known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\"\n\nTo  inform our decision-making, we consider a broad range of factors that help us  understand developments affecting economic growth, labor markets, and  inflation.\n\nI'll start with the most common measure of the overall  economy: gross domestic product, or GDP. I mentioned that I expect GDP growth  this year to be the fastest in decades. Specifically, I see inflation-adjusted,  or real, GDP increasing around seven percent this year. This is welcome  progress after the toughest period for the economy in living memory and a  winter when the pandemic was particularly severe, and the economy suffered as a  result.\n\nDespite the truly devastating effects of the pandemic on  employment, recent job growth is the strongest it's been since last summer. Over  900,000 jobs were added in March, and I am hopeful that we will see very strong  job gains over coming months as the economy continues to reopen. It is very  encouraging to see people getting back to work and to see these gains starting  to be more widespread, including in the sectors and regions that were hit hardest  by the pandemic.\n\nBut, even with the gains that have occurred, let's not  forget that there are about eight and a half million fewer jobs today than before  the pandemic. To put that number in context, this is a shortfall similar to  what we saw at the worst point of the aftermath of the Great Recession. This  means we will need big jobs numbers for some time to fully get the country back  to work.\n\nThe labor market indicator that gets the most media  attention is the unemployment rate. But that statistic may not be the best  measure of the overall health of the labor market because people who  temporarily drop out of the labor force don't get counted as unemployed. It's  vital that we look at a wide range of indicators to gauge the health of the  labor market. One measure that I find useful is the employment-to-population  ratio, or \"EPOP\" as it's affectionately known. EPOP is the share of the  population that have jobs according to  a monthly survey of households.\n\nBefore the pandemic, when the labor market was quite  strong, EPOP was about 61 percent. By April of last year, it had fallen nearly 10  percentage points, which translates to 25 million fewer people working—an  astounding drop. Fortunately, EPOP has risen considerably since then, but it's  still more than three percentage points below pre-pandemic levels. That difference translates to about eight and a half  million fewer people working, close to the statistic I cited on the number of  lost jobs that is based on a survey of employers.\n\nThese are aggregate numbers and only tell part of the  story. It's also important to understand that the downturn has  disproportionately affected certain sectors of the economy and segments of  society. Service-sector jobs, especially those in hospitality and leisure, fell  dramatically with last spring's shutdown of the economy. And a large share of the  job losses fell on Black and Hispanic households.\n\nNow I’ll turn to inflation, the other half of our dual  mandate. With recent rises in energy prices and the reversals of last spring’s  large price declines, the inflation rate has increased from the very low levels  seen during the earlier stages of the pandemic. As the economy further reopens,  these dynamics will continue to play out, and I expect inflation to run  somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run goal for the remainder of this year.\n\nIt's important not to overreact to this volatility in  prices resulting from the unique circumstances of the pandemic and instead stay  focused on the underlying trends in inflation. My expectation is that once the  price reversals and short-run imbalances from the economy reopening have played  out, inflation will come back down to about 2 percent next year.\n\nAlthough the U.S. economy is on a very favorable  trajectory overall, we must remember that our economy does not exist in a  vacuum. The speed of the recovery will also depend on the global picture. We  are seeing a slower rollout of immunizations, emerging strains of the virus,  and a more subdued rebound in other parts of the world. This international  context is another reason why a complete U.S. recovery will take time to  achieve.\n\nThe Fed's Policy Response\n\nGiven  all of this information, it's clear there is a big shift in the economy, and  the outlook has improved. But let me emphasize that the data and conditions we  are seeing now are not nearly enough for the FOMC to shift its monetary policy  stance.\n\nFor  these reasons, the FOMC decided last week to keep strong monetary policy  support for the economy in place. Specifically, the FOMC maintained the target  range for the federal funds rate at zero to ¼ percent and made no changes to its  program of asset purchases. In thinking  about adjusting its stance in the future, the FOMC has defined conditions and  measures that will inform its decision-making. In terms of the federal funds rate,  the FOMC said it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range  until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC's assessments  of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to  moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. 1\n\nMaintaining very low interest rates  serves two purposes. First, it makes it easier for households and businesses to  meet their borrowing needs, for things like opening businesses and buying  homes. Second, low interest rates foster broader financial conditions that help  promote the rebound in spending and investment needed to return the economy to  full strength. In particular, we are seeing positive effects from monetary  policy on the demand for durable goods and homes. Our policy response,  alongside vaccinations and fiscal support, has played an important role in  putting the economy on a solid path forward.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor  those asking if we're there yet, I'll leave you with this. Although we still have  a long road ahead of us to achieve a robust and full recovery, with strong  support from monetary policy, I am confident we will reach our destination.\n\nThank  you, and I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "Hello everyone,  and welcome to the New York Fed’s third Economic Inequality Policy Forum . It’s  a pleasure to speak with all of you who are joining us for this conversation. For  me, today’s event is about sharing research and hearing your recommendations,  so I’m going to keep my opening remarks brief.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the disclaimer  that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of  the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSince the outbreak of the pandemic,  we’ve seen severe economic pain, unprecedented levels of unemployment, and enormous  uncertainty about the future. The health and economic effects of COVID-19 have created  tremendous hardship for many Americans across the country, but they have been especially  painful for communities of color.\n\nWe know that people of color and Black  people in particular have experienced higher rates of illness and death. Significant  representation in essential services work and insufficient access to healthcare  are key factors that have contributed to these outcomes. 1 The pandemic’s convergence with a moment of reckoning for the United States around  racial justice makes conversations on issues like equitable growth even more important  and relevant.\n\nWhen I think about equitable growth, I  think about an economy where everyone can realize their full economic  potential. While  today’s conversation is about equitable recovery ,  everyone here is aware that an equitable economy did not exist before the  pandemic. Another  important dimension of equitable growth is equal access. And the pandemic exposed  just how dramatic the fault lines in racial disparities are, for access to  things like healthcare, credit, and housing.\n\nRecent research by  the New York Fed revealed that Black-owned businesses are almost twice as  likely to shutter during COVID-19 as white-owned firms. Black-owned businesses  are also more likely to be located in coronavirus hot spots. 2 I’m hearing about how these statistics are playing out for families through regular  conversations with community leaders like many of you in our district and  beyond. Far too many are facing unemployment, losing access to their healthcare,  and dealing with the threat of eviction.\n\nStructural inequality stifles growth,  but there  is no single silver bullet that can solve the problems laid bare by the pandemic. As we look ahead to a full recovery from  the downturn, we need to set a stronger foundation. We need more investment in health, in education—especially  in the earliest years—in infrastructure, and in training and skills for  well-paying jobs.\n\nThere is so much  work that needs to be done to make sure that we are fostering an equitable recovery  and ensuring that everyone is able to fulfill their economic potential.\n\nThat’s why at the  New York Fed and across the Federal Reserve System, a key area of focus is to better understand what contributes to economic inequities and to finding  solutions. 3\n\nOur economic research and analysis, which my colleagues will share shortly,  highlights many of these stark disparities. 4 In addition, hosting  conversations like this one creates dialogue around these issues and builds  connections between those working for change.\n\nAnother important  role the Federal Reserve plays in promoting economic equity and access is supervising  banks with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act. This law requires banks to  lend, invest, and offer services to low- and moderate-income communities in  areas where the banks operate.\n\nTo emphasize all of  our work in this space, the New York Fed recently published a statement reinforcing  our commitment to fostering a more equitable economy and society: 5\n\nThe New York Fed  stands in unity with all those who oppose racism, hate, and violence. We join  them in a shared desire to root out the intolerable inequities and injustice  grounded in systemic racism that persist in our society. We are firm in the  belief that economic equality is a critical component for social justice and  that we will never have the truly inclusive and strong economy we seek until  access to health, education, safety, and justice knows no racial or other  boundaries. We are dedicated to understanding and finding solutions to the  numerous forms of inequality that communities of color experience and working  with communities in our District to address deep-seated inequities. We are  steadfast in our commitment to work for a more equitable economy and society  for all, and will redouble our efforts in pursuit of this essential mission.\n\nThe pandemic painfully demonstrates the need for us to redouble our efforts  in working with stakeholders from the community, business, nonprofits, and  governments to build a stronger, more equitable foundation for our economy’s  future. This  makes conversations like the ones we are having today so important for us to  listen to and learn from. Our shared commitment to an equitable recovery is  needed now more than ever.",

    "text": "Note: These remarks are based on those delivered at the 9th High-Level Conference on the International Monetary System on May 14, 2019 .\n\nIntroduction\n\nThank  you for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak again at the  Council on Foreign Relations. I’m going to keep my remarks brief so that  there’s plenty of time for Steve to grill me on interest rates, followed by  some thoughtful questions from the  audience.\n\nWith  the mention of interest rates, it’s time I remind everyone that the views I  express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nJohn  Maynard Keynes is credited with saying, “When the facts change, I change my  mind. What do you do, sir?” The economic era we’ve experienced for the last 11 years  has been defined by the Great Recession. There’s the world before, and the  world after, the subprime mortgage crisis, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and  the ensuing financial crisis.\n\nThe Road to Recovery\n\nGovernments  and central banks have spent the intervening years working to get their  economies growing, create jobs, and put regulation in place to prevent another  such catastrophe.\n\nCentral  banks instituted huge asset purchase programs and brought short-term interest  rates to near zero—in some cases below zero—to stimulate economic recovery.\n\nThe  good news is that, for the most part, monetary policy did its job. Advanced  economies have seen steady growth and significant declines in unemployment. But  the recovery has been slow. And despite low unemployment, inflation rates have  been running persistently below central banks’ goals. The Federal Reserve, like  many central banks, has a goal of keeping inflation at 2 percent.\n\nIn  the pre-2008 era, inflation was a major concern for the public and central  banks alike. And, while I will always be vigilant about inflation that’s too  high, inflation that’s too low is now a more pressing problem.\n\nThe  experience of a slow recovery and persistently low inflation is a symptom of  deeper problems afflicting advanced economies. Two changes, unrelated to the  crisis, have been taking place, causing a shift in economic conditions and  quietly shaping the trajectories of advanced economies.\n\nThese  are the “the facts” that have changed. Today I’m going to discuss them in more  detail, and explore our options for dealing with the challenges they  present.\n\n“The Facts”\n\nShifts  in demographics and productivity growth have fundamentally altered the economic  environment in which we operate.\n\nStarting  with demographics, two changes have taken place: People are generally living  longer, and population growth is slowing. Dwindling birth rates are bringing  population growth to a standstill. In OECD countries, population growth  averaged over 1 percent back in the 1950s and 1960s, but it is now running at  half a percent per year, and is expected to gradually fall before dipping into  negative figures by 2070. 1\n\nSlowing  birth rates mean fewer consumers and fewer workers. People planning on longer  retirements will tend to save more. And while this is undoubtedly good news in  many respects, an abundance in the supply of savings also has a big effect on  the global economic picture.\n\nWhen  it comes to productivity, there has also been a stark step-down in growth.  Rapid changes in the kinds of technology we use in our daily lives—robotic  vacuum cleaners, self-driving cars, and facial recognition technology in our  phones—may make this seem counterintuitive or plain wrong. 2\n\nBut  the data are clear.\n\nIn  OECD economies, growth in labor productivity—the amount produced per worker  hour—has averaged a little over 1 percent per year since 2005, about half the  pace seen over the prior decade.\n\nFalling R-star\n\nSo  what does all this mean for the future?\n\nTwo  things: First, slower population and productivity growth translate directly  into slower trend economic growth. Second, an abundance of savings, and a  decline in demand for savings resulting from slower trend growth, together lead  to lower interest rates. All of these factors combined have contributed to  dramatic declines in the longer-term neutral rate of interest, or r-star.\n\nWhile  a central bank like the Fed sets short-term interest rates, r-star is a result  of longer-term economic factors. It’s the rate expected to prevail when  interest rates are neither giving the economy a boost, nor slowing it down.  That’s why it’s called the “neutral” rate.\n\nThe  evidence of a sizable decline in r-star across economies is compelling. The  weighted average of estimates for five major economic areas—Canada, the euro  area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—has declined to half a  percent. 3 That’s about 2 percentage  points below the average natural rate that prevailed in the two decades before  the financial crisis. A striking aspect of these estimates is that they show no  signs of moving back to previously normal levels, even though many advanced  economies have fully recovered from the crisis.\n\nThis  poses significant challenges for monetary policy. When interest rates are low,  central banks don’t have much room to maneuver to deal with a crisis. They will  only be able to cut interest rates by a small amount before they hit zero—or as  economists call it, the “zero lower bound.” Of course, central banks can, and  have, used negative rates to stimulate growth, but they bring with them a  separate set of challenges.\n\nThe  result is that future recoveries will be slow, and slow growth is usually characterized  by low inflation. Persistently low inflation creates a vicious circle, where  expectations of low inflation drag down current inflation. If inflation falls,  central banks will have even less room to maneuver when faced with a slowdown. 4\n\nA Fresh Approach\n\nAll  this begs the question: what can we do to prepare ourselves and our economies  for the next crisis? There’s no single silver bullet that can solve these  challenges. But changes to monetary, fiscal, and other economic policies could  all help us become more resilient.\n\nStarting  with monetary policy, central banks should reassess their strategies, goals,  and the tools they use to achieve them. 5 This might include things  like reassessing how we achieve our 2 percent goal.\n\nOutside  of monetary policy, there are a number of ways fiscal policy can support an  economy. One is to strengthen the “automatic stabilizers,” which, in a  downturn, reduce taxes without legislation to stimulate growth. Another is to  use regulation to enhance financial stability.\n\nFinally,  fiscal and other economic policies can attack the sources of slow growth and  low r-star directly. Demographics are not an area where most economists, or  policy makers, want to meddle—and I’m certainly not going to stand here and say  people should stop living so long!\n\nBut  there are things we can do to improve long-run growth. These include raising  public and private investment in human and physical capital, infrastructure, and  science and technology, as well as removing barriers to participation in the  labor force and the economy more broadly.\n\nIt’s  impossible to predict the future. But we can deal with the present. The  economic environment in which we operate today is a direct consequence of the  demographic and productivity shifts taking place. Low neutral interest rates  are very real, and they’re here to stay.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  facts have changed, and so it is time to change our minds also. It is often  said that change is hard. But, experience teaches us that it is better to  prepare for the future than wait too long. Ultimately, failure to prepare often  means preparation for failure.",

    "text": "It’s a  pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to comment on the paper  “Monetary Policy Transmission to Real Activity.” This is my fourth time as a  discussant at this conference, and I am sure that I speak on behalf of everyone  here in thanking the authors for keeping their paper to only 23 pages. This is  a welcome improvement over the lengthy tomes of yore that threatened to breach  the 100-page mark—not to mention e-mail attachment size limits.\n\nThe  paper provides a clear and succinct analysis of the timing and magnitude of  effects of monetary policy shocks on spending and employment, both in the  aggregate and across sectors. It adds to an extensive research literature that  has focused on these issues, and the analysis and results are broadly  consistent with those in past studies. In a nutshell, monetary policy shocks  have their largest effects on housing, business investment, and spending on  consumer goods—in that order. The peak effect on GDP occurs after a year and  half, and on employment, it takes two years. Of course, there are differences  across models and times, as well as uncertainty bands around these results, but  this captures the main findings of the paper.\n\nI’ll  admit that given the clarity of the paper and the uncontroversial results, I was  somewhat at a loss in terms of what value I could add as a discussant.  Fortunately, a passage in the paper provided a way out of this dilemma. In describing  the recent episode, the authors note that “while inflation  expectations rose, they never became unmoored.  Such stability of inflation expectations  has a potentially important role in understanding  why disinflation has not been accompanied by a  slowdown in real activity.” I couldn’t agree more, and this  passage led me to look more closely at inflation expectations and how monetary  policy shocks affected these expectations.\n\nIn my  remarks, I will broaden the scope of their analysis to cover the behavior of  inflation expectations, including the effects that monetary policy has on them.  There is a large literature on the effects of monetary policy on realized  inflation, analyzed in Havranek and Rusnak’s meta-analysis, 1 but inflation expectations  have received less attention. I will consider questions around two issues:  First, did inflation expectations behave differently during the past five years  relative to the pre-pandemic period? And second, what are the effects of  monetary policy shocks on inflation expectations, and how do they compare to the  effects on real activity described in the paper?\n\nBefore  I utter even one more word, I need to give the standard disclaimer that the  views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of  the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Decade of  Expectations\n\nTo set  the stage, I will briefly summarize the behavior of inflation and inflation  expectations over the past decade. The dashed line in Figure 1 shows the  12-month percent change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 2014 to January  2025. Prior to the pandemic, inflation was low and stable, fluctuating between  0 and 3 percent. But the post-pandemic experience over the past five years  represented a sharp break. Inflation soared during 2021 and the first half of 2022,  then quickly reversed most of that rise.\n\nShort-run  inflation expectations followed the pattern of the rise and fall of inflation,  while movements in medium-term expectations were much more muted. The solid  lines in Figure 1 show the medians of mean one-year-ahead and three-year-ahead inflation  expectations taken from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations  (SCE). The SCE is a monthly, internet-based survey consisting of a 12-month,  rotating representative panel of about 1,300 households. 2 The survey started in mid-2013,  and questions regarding five-year-ahead inflation expectations were added in  2022. Due to that short sample length, I will mostly focus on the SCE’s one-  and three-year-ahead expectations.\n\nA  striking feature of these expectations is that they have fully returned to  levels that prevailed between mid-2013 and mid-2016, before inflation  expectations drifted downward during the extended low inflation experience  prior to the pandemic. One-year-ahead expectations peaked around the same time  as CPI inflation in mid-2022 and subsequently returned to their pre-pandemic  range at the end of 2023. Three-year-ahead expectations peaked much earlier, in  the fall of 2021, and returned to their pre-pandemic range in mid-2022.\n\nExpectations and  Surprises\n\nThe  first question I examine is whether the behavior of inflation expectations over  the past five years has differed from that before the pandemic, something my  colleagues and I first examined in a Liberty Street Economics post in 2022. 3 As in that article, I will  look at this question in two ways.\n\nThe  first is the sensitivity of inflation expectations to “inflation  surprises”—that is, the difference between what a survey respondent expected  inflation to be and what it turned out to be. Athanasios Orphanides and I showed  that this metric provides a useful summary statistic for the behavior of  inflation expectations. 4\n\nThis approach  takes advantage of the rotating panel structure of the SCE. The inflation  surprise is calculated as the difference between CPI inflation recorded in the  last month of an individual respondent’s participation in the survey and their  one-year-ahead inflation expectation at the beginning of their tenure. The  change in inflation expectations is calculated as the difference between a  respondent’s forecast of inflation between the start and the end of their time  on the panel. Table 1 reports the estimated slope coefficients from a  regression of individual revisions in inflation expectations on their inflation  surprises by subsample. The table also reports the estimated coefficient for  the subsample for which we have five-year-ahead expectations.\n\nThese  results yield two insights into the behavior of inflation expectations. First, the  estimated effects of inflation surprises to revisions in inflation expectations  are considerably larger at the one-year-ahead horizon than at longer horizons.  Second, the estimated effects during the past five years are quite similar to  those for the pre-pandemic period.\n\nA second  measure of how inflation expectations respond to a shock is the co-movement of revisions  in expectations across different horizons. The upper panel of Table 2 reports  the estimated coefficients of a regression of the six-month change in  three-year-ahead expectations on the six-month change in one-year-ahead  expectations based on the SCE for two subsamples. The middle panel shows the  corresponding estimate for five-year-ahead expectations for the available data  from 2022-2024. The lower panel shows corresponding results from the Michigan  survey, which uses a subset of respondents each month who are re-interviewed  six months later. The longer-run expectations question in the Michigan survey asks  respondents about their expectations over the next five to 10 years.\n\nNo Signs of Unmooring\n\nThese  results show the same pattern of smaller estimated coefficients with longer  forecast horizons. Interestingly, they indicate that the co-movement between  one-year-ahead and longer-term expectations over the past five years was somewhat  lower than in the pre-pandemic period. This is consistent with the breakdown in  the co-movements between the SCE’s one- and three-year-ahead expectations shown  in Figure 1 . I should emphasize that based on these two metrics, there is no  sign of inflation expectations becoming unmoored at any forecast horizon  relative to the pre-pandemic period.\n\nTaken  together, these results suggest that respondents expect an inflation shock will  gradually decay over the ensuing years. In particular, although inflation  shocks are expected to have persistent effects on inflation, these effects are expected  to largely dissipate after five years.\n\nMonetary Policy  Shocks and Inflation Expectations\n\nFinally,  I will present impulse response functions (IRFs) of inflation expectations to  monetary policy shocks as a complement to the paper’s analysis of IRFs for real  activity. Figure 2 shows estimated IRFs for monetary policy shocks, using the  same measures as in the paper. 5 The IRFs are scaled to  reflect a one-percentage-point increase in the one-year yield on impact. The  projections use monthly data from 2000 to 2024. Because the SCE did not begin  until 2013, the IRFs are computed using data from the Michigan survey and the  Blue Chip Economic forecasts for long-run expectations.\n\nThree Findings\n\nThree  findings stand out from this analysis. First, in all cases, there is a lag of  about eight months before the shock affects inflation expectations. This is  surprising since inflation expectations are forward-looking and should move  soon after a surprise. And it contrasts with evidence of an immediate partial  response in real activity shown in the paper.\n\nSecond,  the magnitude of the responses declines with the length of the forecast  horizon. This is qualitatively in line with the evidence from the regressions  that I reported earlier, suggesting that respondents expect the effects of  shocks on future inflation to decline over time.\n\nThird,  long-run inflation expectations from the Blue Chip survey of forecasters are  not sensitive to monetary policy shocks. This is consistent with other evidence  indicating long-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored  throughout this period. 6\n\nI will  close by again emphasizing the clarity and concision of the paper. For me, it  was instrumental in stimulating further investigations into the effects of  monetary policy on inflation expectations.\n\nPresentation",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning,  everyone. I’m so pleased to be here with you today.\n\nAs it  says on my CV, monetary policy under uncertainty has been my primary area of  research. And after 30 years in central banking, I can unequivocally say:  Uncertainty is the only certainty in monetary policy. 1\n\nToday I  will discuss the economy and monetary policy in the context of a changing and  uncertain landscape. I’ll talk about global inflationary trends, inflation  expectations, and how the Federal Reserve is working to achieve its dual  mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nBefore  I go further, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Economy Today\n\nI will  start with a snapshot of the U.S. economy. The economy entered the new year on firm  footing. GDP and job growth have been solid, propelled by robust gains in the  labor force and productivity. After a period of cooling, a wide range of labor  market indicators, including the unemployment rate, have stabilized, with  supply and demand broadly in balance and the labor market no longer a source of  inflationary pressure. 2\n\nThe  disinflationary process has continued on a bumpy path toward the FOMC’s  inflation goal of 2 percent over the longer run. After reaching a 40-year high  of over 7 percent in 2022, inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage  change in the personal consumption expenditures price index—has fallen to about  2-1/2 percent, still somewhat above our 2 percent target.\n\nThat’s  where things stand now, but the future is highly uncertain. Recent data—both hard  and soft—are sending mixed signals. Measures of policy uncertainty have  increased sharply in recent months. This is also seen in responses that  explicitly ask about uncertainty in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer  Expectations (SCE). 3 And my business and financial market contacts highlight the role of greater  uncertainty, especially around trade policy, in making it more difficult to  plan investments and hiring.\n\nNavigating  uncertainty during periods of large changes will be a recurring theme in my  remarks today. I will dig deeper into two topics that are important to  understanding inflation in the current macroeconomic environment and that will  no doubt shape the future course of our economies. And since this is the “ Macroeconometric Caribbean Conference,” I will of course bring evidence from macroeconometric  models to bear on these topics.\n\nGlobal Inflation  Trends\n\nIt goes  without saying—especially to this audience of representatives of central banks  from the Caribbean region—that our economies are interconnected, and developments  in one part of the world can have effects that ricochet across the globe. To be  sure, a country’s economy is influenced by domestic developments, but when it  comes to inflation, global factors are a major driver, one that stretches  across countries. This dynamic was particularly evident during the past five  years, when countries around the world experienced a sharp rise and subsequent  fall in inflation. 4\n\nEconomists  at the New York Fed have developed a statistical model, called Global  Multivariate Core Trend Inflation (Global MCT), to measure and better  understand the behavior of the persistent components of global inflation. 5 This model uses inflation  data from seven economies to estimate a common global inflation trend, as well  as global sectoral inflation trends in tradable sectors, such as core goods and  food and energy. It exploits the co-movement of the persistent components of  inflation across both countries and sectors.\n\nThis  analysis uncovers very strong common components of inflation, with global  factors explaining an overwhelming share of the persistent movements in  inflation rates across the economies in the sample, except for Japan’s.  Importantly, these results are not driven by the pandemic and post-pandemic periods,  as they are evident in pre-pandemic inflation data going back to 1990.\n\nAnalysis  using this model finds that supply shocks were the primary driver of the rise  and subsequent decline in global inflation trends over the past several years,  both at the general and sectoral levels. 6 From the beginning of 2021  to late 2022, the estimated global inflation trend soared, then reversed most  of that increase over the following two years. Although supply factors were  primarily responsible for these swings, demand factors also played a role in  boosting the global inflation trend from late 2021 to mid-2024.\n\nWhen  inflation is a global phenomenon, what can individual central banks do to  control it? Here again, Global MCT provides a useful lens to analyze this  question. Based on an estimated vector autoregressive model that includes  Global MCT, U.S. monetary policy shocks have economically and statistically significant  effects on both the global inflation trend and the core goods global inflation  trend. And the peak effect occurred after about 12 months. Similar results are  obtained using a version of the model with European Central Bank monetary  policy shocks.\n\nThese  empirical analyses illustrate how monetary policy spills over and spills back  to domestic and international rates of inflation. In the United States, as in  other countries, monetary policy decisions are based on domestic mandates. But  as policymakers, we also understand that our decisions can affect global economic  and financial conditions, and in turn can spill back onto our shores. This is one  reason why it’s so important that we meet in venues such as this one to share  insights and analyses.\n\nInflation  Expectations\n\nI will  now turn to the critically important role of inflation expectations and how households  and businesses think about future inflation. Well-anchored inflation  expectations are paramount for ensuring price stability, especially during  times of turbulence and uncertainty. The experience of the past five years is a  testament to this: Well-anchored expectations were key to achieving  disinflation while avoiding severe economic consequences.\n\nIt is  useful to distinguish between short-run expectations that tend to respond to  inflation shocks and medium- and longer-run expectations that should be less  responsive when expectations are well anchored.\n\nIn the  past two months, we have seen clear signs of a broad-based increase in  short-term inflation expectations, but most indicators point to continued  well-anchored medium- and longer-term expectations. For example, market-based  measures of inflation expectations have risen at shorter horizons but have been  stable at longer horizons. And New York Fed business surveys from February show  that businesses in the Federal Reserve’s Second District expect higher cost  increases, particularly among manufacturing firms and businesses with a high  import share of their inputs. While year-ahead inflation expectations of firms  also moved up, their longer-term expectations remained stable. 7 And the February SCE indicated  that expectations are largely unchanged over the medium and longer run. 8\n\nThe  sensitivity of short-run inflation expectations to inflation shocks—while  medium- and longer-run expectations are well anchored—is also seen in formal econometric  analysis using data from the SCE and the University of Michigan surveys. 9\n\nIn  estimating the sensitivity of inflation expectations at different forecast  horizons to “inflation surprises”—that is, the difference between what a survey  respondent expected inflation to be and what it turned out to be—the analysis  yields two insights. First, the estimated effects of inflation surprises to  revisions in inflation expectations are considerably larger at the  one-year-ahead horizon than at longer horizons. Second, the estimated effects  during the past five years are similar to those during the pre-pandemic period.  Broadly similar results are obtained when analyzing the co-movement of  revisions in expectations across different horizons.\n\nThis  analysis indicates that households expect an inflation shock will gradually  decay over the ensuing years. In particular, although inflation shocks are  expected to have persistent effects on inflation, these effects are anticipated  to largely dissipate after five years. Importantly, there are no signs of  inflation expectations becoming unmoored relative to the pre-pandemic period.\n\nMonetary Policy Amid  High Uncertainty\n\nAs I  said at the start of my remarks, the economy entered this year in a good place,  but there is a high degree of uncertainty about what the future holds. So, what  does this all mean for monetary policy?\n\nAt its  meeting on Wednesday, the FOMC decided to leave the target range for the  federal funds rate unchanged at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In the accompanying  statement, the Committee noted that uncertainty around the economic outlook has  increased, and it is attentive to risks to both sides of its mandate. 10 The Committee reaffirmed  its strong commitment to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation  to its 2 percent objective, and its policy decisions will be based on a careful  assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of  risks.\n\nIn  addition, the Committee decided to slow the pace of reduction in its holdings  of securities. The ongoing process of balance sheet reduction follows the  principles and plans laid out in 2022. 11 Last June, the Committee took  a first step in slowing the pace of balance sheet reduction. 12 That process has  progressed very well, resulting in a reduction of over $2 trillion in our  securities holdings so far. This week’s decision to slow it further is a  natural next step to smooth the transition from abundant reserves to a level that  is somewhat above ample. This action has no implications for our intended  stance of monetary policy and should not affect the size of our balance sheet  over the medium term.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nTurning  to the U.S. economic outlook, I expect GDP growth this year to step down from last  year’s pace in part because of a slowdown in labor force growth due to lower immigration  rates. But it’s hard to know with any precision how the economy will evolve.  Uncertainty is high, and there are many scenarios that could play out, depending  on fiscal and trade policies and geopolitical and other developments. In the  Summary of Economic Projections that the FOMC released this week, the central tendency  of projections for GDP growth this year was between about 1-1/2 and 2 percent,  and for inflation, between about 2-1/2 and 3 percent. 13 Any of these outcomes—or  even some others outside these ranges—seem completely plausible to me.\n\nIn  addition, it is hard currently to assign probabilities to these scenarios. This  is something economists refer to as Knightian uncertainty. In these  circumstances, it will be important to take a holistic view in monitoring and  assessing all available information. It is also fitting to take a risk  management perspective in assessing the economic outlook, in evaluating the  appropriate stance of monetary policy, and in making policy decisions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere  is certain uncertainty in monetary policy. The current modestly restrictive  stance of monetary policy is entirely appropriate given the solid labor market  and inflation still running somewhat above our 2 percent goal. It also  positions us well to adjust to changing circumstances that affect the  achievement of our dual mandate goals.\n\nWhatever  the economy has in store for us, I am committed to supporting maximum  employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. We are excited to have  you back in person at the New York Fed for the annual U.S. Treasury Market  Conference. You may have noticed that our auditorium has gotten a new look  since you were last here. I hope you'll find it a comfortable space since we  have a very busy day ahead.\n\nThe Last Time (LIBOR's Version)\n\nThe topic of today's conference is resiliency  in the U.S. Treasury market. Before I speak about that, I'd be remiss if I did not  take this opportunity—hopefully for the last time—to remind everyone that we  are entering the final stretch of the transition away from the London  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). I'm pleased to report that the transition has  been extremely successful so far, thanks to the significant and coordinated  efforts from stakeholders across the globe.\n\nA  special shout-out to the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) for its outstanding  work and dedication in guiding the move off of U.S. dollar LIBOR and promoting  the adoption of more robust rates like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).  They proved that LIBOR was far from irreplaceable.\n\nBut there's still more work to do. Over the  next several months, the industry's focus needs to be on  the remediation of legacy contracts well before the cessation of LIBOR, so  we don't have a last-minute rush. Once we complete this  final stretch of the transition, we can say good riddance to LIBOR.\n\nEven when the transition from LIBOR is  complete, the ARRC's work will continue to shape the future. The ARRC has laid  out best practices for the use of reference rates grounded in overnight SOFR. 1 Importantly, this envisages only limited use  of term SOFR, which doesn't share overnight SOFR's foundation in the  deep and robust Treasury financing markets. It's incredibly important that  financial institutions consistently act in ways that are aligned with these  best practices so that we don't have to come back and clean up another mess. Unlike  with Star Trek, the last thing anyone wants to watch is the sequel, \"LIBOR: The  Next Generation.\"\n\nThe LIBOR transition is tangible proof of what  can be accomplished when all stakeholders—public and private—work together and  persevere, against all odds. That sense of purpose, collaboration, and accomplishment  gives me hope for the main topic of the conference today: Treasury market resilience.  And yes, there is much work to be done.\n\nBefore I go on, here's a reminder that you  know all too well I cannot leave behind—and that's the usual disclaimer that  the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nWell-Functioning Markets and Monetary Policy\n\nI've long made the case that a  well-functioning U.S. Treasury market is critical to our economy, and, in fact,  the entire world. 2 , 3 But  now, I'd like to take it a step further to explain how critically important a  resilient financial system—and especially a resilient U.S. Treasury market—is for  monetary policy.\n\nIn the current environment of high global inflation,  central banks around the world have been taking strong, decisive actions to  restore price stability. Restoring price stability is of paramount importance  because it is the foundation of sustained economic and financial  stability. Price stability is not an either/or, it's a must have.\n\nFor monetary policy to be most effective, financial  markets must function properly. Monetary policy influences the economy by  affecting financial conditions, with the Treasury market at the center of it  all. If the Treasury market isn't functioning well, it can impede the  transmission of monetary policy to the economy.\n\nThe Great Debate\n\nThese issues recall a longstanding debate over  what should be done when there is a trade-off between monetary policy and financial  stability goals. In the decade before the pandemic, this debate occurred in the  context of inflation running persistently below the FOMC's long-run 2 percent target. 4\n\nOn one side, there were those who argued that an  extended period of accommodative policy aimed at boosting inflation would contribute  to a buildup of asset prices, leverage, and risk-taking that would ultimately undermine  financial stability. They concluded that policy should lean against the wind of  financial stability risks, even at some cost to achieving the price stability  goal.\n\nOn the other side, I and others have argued  that using monetary policy to address longer-term financial stability considerations  could come at a high cost in terms of current economic activity and could also undermine  credibility in the central bank's long-run inflation goal. For example, based  on the estimated effects of monetary policy on GDP and house prices, using  monetary policy alone to fully deflate the housing bubble that preceded the global  financial crisis would have caused a decline in output much larger than the one  that occurred during the recession of 2007-09. 5\n\nToday we are seeing this debate resurface, but  in a very different economic reality. Some now argue that there is again a  trade-off between price stability and financial stability goals, but this time  it is because large and rapid shifts in monetary policy may contribute to  stresses and expose vulnerabilities in global financial markets. Investors and  financial institutions need to adjust to a rapidly changing and highly  uncertain environment. And heightened uncertainty can add to market volatility,  resulting in diminished market liquidity.\n\nBut these debates about trade-offs expose a  basic problem.\n\nEveryone is  familiar with the idea of a \"jack of all trades.\" Using monetary policy to mitigate financial  stability vulnerabilities can lead to unfavorable outcomes for the economy. Monetary policy should not try to be a jack of all trades and  a master of none. There must be a better way.\n\nFortunately, there is. Instead of looking at  this as a problem of choosing the point on an unfavorable trade-off curve, we  must look for ways to shift the curve by enhancing the resilience of the  financial system. The value of this approach to building resilience was  demonstrated by the global efforts to strengthen the banking system following  the global financial crisis. Despite the economic disruptions caused by  COVID-19 and Russia's war on Ukraine, the banking system has functioned well,  serving as a source of strength for the economy, not a weak link.\n\nAlternative Solutions, Prudent Results\n\nAs monetary policymakers, we need to count on  well-functioning markets that promote financial stability as we pursue our  price stability and maximum employment goals. So, what can be done to enhance  financial stability?\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have instituted  changes over the past few years that support market functioning in times of  stress. In 2021, the FOMC introduced the Standing Repo Facility and the FIMA  Repo Facility. 6 These standing facilities are priced such that they are not  used often in normal times but remain ready to provide liquidity as needed  should funding pressures arise.\n\nWe also must continue to prioritize having a  robust financial system, and that starts with the most core market of all: the  U.S. Treasury market. The Inter-Agency Working Group for  Treasury Market Surveillance is doing just that. Ahead of today's conference,  the group published a progress report around its work to enhance the resilience  of the U.S. Treasury market, which I strongly encourage everyone to read. 7 The report emphasizes progress made on the proposed  expansion of central clearing, enhancements to data collection and  transparency, and the potential for evolution in market structure.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the  world is not static. The Treasury market has increased enormously over the past  quarter century, and the key players have changed significantly. And the rest  of the financial system continues to evolve, with nonbank financial institutions  (NBFIs) playing an increasingly important role. The Financial Stability Board  has been actively engaged in this space, assessing global trends and risks  through a monitoring exercise and developing policy recommendations to  strengthen oversight and regulation. 8 Here  at the New York Fed, we too are deepening our expertise and monitoring of NBFIs.\n\nBut this is not just a job for the official  sector. Just like the successful public-private collaboration that is moving  the world off of LIBOR, the private sector must do its part to enhance  resilience as well. It means constructively and actively engaging in improving  the resilience of the Treasury market and related markets. It also means  planning to build resiliency for episodes of volatility that can impair market  liquidity, and preparing for periods that have less certain funding, such as at  year-end. And it means being a source of strength to the financial system and  the economy, not a weak link.\n\nConclusion\n\nDebates around financial stability and  monetary policy have been longstanding and have tended to focus on unfavorable  trade-offs. Central banks must avoid being a jack of all trades and master of  none. The time is now to find solutions that strengthen our financial system  without compromising our monetary policy goals. These issues are complex, but  the need for meaningful progress on strengthening the resilience of core  financial markets is clear.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nI am excited to see many of you joining  us here—live—at our building on Liberty Street in downtown Manhattan. It means so much to us to be able to bring people together to  discuss the future of New York City in our first-ever hybrid public event. I'd  also like to welcome all the guests and panelists who are joining us virtually.\n\nThis is more than a conference. It's a  moment that marks a new era for how we think about living and working in this city.\n\nIn fact, if you were to wander down these  halls, you'd see my colleagues bringing that idea to life. We  reopened our doors to all employees last month, and we're so glad to be  back and working together in person. For us, this is part of a flexible model  that allows for a mix of days in the office with remote work.\n\nWe believe that being here in this way is  best for our employees, best for this city, and best for the Federal Reserve's Second  District, which is the region we serve.\n\nOur physical presence gives us the  opportunity to better engage with and learn from our communities. Our mission  is to make the U.S. economy stronger and the financial system more stable for  all segments of society, and supporting local economies is a key part of that.  The New York Fed is proud to be an anchor institution of New York City, and we  want the city—and all of its people—to thrive.\n\nI'd like to share a  bit more about why having these discussions is so important for the future of  this city and for us here at the New York Fed. And with that, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views  I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe City's Present and Future\n\nNative New Yorker John Jay Chapman once said, \"The present in New York is so powerful that the  past is lost.\"\n\nYou can feel that powerful reality when  you walk the streets today. Indeed, this city was once an epicenter of the  pandemic: we were hit early, and we were hit hard. The virus spread rapidly,  leading to widespread hospitalizations and a devastating death toll.\n\nDuring the initial months of the  pandemic, one out of five jobs in the city disappeared. In the restaurant  industry in particular, 70 percent of jobs were lost. Other industries, such as  retail and even health care, experienced outsized losses as well.\n\nTwo years later, we've seen great  progress toward a recovery. The most recent data show that well over two-thirds  of New York City's job losses have been reversed. Still, areas of the New York  City economy, especially those dependent on visitors and office workers,  continue to struggle and are lagging the nation in recovery. Despite the  challenges, there is palpable energy and momentum propelling us into the  future.\n\nNow that our focus is on the recovery, we must create an equitable future for all residents of this  city. We must make sure that all of the people who  live, work, or own a business here have a chance to succeed. It is  essential that we build a stronger foundation so that everyone can fulfill  their economic potential, both here in New York and around the nation.\n\nThat's why it's  critical that we prioritize tackling some of the city's biggest problems, including  poverty and inequality, and issues in areas such as infrastructure and  transportation.\n\nThese issues are not new; they existed  long before the pandemic. And there is no simple or single solution to solve  them. But as we plan for a better future, we must understand how New York's challenges  have evolved since March 2020 and how they are playing out in the current  environment. With that knowledge and awareness in mind, we can chart the path  forward.\n\nThe New York Fed's Role\n\nThis brings me to our conference today. The  New York Fed is proud to play a role in connecting and  convening leading policy influencers, stakeholders, and thinkers from  across the city and around the country. Our goal in hosting events like these is  to be a catalyst for collaboration and creative solutions. The panelists we'll  hear from today will help us accomplish just that. They each have a deep  understanding of the issues, a familiarity with the communities, and many  innovative ideas to share.\n\nThe topics on the agenda complement the  work that many people do in this very building every day. Our outreach and  community development team is actively engaged with people and leaders around  the Second District through regional visits, advisory councils, and frequent  events. And our researchers study economic conditions and trends in the region  and make their findings widely available.\n\nThis is a pivotal  time for our city. We are excited to  be back here, and we will continue this important work in forums similar to  this one. I hope you'll partner and engage with us, because our collective  efforts will make a difference.\n\nLet's take advantage of this  opportunity—this New York moment— and together shape a  bright future for this great city.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nOn behalf of the New  York Fed, let me welcome you all to this year’s U.S. Treasury Market  Conference. Many thanks to the distinguished speakers and panelists for joining  us here, and to the event organizers for putting together today’s outstanding agenda.  I’m looking forward to a valuable and productive conversation.\n\nThis gathering is a  recurring calendar item every fall. But the topics that we discuss each year do  not stand alone. Think of it as leveling up in a video game—which is one of my  favorite pastimes by the way, or dare I say, “present times”. At each  conference, we advance our understanding of the Treasury market to the next  level. And in the genre of gaming, this game is multiplayer. It’s remarkable to  think about what we’ve accomplished in this decade-long enterprise of  interagency collaboration. This work continues to be imperative, so we must keep  playing. I mean that in the working sense, of course.\n\nBefore I keep going, I  must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine  alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThree Levels of Play\n\nThe remarks that I’ve  given at past conferences have focused on taking stock of the Treasury market  and sharing updates on our collective efforts. 1 My comments today will be  a retrospective into the events, developments, and lessons learned over the past  seven years. I will then explain how all of that has shaped the FOMC’s thinking  around monetary policy implementation and the design of our ample reserves  implementation framework. I’ll also bring you up to speed with regard to where  the Federal Reserve stands on its balance sheet strategy.\n\nSo, let’s return to the  video game analogy and start at level one—the episode of volatility known as  the “flash rally” of 2014. That period of market stress served as a sharp  reminder that financial markets are not static: they evolve in response to  changes in technology, regulation, business models, and with the addition of  new players and participants.\n\nThat initial level made  it clear that safeguards and systems must evolve so that these markets can  continue to function well in every circumstance and under any condition. So, from  there, we jumped to the next level. And that’s the imperative of market  resiliency. We learned the importance of creating a system that can better  withstand the unforeseeable and the unpredictable. Because when the  unforeseeable and unpredictable did happen, as we saw in the “dash-for-cash” in  2020, it resulted in significant stresses in the Treasury market and related  markets that threatened to spread to broader financial conditions.\n\nThis leads me to level  three. A resilient financial system is critically important for monetary  policy. Because monetary policy influences the economy by affecting financial  market conditions, its effectiveness relies on well-functioning markets, with  the Treasury market at the heart of it all.\n\nGood news—we’ve unlocked  the next level of my remarks. And that is an explanation of the FOMC’s approach  to monetary policy implementation to support effective interest rate control  and smooth functioning of these core markets.\n\nFraming the Frameworks\n\nWe’ve established that monetary  policy implementation frameworks are critically important to the conduct of  monetary policy. 2\n\nIn supplying reserves to  the banking system, the Federal Reserve has multiple goals that frequently  involve trade-offs. 3 First  and foremost, it targets a level of the policy interest rate and aims to  minimize the variability of the policy rate around that target. In addition, it  has objectives related to supporting financial stability and the smooth  functioning of financial markets.\n\nThe core of any  operational framework is the supply of reserves, which can range from a low  level, or “scarce,” to “ample” and “abundant.” The “price” of reserves is the  spread between the market interest rate and the rate earned for holding  reserves at the central bank. When reserves are scarce, the slope of the demand  curve for reserves is steep. A small change in the quantity of reserves results  in a meaningful change in the spread. When reserves are ample, the demand curve  flattens but still slopes downward, so that small changes in the quantity of  reserves have modest effects on the spread. And when reserves are abundant, the  demand curve is essentially flat.\n\nA central bank has two  sets of tools it can use to supply reserves. First, it chooses an ex ante  aggregate level of reserves to supply to the banking system. Second, it may  make available lending facilities to the banking system that offer loans to  financial institutions at an interest rate determined by the central bank. If  the ex ante supply of reserves is sufficiently low, the additional demand will  be met by the lending facilities. Note that both tools are a means to supply  reserves: In the first, the supply is set in advance, while with the latter, it  adjusts endogenously to market conditions.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing  that the two tools can be mutually reinforcing in achieving desired outcomes.  For example, lending facilities limit upward movements in interest rates on  days of high demand, thereby reducing the ex ante supply of reserves needed to  control short-term rates. 4\n\nFederal Reserve: Ample Reserves and  Tools\n\nThe Fed’s operational  framework has evolved over time, reflecting its experience with large balance  sheets since the global financial crisis. 5 In January 2019, when the  decline in the Fed’s asset holdings implied that the quantity of reserves would  soon fall below an “abundant” level, the FOMC formally adopted an ample  reserves strategy. 6\n\nThe FOMC has defined  this framework as one in which “control over the level of the federal funds  rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the  setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active  management of the supply of reserves is not required.” 7 Accordingly, the ex ante  supply of reserves is chosen to be sufficiently large to meet the demand for  reserves on most days.\n\nOne important tool the  FOMC has established to ensure interest rate control is the overnight reverse  repo facility (ON RRP), which, alongside the interest paid on reserve balances  (IORB), helps set a floor for the federal funds rate. Through the ON RRP, eligible  counterparties “lend” to the Federal Reserve at the rate set by the FOMC,  currently at the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate. Usage  of the ON RRP adjusts automatically to market conditions, rising and falling  with supply and demand, which is particularly important in a dynamic market.\n\nThe ON RRP has proven to  be a very effective and flexible tool to support interest rate control to the  downside. When Federal Reserve asset holdings push reserves above ample, the ON  RRP relaxes the tight relationship between balance sheet size and reserves and  acts as a safety valve in supporting smooth transmission of monetary policy to  markets. As the size of the balance sheet falls, market rates rise above the  rate offered at the ON RRP and, as a result, usage of the ON RRP declines to  very low levels. The dynamic usage of the ONRRP is seen in Figure 1 , which  shows average monthly usage of the ON RRP from 2016 through October of this  year. The ON RRP was used extensively when it was economically sensible for the  Fed’s counterparties to do so. By contrast, it has very limited usage when repo  rates are well above the ON RRP rate, as is the case today.\n\nIn 2021, the Federal  Reserve introduced the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), which nicely complements  the ON RRP by providing interest rate control to the upside. 8 The SRF rate is set at the  top of the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate. This combination of  an ample supply of reserves and an SRF rate at the top of the target range  reduces the day-to-day reliance on the facility except during periods of  significant upward pressure on rates resulting from strong liquidity demand or  market stress.\n\nBy ensuring that  adequate liquidity will be available in a wide variety of circumstances, the  SRF plays a critical role in capping temporary upward pressure on rates and  assures markets of effective interest rate control and smooth market  functioning. It is best thought of as a way of making sure that the overall  market has adequate liquidity consistent with the FOMC’s desired level of  interest rates. In that regard, it differs from other lending facilities—such  as the discount window—that aim to provide individual banks with liquidity when  the need arises.\n\nThe SRF has been  effective as reserves have moved from abundant toward ample. Over the past two  months, SRF usage has risen from essentially zero to having greater frequency  and higher volume of take-up, especially on days of temporary repo market  pressures, as shown in Figure 2 . Like the ON RRP facility, the SRF’s  effectiveness relies on market participants availing themselves of the SRF  based on market conditions, free of worries about stigma or other impediments.  I fully expect that the SRF will continue to be actively used in this way and  contain upward pressures on money market rates.\n\nFederal Reserve: The Way Forward\n\nAt the onset of the  pandemic, the Fed, along with central banks around the world, responded quickly  to restore market functioning, 9 causing reserves to rise  well above ample, as they did in many jurisdictions.\n\nIn June of 2022, the Fed  began the process of reducing the size of its balance sheet to transition  toward an ample level of reserves. 10 The FOMC said it intended  to stop balance sheet runoff when it deemed reserves were somewhat above ample,  and then allow reserves to decline further as other liabilities, such as  currency, grow.\n\nThe process has worked  according to plan. The Fed’s securities holdings have shrunk from a peak of  about $8-1/2 trillion in 2022 to $6-1/4 trillion today. At its meeting in  October, the FOMC decided it would conclude the reduction of its aggregate  securities holdings on December 1. 11 This decision was based  on clear market-based signs that we had met the test of reserves being somewhat  above ample. 12 In particular, repo rates have increased relative to administered rates and  have exhibited more volatility on certain days. Accordingly, we have been  seeing more frequent use of the SRF. And the effective federal funds rate has  increased somewhat relative to the IORB after years of that spread being at a  stable level. These developments were expected as the supply of reserves closed  in on ample. 13\n\nLooking forward, the  next step in our balance sheet strategy will be to assess when the level of  reserves has reached ample. It will then be time to begin the process of  gradual purchases of assets that will maintain an ample level of reserves as  the Fed’s other liabilities grow and underlying demand for reserves increases  over time. Such reserve management purchases will represent the natural next  stage of the implementation of the FOMC’s ample reserves strategy and in no way  represent a change in the underlying stance of monetary policy.\n\nDetermining when we are  at ample reserves is an inexact science. I am closely monitoring a variety of  market indicators related to the fed funds market, repo market, and payments to  help assess the state of reserve demand conditions. Based on recent sustained  repo market pressures and other growing signs of reserves moving from abundant  to ample, I expect that it will not be long before we reach ample reserves.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith that, we’ve arrived  at the endgame of my remarks. We’ve learned a lot over the past decade. The  FOMC’s monetary policy implementation framework is designed to support an  adequate supply of liquidity under a wide range of circumstances. The  combination of an ample supply of reserves and the Standing Repo Facility  enables the Committee to maintain strong interest rate control and flexibility  regarding changes in the size of its balance sheet. This operational framework  has proven to be highly effective—and continues to work as designed.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "It's  a great pleasure to be sharing a platform with Andrew Bailey to discuss the  transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a topic of  critical importance to the safety and soundness of the financial system.\n\nThe ongoing  transition away from LIBOR has ramifications for institutions, markets, and  regulators across the globe, making cooperation at the international level of  critical importance.\n\nThe  last time Andrew and I spoke together on this topic was almost exactly a year  ago, when the world was a very different place. 1 In the intervening months,  we've experienced a devastating pandemic that has caused hardship across the  world, and has led to the worst recession in living memory here in the U.S.\n\nSince  the advent of the pandemic, this is the first speech I've given on a topic  other than the economic outlook and monetary policy. Despite the array of  challenges we're facing as a result of the coronavirus, transitioning away from  LIBOR continues to be of paramount importance.\n\nToday,  I'm going to talk about what the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and  others have achieved in the face of enormous adversity and what still needs to  be done between now and the end of next year.\n\nBut  before I continue, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express  are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Challenging Year\n\nWith  a pandemic that's touched every aspect of our way of life, it's easy to forget  why transitioning away from LIBOR is so important.\n\nIt's  13 years since the LIBOR scandal first hit the headlines, and it's still an unreliable  reference rate. LIBOR submissions from banks are largely based on judgment,  rather than real numbers, making the rate vulnerable to manipulation and fraud,  and bringing increased risk with its use in financial contracts. 2 In fact, this problem  became even more acute this spring during the period of severe market stress,  when term lending transactions based on LIBOR became even more scarce than  usual. Thus, the urgency to switch to more robust reference rates and deal with  legacy contracts has not gone away; if anything, this issue has become more  pressing.\n\nUnsurprisingly,  the pandemic has caused some reprioritization of work streams as the official  sector and market participants adjusted to social distancing restrictions and  worked to keep their employees safe.\n\nBut  the importance of transitioning from LIBOR is so great that despite the effects  of COVID-19, the overall timeline remains the same: There are now 537 days until  the existence of LIBOR can no longer be assured. The clock is still ticking,  and it's critical that regulators and institutions continue to work together to  ensure we are all ready for January 1, 2022.\n\nWhat We've Achieved\n\nEven  with the unprecedented situation of a global pandemic, I'm encouraged that a  huge amount of progress has been made on the LIBOR transition since the last  time Andrew and I spoke.\n\nFar  from slowing down, the pace of progress has accelerated.\n\nIn  the United States, there have been numerous consultations issued, a raft of  recommendations published, and a variety of new tools developed, all to support  the transition to more robust reference rates.\n\nThese  include a consultation on the recommended spread adjustment methodology for  cash products transitioning to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the  publication of recommended fallback language for adjustable rate mortgages  (ARMs) and student loans, as well as checklists to help different types of  institutions navigate the transition.\n\nThere  has also been a great deal of interest in the possibility of SOFR-linked  Treasury securities, and the U.S. Treasury recently asked for comments on such  a concept. The consultation closed last week, and I hope many of the  institutions present today shared their views. 3\n\nAnother  significant milestone is that in March, the New York Fed started the  publication of SOFR averages and a SOFR index. The New York Fed now publishes  three compound averages of SOFR daily, which are less variable than daily rates  and may be useful for some applications. 4\n\nSOFR  is based on a much higher volume of underlying transactions than LIBOR, making  it more representative of market conditions and less vulnerable to manipulation.  It's also the rate selected by the ARRC as its preferred replacement for USD LIBOR.\n\nIf  the pandemic has confirmed one thing about financial benchmarks, it's the  resilience of robust reference rates, including SOFR. On a backdrop of enormous  turmoil and uncertainty, both in financial markets and the broader economy,  SOFR was a dog that didn't bark (or bite). The New York Fed publishes a number  of overnight secured and unsecured funding rates, and during this tumultuous  period, they all moved in concert, anchored by the rates set by the Federal  Reserve. This success may not have attracted headlines, but it demonstrates the  value of robust reference rates that are a fair representation of the  underlying market.\n\nIn  addition in March, the ARRC proposed draft legislation in New York to deal with  legacy contracts—a particularly challenging issue. 5\n\nAnd  finally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will stop accepting ARMs based on LIBOR by  the end of 2020. And they plan to begin accepting ARMs based on SOFR later this  year. 6\n\nYes,  it's fair to say that a huge amount of progress has been made in many directions  over the past 12 months. It's encouraging that even in the face of a global  pandemic, neither the official sector, nor the industry, has lost forward  momentum.\n\nNext Steps\n\nBut  we cannot afford to be complacent. With just 537 days left, there's still much  to accomplish.\n\nThis  year the ARRC reiterated its commitment to support the industry through the remainder  of the transition. In April, the ARRC published its 2020 objectives, which laid  out a number of important milestones that need to be achieved. 7\n\nKey areas  of focus include work to address the challenges associated with legacy  contracts, the development of a forward-looking SOFR rate, and finalizing the ARRC-recommended  spread adjustment for legacy contracts transitioning to SOFR.\n\nIn  May, the ARRC followed up with the publication of recommended best practices  for market participants. 8 This included timelines  for a variety of products, including floating-rate notes, business and consumer  loans, securitizations, and derivatives.\n\nIt's  critical that market participants meet the milestones set out in the best  practices and have a clear understanding of any outstanding exposure they have to  LIBOR. There are checklists and implementation guides available for institutions  working to adopt SOFR, 9 and market participants  are encouraged to adhere to the ISDA protocol on a timely basis following its  publication.\n\nIt  doesn't matter whether you're a large global bank or a local company with a  handful of employees, you need to be prepared to manage your institution's  transition away from LIBOR. I hope it goes without saying that new use of USD LIBOR  in financial contracts should stop. As I've said before, let's not make the  existing hole we're trying to climb out of even deeper. 10\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll  conclude with this: Transitioning away from LIBOR to more robust reference rates  is a huge and complex undertaking. It involves numerous jurisdictions, multiple  types of institutions, and a raft of financial products. Since July last year,  the ARRC, the official sector, and market participants have all made remarkable  progress in the most challenging of circumstances to prepare themselves for the  end of LIBOR. The ongoing commitment and the forward momentum are welcome,  positive signs. As we mark days off the calendar, let's all make sure we use the  remaining time wisely and effectively.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nJohn  Maynard Keynes is credited with saying, “When the facts change, I change my  mind. What do you do, sir?” Over the past decade, policymakers across the globe  have been focused on getting their economies and financial systems back in  order. But at the same time, a sea change in supply-side realities has taken  place. These changes have redefined what is achievable, and challenged  conventional wisdom on monetary policy.\n\nShifting  demographic trends and a slowdown in productivity are driving slower trend growth  and historically low levels of real interest rates across the globe. This new  set of facts requires us to rethink what we once knew, reassess how to best  foster strong and stable economies, and ready ourselves for the future.\n\nWith  that start, it’s time I remind everyone that the views I express today are mine  alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee  or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Road to Recovery\n\nFollowing  the global financial crisis, central banks took bold and decisive actions to  right their economies and bring them back to health. Short-term interest rates  were brought to near zero—in some cases below zero—and held there for many  years ( Figure 1 ). The combination of low short-term rates and asset purchase  programs has driven yields on long-term sovereign debt to historically low  levels ( Figure 2 ). In large parts of Europe and Japan, short- and long-term yields remain near zero, a  full decade after the onset of the financial crisis.\n\nEconomic  developments since this unprecedented monetary stimulus provide valuable  insights into the efficacy and limitations of monetary policy. On the positive  side of the ledger, advanced economies have seen steady growth and significant  declines in unemployment, with rates today near, or in many cases well below,  those seen before the crisis ( Figure 3 ). Bold monetary policy actions surely  played an important role in averting far greater catastrophes and aided  economic recovery.\n\nHowever,  this success was achieved only after a disappointingly slow recovery and many  years of economic hardship. And, despite the improvement in the real side of  economies, inflation rates have persistently been below central banks’ goals  ( Figure 4 ). The fact that inflation has been running below target in most  advanced countries—the United Kingdom being the most prominent outlier—suggests  that this challenge is not due to factors specific to a single country.  Instead, there are more systemic factors at play.\n\nInvestors  view these low inflation readings not as an aberration, but rather a new  normal. This is evidenced by a broad-based decline in market-based measures of  longer-run inflation expectations since the mid-2000s, with the UK again  providing the exception ( Figure 5 ).\n\nThis  experience of slow recovery and persistently low inflation is a symptom of a  deeper problem afflicting advanced economies—the root cause of which is a  combination of low neutral interest rates and the lower bound on interest  rates, a topic to which I now turn.\n\nWhat’s Past Is Prologue\n\nUnderlying  these events has been a sea change in the supply side of economies, owing to  fundamental shifts in demographics and productivity growth.\n\nTwo  demographic trends are evident: People are generally living longer and population  growth is slowing. Overall life expectancy in member countries of the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has increased  from about 65 years in the 1950s to nearly 80 years today, and is projected to  exceed 90 years by the end of this century ( Figure 6 ). 1 Despite this increase in  longevity, dwindling birth rates are bringing population growth to a  standstill. In OECD countries, population growth averaged over 1 percent back  in the 1950s and 1960s, but is now running at half a percent per year, and is  expected to gradually fall before dipping into negative figures by 2070 ( Figure 6 ). 2\n\nWhen  it comes to productivity, the changes are no less dramatic. In OECD economies,  growth in labor productivity—the amount produced per worker hour—has averaged a  little over 1 percent per year since 2005, about half the pace seen over the  prior decade ( Figure 7 ) * . A major factor driving the slowdown is a dramatic  decline in the growth rate of “total factor productivity,” or TFP, a measure of  innovation and technological change. 3\n\nAs  Bob Gordon has taught us, U.S. productivity growth tends to cycle between  periods of high growth in decades following fundamental breakthroughs in  science and technology, and relatively fallow periods of steady, incremental  improvements. All the evidence indicates that we are in one of the latter  periods of “normal” productivity growth of 1 - 1.5 percent per year, and that  things will likely stay that way until the next scientific or technological  revolution. 4\n\nR-star Descends\n\nThese  global shifts in demographics and productivity have two important implications  for the future of our economies and for monetary policy. First, slower  population and productivity growth translate directly into slower trend  economic growth. Second, these trends have contributed to dramatic declines in  the longer-term normal or “neutral” real rate of interest, or r-star.\n\nSlower  trend growth reduces the demand for investment, while longer life expectancy  tends to increase household saving. 5 This combination of lower  demand for and higher supply of savings, along with other factors, has pushed  down r-star. With open capital markets, these global changes in supply and  demand affect r-star globally.\n\nThe  evidence of a sizable decline in r-star across economies is compelling. The  weighted average of estimates for five major economic areas—Canada, the euro  area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—has declined to half a percent  ( Figure 8 ). 6 That’s 2 percentage points below the average natural rate that prevailed in the  two decades before the financial crisis. A striking aspect of these estimates  is that they show no signs of moving back to previously normal levels, even  though economies have recovered from the crisis. Given the demographic waves and  sustained productivity growth slowdown around the world, I see no reason to  expect r-star to revert to higher levels in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe  global decline in r-star will continue to pose significant challenges for  monetary policy. Given the limited policy space for interest rate cuts in  future downturns, recoveries will be slow and inflation below target. The  limitation in the ability of central banks to offset downturns results in an  adverse feedback loop, whereby expectations of low future inflation drag down  current inflation and further reduce available policy space. 7\n\nNew Facts, New Approaches\n\nPolicymakers  around the globe need to prepare for the challenges of navigating the new  realities of slow global growth and low r-star. This necessitates new thinking  and approaches to monetary, fiscal, and other economic policies.\n\nStarting  with monetary policy, central banks should revisit and reassess their policy  frameworks, strategies, and toolkits, to maximize efficacy in a low r-star  world. The Bank of Canada already regularly does this, and the Federal Reserve  is currently undergoing a review of its framework and strategy. 8 Absent such changes,  central banks will be severely challenged to achieve stable economies and  well-anchored inflation expectations.\n\nOutside  of monetary policy, there are a number of avenues by which fiscal authorities  can enhance the resilience of economies to negative shocks. One is to  strengthen the “automatic stabilizers” that provide a boost to the economy  during a downturn. A second is to align debt management decisions more with  monetary policy. For example, during a downturn, the fiscal authority could  choose to shorten the duration of debt issuance to reinforce the effects of  central bank quantitative easing. Third, regulatory and supervisory policies  that support the resilience of the financial system can limit the economic  effects of negative shocks.\n\nFinally,  fiscal and other economic policies can attack directly the sources of slow  growth and low r-star. This includes raising public and private investment in  human and physical capital, infrastructure, science and technology, and  policies aimed at removing barriers to participation in the labor force and the  economy more broadly.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  facts have changed, and so it is time to change our minds also. It is often  said that change is hard. But, experience teaches us that it is better to  prepare for the future than wait too long. Ultimately, failure to prepare often  means preparation for failure.\n\nFigures * Correction (May 23, 2019): An earlier published version of these remarks referred to an incorrect time frame for recent growth in labor productivity.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank  you for that warm welcome. As you may be aware, last year I moved from San  Francisco to take on the role of President of the New York Fed. In many ways  California and New York are like different countries—the weather is a big  adjustment, for starters!\n\nBut through  my meetings with community leaders and visits to the Bronx and Brooklyn, I’ve  come to appreciate that we’re facing a lot of the same issues in my new home  that I saw in the San Francisco Bay Area. The main topics of discussion—displacement as a result of gentrification, inequitable growth, and a critical  shortage of affordable housing—are all ones we were grappling with on the  West Coast as well.\n\nThese  issues are complex and challenging, and there are no easy answers, so I want to  start by saying thank you for all the important work you do.\n\nThere  are a couple of topics I want to talk about today. The first is why the work  you do is so important, and the second is the role I see the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York can play in supporting you today, and going forward.\n\nBefore  I go any further I’ll give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express  are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDual mandate\n\nApart  from a stint running a pizza shop, I’ve worked in the Federal Reserve System  for my whole career, nearly 25 years. And I’m not alone. When you ask people at  a Federal Reserve Bank how long they’ve worked there, their response is often  measured in decades, not years. What makes them stay? Working for a  mission-driven institution.\n\nAnd  speaking of our mission, the Federal Reserve has two goals: maximum employment  and price stability. We want our economy to reach its potential in terms of  jobs and growth and we want low, stable inflation. While these two goals are  critically important, they are broad and high-level. The monetary policy  decisions we make have important effects on the overall number of jobs and  wages, but they don’t determine what economic growth looks like across  communities, or who benefits from it.\n\nThat’s  why our outreach and community-based work is a key priority. It’s an  opportunity for us to take all of the data, all of the things we know about the  economy, and help one another as we tackle the very real issues that shape the  everyday lives of Americans.\n\nEquitable Growth\n\nWe’re  closing in on the longest economic expansion on record, unemployment is at  historically low levels, and inflation is close to our 2 percent target. From a  pure monetary policy perspective, this is a healthy economy. But I’m acutely  aware that not everyone is feeling the benefits of the economy’s good  performance.\n\nRecent  work by my colleagues at the New York Fed crystalized the economic challenges  faced by some of those living in New York City. Since the early 1980s wage  inequality has increased in the United States, but that increase in inequality  has been particularly sharp in large urban areas like this one.\n\nIn  New York City and Northern New Jersey, someone near the top of the income  distribution earns seven times that of someone closer to the bottom. This contrasts  with other parts of New York State, where the number is somewhere between four  or five times. 1\n\nThat’s  not to say things are necessarily easier in areas with less inequality. In  fact, many of the areas with less inequality are also challenged by limited job  opportunities and declining populations. It does mean that not everyone is  benefiting from growth equally.\n\nOne  of the reasons for this is that the type of growth in the city has  disproportionately benefited one type of worker. Growth in New York has  generated demand for highly skilled workers, who are often more highly paid and  highly mobile. This drives up housing prices and contributes to gentrification,  which often goes hand in hand with displacement.\n\nWords  like “gentrification” and “displacement” sometimes can feel impersonal or  cliché. For some, gentrification conjures images of fancy coffee shops and  high-priced fashion boutiques. But the reality can be heartbreaking. Families  who’ve lived in a home for generations are driven out, communities break up,  and the social fabric of a neighborhood is irreparably damaged.\n\nWe  seek growth that enables everyone to fulfill their economic potential. We want  enterprise that supports communities, and communities that have the tools to  flourish through investment.\n\nThis  is good for families, good for communities, and good for the economy.\n\nOf  course, you don’t need me to tell you this. You face the challenges of  inequitable growth every day through your work. And that’s why I’d like to talk  about the role we can play to support you create a New York City that benefits  every part of the community.\n\nWhen  I think about our work at the New York Fed, both today and going forward, it  boils down to three things: We connect organizations with data and research to  amplify the power of their work, we convene stakeholders to share experiences  and best practices, and we are a catalyst for initiatives and approaches that  help tackle some of the most complex challenges confronting our communities.\n\nConnect\n\nSome  of our greatest assets are our data, analysis, and research. And I don’t say  that only because I am an economist by training! Data is at its best when it  leads to meaningful action.\n\nI  just came back from a trip to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which  are part of the New York Fed’s district. The overwhelming feedback I received  from community leaders there was how useful they found our research reports for  thinking about how to strengthen their local economy.\n\nAn  example closer to home is the work we do looking at the credit behavior of  households at the zip code level.\n\nAnalysis  from the New York Fed is used by Financial Empowerment Centers across New York  City to support people on low and middle incomes get out of financial trouble  and build a credit profile. It also acts as a barometer for the success of  programs, which helps practitioners learn which interventions are most  effective.\n\nConvene\n\nAs  well as connecting people with research and data, we play an important role  creating spaces where different stakeholders convene, discuss the challenges  and opportunities facing their communities, and share best practices.\n\nThis  is where our workforce development program comes in, and it’s an area where  Federal Reserve Banks from across the country have been collaborating to share  knowledge among key stakeholders.\n\nThe  work we’re doing bringing together schools and local employers is also in this  vein. We owe it to young people to ensure that their investments in education  pay off and that there’s a job at the end of all their hard work and study.\n\nFostering  connections between community colleges and employers is one way we can help to  make sure the next generation is ready for the opportunities our economy has to  offer. We’ve published loads of research on this subject, and we’re putting  some of our findings into practice with a series of roundtables, collaborating  with colleges, workforce development organizations, and employers across the  state.\n\nDisplacement  and equitable growth are areas where we can do more. I’m pleased to share that  later this year we’ll be hosting a series of listening sessions on these  topics. We plan to bring together community development experts and nonprofits  to better understand what’s happening across the district. We want to know  what’s worked in the communities that have seen equitable growth, the challenges for those that haven’t, and what we can  do about it.\n\nWe  hope the findings from these sessions serve as a tool for those areas on the  cusp of gentrification to ensure every part of the community benefits from  local investment.\n\nCatalyze\n\nFinally,  I’m going to turn to this idea of how we can be a catalyst for action.\n\nOur  desire to create change is the reason we created resource guidebooks—publications  that collate data, information, and contacts about specific communities. We’ve  published guidebooks for parts of New York State and New Jersey, and we have  another one in the works for Puerto Rico. They act as a starting point for local  stakeholders and investors looking to support equitable growth in underserved  areas.\n\nAnother  example where we’ve acted as a catalyst is our Small Business Credit Survey.  The findings revealed the challenge small businesses face accessing loans for  expansion. The cost of originating smaller loans is often so great that banks  won’t take them on. But as a result of the gap being identified, one bank is  now partnering with the Community Reinvestment Fund to refer small businesses  to the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund. 2\n\nSmall  businesses are vital to job creation and play an important role in our  communities, so it’s essential we support them to get access to the credit they  need to grow.\n\nI  don’t want to talk about access to credit without saying a few words about the  Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. Our work supervising CRA compliance supports  efforts to make sure credit gets to where it’s needed most.\n\nA  large amount of work has been going on at the Board of Governors to review the  modernization of the CRA, and we held two roundtables here in New York City to  better understand what’s working and where we need change.\n\nWhat’s  important is that efforts to modernize CRA maintain and strengthen the emphasis  on ensuring all communities in our nation have access to affordable credit.\n\nThese  principles—connect, convene, and catalyze—will continue to guide us forward  as we grow our outreach programs and drive progress. They are the ways we  contribute to an economy that works for everyone, above and beyond the  high-level levers of interest rates and asset purchases.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll  conclude where I began. As a policymaker I’m constantly weighing up the dual  mandate, thinking about how we keep the economy on track, and balance maximum  employment with low, stable inflation. But these decisions don’t affect the  kinds of jobs that are created or who benefits from growth.\n\nThe  type of growth we have, where it manifests, and who benefits from it play a  huge role in shaping both the fabric of society and the lives of New Yorkers.  That’s why our community and outreach programs are so important to me.\n\nI’d  like to close by reemphasizing my gratitude for your commitment to this city.  Community development work is complex, challenging, and never done. But it’s  essential for building healthy communities that support everyone to reach their  full economic potential.\n\nThank  you. I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "Good morning. Let me welcome you to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York and to our second Future of New York City conference.  And thank you to the speakers, participants, and organizers who make this such  a valuable forum.\n\nThis year we are celebrating the  centennial of this landmark building here at 33 Liberty Street. We are proud of  our history as a downtown anchor institution and look forward to the next 100  years.\n\nBefore I go further, let me give the  standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt was not too long ago—a little over  four years back—when some predicted that the future of New York City was quite  bleak. Others even went as far to declare that New York City is dead forever.\n\nWell, that forecast didn’t age well.\n\nI imagine those of you sitting right  here in this auditorium would agree with me. Just to get here this morning, you  likely had to catch a ride on a crowded subway, train, bus, or ferry. Or maybe  you were brave enough to drive over a bridge or through a tunnel and then search  for parking. Perhaps you stood in a long line waiting for coffee or a pastry,  or dodged tourists taking a photo right in the middle of the sidewalk. I won’t  even mention the e-scooters and bikes. And it’s only 9:00 a.m.\n\nThat’s because New York City is again one  of the most alive cities on Earth.\n\nIn truth, that 2020 forecast was based  on the reality during that moment in time, at least economically speaking. New  York City was the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., and our region was hit  especially hard. According to New York Fed business surveys, business activity  plunged to historic lows in April 2020, as fear of contagion kept many people  at home and efforts to stop the spread of the virus shutdown large parts of the  regional economy. 1 About 60 percent of service-based businesses and more than half of  manufacturers reported at least a partial shutdown of their operations early on  in the pandemic. Layoffs were widespread. The initial job loss of more than 20  percent in New York City exceeded the national decline of 15 percent. 2 You’ll hear more about how the employment situation has evolved over the past  four years from my colleague Jaison Abel in a few minutes.\n\nI lived and worked here in Lower Manhattan,  so I remember just what that drastic change felt like. The city went from being  packed at all hours of the day to being almost unrecognizable. Here at the New  York Fed and in offices just like ours across the city, only essential workers came  to work in person. And neighborhood businesses and services—and the employees  that supported them—suffered as a result.\n\nBut after that chapter came a remarkable  rebound. To be clear, things are not exactly the same as they were prior to the  pandemic. The city had to adapt to changes in office attendance and commute  patterns, and the fallout is still lingering. But we are back on our feet, and  the current reality is far different from the onset of pandemic and the period  that followed. One indication that’s important for our conversation today is that  we’ve recovered the jobs lost during the pandemic and then some.\n\nNow, shows and venues are packed. It’s  hard to get restaurant reservations at certain places. Apartment vacancies are  low. And office workers are back, even if in some cases it’s only a few days a  week.\n\nWhen we first hosted this conference in  2022, the discussion focused on remote work and the city’s infrastructure, with  a particular focus on an equitable recovery. The overarching question that shaped  our conversations in that moment was, “ What is the future of New York City?”\n\nNow, that question has shifted. There’s  no doubt that New York City has a great future. So today, we’re asking, “ What  kind of future do we want to build for New York City?”\n\nThe future will build and expand on what  has worked so well for the city in the past. The foundational aspects that have  made New York so successful for so long are still present. The excitement and  enthusiasm that draw people to live and work here have not changed. At the same  time, many of the challenges have not changed either. For example, the high  cost of living and housing availability are still predominant concerns, among  others.\n\nThe entertainment, arts, businesses,  culture, and landmarks that we have here in New York cannot be replicated  elsewhere. But those experiences can only be had if there are jobs and a  healthy economy to support it all. It’s important that we invest in the study  of the challenges and opportunities for employment in this city, so that we can  build the future.\n\nOur conference today will do just that. In  our sessions this morning, we’ll talk about how employment was and continues to  be impacted by shifts in the city. And we’ll discuss similarities and  distinctions across industries and occupations, initiatives that will attract  and retain a robust workforce, and more.\n\nThanks again to our speakers and  panelists for the knowledge and insight they bring to this event, and to all of  you for attending and demonstrating your commitment to shaping the future of  this great city.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nHello, everyone. I’m so  pleased to be here today.\n\nOne of the most  enjoyable parts of my job is meeting with business and community leaders to learn  more about our local economies—their challenges and opportunities, their long-established  businesses and new industries. It’s fitting that I started my visit in Schenectady,  known as “The City that Lights and Hauls the World.” And now I’m here at the  Albany NanoTech Complex, a hub for innovative, cutting-edge nanotechnologies. Both  cities, just 20 miles apart, have made—and continue to make—important  contributions to our regional and national economies.\n\nI’ll talk a bit about  that today, although my focus will be on the U.S. economy. I’ll discuss what the  soft and hard data are telling us, and how the totality of the data is informing  my outlook for the economy.\n\nBefore I go further, I  must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine  alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Capital Region\n\nAs an economist and  student of history, I can’t help but start with a few words about the Capital Region.  In the 1880s, when Thomas Edison created components for his electrical  illumination system and the Schenectady Locomotive Works built engines, few  could have imagined the ways that electricity and locomotives would transform  entire societies and economies. They represent what economists call general-purpose  technologies, or GPTs.\n\nToday, many experts  think that the latest GPT is artificial intelligence, or AI. And among the many  research initiatives underway here are technologies that support the  advancement of AI.\n\nIn the 140 years between  these GPT bookends, this region has continued to invest in new industries and training  for workers, helping to drive the health of the local economy.\n\nThe Soft Data\n\nOf course, all  communities in the Federal Reserve’s Second District—which includes the Capital  Region—are affected by national trends. In recent months, the changing landscape  around fiscal and trade policies has heightened economic uncertainty among  consumers, business owners, and financial market participants.\n\nAs an economist and  policymaker, I am always studying the data. Recently, there have been some  interesting dynamics in both the soft data, which are typically survey measures  of perceptions and expectations, and the hard data, which are economic readings  of what has actually happened.\n\nI’ll start with the soft  data. Over the past few months, surveys carried out by the New York Fed and  others have highlighted a great deal of pessimism and uncertainty about the  economic outlook. With respect to the Second District, our surveys of  manufacturers and service firms indicate that economic activity has declined  modestly, and concerns about tariffs are widespread. Several of my business contacts reported pulling back on capital spending and  putting hiring on hold until the economic uncertainty lessens.\n\nIn the New York Fed’s national Survey of Consumer Expectations, consumers’  uncertainty remains elevated not just about inflation, but also about housing prices and their earnings growth. 1 According  to this survey, households have scaled back their expected spending growth on  nonessential items.\n\nThe soft data have also revealed some  good news. Longer-run inflation expectations have remained stable. And with the  pullback in tariffs since early April, short- and medium-term inflation  expectations have receded back close to their pre-pandemic averages. These  patterns are consistent with market-based measures of inflation compensation  and with most other survey-based measures. This is critically important,  because well-anchored inflation expectations are essential for sustained price  stability.\n\nThat said, survey  respondents report that uncertainty about inflation remains elevated.\n\nThe Hard Data\n\nAs a policymaker, I have  often said that my decisions are data dependent—but not data-point dependent. I  look at the totality of the data for underlying trends. I am particularly focused  on those that affect the achievement of the FOMC’s dual mandate goals of  maximum employment and price stability, which is defined as 2 percent inflation  over the longer run.\n\nAnd what much of the hard data shows is that the U.S. economy remains  in a good place.\n\nWith regard to real GDP growth,  the data have been unusually noisy, reflecting front-running of tariffs. That  said, consumer spending and investment have been resilient overall so far this  year.\n\nOn the employment side  of our mandate, labor market conditions have remained solid, with the unemployment  rate at a little over 4 percent for the past year.\n\nOn the price stability side  of our mandate, inflation has  continued to come down from its COVID-era spikes. With the labor market in  balance and wage pressures having abated, inflation, as measured by the personal  consumption expenditures price index, has moved  close to our 2 percent longer-run  goal.\n\nHowever, measures of underlying  inflation—such as core inflation, which strips away volatile categories like  food and energy—are still somewhat above our 2 percent target. And there are signs that tariffs are affecting specific  categories of goods.\n\nWe are seeing evidence of these  patterns in the Second District. In May, New York Fed staff fielded a special  survey to gauge the extent to which New York and New Jersey businesses were  passing on tariff-induced cost increases to their customers. Manufacturers  indicated that over the past six months, the cost of their tariffed goods had risen  by about 20 percent, on average. For service firms, the increase was about 15  percent. The survey’s key finding is that about three-quarters of respondents  in both sectors passed along at least some of these higher costs to their  customers by raising prices.  Indeed, almost a third of manufacturers and nearly half of service firms  reported fully passing along all tariff-related cost increases. 2\n\nWhat does this all mean  for the economy going forward?\n\nMy answer is that we  need to be vigilant in analyzing the totality of the data to see how conditions  evolve.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nGiven the continued uncertainty,  the solid labor market, and inflation still above our 2 percent goal, the FOMC  decided at its meeting last week to leave the target range for the federal  funds rate unchanged at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. 3\n\nMaintaining this modestly  restrictive stance of monetary policy is entirely appropriate to achieve our  maximum employment and price stability goals. It allows for time to closely  analyze incoming data, assess the evolving outlook, and evaluate the balance of  risks to achieving our dual mandate goals.\n\nIn addition, the FOMC  continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and  agency mortgage-backed securities. Despite market volatility related to trade  policy and other developments, that process continues to go very smoothly.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nIn an uncertain  environment, any number of outcomes can occur. But based on what the data tell us  today, I expect uncertainty and tariffs to restrain spending and reduced  immigration to slow labor force growth. As a result, I expect real GDP growth this  year will slow considerably from last year’s pace, to just over 1 percent.\n\nWith this deceleration  of real GDP, I expect the unemployment rate to rise to around 4-1/2 percent by  the end of this year. I anticipate the tariffs enacted this year will boost inflation  to around 3 percent in 2025, and then for inflation to gradually decline to 2  percent over the next two years as the tariff effects fade.\n\nConclusion\n\nMuch of the soft data  we’ve seen in recent months captures the heightened uncertainty about the path of  the economy. But it’s too early to say what the future trajectory of the hard  data will be.\n\nAs always, I remain  focused on all the data, and that includes what I have learned on this  trip to the Capital Region. No matter what comes our way, I am committed to  supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent  longer-run goal.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood  morning. I’m so pleased to be here at Binghamton University, a true gem of the SUNY  system. Meeting with students, educators, and business and community leaders is  a valuable and enjoyable part of my job.\n\nThe New York Fed represents the Federal  Reserve System’s Second District, which includes New York State, northern New  Jersey, western Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This is  a diverse region made up of many smaller local economies. Therefore, it’s  important for me and my colleagues at the New York Fed to collect data and learn  about the challenges and opportunities facing all of the communities we serve.\n\nThat said, monetary  policy affects everyone, and the Federal Reserve is committed to using its  tools to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Today, I will talk about monetary policy and how the Fed  is working to fulfill this dual mandate. I’ll also give you my outlook on the U.S.  economy.\n\nBefore  I do, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today  are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nObsessing Over Data\n\nAs I’ve  traveled around the Southern Tier region, I’ve enjoyed seeing the emergence of  the colors of autumn. Tracking fall foliage is a hobby for many. What I like is  that it’s all about data. “Leaf peepers” submit field reports on changing color  conditions, and experts pore over the information. One forecast predicts we will  hit peak foliage in four days. 1\n\nAt the  Fed, we’re equally obsessed with data. In our case, we study data about the  economy—whether here in the district, across the country, or around the world. So,  I’ll highlight some of the data that help my understanding of how the economy  is performing relative to our dual mandate goals, as well as what policy  actions we can take to achieve these goals.\n\nWhen inflation  became unacceptably high and the labor market exceptionally tight, the FOMC acted  with resolve to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent longer-run target. The Committee’s strong actions have helped bring the  economy much closer to our goals. Imbalances between supply and demand in the  economy have mostly dissipated, even as the economy and employment have  continued to grow. And inflation, as measured by the personal consumption  expenditures (PCE) price index, has declined from over 7 percent in June of 2022  to just 2-1/4 percent in the latest reading. There’s still some distance to go  to reach our goal of 2 percent, but we’re definitely moving in the right  direction.\n\nThe data paint a picture of an economy that  has returned to balance, or in a word that the English majors in the room may  appreciate, “equipoise.” In light of the progress we have seen in  reducing inflation and restoring balance to the economy, the FOMC decided at  its most recent meeting to lower the interest rate that it sets. Simply put,  this action will help maintain the strength of the economy and labor market while  inflation moves back to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nMoving to Price  Stability\n\nI’ll go  further into our policy decision and what it means for the economic outlook in  a minute. But first, I’ll give more details about each side of our dual mandate,  starting with inflation. I’ll use an onion analogy that I have found useful over  the past two years to demonstrate how inflation’s three distinct layers are  normalizing at different rates. 2\n\nThe onion’s outer layer represents globally traded commodities. As the economy  started to rebound from pandemic shutdowns and demand began to soar, inflation  surged, then rose further when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, supply and  demand have come into balance, and these prices have generally been flat or  falling.\n\nThe middle  onion layer is made up of core goods, excluding commodities. Demand for goods rose  sharply as the economy emerged from the pandemic downturn—just as global pandemic-related  supply-chain disruptions significantly hampered supply. But, as seen in the New  York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, those supply pressures have  eased, and core goods inflation has returned to pre-pandemic norms. 3\n\nThe  inner onion layer comprises core services. Although this category is taking the  longest to normalize, the disinflationary process is well underway here too. For  example, measures of underlying inflation that tend to be heavily influenced by  core services inflation today average around 2-1/2 percent. 4\n\nOne positive piece of data that reinforces my  confidence that inflation is on course to reach our 2 percent goal is that  inflation expectations remain well anchored across all forecast horizons. This  is seen in the  New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations as well as other surveys and  market-based measures. 5\n\nA Labor Market in  Balance\n\nNow  I’ll turn to the employment side of our mandate. And no surprise, I’ll point to  data. A wide range of  metrics—including the unemployment rate; measures of job openings, hiring,  quits, and employment flows; and perceptions of job and worker availability—indicate  that the very tight labor market of the past few years has now returned to more  normal conditions and is unlikely to be  a source of inflationary pressures going forward.\n\nRecent analysis by researchers at the New  York Fed provides a useful way to gauge whether the labor market is tight or  loose. 6 They find that you can effectively summarize the state  of the overall labor market in terms of its effect on compensation growth by using  just two indicators: the rate at which employees quit their jobs and the ratio  of job openings to job seekers. In fact, once you take these two measures into  account, other labor market metrics that get a lot of attention—such as the  unemployment rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio—don’t provide  additional useful information.\n\nCombining these two measures into an index of  labor market tightness provides two key insights. First, data as of the second  quarter of this year indicate that the labor market is about where it was in  early 2018—a period of solid labor market conditions and low inflation. Second,  compensation growth should soon return to levels that prevailed prior to the  pandemic.\n\nSeasons of Change\n\nSo, the  labor market is solid. The economy is in a good place. And inflation is closing  in on our 2 percent longer-run goal. With the risks to achieving our goals now  in balance, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds  rate by half a percentage point, to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. In addition, the  Committee continued to normalize the holdings of securities on the Fed’s balance  sheet. 7\n\nLooking  ahead, based on my current forecast for the economy, I expect that it will be  appropriate to continue the process of moving the stance of monetary policy to  a more neutral setting over time. The timing and pace of future adjustments to  interest rates will be based on the evolution of the data, the economic  outlook, and the risks to achieving our goals. We will continue to be data-dependent  and attuned to the evolution of economic conditions in making our decisions.\n\nWith monetary  policy moving to a more neutral setting over time, I expect real GDP to grow between  2-1/4 and 2-1/2 percent this year and to average about 2-1/4 percent over the  next two years. I anticipate the unemployment rate to edge up from its current  level of about 4 percent to around 4-1/4 percent at the end of this year and stay  around that level next year. With the economy in balance and inflation  expectations well anchored, I expect overall PCE inflation to be around 2-1/4  percent this year, and to be close to 2 percent next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  economy has been on a remarkable journey. In two years, the red-hot labor  market has normalized, and inflation has come within striking distance of our 2  percent longer-run goal—all while employment and the economy continue to grow.\n\nWe instituted and  maintained a very restrictive monetary policy stance until the data gave us confidence  that inflation is sustainably on course to 2 percent. With this progress toward  achieving price stability, moving toward a more neutral monetary policy stance will  help maintain the strength of the economy and labor market. Although the  outlook remains uncertain, we are well positioned to achieve our dual mandate goals.",

    "text": "Good morning, and welcome to the New  York Fed.\n\nWe’re so pleased to host you for today’s  event. Over the next few hours, we’ll share perspectives on topics that are important  to you as representatives of community and regional banks across the Federal Reserve’s  Second District.\n\nIf you’ve been here and heard similar  remarks before, you may recall that this is the point where I offer a crucial piece  of information. And that’s the standard disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe next crucial piece of information  that I’ll mention, on which I know you all agree, is that community and  regional banks play a central role in this country’s robust financial system  and in the economic health of this region.\n\nA critically important goal for the  Federal Reserve is to maintain a safe and competitive banking system—and  community and regional banks are a big part of that system.\n\nTo meet that objective, part of our core  mission at the New York Fed is to supervise financial institutions of all sizes  across the Second District. We evaluate the overall safety and soundness of  banking organizations by assessing risk management, compliance with laws and  regulation, operational resilience, and more. Our team here works closely with  colleagues at the Board of Governors and other federal and state banking  regulators to support this function.\n\nWhile the building we are gathered in  today is located in the heart of the financial district in Lower Manhattan, our  jurisdiction stretches far beyond the five boroughs of New York City.\n\nWe supervise financial institutions from  Buffalo to Plattsburgh . . . from Newark down to Asbury Park . . . from  Stamford, Connecticut to the end of Long Island . . . from Puerto Rico to the  U.S. Virgin Islands . . . and everywhere in between.\n\nTo help us carry out our responsibilities,  my team and I regularly travel throughout the Second District to meet with  leaders in government, business, education, community development, and the nonprofit  sector. In fact, we’ve visited many of the locations I just mentioned.\n\nOn these trips, we see first-hand that  big banks don’t always have much presence in small cities. We hear directly  from people about their banking opportunities and challenges. And we feel the vital  role that community and regional banks play by enabling the flow of credit to individuals,  households, and businesses that need it. Ultimately, these visits provide us  with a clearer picture of economic conditions and the financial health of our  region.\n\nUnderstanding these conditions is  critical. We recognize that what we do at the Federal Reserve—especially  regarding monetary policy—affects banks and their customers in all sorts of  ways.\n\nOur connection to banks is not solely  relegated to our supervisory responsibilities. We perform key functions to  maintain the integrity of the U.S. payment and settlement system. This, of  course, includes FedNow, the Fed’s real-time payment network that went live in  July 2023. FedNow allows for banks and credit unions of all sizes to offer  instant payment services to their consumer and business customers, and more than  1,000 financial institutions are currently enrolled. 1\n\nOur responsibilities are broad, and they  are big. That’s why we invest so heavily in our industry outreach efforts.\n\nOne way we do this is through convening  various advisory groups, which operate on local and national levels. To take  one example, the New York Fed’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory  Council is made up of representatives from commercial banks, thrift  institutions, and credit unions in the Second District. 2\n\nThese forums provide us with insight  into regional economic and financial conditions. In turn, we are able to share timely  and relevant information and resources.\n\nToday’s meeting is another chance for us to connect and convene. Now,  when households and businesses are experiencing heightened uncertainty about  the economic outlook, our conversation is critically important. The agenda that  we have put together will touch on many of these timely issues and topics. We’ve  assembled a roster of excellent speakers and panelists to lead the discussions,  many of whom are my esteemed colleagues. And we are keen to hear your views and  perspectives in the Q&A session a little later.\n\nTo that end, I’ll now introduce the New  York Fed’s Director of Research, Kartik Athreya, who will share his views on  the national economic outlook. Kartik has had a longstanding career at the Federal  Reserve, and joined us in New York last year after serving for many years at  the Richmond Fed. He’s been a tremendous asset to our team, and I’m looking  forward to his presentation.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "“No  man is an island entire of itself,” wrote the poet John Donne in 1624. Almost  four centuries later, his words still ring true. And they are particularly  salient when it comes to the financial fortunes of the global economy.\n\nToday  I’m going to explore the commonalities and interconnectedness of the global economy,  and what that means for the outlook in the United States.\n\nBut  before I delve into these ideas, I want to say what a pleasure it is to be back  at the San Francisco Fed, among so many friendly faces. The Asia Economic  Policy Conference is always a fascinating day, and I’d like to thank Mary Daly for  the invitation to speak, and Zheng Liu and Mark Spiegel for putting together an  outstanding program.\n\nI  knew I was back in San Francisco when this morning I spent 20 minutes in line,  waiting to spend five dollars on a cup of coffee. This is one thing for which  inflation appears to be alive and well.\n\nBefore  I explore issues like inflation in any greater depth, I should give the  standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in  the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe U.S. Economy\n\nIf  monetary policy represents a set of scales, on one side we have a strong U.S.  economy with unemployment near a 50-year low, and on the other, a more  challenging and uncertain landscape.\n\nGDP  looks to grow around 2 percent this year, and unemployment has stayed at or  near historically low levels, boosted by solid job growth. At the same time,  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has moved to cut rates three times.  What’s going on?\n\nThere  are three trends I’ll explore today, which all demonstrate the commonalities  and the interconnectedness of the global economy.\n\nThe  first is the low neutral rate of interest, or r-star, the second is slowing  global growth, and the third is rising geopolitical tensions. All are  critically important to the long-term prospects of the U.S. economy, and each  tells an important story about the conditions we’re experiencing today.\n\nLow R-star\n\nThose  of you who know me won’t be surprised that I’m starting with low r-star! The neutral  rate of interest—the rate that prevails when monetary policy is neither  restrictive nor accommodative—has been an area of study, and a personal  passion, for the past two decades.\n\nI  could talk about r-star at great length, but you may be relieved to hear that  for the purpose of this speech, there’s just one point I want to make: r-star  has fallen, not only in the U.S., but around the world.\n\nFundamental  shifts have been occurring in the two main drivers of r-star over the past two  decades: demographics and productivity growth. Lower fertility rates and aging  populations, as well as slower productivity growth, have pushed down r-star by  as much as two percentage points in a number of developed nations.\n\nThese  structural shifts are having fundamental effects on real interest rates,  growth, and inflation. A number of advanced economies have inflation below desired  levels and longer-term interest rates that are well below where they were a  decade ago.\n\nThere  are, of course, a few outliers, but the commonalities between the world’s  developed economies are becoming more and more apparent.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the U.S. is experiencing first-hand  the effects of the structural shifts in demographics and productivity growth.  But the fact that these changes are a common experience for so many developed economies creates  challenges to our economic prospects at home.\n\nSlowing Global Growth\n\nWhich  brings me to the second trend I highlighted: slowing global growth. This story—of  low interest rates, low inflation, and slow growth—is showing up in the data.\n\nThe  latest numbers from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) follow the recent  trend of steady downward revisions of growth estimates. Their forecast for  global growth for 2019 is now 3 percent, which is the lowest since 2008–09, and  it’s not hard to think of scenarios in which growth slows even further. 1\n\nIn  the old days, central bankers used to worry about inflationary pressures being  too great. Old habits die hard, and I’m always on the lookout for signs that  inflation is rising too fast. But in the current climate it’s inflation that’s  too low that’s of greater concern.\n\nYou  see, my five-dollar cup of coffee masks an inconvenient truth: inflation in the  United States is below target and has been for some time.\n\nBeyond  sluggish inflation, we’re starting to see signs of slower global growth playing  out in the U.S. data. While consumer spending is holding up, other parts of the  economy—including manufacturing, exports, and business investment—have seen  growth stall or experienced outright declines.\n\nGeopolitical Tensions\n\nThe  third and final issue I want to discuss—the rising geopolitical tensions around  the globe—further complicates an already complex picture.\n\nWhen  it comes to the economic outlook, the word of the day—and probably the year—is  “uncertainty.”\n\nTrade  negotiations, civil unrest, and tensions in a number of corners of the world are  driving many businesses to take a wait-and-see approach to investment, thus  putting a further dampener on growth prospects.\n\nIt’s  notable that later in the same poem I used to open my speech, John Donne  writes, “if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less.”\n\nThe  ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and its eventual outcome is a cause of  concern not just for the UK economy, but many of its European trading partners.  It’s impossible to predict what the spillover effects will be when Brexit finally  reaches a conclusion.\n\nWe  face similar uncertainty on our own shores regarding trade tensions. I  frequently hear from my business contacts that they’re holding off on making  investments until the landscape is clearer.\n\nAnd  the ongoing uncertainty in both of these  situations, rather than the day to day ups and downs, has become a key driver  of business decisions.\n\nTrade  negotiations and Brexit are top of mind when it comes to uncertainty. But  geopolitical risks and political upheaval are affecting regions across the  globe.\n\nIt’s  striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are  threatening to put the brakes on growth. Even if the outcomes of current  negotiations are ultimately positive—be they between the U.S. and China, or the  UK and the European Union (EU)—the uncertainty created by current events is no  doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we’re experiencing  today.\n\nFurthermore,  the interconnectedness of our economies means that literally, no man is an island.  If one economy starts to struggle, the spillover effects onto others can take  hold rapidly.\n\nThe  common thread of geopolitical tensions is that while they’re difficult to  predict, they’re also impossible to ignore. On a backdrop of low r-star and slowing  global growth, they drive businesses to be more cautious, more vigilant, and  more conservative in their approach.\n\nData Dependent, Not Data-Point Dependent\n\nThe  long-term factors driving low r-star and slowing global growth, as well as the  more near-term geopolitical tensions, are afflictions from which we all suffer.\n\nSo  what’s the solution? Where do we as policymakers, researchers, and regulators  go from here?\n\nAt  press conferences I’m often asked: if growth slows by X percent, or  unemployment increases by Y percent, will that mean that the FOMC is going to  do Z at its next meeting?\n\nIf  the Fed had a motto, it would probably be “data dependent.” When asked about  this, it’s important to clarify that while I’m data dependent, I’m not data- point dependent.\n\nIt’s  not about being guided by one single data point—GDP or job growth—but by all of  the data and information that tell us where the economy is, and where the  economy is heading. Importantly, it’s not about looking at things merely as  they are—it’s about trying to read how the economy is likely to evolve over the  next couple of years, and what risks lie ahead, based on a broad range of  evidence.\n\nMonetary  policy is a long game. The policy decisions we’ve made this year will continue  to have a ripple effect years into the future. As policymakers, we need to take  in how far-reaching those ripples are going to be.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThe  adjustments to monetary policy we made this year were designed to balance  maintaining a strong U.S. economy with slowing global growth, and provide  insurance against ongoing and potential future risks.\n\nAnd  that’s what they’ve done. The economy is in a good place, and monetary policy  is as well. My forecast is for moderate GDP growth, the labor market remaining  strong, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 percent target. Of course,  things can change. Data dependency remains our motto, and if there were a  material change to this outlook, we would adjust monetary policy in support of  our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll  conclude with this. John Donne’s words are perhaps more relevant in 2019 than  they were in 1624. No man is an island, and no economy can insulate itself—for  better or worse—from the fortunes of its neighbors.\n\nAt  the same time, all economies are having a common experience as a result of  longer-term structural changes.\n\nShifts  in demographics and productivity growth point clearly in the direction of low  neutral interest rates and slowing growth. We’re seeing the reality of these  changes in the form of sluggish inflation and interest rates much lower than in  previous decades.\n\nCentral  banks and policymakers around the world need to prepare for economies that are  more connected than ever before.\n\nI’ll  now take your questions.\n\nAddendum\n\n'No Man is an Island' No  man is an island entire of itself; every man is a  piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a  clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is  the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well  as any manner of thy friends or of thine own  were; any man's death diminishes me, because  I am involved in mankind. And  therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it  tolls for thee. John Donne",

    "text": "President Poser, Chair Schaeffer and members  of the Board of Trustees, deans, faculty and staff, family and friends, Kate and Willie Pride, and of course, the  graduating class of 2025 . . . good evening and  congratulations!\n\nIt’s been over 30 years since I received my doctorate. I am deeply  honored and humbled to be donning commencement regalia to receive a second one.  Thank you to the entire Hofstra community.\n\nWhen you first heard that John Williams was speaking here today,  perhaps you were expecting the other John Williams. You know, the one  who wrote the music for Star Wars and dozens of other movies.\n\nI may not have written music for Star Wars, but I have written  quite a bit about something called “r-star.”\n\nWhat is r-star?\n\nR-star is the natural, or “normal,” rate of interest. It’s the  eventual destination for interest rates. The problem is that you can’t look it  up in a book or find it in a statistical table. Like many things in life, you must learn about it through  experience and evidence (although I am sure if you ask ChatGPT, it will give  you an answer). It’s the kind of thing that we economists say is “unobservable,”  but then spend our careers obsessing over how to observe it. Well, at least I  do.\n\nYou’ve already studied for your hard-earned degrees and may not be  ready to pursue another one in economics . . . yet . So, I’ll explain just  one quick detail about r-star and then get to the point.\n\nR-star is part of a group of macroeconomic “star” estimates—a  family, so to speak. Really, they’re just a form of shorthand. R-star’s often referenced  cousins are y-star and u-star, which stand for real GDP and unemployment,  respectively.\n\nSo, we’ve got “y”, “r”, and “u.”\n\nCoincidentally, “why are you?” is the beginning of a set of questions  that I have asked myself at many points throughout my career. My passion for studying  r-star has taken me on a three-decade journey as a researcher, policymaker, and  leader of a century-old institution in Lower Manhattan. And I think it’s  helpful framing for graduates like you as you take the next steps in your  careers.\n\nAs you continue on beyond the walls and halls of this beautiful  Hofstra campus and venture into offices, hospitals, schools, and businesses,  ask yourself:\n\nWhy are you here?\n\nWhy are you going to be successful?\n\nWhy you ?\n\nFor many people, the first motivation  to earn a graduate degree is to secure a job or to advance in your particular  field. That is important, and you will find it valuable every day. But there’s even  more to it. When you think more broadly about the “whys,” your career, and the  role that it plays in your life, can be far more expansive than you could have  imagined.\n\nSo, the first lesson that I’ll share can help answer the question,  “why are you here?” And the answer is to remind yourself about what you’ve set  out to achieve with your graduate studies. And that is, to be both a generalist  and a subject matter expert.\n\nYes, I know I am sounding like a two-handed economist.\n\nBut think about it. On the one hand, the world needs people who  have knowledge and skills that are narrow—and on the other, we need knowledge  and skills to be broad. Each of you has a strong foundation and comprehensive  education, but also deep subject matter expertise.\n\nGraduate education may close some doors, but it opens up many new  ones, too. You’ve earned an advanced degree at an esteemed institution, and you’ve  invested a tremendous amount of time and money into learning everything that  you could in your chosen area. And with this expertise you are well positioned  to build and exercise strengths that you have yet to develop or that may not  come naturally to you.\n\nCombine all your experiences from life, from college, from work, and  from the studies that landed you here today. Piece them together and use them  as building blocks to find your footing. With the mindset of operating as both a subject matter expert and a generalist, you can discover opportunities  and prospects you may not have previously considered.\n\nOn to the second question: “Why are you going to be successful?”\n\nTo this I answer, “by finding a mentor.”\n\nA good mentor, the right mentor, is not the one who will  say, “just follow in my footsteps and do exactly what I did.” Instead, it’s the  one who will say “knock on this door,” or point out the doors that you don’t  even know exist. It’s one who believes in you and is willing to tell you important  things, even some you may not want to hear.\n\nMy mentor, Janet Yellen, did this for me. In fact, she was the one  who helped me understand the first lesson I just spoke about. Back in the  2000s, I worked for her as a research economist. The work I was doing was exactly  what I set out to do, and what I loved. But at a certain point, Janet—who at  that time was the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve—advised me to  broaden my perspective and experiences. She recommended that I learn about the  activities and people in our organization outside my area of expertise. This  meant spending time away from my main responsibilities, where I was very  comfortable, and moving into areas where I knew nothing—and it showed!\n\nI needed to be encouraged to think more broadly, outside of charts  and graphs and footnotes. I did my best to follow her guidance, and I am glad I  did. Let me emphasize this part: it’s not enough to have a mentor or mentors—you  have to be open to their guidance and take action.\n\nThe experience of learning new things, seeing situations from a  new perspective, and making mistakes along the way is what truly made a  difference not only to me, but also to the people around me and to the  organizations I was in. And this led to many of the accomplishments I am most  proud of in my career.\n\nWithout Janet Yellen’s mentorship, I would not be who I am and  where I am today.\n\nAnd now to answer the final question: “Why you ?”\n\nYou have the skills. You have the experience. You have the drive.\n\nBut in the pursuit of career success, don’t forget why you love  what you do and why you stand out.\n\nI often say that as an economist, I know just two words: supply  and demand.\n\nWhile it’s true that economics plays a major role in my life, I have  also made sure to stay close to other two-word phrases that are near and dear  to me. Like video games. Classic rock. Star Trek. The names of my two sons,  Kenneth and Nicholas. Pizza. Sorry, that’s one word. Eat Pizza.\n\nContinue to develop your hobbies, passions, and interests. They  will keep you energized when sometimes work does not.\n\nAnd they will keep you human. Keep you relatable. Keep you sane.\n\nWhatever title you hold, wherever your office is, or whichever  board seat you occupy, always remember “you.”\n\nYou have earned the right to be a leader in your field, so embrace  leadership in all its forms. We need leaders from all kinds of backgrounds and  disciplines. We need strong communicators. And we need those who can inspire  teams, take ownership, and drive progress. Especially at times of great  uncertainty, people crave effective leadership.\n\nThat’s why this is a good time in your career to play two roles.\n\nYou can have a mentor and be a mentor at the same  time. Pay it back and pay it forward.\n\nAnd while you’re busy making incredible contributions to your  organizations and to the world, don’t forget yourself. Don’t forget what makes  you great. And don’t forget to eat pizza.\n\nCongratulations, and best of luck in everything you do. May the  stars be with you.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI’m so pleased and honored to speak at  this event commemorating the Research & Statistics Centennial. It’s great  to see so many friends, colleagues, and—especially—the many mentors who have  had such an impact on this institution, and on me personally.\n\nResearch & Statistics—affectionally  known as R&S—is almost as old as the Federal Reserve itself. It has  certainly made its mark over the past 100 years—and it continues to do so  today. This is a testament to the leadership, high professional standards, and  dedication to the Federal Reserve’s mission ingrained in generations of R&S  employees.\n\nOther speakers will discuss key aspects  of the evolution and contributions of R&S over the past century. I will  focus my remarks on the past 30 years. This corresponds to my own time as a  researcher and policymaker—as a member of R&S for the first seven years,  then as a consumer of R&S products while at the San Francisco and New York  Feds. In that time, the theory and practice of monetary policy have changed  dramatically. Equally striking are the ways that transformation has influenced  R&S research and analysis, and the ways the work of R&S has, in turn, influenced  monetary policy.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to give  the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and  do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt Was 30 Years Ago Today…\n\nTo get a full appreciation of all that’s  happened in the past 30 years, I want to take you back to 1993. On a personal  note, that was when I first interviewed for a job at the Board as a wet-behind-the-ears,  31-year-old grad student.\n\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy,  1993 seems like a world away. Back then, the Fed’s balance sheet totaled about  $400 billion . Now? It’s nearly $8 trillion .\n\nSo many things we take for granted weren’t  even a “thing” back then. There were no FOMC statements . . . no press  conferences . . . no dot plots . . . no longer-run forecasts in the SEP . . . no  policy rules, optimal control, or flexible inflation targeting. In fact, there  was no inflation target at all!\n\nThere was no QE or QT, no LSAPs . . . no  forward guidance, Odyssean or Delphic . . . no ZLB, ELB, or shadow rates . . . no  ample or abundant reserves . . . no IORB, ON RRP, or SOFR . . . no DSGE, EDO, or  SIGMA . . . no FRB/US model . . . and, most shocking of all, no r-star!\n\nReading through this extensive list, I admit  I have some sympathy for why central bankers occasionally pine for the simpler  times of yesteryear (except for the r-star part, of course).\n\nThe Taylor Rule: Systematic Monetary Policy\n\nBut change was already afoot.\n\nI’ll start with one development that, in  important ways, connects them all: the birth of the famous “Taylor rule,” in  1993, from John Taylor’s “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice.” 1\n\nInstead of approaching policy as a one-time tactical decision of whether rates should be higher, lower, or stay the  same, the Taylor rule laid out an overall strategy for setting interest  rates in any circumstances in terms of a reaction function. And it spawned research  on a vast collection of monetary policy rules and optimal control policies.\n\nThe Taylor rule transformed monetary  policy research. The areas of study broadened from short-term analysis and  impulse response functions to key longer-term issues. This included the  principles of effective policy strategies, trade-offs between policy goals, effects  of the zero lower bound, and the roles of the so-called “star” variables—the inflation  target, potential output, and yes, the neutral interest rate, or r-star—that all  appear in the policy rule.\n\nThe Taylor rule not only altered the way  monetary policy is conceptualized, but also changed the way R&S and the  other research divisions approached questions related to the economic outlook  and monetary policy.\n\nAt the Fed, the wheels of change may sometimes  turn slowly, but the Taylor rule helped get those wheels spinning.\n\nIt Takes a Model\n\nA second transformative change in the  past 30 years was the development of macroeconomic models designed to study  longer-run issues, such as monetary policy strategy. Earlier macroeconomic  models were often used primarily for short-term forecasting and analysis. But these  new models allowed researchers to explore longer-run questions related to  policy strategies using empirically founded models.\n\nThe FRB/US model in R&S and  FRB/Global in the International Finance division represented a watershed moment  in the early 1990s, and they supplemented other models in use at the Board. 2 Later, a generation of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models were added  to the stable of tools for analysis, including the Estimated Dynamic  Optimization model in R&S and the SIGMA model in International Finance. 3\n\nTransparency\n\nSo far, I have highlighted developments underway  in economics in the early 1990s. But there was also a transformation underway  in monetary policymaking, with a goal of increasing transparency, especially in  public communications about policy goals, strategies, and actions. In late  1989, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand rocked the central banking world by  introducing inflation targeting. The Bank of Canada and the Bank of England  soon followed suit. Two key tenets of inflation targeting are the communication  of a clear, numerical description of the inflation goal and central bank  accountability for achieving that goal.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve did not  formally adopt a version of inflation targeting until 2012, the FOMC took several  steps to increase clarity and transparency in the 1990s and the first decade of  the 2000s. It started issuing policy statements after meetings . . . expedited  the release of FOMC minutes . . . added longer-run FOMC projections . . . and  increasingly used forward guidance about future policy actions. 4\n\nThis trend toward transparency accelerated  dramatically in 2012, with the formal announcement of a 2 percent longer-run  inflation target and policy strategy and, for the first time, the publication of  FOMC projections of the federal funds rate. 5\n\nThree Case Studies: ZLB, Policy Frameworks, and R-star\n\nThis combination of the Taylor rule, a  new generation of models, and growing transparency spurred R&S research  into a range of monetary policy topics, and it identified new issues to  explore. This was a two-way process, with new research contributing to  policymakers’ thinking on issues, and policymakers’ interest in greater  transparency and inflation targeting influencing the questions researchers  studied.\n\nThere are numerous examples from the  past 30 years, each with important contributions from R&S economists, many who  are in this room. But, given the constraints of time, I will focus on three  that stand out for me.\n\nThe first is the zero lower bound, or  ZLB. For a long time, the ZLB was viewed as more of a historical curiosity than  a relevant issue for U.S. monetary policy. But in the early 1990s, Jeff Fuhrer,  building on work done while in R&S, and Brian Madigan, from the Monetary  Affairs division, analyzed the effects of the ZLB on nominal interest rates for  different policy rules and inflation targets. 6 This was a groundbreaking paper at that time. It made the simple, yet powerful  insight that if you follow a policy rule like the Taylor rule, and a big enough  negative shock comes along, the nominal interest rate will be constrained at  the lower bound, with negative effects on the economy and inflation. My work  with David Reifschneider on the ZLB in the late 1990s, which we presented to  the FOMC in January 2002, developed these insights further. 7\n\nIn the subsequent 20 years, numerous  contributions from R&S researchers and others have added to our  understanding of the consequences of the ZLB, and of alternative tools such as quantitative  easing and forward guidance.\n\nMy second example is the analysis of  alternative policy rules and approaches in describing the set of choices and  outcomes policymakers face, including analysis of the trade-offs between policy  objectives. 8 Alternative  scenarios based on different policy strategies regularly appear in the Tealbook  prepared by Board staff for the FOMC. This line of research is also exemplified  by the set of papers and analysis that contributed to the FOMC Policy Framework  review, announced in 2018 and completed in 2020, with important contributions  by R&S economists. 9\n\nMy third and final example is, of  course, r-star. R-star sits right at the center of policy rules, macro models,  the ZLB, and longer-run strategy. In remarks at the Thomas Laubach Research  Conference in May, I recounted how Thomas and I started working together on the  estimation of r-star in 2000, spurred by questions from policymakers and senior  leaders at the Board. 10 But work in R&S began even earlier, with Antulio Bomfim estimating r-star using  the MPS model, the predecessor of FRB/US. 11 And it continues to be a relevant and timely topic of R&S research and  policy analysis to this day.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nA critical component of any strategy is  a focus on the future, and that is true with monetary policy.\n\nThirty years ago, R&S was very much  about the here and now. The staff forecasts in the Greenbook usually extended  only through the end of the next year. And medium-term five-year-ahead  forecasts were reported only twice a year. Policy analysis was generally  short-term and rather mechanical: What would happen if the FOMC increased the  funds rate by, for example, 100 points for the next year?\n\nThe world has changed. The analytical  tools we have at our disposal have changed. And R&S researchers have not  only kept up with those changes, but, in many cases, have also been the first  to recognize them and contribute to our understanding of their implications,  often well in advance of academic economists. My three examples illustrate  this, but there are many more to draw from.\n\nRecently, macroeconomic models used at  central banks like the Fed have been blamed for missing the rapid and sustained  rise in inflation that began in 2021. But models don’t make staff forecasts or policy  decisions. That’s not their purpose. The purpose of models—whether simple  heuristics or multicountry models with hundreds of equations—is to help  organize, quantify, and communicate our understanding of the how the economy  works. Any shortcomings in the models reflect shortfalls in our collective understanding,  rather than the cause of our misunderstanding. And it is the job of researchers  to learn from experience as they revise existing models and build new ones.\n\nIn that regard, the models and analysis created  and refined by generations of R&S researchers have done exactly that. In so  doing, they have added immensely to the understanding of issues critical to the  Federal Reserve’s mission.\n\nI will finish where I started. In  looking back over the past 30 years, it’s remarkable how dramatically the  theory and practice of monetary policy and the work of R&S have jointly  evolved. The Fed of 1993 seems far distant from that of today. I wonder if, 30  years from now, they—by which I mean the AI robots running things—will look  back at our current understanding of monetary policy and economics with  amusement. And I imagine they will wonder how we managed without all the new  things that are about to be discovered.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank you for the kind introduction. I’m delighted to be back at  the Economic Club of New York. I’ve worn many hats here at the Club: one as a longtime  member, one as a repeat guest, and one as chair. I am pleased to see how the Club’s  programming continues to evolve in service of its important mission.\n\nBefore turning to the conversation with Sonali Basak and taking your  questions, I’d like to take the next 10 minutes or so to share my outlook for  the economy and how I see the path forward in the current moment.\n\nI’ll put my Federal Reserve hat back on now and give the standard  Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others  in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic  Uncertainty Is for Certain\n\nThere’s a lot to say about where the economy stands against the  backdrop of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate goals. I’ll start with what  we’ve learned from the data in recent months and how it relates to maximum  employment and price stability.\n\nThe GDP data oscillated quite a bit in the first half of this year,  largely reflecting the effects from the front-running of tariff increases.  Looking through the downs and ups in the data, growth in the first half of the  year was about 1-1/2 percent, well below last year’s 2-1/2 percent pace.\n\nThis slowdown in growth reflects a variety of factors influencing  the supply and demand sides of our economy. Much lower immigration and the  sizable increase in tariffs reduce both the productive capacity of the economy  and demand. In addition, the changing landscape around trade policy has increased  economic uncertainty among households and businesses, weighing on demand. We have  seen this in the surveys and outreach that are conducted within the Fed’s Second  District and across the country. While the extent of tariff increases is  becoming clearer, there is still substantial uncertainty surrounding the path  of trade policy and its effects on the economy.\n\nSeeing  the Whole Picture\n\nGDP and related measures are an  important part of the overall picture. But my view is informed by a wide  variety of other economic indicators as well. And those are consistent with a  picture of an economy that is growing, albeit more slowly than last year.\n\nLooking at the totality of the data over the past year, there has  been a gradual cooling in labor market conditions to levels similar to those that  prevailed in the years prior to the pandemic. You can see this pattern in the  data on hiring and quits rates, vacancies, and survey measures of jobs’ and  workers’ availability. And this cooling is consistent with the gradual slowing  of wage growth that we’ve seen.\n\nIn addition, there has been a notable slowdown in payroll  employment growth in recent months, but this is likely the result of lower  growth in both demand and supply, reflecting in large part the effects  of reduced immigration on the labor force.\n\nI draw three conclusions from the labor market indicators. First,  the labor market is currently in balance and not adding to inflationary  pressures. Second, the gradual cooling in the labor market is consistent with the  slowing in overall economic growth and my assessment of monetary policy being  modestly restrictive. Third, as we are seeing today, when there are sharp  changes in labor supply, it can be challenging to assess the rate of job growth  consistent with that of labor supply. I therefore put greater weight on other  indicators of the level of labor market conditions in assessing the  strength of the labor market.\n\nThe  Tariff-Inflation Relationship\n\nNow I’ll pivot to price stability. Over the past year, the core services  components of inflation have evolved broadly in line with gradual progress  toward our longer-run 2 percent goal. Based on the 12-month percent change in  the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, headline inflation was  2.6 percent in July, and core inflation was 2.9 percent. These figures are modestly  higher than comparable numbers from a year ago.\n\nThe big story here, of course, is tariffs. There are clear signs  that tariff increases are affecting consumer prices and that trade diversion is  taking place. One area where we can clearly see the initial effects of tariff  increases is in core goods prices. Price increases for items that are exposed  to higher tariffs have been well above what one would expect based on past  trends and in the absence of tariffs. 1\n\nThe realized aggregate effects of tariffs so far have not been as  large as expected earlier in the year, but it’s still early days, and it will  take time for them to come to be fully realized. Combining enacted and  announced tariffs, estimates of the average effective tariff rate range between  15 and 20 percent. By comparison, net tariff receipts as a share of imports  rose from about 2-1/4 percent in the first three months of the year to around  10 percent in July. This is a sizable increase for sure, but well short of the  increase implied by a straight read of the announced tariffs.\n\nFortunately, I am not seeing signs of amplification or  second-round effects of tariffs on broader inflation trends. In particular,  recent readings of the New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index are  near historical averages. 2 And longer-run inflation expectations have remained stable, while short- and  medium-term inflation expectations, after increasing modestly earlier in the  year, have returned to their pre-pandemic ranges. 3 This is critically important, because well-anchored inflation expectations are  essential for sustained price stability.\n\nAll in all, I expect tariffs will boost overall prices by a total  of between 1 and 1-1/2 percent, with these effects continuing through the first  half of next year. That’s my current estimate, but there is a great deal of  uncertainty about these effects. As we collect more data, we will get a better  understanding of the magnitude and timing of tariffs’ effects. I’ll continue to  monitor prices and broad movements in inflation over time to assess evolving  conditions.\n\nMonetary  Policy\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance has been modestly  restrictive, as seen through the slowing of inflation and wage growth and the gradual  cooling of the labor market. This policy stance is appropriate given that inflation  has remained above our 2 percent target while the labor market has been  generally consistent with maximum employment. With that backdrop, the FOMC  decided to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4-1/4  to 4-1/2 percent at its meeting in late July. 4\n\nLooking ahead, if progress on our dual mandate goals continues as  in my baseline forecast, I anticipate it will become appropriate to move  interest rates toward a more neutral stance over time. This expectation  reflects a delicate balancing of risks to our mandate goals. On the one hand, we  need to keep the labor market in balance to ensure that the effects of tariffs  do not spill over into a longer-lasting broad increase in inflation. On the  other hand, maintaining a stance of “too restrictive policy for too long” could  increase risks to our maximum employment mandate.\n\nMy approach to these assessments is, as always, entirely focused  on the totality of the data and what it tells us about the relative risks to  achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nLet me briefly comment on the Fed’s balance sheet. The FOMC  continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and  agency mortgage-backed securities, and that process is going very smoothly. With take-up at the overnight reverse repo facility now quite  low, the level of reserves has already started to decline and is expected to  decline more meaningfully going forward as our asset holdings continue to  shrink and other liabilities rise. We continue to closely monitor a range  of indicators related to the ampleness of reserves.\n\nEconomic  Outlook\n\nI will conclude with my economic outlook. Let me say at the outset  that a number of outcomes are possible given all the uncertainty. But based on  what the data tell us today, I expect the combined effects of trade and  immigration policies and associated uncertainty to continue to weigh on growth.  As a result, I expect GDP growth this year to be between 1-1/4 and 1-1/2 percent.\n\nWith this slowdown in growth, I expect the unemployment rate to gradually  rise to about 4-1/2 percent next year. And I expect PCE inflation to come in between  3 and 3-1/4 percent this year, before declining to around 2-1/2 percent next  year, and reaching 2 percent in 2027.\n\nConclusion\n\nA lot has happened since I last stood at this podium. But you  won’t be surprised to hear that my penchant for “data dependency” has not altered.  The outlook remains uncertain, and the data can shift in unexpected ways. In  navigating these uncertain waters, I remain laser focused on supporting maximum  employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal on a  sustained basis.\n\nOnce again, I’m honored to be back at ECNY. And I’m looking  forward to the rest of the program. Thank you.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the sixth annual  U.S. Treasury Market Conference. I wish we were able to meet in person at the New  York Fed. But, while the location for this year's conference may have moved  from an auditorium to your living room, the goal remains the same: To bring  together market participants and representatives from five public sector  bodies—the New York Fed, the Board of Governors, the Treasury, the SEC, and the  CFTC. And, the events of the past year make the conversations we will have today  all the more valuable and timely.\n\nToday, I'd like to begin with stressing the importance of  well-functioning financial markets and then look at two recent episodes of  volatility and the lessons learned. I'll close by explaining the Fed's role to  support functioning in this critical part of the financial system.\n\nAt last year's conference, I spoke about the transition  away from LIBOR. Because I am certain all of you have committed to memory  everything I said then, I'll keep my remarks on LIBOR today short and to the  point: We have only 459 days until the availability of LIBOR can no longer be  assured, and everyone needs to put their nose to the grindstone in their efforts  to prepare for the move off LIBOR. In the immortal words of Captain Jean Luc  Picard—make it so!\n\nBefore I continue on to today's topic or quote other  favorite Star Trek characters, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that  the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Heart of the  Economy\n\nThe markets that are the center of attention today—the Treasury  market, the repo market, and the mortgage-backed securities market—represent the  heart of the circulatory system of our financial system and our economy, and  indeed the global economy. When they are working smoothly, all the other parts  of the system can perform as they should.\n\nBut, the opposite is true as well. If these critical  markets break down, credit stops flowing, and people can't finance the purchase  of a car or a home, businesses can't invest, and the economy suffers, resulting  in lost jobs and income. 1\n\nFinancial markets aren't static—they evolve over time in  response to changes in technology, regulation, and business models. The  Treasury market is not immune to this process of change. We have seen the  emergence of principal trading firms, changes in regulations of key  intermediaries, and the growth of nonbank financial institutions. 2 With  this evolution, it is vitally important to ensure that safeguards and systems also  evolve so that these markets function well in all circumstances and conditions,  including unprecedented events like the pandemic.\n\nWe need to reflect on and learn from these experiences and  consider ways to make these and other markets more robust, thereby minimizing  the potential negative consequences to the economy and the need for  extraordinary policy responses.\n\nMarket Conditions  in September and March\n\nI know it might seem like a lifetime ago, but allow me  take you to mid-September of last year.\n\nA number of otherwise ordinary occurrences—including corporate  tax payments and settlement of newly issued Treasuries—were expected to put  some upward pressure on short-term rates, but the market response was out of  proportion to the magnitude of the shock.\n\nConditions in funding markets became highly volatile,  with both secured and unsecured lending rates rising sharply. Indeed, the size  of the reaction in repo rates, the spillover to the federal funds market, and  the emergence of strains in market functioning were well outside of recent  experience. And the market stress was looking to get worse, not better. 3 4\n\nIn response to these developments, the Federal Reserve conducted  a series of large-scale repo operations with the aim of calming conditions in  funding markets and bringing the federal funds rate within the target range. The  provision of liquidity had the desired effect of reducing strains in markets,  narrowing the dispersion of rates, and keeping the federal funds rate within  the target range. 5\n\nMoving to more recent events, in  March of this year the global spread of the pandemic led to a rapid and massive  movement of funds around the world as investors sought to protect themselves  from the highly uncertain and darkening economic outlook. These flows  threatened to overwhelm the financial system and resulted in intense strain and  disruption in short-term funding markets and markets for Treasury securities  and agency mortgage-backed securities. 6 Measures of market functioning deteriorated to levels near, or in some cases  worse than, those we saw at the peak of the 2008 global financial crisis. 7\n\nIn response to the extraordinary  volatility and signs of market disruption caused by the pandemic, the Federal  Reserve greatly expanded its repo operations and decisively and immediately began  purchasing enormous quantities of U.S. Treasury securities and agency  mortgage-backed securities. Our approach was to deliver a rapid and  overwhelming response that would give assurance to market participants that  liquidity would be there in the coming days and months.\n\nThese actions, combined with the introduction of  emergency lending facilities to provide liquidity to funding and credit  markets, proved successful. They quickly restored market functioning and  averted what could have been a much more severe pullback from markets and the  flow of credit to households and businesses. 8 Indeed,  the rapid restoration of market functioning helped restore a robust flow of  credit at historically low interest rates to the economy, which has provided a  boost for the recovery.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nI don't like to be ominous or foreshadow the future. But,  if another crisis were to occur, we must to be able to look back on this time  and know that we learned everything we could from recent events. After the  financial crisis of 2008, a significant amount of work both in the United  States and around the world was invested in studying the causes of that crisis and  finding ways to make the financial system more resilient.\n\nThe ultimate goal of those reforms was to ensure that the  next time the global economy was hit by a major shock, the financial system  would be a source of support for the economy, rather than amplify weakness.  Those efforts were hugely successful. The resilience of the U.S. banking system  in particular has been a key factor in positioning our economy for a strong  recovery, despite the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nIt's crucial that our financial system can handle shocks  and disruption. We must use the opportunity before us and study the events in  September and March to identify the root causes for the market stress and  disruption. 9 We need to understand how changes in the market ecosystem—whether due to  regulation, technology, or other factors—have influenced market resilience. Like  the post-financial-crisis reforms, this is an opportunity to think hard about  what changes will help fortify the financial system against future shocks.\n\nThe Role of  Central Banks\n\nDespite our best efforts, we should not fool ourselves  that we can design a system that is bulletproof against every circumstance. The  events of the past year have demonstrated the critical role central banks can and must play in  extraordinary times when market stress and dysfunction threaten to spill over into  the economy. No private institution has the ability to provide liquidity at the  speed or scale that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have this year.\n\nAlthough we often talk about the Fed in terms of monetary policy and interest rates, the Federal Reserve  System was originally created to ensure the stability of the financial system. 10 That  role is as relevant today as it was 107 years ago, and will continue to be in  the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude by returning to my analogy of these  critical markets as the heart of our circulatory system. Recent events have  reaffirmed what many already knew. Liquid, well-functioning markets for  Treasury and related securities are absolutely essential for credit to flow and  the economy to prosper. Assuring that these markets are robust and resilient to  unknown future circumstances may seem like a daunting task, but as Captain Picard  also taught us, \"Things are only impossible until they're not.\"\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to join you today. I’ll  start by thanking you for your commitment to the economic development of  communities across the New York region.\n\nMy remarks today will focus on the economic outlook in the United States  and how the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy actions are helping restore price  stability. I’ll also share some observations about economic developments closer  to home in the New York metropolitan area. Before I go further, I need to give  the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and  do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve’s Mandate\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, our work and actions are guided by our  dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhen it comes to employment—the first half of the mandate—things are  looking very good. The economy added nearly 2.9 million payroll jobs in 2023. 1 The employment-to-population ratio of “prime-age” workers aged 25-54 has  regained levels that prevailed in the months before the pandemic. And the national  unemployment rate has been at or below 4 percent for two straight years now,  the longest such stretch in over five decades. The current unemployment rate of  3.7 percent is in line with my 3-3/4 percent estimate for the unemployment rate  that is likely to prevail over the longer run.\n\nOn the price stability side, the situation has improved  significantly since the sharp rise in inflation that followed the onset of the pandemic  and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation, as measured by the personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, surged to a 40-year high of about 7  percent in June of 2022. Over the past year and a half, the inflation rate has fallen  back to just over 2-1/2 percent. This decrease is a clearly positive  development, but it is important to stress that we still have a ways to go to  get inflation back to the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Price stability  is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity stands and is essential to  ensure maximum employment over the long term.\n\nThe  Labor Market: U.S. and New York City\n\nI’ll now dive a bit deeper into the economic situation and  outlook, starting with the employment side of our mandate. After the recovery  from the pandemic, we saw a red-hot labor market take shape across the country.  You’re familiar with the story—demand far exceeded supply, and that imbalance  contributed to rapid wage growth and high inflation.\n\nOver the past year, even as the labor market has remained strong, we  have seen a steady return toward better balance. Job growth ended the year on a  strong note but has slowed considerably from the unsustainably high rates  recorded in the first half of last year. Quits and hiring rates are back near pre-pandemic  levels, as are the perceptions of job availability and the ability to fill  jobs. The job openings rate—which reached all-time highs in 2022—has also  trended lower but is still high relative to pre-pandemic norms.\n\nWe’ve seen a rebalancing in New York  City as well, where the recovery in employment has taken longer than in the nation  as a whole. Now, New York City has basically  regained the jobs lost during the pandemic. Still, the recovery has been  uneven. Even though employment in higher-wage sectors such as finance and  business services has rebounded, sectors that tend to provide jobs to  lower-wage workers that rely on foot traffic from office workers continue to  lag, holding back the city’s recovery.\n\nThere have been meaningful improvements on the supply side of the labor  market, too. Labor force participation has trended upward, and immigration  rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. But there are limits to how much  supply can increase, and some further moderation in demand is likely needed to  fully return balance to the labor market.\n\nThree  Layers of Inflation\n\nI’ll now return to our price stability mandate. If you’ve read the  speeches that I’ve given over the past year or so, you will know that I’ve been  using a metaphor of an onion’s layers to explain inflation—how it climbed so  high in 2021 and why it’s now moderating. 2 In  this metaphor, I describe three layers, so it’s become my “rule of three,” so  to speak. Today, I’ll explain how each of the three layers represents a  different sector of the economy.\n\nThe first and outermost layer of the inflation onion represents  globally traded commodities. Demand for commodities soared when the pandemic  hit, contributing to a surge in inflation, and then rose again when Russia  invaded Ukraine.\n\nNow that global demand has come into better balance with supply, commodity  prices have come down significantly from their peak levels. Food price  inflation has dropped below two percent, and energy prices have been falling  over the past year, bringing down the overall inflation rate rather than  pushing it higher.\n\nThe second layer of the onion—core goods, that is goods excluding  food and energy—is also benefitting from the rebalancing of supply and demand,  both here and abroad. The inflation rate in this layer of the onion has dropped  to near zero, reflecting cooling demand and the resolution of supply chain  bottlenecks that contributed to rapid price increases. The New York Fed’s  Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which measures the extent of supply-chain  disruptions, indicates that overall supply-chain pressures have returned to  pre-pandemic levels. 3\n\nWe’ve now peeled away the first two layers of the onion, which  have seen the largest and most rapid improvements. We’re beginning to see  significant progress in the third, innermost layer of the onion, too. Core  services inflation has come down after peaking early last year. One factor  contributing to this is slowing shelter inflation, as the growth of rents for  newly signed leases returns to pre-pandemic norms. And the inflation rate for  core services excluding housing has also slowed considerably.\n\nFuture  Indicators\n\nWith that summary of the inflation onion in mind, what can we  expect for inflation going forward?\n\nOne important factor behind inflation is inflation expectations,  and the recent indicators here have been quite encouraging. Longer-term inflation  expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2  percent goal. Medium-term inflation expectations are fully back to pre-pandemic  levels. And one-year-ahead inflation expectations, which rose as inflation  surged, have fallen dramatically to within the range seen in the seven years  before the pandemic for which we have survey data. 4\n\nA second useful indicator for future inflation is the New York  Fed’s Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation. After reaching nearly 5-1/2 percent  in June of 2022, the most recent MCT reading is 2.3 percent. 5 Other indicators of underlying inflation are showing significant declines toward  pre-pandemic levels as well.\n\nThe third indicator I’ll mention—there’s my rule of three again—is  wage growth. Economists at the New York Fed have developed a measure of trend  wage inflation, which has declined to about 4-1/2 percent from its peak of near  7 percent in December 2021. 6 This is another indicator that the labor market is coming back into better  balance.\n\nIf we put all these pieces together, the data indicate that we are  clearly moving in the right direction. However, we still are a ways from our  price stability goal.\n\nMonetary  Policy\n\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy?\n\nThe FOMC’s policy actions over the past two years have put in  place a restrictive policy stance that is helping achieve balance between  demand and supply and restore price stability. In December, the FOMC kept the  target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In determining  the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return  inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the  cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy  affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial  developments. 7\n\nSo  here is my forecast for 2024 and beyond. Taking into account the effects of  restrictive monetary policy, I expect GDP growth to slow to about 1-1/4 percent  this year, and for the unemployment rate to rise to around 4 percent. I expect PCE  inflation to continue to slow to about 2-1/4 percent this year, before reaching  our 2 percent longer-run goal next year.\n\nAll of that said, the future remains uncertain. The risks are  two-sided, with the possibility of supply-demand imbalances or inflation  remaining stubbornly persistent weighed against that of a weaker-than-expected  economy and labor market.\n\nMy base case is that the current restrictive stance of monetary  policy will continue to restore balance and bring inflation back to our 2  percent longer-run goal. I expect that we will need to maintain a restrictive  stance of policy for some time to fully achieve our goals, and it will only be  appropriate to dial back the degree of policy restraint when we are confident  that inflation is moving toward 2 percent on a sustained basis. The outlook  remains highly uncertain, and I will continue to carefully watch and assess the  data to judge whether the stance of policy is best positioned to achieve our  goals. Our policy decisions will be made meeting by meeting and will follow  another rule of three: by looking at the totality of the incoming data, the  evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\n\nI’d like to briefly mention the current state of the Fed’s balance  sheet. At our last meeting in December, the FOMC said that it will continue reducing  its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed  securities, as described in our framework announced in 2022. 8 The strategy and implementation of the reduction in our security holdings is  working exactly as designed. Thus far we have reduced our securities holdings  by about $1.3 trillion, with no signs of adverse effects on market functioning. 9\n\nIn its  plans, the FOMC said that to ensure a smooth transition it intends to slow and  then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances  are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves. 10 So far, we don’t seem to be close to that point. The decline in securities  holdings has been absorbed almost entirely by a drop in the overnight reverse  repurchase agreement facility (ON RRP). As a result, aggregate reserve balances  are little changed from their levels in mid-2022, when balance sheet reduction  started. Looking ahead to this year, as the balance sheet continues to shrink and  usage of the ON RRP continues to decline, we will closely monitor money market  conditions and the demand for reserves.\n\nThe FOMC’s Commitment\n\nI’ll close with  a final set of three. One, the strong actions that we have taken over the past  two years are working as intended. Two, we have seen meaningful progress on  restoring balance to the economy and bringing inflation down. And three, our  work is not done. I am committed to achieving our 2 percent longer-run  inflation goal and creating a strong foundation for our economic future.",

    "text": "Let me start by personally  welcoming you to the New York Fed. We have enjoyed a long and productive  relationship with Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, or SIPA,  and it’s great to be here to discuss timely and important issues.\n\nThe topic of my talk today  is the optimal supply of central bank reserves. Prior to the global financial  crisis, this issue was more or less settled. Then, in response to that crisis  and the ensuing economic downturn—and again following the COVID-19 pandemic—many  central banks expanded their balance sheets through various quantitative easing  programs funded for the most part by large-scale increases in central bank  reserves. These increases resulted in fundamental changes in ways central banks  have approached the provision of reserves while maintaining control of  short-term interest rates set by the monetary policymaking body. As a result of  these experiences in managing large balance sheets, many central banks have  reviewed, and in some cases modified, their strategies for supplying reserves  and controlling interest rates. Although their approaches have differed in specifics,  they share common elements that reflect the fundamental factors that shape the  supply and demand for reserves. 1\n\nCentral banks have  multiple goals in supplying reserves to the banking system that frequently  involve trade-offs. 2 First and foremost, they target a level of the policy interest rate and aim to  minimize the variability of the policy rate around that target. In addition,  they have goals related to supporting the functioning of financial markets and  financial stability. For example, central banks may see advantages or  disadvantages to interbank lending in money markets, as well as costs and  benefits related to central bank lending into markets.\n\nIn this talk, I will consider  this question using a relatively simple analytical framework for the supply and  demand of reserves that can be applied to various jurisdictions with  differences in institutional arrangements and policy objectives. I see this  exercise as being in the spirit of William Poole’s seminal analysis of the  optimal instrument for monetary policy. 3 My goal is to provide a  useful background for the rich discussion ahead of us at this conference and  elsewhere.\n\nI should emphasize that  the substance of my remarks is based on my joint research with Gara Afonso,  Gabriele La Spada, and Thomas Mertens, and I have also benefited greatly from what  I have learned from my amazing colleagues at the New York Fed and on the BIS  Markets Committee. They deserve the credit, and I get to give the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nThe Demand for Reserves\n\nThe key building block  of this analysis is that the demand for central bank reserves is inherently nonlinear  and subject to uncertainty. For those who are interested, all the equations,  Greek letters, and mathematical proofs are in the paper. For this presentation,  I will stick to words and pictures to describe the model and results. 4\n\nSpecifically, a central  bank faces a demand curve for reserves that describes the relationship between  the quantity of reserves and the spread between the policy rate and the  interest rate on reserves. This is illustrated by Figure 1 , which shows the  relationship between the level of reserves in the United States, normalized by  banking assets, and the spread between the federal funds rate and the interest  paid on reserves from 2015 to early 2020, before the onset of the pandemic. The  spread represents the price of reserves, and the shape of the demand curve is  the result of a trade-off: Banks receive benefits from holding reserves, but they  also incur costs. Since the net benefits decline with the quantity of reserves  held, the curve is nonlinear with a lower asymptote.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2 , this  relationship can be represented in a stylized way by a piecewise linear demand curve  characterized by three regions. For a low level of reserves, the slope of the  demand curve is steep. A small change in the quantity of reserves results in a  meaningful change in the spread. This is referred to as the “scarce reserves” region.  At a sufficiently large level of reserves, the slope of the demand curve  flattens but is still downward-sloping. This region is called “ample reserves.”  At an even larger level of reserves, the demand curve is flat. This region is  called “abundant reserves.” The point at which reserves become abundant is  labeled X A in the figure. For reserves above that level, the spread  is constant at .\n\nSo far, I have described  the demand for reserves as if it were fixed and known. However, there is  considerable evidence that this demand curve in the U.S. has shifted at times over  the past 15 years. 5 I will now introduce uncertainty by including random variation in the demand  for reserves, as represented by leftward and  rightward shifts in the value of the cutoff for abundant reserves, ΧA. 6 Such variation  is illustrated in Figure 3 , where I have simplified the model to two regions—ample  and abundant reserves. And the demand shock is indicated by the random variable  ε. For a given quantity of reserves X, large shocks have asymmetric effects on  the resulting level of the spread, as illustrated in the figure. This  asymmetric effect is due to the nonlinearity of the demand curve. A sizable  positive shock to demand has a larger effect on the spread than a negative  shock of equal magnitude, where in the latter case, the presence of the flat  demand curve limits the decline in the spread.\n\nBecause positive shocks  raise interest spreads more than negative shocks lower them, the net effect of  shocks is to raise the spread on average. That is, the combination of random  variation in demand and a nonlinear demand curve implies that for a given  quantity of reserves, the resulting stochastic mean level of the spread is  above the value implied by the demand curve absent uncertainty. This  relationship is illustrated by the solid red line in Figure 4 , which again assumes  there are only two regions. The difference between the mean value of the spread  under uncertainty and the corresponding deterministic value, shown by the black  line, is greatest for levels of reserves in the vicinity of the cutoff between  ample and abundant reserves under the deterministic curve.\n\nThe Optimal Supply of Reserves\n\nI’ll now turn to the  central bank’s problem of selecting the optimal provision of reserves given the  nonlinear demand curve and uncertainty. A central bank is assumed to target a  level of the spread, denoted by Ŝ, that lies in the region of ample reserves.  The choice of the target spread reflects considerations related to the  efficient functioning of money markets and the provision of interbank lending  that facilitates the redistribution of reserves across banks. 7 In the following, I take this  as a fixed, exogenous target.\n\nThe central bank has  potentially two tools that it can use to achieve this objective. First, it sets  the aggregate level of reserves available to the banking system, as defined by  the variable X. Second, it may make available a lending facility to the banking  system that offers loans to banks at an interest rate, which I will represent by  L. For ease of exposition, I assume that this lending facility has unlimited  capacity, but later, I will discuss the implications of putting constraints or  costs on its use. 8\n\nIn a deterministic world  without uncertainty, this problem is easy to solve. The central bank sets the  optimal level of reserves equal to the value consistent with the intersection  of the demand curve with the target spread. This is labeled by X* on Figure 4 .  In this case, perfect interest rate control is achieved at the targeted level without  a lending facility.\n\nIn the presence of  uncertainty regarding the demand for reserves, the problem is more interesting.  If the central bank must set the level of reserves and the rate on the lending  facility before the demand shock is realized, it can no longer perfectly  control the spread. To make things precise, I assume the central bank has a  quadratic objective function—that is, it minimizes the mean squared difference  between the realized spread and its target rate. With this specification of the  objective, the central bank’s problem can be described by the sum of two parts:  the squared difference between the mean spread and the target and the variance  of the spread.\n\nWith all of this  preparation, I can now derive the optimal supply of reserves. I will start with  the special case where there is no lending facility. This simplifies the  exposition while conveying clearly a key result.\n\nCase 1: No Lending Facility\n\nLet me cut to the chase:  Absent a lending facility, the optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is  unequivocally higher than it is without uncertainty. This finding is the result  of two effects that create a precautionary motive to add to the supply of  reserves to guard against a positive demand shock. First, as I discussed  earlier, for a given level of reserves, the presence of uncertainty increases  the mean spread. Second, increasing the supply of reserves reduces the variance  of the spread because there is a greater probability of being on the flat part  of the demand curve.\n\nIndeed, if the  uncertainty is great enough, the optimal level of reserves can exceed the  cutoff for abundant reserves under no uncertainty. That is, uncertainty can  imply that it is optimal to supply abundant reserves even if the central bank’s  target spread is in the ample reserves region, as I have assumed.\n\nAlthough uncertainty  increases the optimal supply of reserves, the resulting mean level of the  spread may rise or fall with uncertainty. This ambiguous result owes to  uncertainty increasing the mean spread for a given level of reserves, while the  higher optimal level of reserves reduces the spread. Therefore, one cannot  judge whether the policy is optimal simply because the mean spread equals its  target.\n\nCase 2: Lending Facility\n\nI now consider the case  where there is a lending facility. There are a number of factors that influence  the choice of the facility lending rate and the conditions of use for such a  facility. 9 For the present purposes, I  do not explicitly analyze these factors but instead assume the spread between the  facility lending rate and the interest rate on reserves is set exogenously at a  level L above the target spread and is invariant to the quantity of reserves.  If the intersection of demand and reserves supply occurs at a spread above L,  the incremental demand is assumed to be met by the lending facility. Such a  situation is illustrated as the solid green horizonal line in Figure 5 .\n\nIn addition, I assume  that there are frictions or costs associated with the scale of the use of the  lending facility. I model this as an additional quadratic penalty in the  central bank’s objective that’s associated with the magnitude of lending  facility usage. 10 For example, such a penalty could reflect the view that heavy and regular use  of the lending facility fosters an overreliance on the central bank for funding  needs that should be tempered.\n\nWith a lending facility,  the choice of the optimal supply of reserves takes into account the fact that  the spread is capped at the lending rate. This mitigates the precautionary  motive for supplying reserves to guard against a positive demand shock. This  effect is greatest when the lending rate is closer to the target spread. On the  other hand, if the lending rate is very high relative to the target spread,  then the facility is rarely used, and the optimal supply of reserves is near  what it would be absent a facility.\n\nThe choice of the  optimal level of reserves also reflects the trade-off between reducing excess  reserves and incurring the costs of additional usage of the facility: The  greater the cost incurred for usage of the facility, the higher the optimal  level of reserves. In particular, if the costs associated with usage of the  facility are relatively small, then the optimal supply of reserves is lower  than it would be absent the lending facility. But if the costs are sufficiently  large, the optimal supply may exceed that in absence of a lending facility to  guard against extensive use of the facility.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis analytical  framework for the supply and demand of reserves under uncertainty provides  valuable insights into the factors affecting the optimal supply of reserves and  the design of liquidity facilities. First, absent a lending facility, the  optimal supply of reserves under uncertainty is greater than it would be absent  uncertainty. Second, the ideal choice for the supply of reserves depends on  institutional factors, such as the pricing of and frictions related to  liquidity facilities as well as preferences over the various goals related to monetary  policy implementation. In other words, there is no single best way to supply  reserves; rather, the best mix of tools depends on circumstances and policy  preferences unique to each jurisdiction.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Hello,  everyone. It’s a pleasure to speak with you today. The summer solstice was yesterday  evening, making today one of the longest days of the year. But please rest  assured that I won’t take advantage of that and go on for too long. That  way, there will be plenty of time for me to answer your questions.\n\nThe  good thing about virtual meetings like this one is that I get to speak with people  from across the country with the click of a button. But I also know that there  is nothing more heartwarming than when families and friends are finally able to  get back together in person after all this time. Indeed, we are starting to see  “the smiles returning to the faces,” and I mean that now quite literally.\n\nToday  I’m going to talk about three things: first, I’ll briefly discuss the transition  away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a topic of particular  relevance to this audience; second, I’ll talk about the outlook for the economy  and where we are in the recovery; and finally, what that means for monetary  policy.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the usual disclaimer that  the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nThe Final  Countdown\n\nI’ve  spoken about the LIBOR transition many times before, 1 but the message bears  repeating, especially now that we’re only about six months away from moving off  of LIBOR, once and for all.\n\nDuring  this critical time, it’s important to focus on building a strong and robust foundation  for the future so that we never have to go through a transition like this one  again.\n\nThat’s  why when it comes to choosing a LIBOR replacement, you need to be confident  that the rate you use is appropriate and will hold up even under stress. At the  Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) meeting earlier this month, FSOC  members highlighted risks around reference rates that share many of LIBOR’s  shortcomings, such as being based on thinly-traded markets. 2 The Alternative Reference  Rates Committee (ARRC) studied this issue carefully and consulted thoroughly  with the public, and recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as  the main U.S. dollar reference rate for the post-LIBOR world. Importantly, SOFR  proved to be resilient even during the market stress at the height of the  pandemic last spring and will provide a rock-solid foundation for the  post-LIBOR world. 3\n\nThe final comment I’ll add on this topic is that while much progress has been made in the transition away from LIBOR, time is running out, and your transition from LIBOR should happen as soon as practically possible. This is not something to leave until the last minute.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nOK,  enough on LIBOR, at least for today. I’ll now turn to the theme of the economic  outlook and where I see us on the path to a full recovery.\n\nLet  me begin by saying that we’ve come a long way since the darkest days of the pandemic,  and I expect even brighter days ahead—and I don’t just mean that because it is  finally summertime.\n\nWe  find ourselves at an extraordinary juncture in the recovery. Thanks to  widespread vaccinations and robust support from fiscal policy, the economy is  reopening more quickly and more strongly than expected. When it comes to the  economy, it’s getting better all the time.\n\nThe  rapid rebound is excellent news—it means more jobs and a brighter future. But,  it also means that we are seeing strains as businesses try to keep up with the  rapid acceleration in demand for their products. After sharp declines in  employment, production, and prices last year, the opposite is now occurring. As  a result, we are seeing a record number of job openings, supply bottlenecks in  sectors such as autos, and sharp increases in prices for some high-in-demand  goods and services.\n\nTo  get an idea of how fast the economy is restarting, it’s useful to look at gross  domestic product, or GDP. Fueled by rapid growth in consumer spending, business  investment, and housing, I expect inflation-adjusted, or real, GDP to increase  seven percent this year. If that forecast comes true, that would be the fastest  year-over-year growth rate since 1984.\n\nThis  strong growth in demand is translating into large numbers of people getting  back to work. More than half a million jobs were added in May, which is good  progress. But, I cannot stress enough that we still have a long way to go to get  back to full strength. For example, there are still over seven million fewer  jobs today than before the pandemic.\n\nUnderlying  these numbers are sizable movements of people in the labor market. Employers are  hiring at a rapid clip, with nearly seven million people moving from the ranks  of non-employed to employed per month. At the same time, people are leaving  jobs in elevated numbers, either to look for new work or to exit the labor  force altogether. These big movements in the labor market, both in hires and  quits, reflect the extraordinary nature of the pandemic, as employers and  workers adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.\n\nWhat  should we take from all of this? Clearly, the demand for labor is very strong—we  hear that from employers who are finding it hard to fill all their openings—and  a lot of people are getting hired. At the same time, the numerous people  leaving their current jobs contribute to the record-high level of postings as  employers look to fill newly vacant positions. We won’t see all the vacancies  filled overnight—it takes time for employers to fill open positions. With the  strong, sustained demand for workers and progress on hiring, I am confident  that we will see continued strong job gains going forward.\n\nThe last aspect of the  outlook that I’ll speak about is inflation. Recent inflation data have moved up  sharply, which has garnered a great deal of attention. My view is that the spike  in inflation mostly reflects the temporary effects of the surprisingly rapid  opening of the economy. Given the importance of this issue, I will explain my  thinking in more detail.\n\nWith the economy  reopening, people  are once again enjoying activities, such as travel, that they postponed during  the worst days of the pandemic. With the return of these activities, prices for  things like airfares and hotel rooms have rebounded. But we must keep in mind  that many of these increases are simply reversals of the large declines we saw  last year when the pandemic first took hold. Once these prices have fully  adjusted to the reopened economy, they shouldn’t continue to increase at recent  elevated rates, and their effect on overall inflation should subside.\n\nIn  addition, we have seen surges in demand for certain goods that have outstripped  available supply. The clearest example is used cars, which are in very high  demand, reflecting factors such as the needs of a remote workforce, stimulus  payments, and demand from rental car companies. At the same time, the supply of  vehicles has been held back by earlier production cutbacks and shortages of  semiconductor chips. This imbalance in supply and demand has caused used car  prices to soar. Looking forward, supply will slowly come back online, and I therefore  expect car prices to stabilize and then decline over time to more normal  levels.\n\nWe  have already seen this type of dynamic play out in some sectors. The latest  data show growth in wholesale used car prices slowing in the first half of  June. 4 And lumber prices, which  soared during the pandemic as housing demand surged and supply struggled to  keep up, have declined sharply in recent weeks.\n\nI  expect that as price reversals and  short-run imbalances from the economy reopening play out, inflation will come  down from around 3 percent this year to close to 2 percent next year and in 2023.  It  goes without saying that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the  inflation outlook, and I will be watching the data closely.\n\nThe Fed’s Policy  Response\n\nIt’s  clear that the economy is improving at a rapid rate, and the medium-term  outlook is very good. But the data and conditions have not progressed enough  for the FOMC to shift its monetary policy stance of strong support for the  economic recovery.\n\nSpecifically, the FOMC decided last week to maintain the  target range for the federal funds rate at zero to ¼ percent and made no  changes to its program of asset purchases. In thinking about adjusting its  stance in the future, the FOMC has defined conditions and measures that will  inform its decision-making. In terms of the federal funds rate, the FOMC said  it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor  market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC's assessments of  maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to  moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also said it will maintain  its current asset purchase pace until substantial further progress has been  made toward its employment and inflation goals. 5\n\nConclusion\n\nI  hope you remember the “things we said today,” but if not, here’s my final message.  The sun is shining, both literally and figuratively. Progress on vaccinations  and the economy is very welcome news, and I look forward to a full and complete  recovery, accompanied by inflation that averages 2 percent over time.\n\nThank  you, and I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "I  would like to start by thanking Tharman for the invitation to participate in this  panel of esteemed current and former policymakers.  I am also pleased to continue the long tradition  of hosting the Group of Thirty at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and very  much look forward to this morning’s discussion.\n\nIn  my remarks, I will focus on the following question:  What long-run monetary policy strategy is best  suited to anchor inflation expectations, foster price stability, and promote  maximum employment?  I emphasize the  phrase “long-run” because I will focus on the features of a systematic policy  framework, rather than tactical policy decisions.  This topic is not only of academic interest:  As was recently announced, the Federal Reserve  is embarking on a review of its long-run monetary policy framework. 1 I will argue that the global decline in the  neutral rate of interest over the past quarter century poses significant challenges  to maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations in a standard inflation-targeting  regime.  I will then lay out some alternative  policy strategies that have the potential of providing a solid anchor for inflation  expectations—even with a very low neutral interest rate—while preserving broad  continuity with current inflation-targeting practice.  Now that I am already way out on a limb, I  should emphasize that my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those  of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nAs a  starting point, it’s useful to travel back in time to the 1980s and 1990s, when  inflation targeting was introduced.  The  problem at the time was high and variable inflation that contributed to  macroeconomic instability and unmoored inflation expectations, which in turn  fueled high and variable inflation.  To break  this vicious cycle, numerous central banks instituted inflation targeting, or  variants thereof, with a focus on bringing inflation down to a low level and  fostering the establishment of stable, well-anchored inflation expectations.\n\nThis  strategy worked extraordinarily well in the decade preceding the global  financial crisis, as central banks were able to achieve remarkably low and  stable inflation, leading to a positive feedback loop between low inflation and  well-anchored inflation expectations.\n\nToday,  we face an altogether different set of problems stemming from a very low  neutral interest rate—that is, the short-term real interest rate consistent  with an economy operating at its potential alongside low and stable inflation.  Ironically, the problem we need to solve these  days is the risk of inflation that is persistently too low , rather than too high .\n\nToday’s  low neutral interest rates reflect the culmination of trends extending back 25  years.  A quarter century ago, a typical  estimate of the neutral rate in the United States was 2 or 2½ percent—consistent  with historical averages over the preceding half century.  Since then, however, there has been a clear  downward trend in neutral interest rates in the United States and other advanced  economies, with current estimates ranging from 0 to 1½ percent. 2\n\nThree  main global trends appear to account for the bulk of the decline in the neutral  rate over the past quarter century. 3 One is demographics: populations are aging as  people live longer and birth rates have fallen. The second is productivity growth, which has  slowed around the world. The third is the  heightened demand for safe and liquid assets, which has led to a wider wedge  between yields on safe government securities or central bank reserves and yields  on riskier assets such as corporate bonds.\n\nImportantly,  the onset of these trends preceded the global financial crisis and they have  continued even as countries have recovered.   Although there is a great deal of uncertainty about the neutral rate,  and conditions may change, a reasonable assumption is that it will remain low—not  far from current levels—for the foreseeable future. 4\n\nWhat  does a low neutral rate mean for monetary policy and the anchoring of inflation  expectations?  When a recession hits,  central banks may not be able to reduce interest rates well below their neutral  level to stimulate the economy as warranted because of the effective lower  bound on nominal interest rates.  This shortfall  of monetary accommodation would result in less desirable economic outcomes  during the recession and recovery.  In  particular, inflation would typically undershoot its desired target during  these episodes.  The persistence of below-target  inflation rates in many advanced economies over the past decade is a testament  to this dynamic.\n\nAs a  result of the inherent asymmetry introduced by the lower bound on interest rates,  an inflation-targeting central bank could experience inflation that is below  target, once we consider the average inflation rate over periods when policy is  constrained and those when it is not.   With inflation on average below the target level, inflation expectations  will likely slip below the target rate as well. 5\n\nA  simple example helps illustrate this problem.  Say that 80 percent of the time, the lower  bound on interest rates does not constrain policy and the central bank aims for  a 2 percent target inflation rate.  During  these “good” times, an inflation-targeting central bank aims to keep inflation near  2 percent.  But, 20 percent of the time,  the economy falls into a recession that’s severe enough that the lower bound  constrains policy. Assume that during  these periods, inflation averages only 1 percent.  So, 80 percent of the time inflation averages  2 percent and 20 percent of the time inflation averages 1 percent.  The resulting average rate of inflation is  about 1.8 percent.  As a consequence,  inflation expectations are likely to become anchored at the long-run average of  1.8 percent, below the desired 2 percent target.\n\nBut,  that’s not the end of the story.  This  downward shift in inflation expectations has a second-round effect on real  interest rates, the economy, and inflation.  When policy is constrained by the effective  lower bound, the downward shift in inflation expectations raises the real  interest rate, further diminishing the degree of monetary stimulus, making the  downturn worse and reducing inflation even more.  Even in times when policy is not constrained,  the expectation of below-target inflation in the future affects current decisions,  putting additional downward pressure on inflation.  In other words, monetary policy is always  swimming upstream, fighting a current of too-low inflation expectations that  interferes with achieving the target inflation rate.\n\nA  number of alternative monetary policy frameworks have been proposed that aim to  tackle the problems associated with the lower bound on interest rates.  Although they differ in many ways, it is  useful to divide these proposals into three broad categories.  The first option is to maintain the basic  framework of inflation targeting and to rely on a combination of aggressive  conventional and unconventional policy actions when facing economic downturns to  limit the deleterious effects of the lower bound.  This carries with it the risk that inflation  expectations become anchored at too low a level.\n\nThe  second option is “average-inflation targeting,” whereby the central bank  purposefully aims to achieve an above-target inflation rate in “good” times  when the lower bound is not a constraint.   Properly designed and implemented, such an overshoot can offset the inflation  undershoot during “bad” times so that the longer-run average inflation rate and  inflation expectations are in line with the target.\n\nThe  third option is price-level targeting, including its various offshoots, such as  nominal GDP targeting and temporary price-level targeting.  In such a regime, the central bank commits to  keep the price level near a steadily growing target path.  Like average-inflation targeting, this  strategy promises to overshoot the target inflation rate in “good” times to  make up for the inflation undershoot when policy is constrained.\n\nIn  theory, both average-inflation and price-level targeting can solve the problem  of anchoring inflation expectations at the target rate while maintaining a low  inflation target rate amid low neutral rates.   Although price-level targeting is a bigger leap from inflation targeting  than average-inflation targeting, each can be implemented in ways that are very  similar to standard inflation targeting, either in terms of forecast-targeting  or a policy rule. 6 Importantly, neither will likely be  effective in practice unless communicated clearly and carried out consistently  over time.  More broadly, all of these  proposed strategies face potential costs and benefits—in terms of macroeconomic  performance, communication, and robustness to uncertainty—which require careful  study.\n\nIn  considering alternative monetary policy strategies, academic experts, policymakers,  and others from around the world have an important part to play, sharing and  discussing ideas and comparing experiences to help all of us to think through  these issues.  This process of careful  study and discussion proved highly valuable during the development and  implementation of inflation targeting in decades past, and will be equally  valuable in the present debates.\n\nThank  you.",

    "text": "Thank you,  Trevor. And good morning, everyone. It is a special privilege to participate in  this conference honoring my dear friend, colleague, and co-author, Thomas  Laubach.\n\nMany of you knew  Thomas personally, and all of you knew him through his work. He was a brilliant  economist, trusted colleague, and an inspiring leader. We miss Thomas' dedication,  good cheer, and sense of humor,  and his impact on everyone  he touched endures.\n\nOur collaboration  started in the fall of 2000 with a shared interest in figuring out how to  measure the elusive natural rate of interest, otherwise known as r-star. At the  time, neither of us had any idea that our research on this topic would continue  for 20 years.\n\nKathryn Holston  and I are carrying on this work. It's one of the many ways we can honor Thomas  and his memory.  Because of the unprecedented, pandemic-related  shocks to the economy, we paused our regular publication of r-star estimates in  late 2020. This conference is the perfect venue to announce that we are  resuming them.  But first, I want to take some time to share r-star's origin  story, which is how I came to know Thomas.\n\nBefore I go any  further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nQuestioning the Assumption\n\nThe idea of a  natural rate of interest has been around ever since the Swedish economist Knut  Wicksell wrote about it in 1898. Early on, it was recognized that it's not  something that can be directly observed or measured. As the economist John H. Williams  wrote in 1931:\n\nThe topic gained renewed  relevance in 1993, following John Taylor's famous description of a monetary  policy rule that incorporated an assumption of a natural rate of 2 percent. 2 For policymakers,  the natural questions—pardon the pun—were: Is 2 percent the right  number? Does it change over time? And how would we know? Those were the  very questions than then-Federal Reserve Governor Larry Meyer posed to Board  staff back in 2000. And that's what brought Thomas and me together.\n\nA Meeting of Minds\n\nIn July of that  year, I returned to the Board from a stint at the Council of Economic Advisors,  shortly after Thomas joined the Board staff from the Kansas City Fed. We hit it  off immediately. It just so happened that both of us had been thinking about the  natural rate of interest. And since Governor Meyer had raised the subject, we moved  quickly to develop an approach to answer his questions.\n\nAlthough we  didn't know it then, we were following exactly the problem the other John Williams  laid out in 1931. 3 Simply put, Thomas had a hammer. And we  found a new nail. The hammer was the Kalman filter, which is about inferring the  behavior of an object from its effects on other objects. And the nail was  r-star.\n\nA Fast  Start\n\nOn December 14, 2000, after a few short months of working together, we  wrote our ideas and results in a memo to the Board of Governors. 4 The memo  started with the bold declaration:\n\nAnd the Laubach-Williams (LW) model was born. Starting in May 2001,  r-star estimates made their way into the staff Bluebook  prepared for the FOMC. 5\n\nLooking back, I am struck by how quickly these  ideas came together. I must also acknowledge the unwavering support we received  from senior leadership to bring this new research to policymakers.\n\nWithin a year of writing the memo, we put out the academic version of  this work. 6 , 7 The original paper included a section on time-varying r-star's  implications for monetary policy. But the editor cut it, leaving it \"for future  research.\"\n\nWhat's Past is Prologue\n\nFast forward a  decade, and an entirely new question about r-star arose: Why had estimates of  r-star fallen so low?  It's a  topic Thomas and I explored in our \"Redux\" paper. 8 And in 2017, Kathryn, Thomas, and I expanded the  set of economies for which we estimated r-star. 9\n\nIndeed, before the pandemic, historically low  estimates of r-star characterized advanced economies across the globe. This is  illustrated by the Holston-Laubach-Williams (HLW) estimates of r-star for the  United States and the Euro Area using data through 2019, shown in Figure 1 .  Both were around ½ percent before the onset of the pandemic, far lower than  estimates from preceding decades.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nOne of the features of the LW and HLW models is that  both are designed to be flexible and to \"let the data speak\" in measuring  changes in the natural rate of interest. Even this flexibility, however, has  its limits. And the economic turmoil brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic went  far beyond what the models were originally designed for.\n\nIn particular, the pandemic violated two key  assumptions about the nature of macroeconomic disturbances underlying the models. 10 First, the Kalman filter statistical method that  serves as the models' workhorse assumes random disturbances to the economy follow  a normal, or bell-shaped, distribution. Relative to historical experience,  COVID-19 represented an extremely rare tail event in terms of its effect on the  economy. Second, the models assume that these disturbances are serially  uncorrelated, which is at odds with the sequence of shutdowns and reopenings  associated with COVID-19.\n\nThe highly unusual nature of the effects of  COVID-19 is illustrated by the model auxiliary residuals for the output gap,  shown for the United States and the Euro Area, in Figure 2 . These residuals are  related to the difference between the data and the model's prediction for the  data. The dashed lines in the figure indicate two standard deviations. For the  United States, these residuals are as large as 15 standard deviations, and for  the Euro Area, they exceed 20 standard deviations in some periods. In a purely  statistical sense, the probability of such an event occurring even once, much  less twice, is infinitesimally small.\n\nAfter the onset of the pandemic, we suspended  publication of r-star estimates due to this extreme economic volatility and the  elevated uncertainty about how the pandemic would evolve.\n\nThe Relaunch\n\nI am pleased to report that starting today, we are  relaunching regular publication of the LW and HLW  estimates of r-star. The estimates, along  with model documentation, are available on the New York Fed website and will be  updated each quarter. 11\n\nTo address the two violations of the original model  assumptions caused by the pandemic, we made two modifications to the estimation  of both models.  I should note that this is described in detail  in the paper, \" Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest After  COVID-19 ,\" that  was posted this morning on the New York Fed's r-star web page.\n\nFirst, we incorporated an additional persistent  supply shock related to the effects of the pandemic that directly reduce the  economy's potential. We measure this shock using the Oxford COVID-19 Government  Response Stringency Index for each economy. 12 This index aggregates measures of government  containment and shutdown policies. Because the index is no longer being  produced, we assume that in each case, it declines smoothly to zero over  2023-24.\n\nSecond, we use a statistical procedure that  accounts for outliers in the model's estimation. Specifically, from the second  quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimate a time-varying  process for the variance of the shocks hitting the economy. This procedure  places a lower weight on periods when there are very large outliers.\n\nOur results show that outliers are particularly large  in 2020, as seen in Figure 2 . By comparison, the estimated magnitude of  outliers is relatively modest in 2021 and 2022. Starting in 2023, we assume  that the distribution of shocks is no longer affected by the pandemic.\n\nLetting the Data Speak\n\nEstimation of the modified model reveals three key  findings. First, the modified estimation procedure yields results that are overall  quite similar to those from the original model during the pre-pandemic period.  Second, the current estimates of r-star are similar to those estimated directly  before the pandemic. Third, the estimates of the natural level of output at the  end of 2022 are much lower than predicted before the pandemic.\n\nThe current HLW estimates of r-star in the United  States are shown in Figure 3 . For comparison, the figure also shows estimates  using a version of the model that is not adjusted to take into account COVID or  outliers and holds the parameter values fixed at estimates using data through  the end of 2019.\n\nThe two sets of estimates are very similar through  2019. They differ sharply during the acute period of the pandemic, however,  when the estimates from the unmodified model exhibit large swings due to the  presence of sizeable outliers. Interestingly, the two estimates are very close  to each other at the end of the sample. That is, the modifications to the model  do not interfere with \"letting the data speak.\"\n\nA Modest Imprint\n\nBased on the new r-star estimates for Canada, the  Euro Area, and the United States, we see no signs of a significant reversal of  the decline in r-star estimates evident in prior decades. 13 In fact, in all three economies, the r-star  estimates in 2022 are within two-tenths of a percentage point of the  corresponding estimate in 2019.\n\nThe largest differences between model estimates  pre- and post-pandemic relate to the level of each economy's potential output. Figure 4 compares the model's measure of the natural level of output based on  estimates using data through the fourth quarter of 2019 (the blue line) to  current estimates. At the end of 2022, the COVID-adjusted level of potential  output (the black line) is 4.2 percent below the pre-pandemic projection for the  fourth quarter of 2022, with nearly half of that shortfall explained by the  COVID shock measure and the remainder a permanent change in the natural level  of output (the gold line).\n\nIn summary, according to the model estimates, the  main longer-term consequence from the pandemic period is a reduction in  potential output, but the  imprint on r-star appears to be  relatively modest.  Importantly, there is no evidence that the era of very  low natural rates of interest has ended.\n\nThe Future of R-star?\n\nThese estimates indicate that r-star today is about  where it was before the pandemic. But where is it headed in the future? Of  course, this is impossible to know with any certainty.\n\nOne way to gauge how forecasters perceive the  future of r-star is to use forecast data to estimate it. Figure 5 shows the HLW-based  estimates of r-star in the U.S. through the end of 2024. It uses published data  in the first quarter of 2023. The May 2023 Blue Chip forecasts for inflation,  GDP, and interest rates are used as proxies for data from the second quarter of  2023 through the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe resulting estimate of r-star is about ½ percent  in the first quarter of 2023, and subsequently falls to slightly below zero.  Evidently, the value of r-star implied by private forecasts is, if anything,  even lower than today's estimate. Time will tell whether this turns out to be  the case.\n\nNo One  Right Answer\n\nLet me conclude by sharing something I learned from Thomas and hold  dear. It's actually hidden in the last line of the abstract from our first published  paper. It says: \"Estimates of the natural rate of interest, however, are very  imprecise and subject to real-time measurement error.\" 14\n\nTo some, that may sound like a negative statement. But it's also what  makes empirical research so exciting and challenging. There is no one right  answer and no single way to view the world. Empirical research is a process of  continuous learning and adaptation—fueled by perseverance. People come up with  different approaches, and we learn from all of them.\n\nSo, while we started with the problem of how to estimate r-star, it  didn't end with that first Board memo. Rather, it opened the door to new  questions, which led to further challenges and even more research. This is the  legacy of Thomas Laubach, and it's what brings us all together today.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good afternoon. I'm so pleased to be here with you today. We've  waited a long time to gather in person. And I think we can all agree that  meeting in this charming location was worth the wait. For most visitors, Eltville  is renowned for its wine and roses. But for economists, it's a place to convene  for weighty discussions on monetary policy. Given the events happening around  the world today, there is much to discuss.\n\nWe are meeting at a time of significant economic challenges and uncertainties.  Inflation has reached levels not seen in decades, both in the United States and  in many other countries. And recent events—including the war in Ukraine,  lockdowns in China, and other supply disruptions related to the ongoing Covid-19  pandemic—are exacerbating near-term inflationary pressures and uncertainty  about the global economic outlook.\n\nThe challenge for monetary policy today is clear: to bring  inflation down while maintaining a strong economy. This, of course, is at the  heart of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum  employment. Although the task is difficult, it is not insurmountable. We have  the tools to return balance to the economy and restore price stability, and we  are committed to using them.\n\nBefore I go any further, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer  that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nOverheating\n\nWhenever I talk about monetary policy, I start with the Federal  Reserve's dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. With the unemployment rate back to very low pre-pandemic levels,  and a variety of indicators showing the labor market is very strong, maximum  employment has been achieved. But, with inflation rising to unacceptably  high levels, we are far from our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation. High  inflation harms those who are most in need. Too many families are now  struggling to meet the increasing cost of necessities. I am resolutely focused on  restoring price stability, which is the foundation for a vibrant and healthy  economy.\n\nOver the past year, inflation has increased rapidly and dramatically  to levels last seen in the early 1980s. A year ago, overall inflation, as  measured by the percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  price index, was 2.5 percent. In March, it was 6.6 percent. A portion of this sharp  rise reflects global increases in food and energy prices. But, even excluding  energy and food costs, the \"core\" inflation rate has increased from 2 percent a  year ago to 5.2 percent today.\n\nThree major imbalances are contributing  to an overheating economy and high inflation. First, the  effects of the pandemic have significantly increased demand for certain  categories of spending, especially for durable goods and housing. This increase  in demand is occurring while supply in these sectors is being adversely  affected by the pandemic.\n\nThe case study for this dynamic is the automobile sector. The  combination of high demand and supply shortages has led to historically low  inventories. Customers are lining up to buy cars but are finding the dealer lots  empty. It's a seller's market, and prices have soared. New car prices are up nearly  15 percent since the start of the pandemic, and used car prices have skyrocketed,  rising more than 50 percent.\n\nAnother prominent example is housing.  With remote work policies in place, many people have  relocated—buying larger homes in the South, in the suburbs, and in more  affordable cities. This shift has caused demand for housing in some regions to  far outstrip supply, while new housing construction has been held back by  shortages in labor and materials. The imbalance between demand and supply has  led to bidding wars.  Homes have sailed off the market at  record prices, with many purchased sight unseen. This combination of high  demand and crimped supply has also resulted in rapid increases in rents,  especially for apartments coming onto the market.\n\nThe second major imbalance is in the labor market, where overall demand  far exceeds existing supply. The ratio of job vacancies to the unemployed is near its all-time high, workers are quitting  jobs at a record rate, and employers are bidding up wages. This sizzling hot labor  market is also related to the imbalance between demand and supply for goods and  housing, as businesses seek to hire more workers to help meet the high demand. And  labor supply shortages and rising labor costs are contributing to price  pressures across a wide range of goods and services.\n\nFinally, global  imbalances in supply and demand have also contributed to supply-chain problems  that have affected the availability and costs of shipping, as well as a variety  of inputs into production—including semiconductor chips used in making cars.  The war in Ukraine and recent lockdowns in China have further  constrained the global supply of goods and commodities, including food and  energy.\n\nTurning Down the Heat\n\nWith clear signs of demand exceeding supply and an economy running  too hot, the primary focus of monetary policy is to turn down the heat and  restore price stability.\n\nAlthough we are facing highly unusual and challenging  circumstances, I am confident we have the right tools to achieve our goals. In  fact, we have an advantage over previous inflationary episodes: Our monetary  policy tools are especially powerful in the very sectors where we see the greatest  imbalances and signs of overheating—such as durable goods and housing. Higher  interest rates will cool demand in these rate-sensitive sectors to levels  better aligned with supply. This will also turn down the heat in the labor  market, reducing the imbalance between job openings and available labor supply.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve on its own cannot  address the global nature of inflation, we are not acting alone. Many other central banks are also taking steps to curb inflation. Taken  together, these actions should help restore balance to supply and demand  globally. That, in turn, should help diminish supply-chain bottlenecks and  reduce inflationary pressures.\n\nTaking  Action\n\nIn the United States, the FOMC is taking strong actions to restore  balance and bring inflation down. So far this year, the FOMC has raised the  target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, including a 50-basis-point  increase announced after our meeting last week. 1 In  addition, the FOMC has indicated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in  the target range will be appropriate. I expect the FOMC will move expeditiously  in bringing the federal funds rate back to more normal levels this year.\n\nThe FOMC also announced last week that starting June 1st,  it will begin reducing the size of its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and  agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans  for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet. 2 The reduction of the balance sheet will play out over the next few years,  eventually bringing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings to a level  consistent with the ample reserves framework that the FOMC reaffirmed in  January when it released its principles for balance sheet reduction. 3\n\nEconomic  Outlook\n\nEven before it took these actions, the FOMC communicated a path of  raising the target federal funds rate and reducing the balance sheet. Those  communications and subsequent actions are having a meaningful effect on broad financial  conditions.  For example, since the beginning of the year, both  two-year Treasury yields and 30-year fixed mortgage rates have risen more than  2 percentage points. We have seen a significant tightening of financial  conditions abroad as well.\n\nOur monetary policy actions will cool the demand side of the  equation. I also expect that over time, the factors contributing to supply shortages  will be resolved, so that some of the rebalancing will be accomplished through  increases in supply, both in the United States and around the world.  For  2022, I expect core PCE inflation to be nearly 4 percent, before falling to  about 2 ½ percent next year. I expect inflation to further decline to close to  our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2024.\n\nI  expect the labor market and economy to continue to show strength and  resilience. For 2022, I expect GDP growth to be around 2 percent and the  unemployment rate to remain around its current low level.\n\nConclusion\n\nReducing  inflation to our longer-run goal while keeping the labor market strong is the  challenge of our time.  The ongoing  pandemic and war in Ukraine bring a tremendous amount of complexity and uncertainty.  We will need to be data dependent and adjust our policy actions as circumstances  warrant. We have the right tools, and we will use them to meet this challenge.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for having me here today. I  always enjoy meeting with business and community leaders in the Federal  Reserve’s Second District. And it’s a real treat to join you here at the Cradle  of Aviation Museum. It’s a great reminder of Long Island’s rich history in  aeronautics and innovation.\n\nIf only I had time to visit some of the space exhibits today. Alas,  maybe next time....\n\nInstead, in my remarks, I will focus on how the Federal Reserve is  working to achieve our goals of maximum employment and price stability. I’ll  also discuss the significant progress we’ve seen in restoring balance to the  economy and bringing inflation down to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s)  2 percent longer-run goal. And I’ll talk about what we still need to see for a  full and sustained return to price stability. Finally, I’ll give my economic outlook.\n\nBefore I get into all of that, I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer  that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect  those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFalling Inflation, Low Unemployment\n\nIn  thinking about the state of our economy today, and what that means for the  future, it’s important to start from where we’ve been.\n\nAs business leaders, you know all too  well the impacts of the pandemic. In many ways, Long Island’s economy mirrors New  York City’s. Both were hit especially hard in 2020—in fact, much harder than  what we saw nationally. And in 2023, both reached an important  milestone, returning to the number of jobs we had before the pandemic.\n\nLast year was also a turning point for the  U.S. economy. Global supply chains, which were severely disrupted during the  pandemic and early in the recovery, returned to normal. 1 Demand came into better balance with supply. And the economy grew far faster than  anyone expected a year ago, boosted by increases in the labor force and  productivity.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market remained  strong, with the unemployment rate under 4 percent—a mark it’s held for the  past two years, the longest stretch in five decades. And inflation—as measured  by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—continued to decline  from its 40-year high of about 7 percent in mid-2022, reaching about 2-1/2  percent last year.\n\nGiven that we are  in a museum that houses an actual Lunar Module—and all eyes are on plans  to return to the moon—I cannot resist the temptation to use the mission to send  astronauts to the moon as a metaphor for the economy.\n\nLike traveling to  the moon and back, inflation shot up, then came back down. And as with the  Apollo missions, it’s the safe return home that’s essential. While we’ve seen  great progress toward achieving our goals, the journey is not yet over, and I  am very focused on making sure we complete this mission successfully.\n\nA  Strong, More Balanced Labor Market\n\nI’m going to spend some time digging deeper into the trends behind  both sides of our dual mandate goals. I’ll start with employment.\n\nAs  you’ll recall, when the economy recovered from the pandemic, the labor market  turned red hot. Demand for workers far exceeded supply, and that imbalance  contributed to rapid wage growth and high inflation.\n\nNow, the labor market—both in the nation as a  whole and here in the Second District—has shown signs of returning to something  closer to normal. Nationally,  many indicators—such as quits rates and surveys of perceptions of availability  of workers and jobs—have returned to around pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThroughout this  process of getting into better balance, the labor market has remained strong.  The current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is near my estimate for the  unemployment rate that is likely to prevail over the longer run. And job growth  continues to be solid.\n\nDespite  the very real progress in restoring balance, two important indicators point to lingering  tightness in the labor market: job openings and wage growth. Job vacancies,  which reached all-time highs in the red-hot labor market of 2022, have trended  lower since then, but are still quite elevated relative to pre-pandemic norms.  And while we have seen measures of wage growth come down from their  pandemic-era peaks, they remain above pre-Covid averages.\n\nThe  Return Trip of Inflation\n\nThat leads me to the other side of our mandate, price stability.  As I mentioned, inflation has declined significantly over the past year and a  half. This drop has been broad-based, encompassing decreases in inflation rates  for food, energy, goods, and services. The decline in inflation has benefited  from a reduction in demand and supply imbalances, both here and internationally,  and the resolution of global supply-chain bottlenecks.\n\nOne way to illustrate  the dynamics of inflation is through the New York Fed’s measure of underlying  inflation, called the Multivariate Core Trend inflation (MCT). 2 Before the pandemic, this measure was  1.8 percent, slightly below the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. As inflation  rose following the pandemic and the onset of Russia’s war on Ukraine, it climbed  sharply, peaking at about 5-1/2 percent in June of 2022.\n\nSince then, the  MCT has fallen significantly, reaching 2.3 percent in December, reflecting  declines in all the major categories of core inflation. Like the flight path the  Apollo missions took to the moon and back, the MCT’s return trajectory is a  mirror image of its rise. But, we still have a ways to go on the journey to sustained  2 percent inflation.\n\nYou see a similar round trip  in measures of near- and medium-term inflation expectations. According  to the  New York Fed’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations, one- and  three-year-ahead inflation expectations rose as inflation surged. Since then,  these measures have come back to Earth.\n\nOne-year-ahead  expectations are within the range seen in the years prior to the pandemic, and three-year-ahead  expectations are now actually a bit below their 2014-2019 average. 3 Other measures of inflation  expectations show similar round-trip trajectories.\n\nMonetary  Policy and the Economic Outlook\n\nIn summary, the economy is strong, imbalances are diminishing, and  inflation has come down but remains above our 2 percent longer-run target.\n\nWhat does that mean for monetary policy?\n\nOver the past two years, the FOMC has put in place a restrictive  stance of monetary policy with the aim of bringing inflation back to 2 percent  on a sustained basis. Given the progress we have seen, the risks to achieving our  maximum employment and price stability goals are moving into better balance.\n\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC kept the target range for the  federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In announcing that  decision, the Committee said it “does not expect it will be appropriate to  reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation  is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” 4\n\nTaking into account the effects of restrictive monetary policy, I expect  GDP growth to slow to about 1-1/2 percent this year, and the unemployment rate  to rise modestly, peaking at around 4 percent.\n\nI expect inflation to continue its return journey to 2 percent,  although there will likely be bumps along the way, as we saw in the most recent  Consumer Price Index data. To be specific, I expect PCE inflation to be around  2 to 2-1/4 percent this year and 2 percent next year.\n\nThe risks to this forecast are two-sided. Inflation may surprise  on the upside, or consumer strength—a major driver of the robust growth we saw  in 2023—may fade more quickly than I anticipate.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrice stability is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity  stands. While the economy has come a long way toward achieving better balance  and reaching our 2 percent inflation goal, we are not there yet. I am committed  to fully restoring price stability in the context of a strong economy and labor  market.\n\nAs we navigate the remainder of this journey, I will be focused on  the data, the economic outlook, and the risks, in evaluating the appropriate  path for monetary policy that best achieves our goals.\n\nOr, to paraphrase the words of the astronaut Alan Shepard, we’ll assess  incoming data until it’s clear all systems are go.",

    "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you to St.  Lawrence University for hosting today's event. It's especially exciting to be  here at the start of an academic year, and I hope you all have a safe and  successful fall semester.\n\nThe motto for New York State is \"Excelsior,\"  meaning \"ever upward.\" What better way to get the full New York experience than  by spending time—even virtually—in the North Country. These visits around the  Federal Reserve's Second District are one of the highlights of my job, and  something I very much look forward to doing again in person when it's safe to  do so.\n\nIt's now been about a year and a half since  the pandemic took hold. Over that time, there's been much change: phases and  stages, highs and lows, shifts and swings, downturns and reversals.\n\nThe virus and its effects on the economy are  ever evolving. On top of that, the unusual and extraordinary nature of this  crisis means circumstances are far beyond the norm for typical economic recessions  and recoveries. Even while there are significant improvements in some areas, setbacks  persist in many others. And now, the emergence and rapid spread of the Delta  variant in parts of the country and around the world has introduced a new layer  of uncertainty.\n\nI'm here today to speak about how some of  those changes are showing up in the economic data as it relates to the  recovery. But it's also important to remember that behind the numbers are  families, businesses, and communities that have suffered and continue to face  tremendous challenges of all kinds.\n\nIn my remarks this afternoon I'll share more  about how what we are seeing in the incoming data relates to the economic  picture nationally and to this region. I'll also highlight some of the unique inflation  dynamics we are seeing. Finally, I'll explain what that means for monetary  policy and the path forward.\n\nBefore I  continue, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDual Mandate\n\nI know there  are a lot of economics students in today's audience. I won't quiz you about the  Federal Reserve, but one aspect of our work that you may be familiar with is  the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" These are the two goals set by Congress: maximum employment  and price stability.\n\nGiven these goals, our focus is studying and understanding  the wide range of developments that affect employment, unemployment, and  inflation.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nSo, what are these developments telling us  about the current economic outlook?\n\nI'll start by saying that the economy continues  to grow at a strong rate. The reopening of the economy means more jobs, more  demand for products, and good momentum toward a full recovery. But, even with  the strong pace of growth we are seeing, a full recovery from the pandemic will  take quite some time to complete. We're seeing this process of adjustment to  rapidly changing circumstances reflected in the data showing a record number of  job openings, supply bottlenecks in sectors such as autos, and sharp increases  in prices for some goods and services that are in high demand.\n\nOne data point that is useful to look at to  better understand these dynamics is gross domestic product, or GDP. Thanks to widespread  vaccinations and robust fiscal support, we saw rapid growth in the first half  of the year. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, there are indications  in the most recent data that the spread of the Delta variant is weighing on  consumer spending and jobs, and the pace of growth appears to be slowing  somewhat relative to the first half. Overall, I expect inflation-adjusted, or  real, GDP to increase around six percent this year.\n\nTurning to employment, job gains have been  strong in recent months, on balance—particularly in sectors that were  especially hit hard at points during the pandemic, such as leisure and  hospitality. This growth in demand translates into large numbers of people  getting back to work. We've seen an average of 750,000 jobs added per month  over the three months through August. And the unemployment rate continues to  come down, and now stands at 5.2 percent.\n\nBut I cannot stress enough that we still have  a long way to go to get back to our maximum employment goal. For example, there  are still over five million fewer jobs today than before the pandemic, and the  unemployment rate is still far above the levels reached early last year.\n\nA more nuanced picture appears when you look more  closely at the employment story. In typical recessions, the challenge is that  there are not enough jobs available for the number of people seeking work. In  today's job market, demand for labor is very high—we hear that from employers  who are finding it hard to fill all their openings—and a lot of people are  getting hired. At the same time, people are leaving their jobs in large  numbers, either to look for new work or exit the labor force altogether.\n\nThis cycle of hires and quits reflects the  extraordinary nature of the pandemic, as workers and employers adapt to rapidly  changing circumstances. These vacancies won't be filled instantly—it takes time  for employers to find the right workers. But as demand for workers and progress  on hiring remains strong, I am confident that we will continue to see meaningful  job gains and continued progress toward maximum employment.\n\nThe last aspect of the outlook that I'll speak  about is inflation. Recent data show core inflation, which excludes volatile  food and energy prices, running at about 3-1/2 percent, which is well above the  Federal Reserve's longer-term 2 percent goal. Taking a closer look at the data,  it's clear that this spike in inflation largely reflects the transitory effects  of the rapid reopening of the economy, which is pushing supply and demand in  extreme ways. As the economy gets through these unusual dynamics, I expect  inflation to come back down to around 2 percent next year. Given the complexity  of this topic, I'll go into this in more detail.\n\nI find it helpful to view recent developments  in terms of three categories. The first is related to prices for goods and  services that underwent huge declines during the pandemic but are now rebounding  as the economy reopens. For example, in the first year of the pandemic, prices  for airfare and lodging fell sharply as people cut back on travel. Since then,  we've seen these rebound toward their pre-pandemic trends, pushing the  inflation rate up.\n\nOne simple way to get a better read of inflation  that is not overly influenced by these big swings in prices is to take the  average inflation rate from the start of the pandemic. That calculation shows  that core inflation has averaged 2-3/4 percent since February of last year.\n\nBut even that number is heavily influenced by  the effects of the pandemic on the second category: used vehicles. Even though  used cars and trucks are a small category, their soaring prices account for  nearly half a percentage point of the inflation since the start of the  pandemic. This is the result of a large imbalance in supply and demand for cars  and trucks related to the pandemic. Strong demand for vehicles is being driven  by rental car companies, stimulus payments, and the needs of a remote workforce.  At the same time, the supply of vehicles has been curbed by earlier production  cutbacks and shortages of semiconductor chips. This confluence of events has  caused prices for motor vehicles—especially used cars and trucks—to soar.\n\nBut, the good news is that used cars are  unlikely to continue to contribute to high inflation in the future. In fact,  the market for used vehicles appears to have stabilized, and as supply and  demand gradually come back into balance, I expect used car prices will start to  move back down toward more normal levels.\n\nThe final category is underlying inflation. Various  measures of longer-term inflation expectations are at levels consistent with  our 2 percent long-run goal. At the same time, inflation has been reasonably tame  in categories of services that are not as directly influenced by the pandemic—and  likewise for measures of underlying inflation such as the trimmed-mean PCE  inflation rate.\n\nAfter this year's spike in inflation related  to the effects of the pandemic—and with inflation expectations and other  measures of underlying inflation close to our 2 percent longer-run goal—I  expect inflation pressures to moderate over time and for the inflation rate to come  back to its underlying trend of around 2 percent next year. It goes without  saying that there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the inflation  outlook, and I will be watching the data closely in the coming months.\n\nNorth Country\n\nI've spoken at great length about the outlook  for the U.S. economy as a whole. While people's experiences are influenced by  the macro outlook, the local economy often plays a very important role in  shaping their economic opportunity.\n\nAt the beginning of this speech, I referred to  the Federal Reserve System's Second District, which is the region the New York  Fed is responsible for. This area includes New York State, parts of New Jersey  and Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To better understand  the state of the economy and economic growth here, I've spent a lot of time  this week meeting with North Country business leaders, community organizers,  and elected officials.\n\nMuch of what emerged from these conversations reflects  the unique aspects of the North Country economy, which suffered outsize job  losses at the onset of the pandemic and continues to experience a reduction in  tourism owing to border closures. This area, like many across the Second  District and around the country, has its challenges. But I expect a strong  recovery will take hold here, supported by the improvement in the broader U.S. economy.\n\nThe Fed's Policy Response\n\nThis brings me to the Fed's policy response. In  its December 2020 statement, the FOMC said it would continue asset purchases at  the current pace until it sees substantial further progress toward our maximum  employment and price stability goals. 1\n\nGiven what I explained earlier, I think it's  clear that we have made substantial further progress on achieving our inflation  goal. There has also been very good progress toward maximum employment, but I  will want to see more improvement before I am ready to declare the test of substantial  further progress being met. Assuming the economy continues to improve as I  anticipate, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset  purchases this year. I will be carefully assessing the incoming data on the  labor market and what it means for the economic outlook, as well as assessing  risks such as the effects of the Delta variant.\n\nIt is important to remember that even after the  asset purchases end, the stance of monetary policy will continue to support a  strong and full economic recovery and sustained attainment of 2 percent average  inflation.\n\nIn particular, the FOMC has indicated that it will  continue to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at its current  level until the economy reaches conditions consistent with its assessments of maximum  employment, and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately  exceed 2 percent for some time. There is still a long way to go before reaching  maximum employment, and over time it should become clearer whether we have  reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo close, I'll say that it's clear that the  pandemic is far from over, both in terms of its effects on health and its  effects on the economy. The unusual nature of this crisis means that this  recovery is far different than anything we have seen before. But with time, I  am confident that the economy will continue to move ever upward.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to your  questions.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and the New  York Fed share a commitment to supporting economic strength in communities and  households in our region. I look forward to speaking more about that in my  discussion with President José González in  a few minutes.\n\nBefore we get to that conversation, I’ll  spend some time focusing on how the Federal Reserve is working to achieve our  goals of maximum employment and price stability. I’ll also discuss the  significant progress we’ve seen in restoring balance to the economy and  bringing inflation back down to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) 2  percent longer-run goal. Finally, I’ll share more on the trajectory of the  Fed’s balance sheet as well as my view on where the economy is headed overall.\n\nNow I need to provide the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nI’ll turn to the numbers in a minute. But first, by a show of  hands, how many of you witnessed the solar eclipse earlier this week? I’ll leave  the complex explanations of cosmic phenomena to Dr. Massimino, who I expect  will give a fascinating presentation later today. But simply stated, an eclipse  happens when several things are perfectly aligned. Or, in the immortal words of  Pink Floyd, when “everything under the sun is in tune.”\n\nLike  Monday’s eclipse, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate has two goals that need to  be in tune with one another: maximum employment and price stability. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving a  sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. The overarching objective of monetary policy now is to  properly balance restoring price stability and maintaining maximum employment,  and the FOMC remains strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent  over time.\n\nStrong Employment, Lower Inflation\n\nThe good news is that over the past year  we have made considerable progress toward this objective. Demand-supply  imbalances have diminished. Global supply chains, which were severely disrupted  during the pandemic and early in the recovery, have mostly returned to normal. 1 And the economy grew far faster than anyone expected last year. Labor supply  has been boosted by an increase in labor force participation among individuals  aged 25-54 years, as well as by increased immigration flows.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market has remained  strong. The unemployment rate has been under 4 percent for more than two years,  which is the longest stretch at that rate in over 50 years—even longer ago than  the release of Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon.”\n\nInflation has come down substantially,  too. The 12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  price index has continued to decline, falling from its 40-year high of above 7  percent in mid-2022 to 2-1/2 percent in the latest reading.\n\nAll in all, there has been tremendous progress  toward better balance. But this episode is not yet over, and I am still very  focused on ensuring we achieve both of our goals.\n\nA Better-Balanced Labor Market\n\nI’m going to delve further into the  trends underlying both sides of our dual mandate, starting with employment.\n\nWhen the U.S. economy recovered from the  pandemic, the labor market turned red-hot. Demand for workers far exceeded  supply, and that imbalance contributed to rapid wage growth and high inflation.\n\nNow, the labor market has shown signs of  returning to something closer to normal. Nationally, many indicators—such as  quits rates and surveys of perceptions of availability of workers and jobs—have  returned to ranges seen before the pandemic. The current unemployment rate of 3.8  percent equals my estimate for the unemployment rate that is likely to prevail  over the longer run, and job growth continues to be solid.\n\nThe story in the Federal Reserve’s  Second District—an area with similar boundaries to that of the Federal Home  Loan Bank of New York—is much like the national one. Our business contacts indicate  that here, too, labor demand and supply are moving into better balance. In  particular, we are hearing from businesses that it is becoming less difficult  to find qualified workers.\n\nDespite the progress in restoring  balance, two important indicators point to lingering tightness in the labor  market: job openings and wage growth. Job vacancies, which reached record highs  in 2022, have trended lower since then, but are still quite elevated relative  to pre-pandemic norms. And while we have seen measures of wage growth come down  from their pandemic-era peaks, they remain above pre-Covid rates.\n\nInflation Over Time\n\nOn the price stability front, we’ve seen  inflation decline significantly over the past year and a half. This drop has  been broad-based, with all major categories of inflation—food, energy, goods,  and services—all trending down. The decline in inflation has benefited from a  reduction in demand and supply imbalances, both here in the U.S. and  internationally. The resolution of global supply-chain bottlenecks has been a  key factor as well. The recent event at the Baltimore port is tragic and may  have some local economic impact, but the overall outlook for supply chain  issues is still broadly on a good path.\n\nImportantly, inflation expectations in  the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations are now again within their  pre-Covid ranges at all horizons, consistent with other measures of inflation  expectations. 2\n\nThe Housing Market\n\nOne key area of the economy warrants more  exploration. This audience knows all too well the unique situation that’s  playing out in the housing market right now. While restrictive monetary policy  is having its usual restraining effects on housing demand, it is occurring amid  a period where structural demand for housing has been especially strong. Remote  work and other factors drove demand for housing in the aftermath of the  pandemic, which in turn has pushed up home prices to elevated levels relative  to historical norms. Even so, we’re not seeing the types of risks in housing  finance that we saw during the housing boom before the 2007-2008 financial  crisis.\n\nThe strong structural housing demand  also has had significant effects on rents, raising broad measures of rent  inflation considerably in the aftermath of the pandemic. The restraining  effects of restrictive monetary policy have begun to show in more moderate  increases in these broad measures. Moreover, data on new rents suggest that rent  inflation should moderate further in the coming months toward pre-pandemic  norms.\n\nWhile the residential housing market  overall has remained strong, commercial real estate presents greater  uncertainty and concern. The underlying value of many office buildings has  become less clear, and I anticipate a bumpy process as buildings and  investments come to market. In my view, this is not an immediate risk, but the  situation will take time to resolve.\n\nMonetary Policy and the Economic Outlook\n\nSo, the economy is strong, imbalances  are diminishing, and inflation has come down but remains above our 2 percent  longer-run target. What does that mean for monetary policy?\n\nOver  the past two years, the FOMC has put in place a restrictive stance of monetary  policy with the aim of bringing inflation back to 2 percent on a sustained  basis. Given the progress we have seen, the risks to achieving our maximum  employment and price stability goals are moving into better balance.\n\nAt its March meeting, the FOMC kept the target range for the  federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In announcing that  decision, the Committee said it “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target  range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving  sustainably toward 2 percent.” 3 The economic projections we issued  at that time indicate that if the economy proceeds as expected, it will make  sense to dial back the policy restraint gradually over time, starting this  year. 4\n\nTaking into  account the effects of restrictive monetary policy, I expect GDP growth to be about  2 percent this year, reflecting the continued resilience of the economy and  further improvements on the supply side. I expect the unemployment rate to peak  at 4 percent this year and move gradually down to its longer-run level of 3-3/4  percent thereafter. I expect inflation to continue its  gradual return to 2 percent, although there will likely be bumps along the way,  as we’ve seen in some recent inflation readings. I expect overall PCE inflation to be  2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent this year, before moving closer to 2 percent next year.\n\nAs has been  the case since the onset of the pandemic,  the outlook ahead is uncertain, and we will need to remain data-dependent.\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet\n\nI’ll now spend just a moment mentioning  the Fed’s balance sheet.\n\nIn May of 2022, the FOMC laid out its plan  for reducing the size of the balance sheet. 5 The execution of that plan is proceeding as we had envisioned, with securities holdings  decreasing and take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase facility declining. Federal  Reserve staff continue to monitor several indicators of abundance of reserves,  and they all signal that the current level of reserves remains safely far above  the level consistent with the FOMC’s ample reserves regime. 6 We’ve so far reduced the size of our balance sheet by about $1.5 trillion. The  next step in the execution of the plan will be to slow the pace of decline in  our securities holdings.\n\nWhile the Committee made no decision at  our recent meeting, most FOMC participants said it would be appropriate to slow  the pace of runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously  discussed. 7 The decision to slow the pace is in no way indicating an imminent cessation of  shrinking the balance sheet. Rather, by slowing the pace, we’re better able to  monitor conditions and facilitate a smooth transition to ample reserves.\n\nClosing\n\nI’ll close by saying that price  stability is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity stands. The economy  has come a long way toward achieving better balance and reaching our 2 percent  inflation goal. But we have not seen the total alignment of our dual mandate quite  yet. I am committed to achieving maximum employment and price stability over  the long term.\n\nTherefore, I will remain focused on the  data, the economic outlook, and the risks as we evaluate the appropriate path  for monetary policy to best achieve our goals.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Good  morning. Over the past four months we have experienced a series of  unprecedented events. The pandemic, social distancing, and the economic fallout  have transformed all of our lives. This summer, many Americans will be grieving  the loss of loved ones, and many more will be faced with financial hardship and  concern about the uncertainty of the future.\n\nThe  pandemic has caused a deep recession and levels of unemployment we've not  experienced in our lifetimes. At the Federal Reserve, we are working tirelessly  to address the economic damage caused by the coronavirus and to put the economy  back on a path toward achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment  and price stability.\n\nIn the  first half of March, as the pandemic began to unfold in the U.S., the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds rate effectively to  zero. Bringing the policy rate down to this low level reduced interest rates  across the economy, making it easier for households and businesses to meet  their borrowing needs and fostering favorable financial conditions.\n\nBeyond  these monetary policy actions, we have taken many additional measures to promote  the stability of the financial system and to support the flow of credit. Today,  I'm going to focus my remarks on these measures and detail their significance  for supporting the economy.\n\nBut  before I continue, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express  are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Lesson from History\n\nEnsuring  liquid and smoothly functioning financial markets are essential roles of  central banks, like the Federal Reserve. Yet, it's often poorly understood why these  roles are so important for the health of the broader economy.\n\nIt  was the financial crisis that erupted in 1907 that led to the creation of the  Federal Reserve System, and as we've planned and executed our response to the  current crisis, it's this history lesson I keep returning to.\n\nA  number of shocks, beginning with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, led to a  run on the banks in 1907. The run on the banks was stemmed by emergency loans  from a consortium of private banks, called the New York Clearing House. But a  run on less regulated trusts, the \"shadow banks\" of that time, could not be  similarly curtailed. 1\n\nJ.P.  Morgan brought together a group of young bankers, including Benjamin Strong,  who would go on to become the first head of the New York Fed, to examine the  books of the trusts. They made loans to the trusts they judged solvent, but the  Knickerbocker Trust, the second-largest in the country, did not make the cut,  and its collapse precipitated panic throughout financial markets. To stem that  panic, Morgan and his banking colleagues lent more generously to the surviving  trusts.\n\nThe consequence  of these events was a severe recession, and the U.S. economy contracted more  than 10 percent. As a result of the financial sector's inability to contain  recurring financial panics, Congress realized the need for the public sector to  step in, a process that led in 1913 to the creation of the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nAn Unprecedented Challenge\n\nReturning  to more recent events, as the pandemic began to unfold in the U.S., we saw intense  strain and disruption to financial markets. In response, the Federal Reserve  has taken a set of strong and decisive actions to supply liquidity and to assure  the continued flow of credit in the economy. 2\n\nThe  unique nature of this recession—a global pandemic—has required us to design an  innovative response. Some of our actions have the hallmarks of those taken during  the 2008 financial crisis, but many more have required a fresh approach.\n\nAs  uncertainty about the coronavirus took hold, we saw disruptions in short-term  funding markets. Markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed  securities, which are normally highly liquid and form the bedrock of our  financial system, nearly buckled under the strain of massive flows of funds in  response to the pandemic. 3\n\nIt's  easy to think of financial markets as somewhat divorced from the real  economy—most people will never need to worry about a spike in the repo rate or  liquidity in the Treasury market. But the reality is that like the events of  1907—and more recently 2008—turmoil in financial markets can have a devastating  impact on the wider economy. If credit isn't flowing, people can't finance the  purchase of a home, businesses can't invest, and nonprofit organizations and  municipalities can't keep essential services going.\n\nThis  is why safeguarding the functioning of financial markets is essential for the health  of the broader economy.\n\nIn  response to the extraordinary volatility caused by the pandemic, the Fed greatly  expanded its repo operations and began purchasing sizable quantities of U.S.  Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThese  actions to provide massive liquidity have proven successful. They restored  market functioning and averted what could have been a much more severe pullback  from markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses. 4\n\nDeploying Our Tools\n\nIn  addition to the repo operations and asset purchases, we have established a  number of programs to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and  state and local governments. 5\n\nI  won't go into detail about all of the facilities, but I will emphasize two  important points. First, they demonstrate the Fed's strong commitment to  prevent lasting damage to the economy. Second, the scale and reach of the  response is an indication of the gravity and unique nature of the situation we  are facing.\n\nAlthough  the facilities differ in important ways, reflecting the specifics of markets  and sectors, they all share the goal of keeping credit flowing to households,  businesses small and large, and other key segments of the economy.\n\nSince  the announcements and rollouts of the various facilities, we have seen a  significant improvement in the pricing and availability of credit. 6\n\nSomewhat  paradoxically, despite the clear effect that these facilities have had on the  availability of credit, actual take-up of the facilities has been relatively  low. But this is in fact a measure of success—the existence of the facilities,  even in a backstop role, has helped boost confidence to the point where  borrowers are able to access credit from the private market at affordable  rates.\n\nIt's  worth noting that the Federal Reserve does not act alone. As my colleague Chair  Powell says, \"The Fed has lending powers, not spending powers.\" 7 Sound healthcare policy  and the ability of fiscal authorities to put cash directly in the hands of  Americans are both essential for the economy to endure this devastating  episode.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll  conclude with this: If the history of central banking teaches us one thing,  it's that \"necessity is the mother of invention.\" Severe crises demand  innovative and decisive responses, and the Federal Reserve is striving to  deliver just that.",

    "text": "Good  afternoon, everyone. When I give a closing keynote I try to bear in mind that  you’ve been listening for hours to complex and technical material. I wish I  could say that I’m here to offer some light relief, but, alas, no.\n\nThe  topic I’m going to address this afternoon is both complex and technical. It’s the recent turmoil in the repo markets and the  Fed’s actions to address it.\n\nI’m  going to start by laying out the Fed’s operating framework for carrying out  monetary policy. This will take me into aspects of the “plumbing” of the  financial system, which may seem like an esoteric topic to many, but it’s one  of critical importance, so please bear with me.\n\nI  will then go over the money market turmoil from a month ago that led the New  York Fed to conduct open market operations to stabilize short-term interest  rates. I’ll conclude by describing the path forward as laid out in the Fed  announcements this past Friday. 1\n\nBefore  I go any further, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I  express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMonetary Policy, Interest Rates, and Ample Reserves\n\nAs a  prelude, it’s worthwhile to step back and remember how this all connects to the  Fed’s overarching monetary policy goals.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve has two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price  stability. The main way we achieve these goals is by controlling the federal  funds rate, the rate at which banks lend each other money overnight in the form  of unsecured loans. This rate in turn affects overall financial conditions and  thereby the wider economy.\n\nAt  each of its meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decides on the  target range for the federal funds rate, which currently stands at 1-3/4 to 2  percent. 2\n\nBut  how does this work—that is, what keeps the federal funds rate within the target  range? The Fed has an operational framework in place designed to keep interest  rates where the FOMC wants them. We call this an “ample reserves” regime.\n\nBack  in January of this year, the FOMC communicated its intention to continue to  implement policy according to this regime. 3\n\nThe  key benefit of this approach is that it’s a simple, effective way of  controlling the federal funds rate and thereby influencing other short-term  interest rates.\n\nThe  ample reserves framework has three elements designed to maintain the federal  funds rate within the target range.\n\nThe  first, not surprisingly, is supplying an amount of reserves that banks hold at  the Federal Reserve that is “ample.” By that, we mean that the supply of  reserves is adequate to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.  Here, “efficient” means that the level of reserves is not excessive, relative  to what’s needed to be effective. And “effective” means that typical temporary movements  in the demand or supply of reserves don’t cause large changes in the federal  funds rate without active management of reserves. I’ll come back to the  challenge of knowing what constitutes “ample” later.\n\nThe  second element consists of the interest rates that the Fed itself sets and that  influence the federal funds rate. These “administered” rates, as they are  known, include the interest rate paid to banks on their reserve balances and  the overnight reverse repo rate that the Fed pays to a wider set of money  market participants on a similar, risk-free overnight investment.\n\nThese  first two elements—an ample quantity of reserves and administered interest rates—are meant to do the lion’s share of work to keep the federal funds rate  within the target range.\n\nBut  there may be relatively infrequent situations when these two elements are not  enough to keep the federal funds rate within the target range. Therefore, the  third element is the directive from the FOMC for the New York Fed’s Open Market  Trading Desk (the Desk) to conduct open market operations as needed to keep the  federal funds rate within the target range. For example, through repurchase  agreements of Treasury and agency securities, the Fed can temporarily increase  the amount of reserves in the system.\n\nTo  support the economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the FOMC  increased its long-term securities holdings dramatically. This led to a  similarly large increase in reserves, which peaked at about $2.8 trillion in  2014. Subsequently, growth in non-reserve liabilities such as currency and reductions  in the Fed’s securities holdings caused reserve levels to decline.\n\nAs  the level of reserves has come down, we stepped up our monitoring of the effect  of reserve levels on interest rates. The level of reserves consistent with  “ample” is inherently highly uncertain, so we have been actively looking for  signs that reserves might be growing scarce. Along with in-depth analysis of  conditions in money markets, we conduct surveys of banks and other outreach to  market participants to understand the factors that influence the demand for  reserves. 4\n\nTo  smooth the transition to a level of reserves consistent with the framework, the  FOMC announced a slowing of the pace of the reduction in securities holdings at  its March meeting this year and stopped it outright at the July meeting. 5\n\nBased  on a variety of metrics and information, the supply of reserves appeared ample  during the summer and into early September. The funds rate traded well within  the target range and money markets functioned well.\n\nRecent Developments in Money Markets\n\nWith  the stage set, I’ll turn to market conditions over the past month and the Fed’s  actions.\n\nConditions  in money markets became highly volatile about a month ago. Secured and  unsecured rates moved higher and became more disparate on Monday, September 16,  and this intensified the following day.\n\nWe  had expected a number of factors—including corporate tax payments and the  settlement of newly issued Treasury securities—to put some upward pressure on  short-term rates. However, the size of the reaction in repo rates, the  spillover to the federal funds market, and the emergence of strains in market  functioning were outside of recent experience.\n\nIn  response to the simultaneous increase and widening dispersion in repo rates and  the federal funds rate, on the morning of Tuesday, September 17, the Fed conducted the  first non-test repo operations in many years, followed by daily operations.  These actions had the desired effect of reducing strains in markets, narrowing  the dispersion of rates, and fostering conditions in money markets to keep the  federal funds rate within the target range. To ensure that the federal funds  rate remained within the target range going forward, we announced daily  overnight and regular term repo operations, which continue to this day. 6\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nOur  open market operations have succeeded at keeping the federal funds rate within  the target range and have stabilized conditions in short-term funding markets.\n\nAt  the same time, recent experience has provided important lessons for the  successful operation of the ample reserves framework.\n\nA  confluence of events contributed to the volatility in money markets a month  ago. But one telling observation is that when increases in the Fed’s  non-reserve liabilities caused the level of reserves to fall well below those  prevailing during summer and early September, strains in money markets emerged.  And when the prior level of reserves was quickly restored through temporary  open market operations, normal interest rates and market functioning returned.\n\nIn  light of these events, we have learned that the ample reserves framework has  worked smoothly with a level of reserves at least as large as we saw during  summer and into early September. Although temporary open market operations are  doing the trick for the time being, anticipated increases in non-reserve  liabilities would cause reserves to decline in coming months without further  actions.\n\nBased  on these considerations, last Friday the FOMC announced that the Fed will be  purchasing U.S. Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year. 7 Specifically,  the Desk announced an initial monthly pace of purchases of $60 billion. These  permanent purchases will, over time, bring the underlying level of reserves—by  which I mean absent temporary open market operations—to a level consistent with  the ample reserves framework on a sustained basis.\n\nIn  concert with these purchases, the FOMC announced that the Desk will continue  temporary overnight and term open market operations at least through January of  next year. 8 This combination of permanent Treasury bill purchases and ongoing temporary  open market operations is designed to provide effective control of the federal  funds rate over the next several months.\n\nI  should emphasize that all of these actions are aimed at the implementation of  monetary policy and do not in any way represent a change in the stance of  monetary policy. The goal is to make sure that the federal funds rate stays  within the target range set by the FOMC.\n\nAs  we move forward, we will continue to learn about demand for reserves and other  Federal Reserve liabilities and market functioning, and may adjust the  specifics of the plan as appropriate.\n\nWhat Does All of This Mean for SOFR?\n\nThat’s  a lot on monetary policy, interest rates, reserves, and repos.\n\nBut  before I close, I’d like to emphasize an important point about a particularly  important repo benchmark rate, and that’s the Secured Overnight Financing Rate,  or SOFR. SOFR is the reference rate that the Alternative Reference Rates  Committee (ARRC) has selected as the preferred replacement for LIBOR.\n\nAt  the same time that we saw turmoil in the repo market, we saw a temporary spike  in SOFR. As market participants make preparations to transition away from  LIBOR, they’re understandably watching SOFR very closely.\n\nThere  are a few things I’d like to highlight with respect to SOFR. First, a temporary  spike is not surprising, given that SOFR reflects rates on real-world  transactions. Second, the very fact that we saw a spike in SOFR is an  indication of how representative of its underlying market it is. It’s based on  actual transactions, rather than judgment (like LIBOR), which is part of what makes  SOFR so robust. Third and final, is that in the vast majority of use cases, the  relevant metric for SOFR is an average over time. Focusing on overnight SOFR  isn’t particularly useful in this context, as financial contracts will  generally refer to an average of SOFR over many weeks or months.\n\nMy  message to you is: Don’t let last month’s temporary spike in SOFR, or hope for  the creation of some other replacement reference rate, become an excuse for  delaying your transition away from LIBOR. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it  again: like death and taxes, the end of LIBOR is unavoidable, and we must do all that it takes to prepare for a LIBOR-less future. 9 And  the existence of LIBOR is only guaranteed for another 807 days. 10\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ve  talked through a lot of important issues this afternoon, and I greatly  appreciate your attention.\n\nThe  events I’ve described are an apt reminder of the importance of well-functioning  financial markets and the vital role the Federal Reserve plays in providing  liquidity. They are also a demonstration of our ability to act swiftly and  effectively to execute our monetary policy implementation goals and keep the  federal funds rate within in the target range.\n\nThank  you.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIt’s  great to be with you here today. Queens is a special place. There are so many  features that make it unique. It’s one of the country’s most diverse areas. It’s  home to not one, but two airports. And it’s the birthplace of so many famous  actors and musicians.\n\nThat  said, getting around can be complicated. The hyphenated numbers in street  addresses. The avenues, roads, and drives that all start with the same number. The  fact that you can have a 58th Street that meets a 58th  Drive.\n\nNavigating  through Queens can be quite a journey. And as the past few years have shown, the  same can be said for the economy.\n\nTo give  you a roadmap today, I’m going to discuss the rise and fall of inflation—from  unacceptably high to within striking distance of the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run  goal—as well as the labor market’s return to balance. I’ll also talk about how monetary  policy is working to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price  stability. And I’ll provide my economic outlook.\n\nBut before  I continue the journey, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views  I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nStrong Demand, Strong  Supply\n\nIn  talking about where the economy has been and where it’s headed, it’s important  to take stock of where we are.\n\nRight  now, the economy is in a good place. The labor market is solid. Inflation is just  above our 2 percent longer-run target—although there have been a few bumps  along the way. And GDP growth continues to be strong, averaging about 3 percent  per year over the past two years.\n\nAs the  economy has returned to balance and inflation has come down, the FOMC has taken  steps to move its monetary policy stance from one that constrains demand toward  one that is more neutral. In September, the Committee lowered the target range for  the federal funds rate by half a percentage point, and last month it lowered it  by another quarter of a point. 1 , 2\n\nBut  with the strong growth that we’re seeing, I’m often asked the question: Why is  the Fed cutting interest rates at all?\n\nThe simple  answer is that while growth in demand has been strong, growth in supply has  been even stronger. Specifically, robust growth in both the labor force and in  productivity has meant that the economy can expand at a higher pace than we saw  before the pandemic, without creating inflationary pressures.\n\nImportantly,  our mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability. That means having  demand in line with supply and keeping the risks to achieving our goals in  balance.\n\nAnd now  that we’ve achieved that balance, our job now is to ensure the risks remain in balance.\n\nOn the Way to 2  Percent\n\nSo that’s  the big picture view. Before I go into more detail about monetary policy, I’m  going to delve deeper into each side of our dual mandate, starting with  inflation.\n\nThe  onset of the pandemic in 2020 dealt enormous shocks to the global economy,  resulting in extraordinary imbalances from high demand and unprecedented supply  disruptions. That, along with Russia’s war against Ukraine and other factors,  caused inflation to surge to a 40-year high of over 7 percent in June of 2022,  as measured by the 12-month percent change in the personal consumer  expenditures (PCE) price index. Inflation has now fallen to around 2-1/4  percent in the latest reading.\n\nStill, inflation  remains above our 2 percent longer-run target, and it will take some time to  achieve our inflation goal on a sustained basis.\n\nBut there  are reasons to be confident that inflation is on its way to 2 percent. To start,  it is helpful to look under the hood at various categories of goods and  services. Inflation rates for goods and services excluding food, energy, and housing  have slowed to levels that are roughly consistent with what we saw from 2002 to  2007, when core inflation was around 2 percent on average. Housing inflation,  which largely encompasses rises in rents for rental units and in implied rents  for owner-occupied homes, remains elevated compared to that time frame. But I  expect the disinflationary process to continue here, too, as lower rates of  rent increases for new leases are increasingly reflected in the official inflation  measures.\n\nRecent  analysis by researchers at the New York Fed reveals another contributing factor  to inflation’s surge and subsequent decline. 3 In 2021 and 2022,  significant, simultaneous increases in wages and material input prices created a  perfect storm in the traded goods sector. This extraordinary concurrence of  outsized increases constrained the ability of businesses to adjust their input  mix to mitigate the cost pressures they were facing. As a result, businesses  passed more of those higher costs to the prices of their products.\n\nBut this  dynamic began to subside in the middle of 2022, and it appears to be behind us  now. This finding is consistent with what I am hearing in my discussions with business  leaders in the Second District. Customers are increasingly pushing back against  additional price increases, and margins are being compressed.\n\nAnother  data point reinforcing my view that inflation is moving to 2 percent is that  survey- and market-based measures show that inflation expectations remain well  anchored. In particular, the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations shows  inflation expectations have stayed within their pre-pandemic ranges across all  horizons. 4\n\nLabor Market  Equilibrium\n\nWhile  we are making strides to bring inflation down, the other side of our dual  mandate—employment—has also come into balance.\n\nI’m  sure many of you remember that in the aftermath of the pandemic, there were far  too many job openings and not enough people to fill them. Since then, labor  supply has increased meaningfully, and demand has eased.\n\nNow, a  wide range of metrics—including measures of vacancies, quits and hires rates,  surveys of job and worker availability, and job finding and layoff rates—indicate  a cooling in the labor market from the very tight conditions we’ve seen in the  past few years. My discussions with business leaders in the region also bear  this out.\n\nIn  addition, researchers at the New York Fed have developed a measure—the  Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index—that provides a useful summary of the  overall state of the labor market. 5 This Index has declined  for 10 consecutive quarters. And it is now at the level it was in early 2017, a  time when the labor market was solid but not overheated. This decline also has  been accompanied by slowing wage growth, which is in line with the model’s  prediction. If the HPW Index remains near its current level, the growth rate of  the Employment Cost Index should come in at levels that are broadly consistent  with 2 percent inflation.\n\nTo cut  to the chase, the labor market is unlikely to be a source of inflationary  pressures going forward.\n\nShifting to Neutral\n\nWhat  does this all mean for monetary policy?\n\nThe  target range for the federal funds rate currently stands at 4-1/2 to 4-3/4  percent. Monetary policy remains in restrictive territory to support the  sustainable return of inflation to our 2 percent goal. I expect it will be  appropriate to continue to move to a more neutral policy setting over time.\n\nThe  path for policy will depend on the data. If we’ve learned anything over the  past five years, it’s that the outlook remains highly uncertain. Our decisions on  future policy actions will continue to be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis. And  they will be based on the totality of the data, the evolution of the economic  outlook, and the risks to achieving our dual mandate goals.\n\nFrom  what we know today, I expect real GDP growth to come in at about 2-1/2 percent  for this year—or maybe a bit higher—reflecting solid supply-side growth. I  anticipate the unemployment rate will run between 4 and 4-1/4 percent over  coming months. And I expect inflation to be around 2-1/4 percent for the year  as a whole. Looking ahead, I expect inflation to gradually come down to our 2  percent objective, although progress may be uneven at times.\n\nThe Journey Continues\n\nThe  word I’ve been using lately to describe the state of the economy is equipoise,  which is a fancy way of saying equilibrium. And the journey to equipoise has  been extraordinary.\n\nInflation  that was once unacceptably high is now close to our 2 percent longer-run goal,  and a labor market that was once exceptionally tight is now in balance. Our aim  is to ensure that inflation continues its march toward 2 percent while sustaining  the strength of the economy and labor market.\n\nWe’ve  come a long way, and we’re committed to getting the job done.",

    "text": "Thank you and good  afternoon.  It’s truly a pleasure to  speak at this workshop on monetary policy implementation co-organized by  Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.  This is my  first speech on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy since my  journey from the West Coast to the East Coast—and it’s great to be here,  especially now that summer is coming to an end and before winter hits!  This workshop covers important and timely  issues—including reserve reductions, money markets, and future frameworks.  And, it represents a continuation of the  Fed’s tradition of robust dialogue with the financial and academic communities  as we seek to gain a better understanding of the impact of our policy decisions  amid changing financial market conditions and structures.\n\nIn my remarks  today, I will focus on monetary policy, highlighting the evolution of Federal  Reserve policy actions and communications as we’ve exited from the  extraordinary stimulus that followed the crisis and recession.  The good news is that 10 years after the  crisis, the U.S. economy is doing very well overall.  From the perspective of the Fed’s dual mandate  of maximum employment and price stability, quite honestly, this is about as good  as it gets.  As a result, the Fed has  naturally been moving toward more “normal” monetary policy.\n\nAnd that brings me  to a key theme of my remarks today:  What  does “normal” monetary policy look like?   Before I go any further, I should note that what I have to say  represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nStrong,  Strong, Strong\n\nMy take on the  economy is well summarized by the most recent FOMC statement, in which we used variations  on the word “strong” five times in only four short paragraphs.  The statement references “strong” labor  market conditions, “strong” job gains, and a “strong” rate of growth in  economic activity, household spending and business fixed investment. 1 Although this may suggest that we really need  to consult a thesaurus, at least we can’t be accused of ambiguity.\n\nThe Fed has attained  its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability about as  well as it ever has, with most indicators pointing to a very strong labor  market indeed—including an unemployment rate below 4 percent—and an inflation rate  very near our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nWith fiscal  stimulus and favorable financial conditions providing tailwinds to the economy,  the outlook is for more of the same.  Let  me put some hard numbers to that:  I  expect real GDP to increase by 3 percent this year and by 2.5 percent in  2019.  This above-trend pace of growth  should lead to continued solid job gains and further declines in  unemployment.  I expect the unemployment  rate to fall slightly below 3.5 percent next year, the lowest level in nearly 50  years.\n\nIn keeping with  the strong economy, I expect price inflation to edge up a bit above 2 percent,  but don’t see any signs of greater inflationary pressures on the horizon.  And, I continue to expect that further  gradual increases in interest rates will best foster a sustained economic  expansion and achievement of our dual mandate goals.\n\nI should hasten to  add that not everyone has shared equally in this otherwise strong economy.  The unevenness of the recovery is evident in  my travels around the Second District, where, for example, the economic recovery  in upstate New York continues to lag the nation as a whole.  So, while the national economy is in good  shape, longer-run economic challenges have meant that not all Americans have benefited  from the improvement in the economy.  Beyond  supporting a strong overall economy, monetary policy has limited reach into  these issues, which are best addressed through other means, such as investments  in education, workforce development, and economic development.\n\nThree  Stages of Monetary Policy Normalization\n\nIn thinking about  the outlook for monetary policy, it’s useful to remember how we got to where we  are today.  The financial crisis and the  Great Recession led the FOMC to lower the federal funds rate target to near  zero and to keep it there for seven years.   This lengthy spell at zero reflected the long shadow of the  crisis—evident in the subsequent subdued growth rate and inflation rate—and the  need for the economy to convalesce after enormous trauma.  With the unemployment rate still very high  and inflation low, the Federal Reserve embarked on a long journey through terra incognita of unconventional  monetary policy actions, including large-scale asset purchases and forward  guidance on the future path of interest rates.   We weren’t alone:  Indeed, some central  banks across the globe went even further down the road of unconventional  policies.\n\nIn part due to the  Fed’s actions, the U.S. economy gradually recovered, and as a result the FOMC has  been slowly but surely moving monetary policy “back to normal.”  This process can be thought of in three  stages.\n\nStage  1: Lift-off\n\nThe first stage in  policy normalization focused on the lift-off of the federal funds rate target from  near zero, which occurred in December 2015.  But, well before that happened, the FOMC went to  great effort to communicate its thinking to the public to better prepare it for  the upcoming change in policy. 2 Importantly, we also made extensive  preparations to ensure that we were ready and able to raise rates as needed, in the context of a very large Fed  balance sheet and bank reserves.  And,  consistent with the Fed’s aim to be as transparent as possible, we published our  plans on how we would use interest rates paid on bank reserves and overnight  reverse repurchase agreements to keep the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s  target range. 3\n\nAt the time—in  light of the shallow recovery and low inflation—the FOMC was very focused on  balancing the risk of a premature removal of accommodation against concerns  that excesses could eventually develop in the economy.  In the end, lift-off went without a hitch.  The approach developed back then has served  us extremely well in controlling the federal funds rate, and has proven to be  flexible as market conditions have evolved.   I will come back to this point later.\n\nStage  2: Normalization\n\nThe second stage  of normalization followed lift-off and has involved two processes:  1) raising the federal funds target closer to  more normal levels, reflecting the ongoing improvement in the economy, and 2) gradually  reducing the Fed’s balance sheet as we work to unwind the asset purchase  policies put in place during the crisis.\n\nLet’s start with  interest rate normalization. Since lift-off, we’ve raised interest rates as the  economy moved toward maximum employment and our 2 percent longer-run inflation  objective.  We continued this process  with our most recent rate increase this week. 4 Throughout, we’ve repeatedly stressed that we  foresaw this to be a process of gradual normalization, reflecting the balancing  of risks to reaching our goals.  In  particular, downside risks to the achievement of our employment and inflation  goals amid very low interest rates were compelling arguments for a cautious and  relatively predictable approach to policy.  This approach proved its worth:  The economy continued to expand at a healthy  pace even as the Fed raised rates numerous times.\n\nI’ll now turn  briefly to the normalization of the balance sheet.  We began this process about a year ago.  In the now-standard Fed practice of  communicate, communicate, and communicate, we published detailed plans well in  advance on how we would gradually and predictably reduce the balance sheet. 5 As with lift-off, this process has proceeded  smoothly without market disruption or volatility—and that’s the way we like it. 6\n\nStage  3: “Normal”\n\nThis brings me to  the third stage, that of “normal” monetary policy.  As interest rates have moved well away from  zero and the balance sheet has started shrinking, a natural question arises:  What does normal monetary policy look like?  As before, I’ll start with interest rate  policy and finish with the balance sheet.\n\nFor those who  follow the Fed closely, you’ve noticed that the FOMC has been slimming down its  statements of late and using less forward guidance about the future path of policy.   In this vein, the FOMC this week removed  language from its statement indicating that monetary policy remains  accommodative. 7 Let me make clear, these more concise  statements do not signify a shift in  our monetary policy approach.  Instead, they  represent the natural evolution of the language describing the factors  influencing our policy decisions in the context of the strength of the economic  outlook and inflation being near our 2 percent longer-run goal.  These changes in how we communicate our policy  views are a sign that we are nearing the end of the second stage of the normalization  process, and are inching closer to conducting normal monetary policy.\n\nArguably, it’s  been a long time since monetary policy was “normal,” so it’s worth describing  what normal looks like in some detail.  At  its most basic level, policy-making will remain the same:  The path of interest rates will continue to be  guided strategically by our dual mandate objectives and shaped tactically by  the data and their implications for the economic outlook.  We’ll continue to be transparent about our  thinking about the economy and monetary policy.\n\nBut, changing  circumstances call for some changes in how the FOMC communicates its policy  views. Now that interest rates are well away from zero and the economy is humming  along, the case for strong forward guidance about future policy actions is becoming  less compelling.  For one, the future  direction of policy will no longer be as clear as it was during the past few  years.  When interest rates were  extremely low, it was obvious that the direction for rates was upward, toward  more normal levels, and our forward guidance reinforced that point.  At some point in the future, it will no longer  be clear whether interest rates need to go up or down, and explicit forward  guidance about the future path of policy will no longer be appropriate.\n\nIn addition, as we  have moved far away from near-zero interest rates, it makes sense to shift away  from a focus on normalizing the stance of monetary policy relative to some benchmark  “neutral” interest rate, often referred to as “r-star.”  Now, I have spent a good deal of my career  studying r-star and I find it to be a useful concept for describing the  economy’s longer-run behavior.\n\nHaving said that, at  times r-star has actually gotten too much attention in commentary about Fed  policy.  Back when interest rates were  well below neutral, r-star appropriately acted as a pole star for navigation.  But, as we have gotten closer to the range of  estimates of neutral, what appeared to be a bright point of light is really a  fuzzy blur, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in measuring r-star. 8 More than that, r-star is just one factor affecting  our decisions, alongside economic and labor market indicators, wage and price  inflation, global developments, financial conditions, the risks to the outlook…  I think you get the point.\n\nReturning to the  balance sheet, the question of what exactly the new normal looks like is still  being analyzed and discussed at the Fed.   We have indicated that we plan to shrink the balance sheet to the  smallest size consistent with the efficient and effective conduct of monetary  policy, and that, in the long run, the asset side of the balance sheet will  consist primarily of Treasury securities. 9 That’s our strategy, but its execution will  depend on the operating framework of monetary policy, among other factors.\n\nHere, the Fed basically  has two choices.  We could return to a  system similar in spirit to that used before the financial crisis, in which the  supply of reserves in the banking system was kept relatively scarce, and the interest  rate was set by adjusting reserves on a frequent basis through open market  operations.  Alternatively, we could  continue with the system that we’ve been using since the crisis, in which bank reserves  are abundant and the federal funds rate target is achieved through adjustments  to administered rates.  As I said, this  approach is working very well at controlling interest rates and has proven to  be easy to communicate and adaptable. 10 The Fed will be looking closely at these  options in the coming months and will subsequently make a decision on the future  operating framework. And, as is our standard practice, we will be sure to  communicate our thinking and decisions on this issue as soon and as thoroughly  as practicable.\n\nConclusion\n\nMonetary  policy-making has perhaps never been more challenging than it was following the  financial crisis.  But, as we move toward  more “normal” conduct of monetary policy, we shouldn’t rest easy and think we  won’t confront our own fair share of future challenges.  The most important one in front of us today is  sustaining the long economic expansion without allowing risks to grow that  ultimately undermine economic prosperity.   Whatever the future may bring, I will be guided by our dual mandate, a  heavy dependence on data, and a steadfast commitment to transparency.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Good  afternoon, and welcome everyone. I'm John Williams, president and CEO of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nI'm  here to kick off what is now the eighth installment of a landmark series on the  topic of Racism and the Economy sponsored by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. These  events examine structural racism's toll on the economy and identify potential actions  that can improve economic outcomes for all segments of society.\n\nThere  is no facet of our society immune to racism, health included. So, this  afternoon, we will be looking at key issues around race and the economy through  the lens of health—a focus never more urgent and critical.\n\nBefore  we move on with the program, I'd like to share more broadly why this is so  important for the Federal Reserve, what we're learning, and what we're doing. And  with that, I must give the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee  or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHaving poor health is a challenge on many levels. We're  keenly aware that health can be a huge driver of economic inequality. People  who lack good health or healthcare often struggle to participate fully in the economy. On top of that, social determinants  of health—economic stability, housing, and education—can be barriers to  employment and affect the kinds of jobs people get.\n\nOf  course, we at the Federal Reserve are neither healthcare workers nor healthcare  policymakers. But a major part of our core mission is to foster a strong  economy and promote maximum employment. And to put it simply, we need healthy  people to have a healthy economy and workforce. That's why understanding the nexus  of race, health, and the economy is central to achieving our goals. We are  deeply committed to doing so, both in this series and beyond.\n\nThe  pandemic demonstrated just how acute many of the connections are between  physical and economic health for individuals and communities. And it exposed just  how dramatic racial disparities can be, especially in accessing healthcare and  other critical resources.\n\nThe  convergence of a health crisis, business closures, and job losses created tremendous  hardships for many Americans, and was especially devastating for communities of  color. We know that people of color, and Black people in particular, experienced  higher rates of illness and death. 1 Significant representation  in essential services work—jobs that required close contact with others—contributed  in part to these tragic outcomes. 2\n\nOver  the past 18 months, we learned how these issues played out for families through  regular conversations with community leaders in our district and beyond. Separately,  our research shone a spotlight on many of these painful realities. For example,  a team of New York Fed economists published a series earlier this year aimed at  understanding the gap in COVID-19 intensity by race and by income. 3 And last month, they  shared their findings around racial differences in ICU stress during the third  wave of COVID-19. 4\n\nThere's  no single or simple solution that can fully address these problems. But, as a  nation we can build a stronger foundation so that everyone can fulfill their  economic potential, thus better enabling the Federal Reserve to fulfill its  mandate.\n\nThat's why at the New York Fed—and  across the Federal Reserve System—a key area of focus is to better understand economic  drivers of health and wellbeing, and to champion promising solutions.\n\nWe are able to do this in large part  through our Community Development efforts to better understand the needs and  issues of low- and moderate-income communities throughout our District. Our Community  Development team recently  adopted a new strategy to concentrate on three key areas: health, household  income, and climate. 5 Our aim is to connect people, programs, and  proposals—especially those focused on fostering racial equity—with the funding needed  to promote equitable growth and tackle economic inequality.\n\nWe are already  doing important work in this space and there is so much planned for the future.\n\nA few months  ago, we  brought together mental health and policy experts to  examine  the  pandemic's impact on mental health in communities of color, including the  correlation between depression, anxiety, and economic factors such as lost  income. 6\n\nAnd  next week, we'll be hosting an event in collaboration with New York University's  Rory Meyers College of Nursing, the New York City Department of Health and  Mental Hygiene, the Low Income  Investment Fund, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to discuss the need for investments in maternal and child health. 7 Our  goal for convening this coalition of thought and civic leaders is to find  innovative ways to ensure that all mothers across the city have the care they need  to fully participate in the economy and that their children are positioned for  a healthy start.\n\nToday  you'll hear from an exceptional lineup of panelists: leaders in the medical,  academic, and policy worlds. We'll close with a panel of my colleagues, fellow  Reserve Bank presidents, who will share their reflections on what we've learned  and discussed today.\n\nSo,  with that, I'll hand it over to Marielle Segarra of Marketplace who will moderate  the next part of the program. Thank you all again for joining today's event.",

    "text": "Good  morning, everyone. I’d like to begin by welcoming you to the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York and to the fifth conference on culture in financial services  that we’ve hosted.\n\nBefore  I launch into my remarks, it’s time I remind everyone that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhen  I took on the role as President of the New York Fed last year it so happened  that my first day coincided with this conference. In my remarks that day, I  emphasized that culture is a long-term project, a constantly evolving one,  which is never done.\n\nThe  trouble with long-term projects with no distinct finish line is that they can  lack a sense of urgency. The pressure to make real progress is often missing,  especially when there are so many other priorities competing for our time.\n\nHeadlines  in the financial news illustrate the lack of progress. In the year since our  last conference, stories of money laundering and fraud have been an all-too-frequent  feature. Culture is at the heart of many of these issues, and addressing the  root causes of misconduct must remain a high priority for the industry and  regulators.\n\nThe Supervisory Approach\n\nGiven  this imperative for change, the question is, what can we do to improve culture  in financial services?\n\nCulture  is like many of the risk management issues challenging businesses. Cyber  threats, digital transformation, and climate change are all facts of life that  companies face today, and will be facing 10 years from now.\n\nBut  I don’t hear any CEOs saying that securing their servers is a project that can  wait until 2029. Nor does anyone think that there are “once and done” fixes for  these problems. Indeed, one important lesson from cybersecurity is that this is  not purely a technology problem, but one that requires a fundamental shift in  mindset and culture over the long term.\n\nSo  the first thing is the industry, the regulatory agencies, and the banks need to  take culture seriously, now.\n\nA  major and essential part of this is that there must be meaningful consequences  for firms and people when things go wrong. We have learned that simply levying  large fines on companies is not enough to create lasting change. More is  needed.\n\nRegulators  must hold management and boards of directors to account. The legal element of  supervision will always remain paramount. And a scandal often spurs change. But  if leaders wait until things have gone wrong to think about culture, they’re  leaving it too late.\n\nWhat Do We Do to Get to a “Good” Culture?\n\nThe  second thing is we need to understand what contributes to a good culture, and  what allows a bad one to flourish. What fosters an organizational culture where  people feel empowered to speak up? And what leads to a work environment where  employees feel emboldened to commit fraud?\n\nThat’s  one of the things I’m most looking forward to in today’s conference. I can’t  wait to hear the insights from such a variety of voices. Looking beyond our own  narrow frame of reference to other fields of study, like organizational  psychology, will help us understand how to achieve the progress that’s so  desperately needed.\n\nBehavioral  science really gets to the root of how human nature interacts with an  organization’s processes. Everything from how we set goals to how we motivate  our staff to achieve those goals has an effect on culture, for better or for  worse.\n\nThis  is where the rubber hits the road for most organizations, in the financial  services industry, and beyond.\n\nWe’re  also going to hear from experts on the role technology plays, including the  ethics of data handling, and what artificial intelligence means for  relationships with customers.\n\nAnd  I’m particularly looking forward to hearing about how diversity, something  that’s a strategic priority for me and this Bank, affects cultural norms. This  includes diversity not only in terms of race and gender, but diversity of  thought and experience, which also affects an organization’s culture and  decision-making.\n\nAs  an academic at heart, I have a self-confessed bias toward research. But in this  case, there’s real value in understanding the full breadth and depth of these  issues.\n\nOne  of the most important reasons is that we can debunk some of the myths that have  acted as a security blanket to the industry. Too often, when things go wrong,  business leaders blame a single “bad apple” as the cause of the problem.\n\nBut  focusing on an individual bad actor can obscure a culture in which people feel that  misconduct in the pursuit of profit is tolerated, or even condoned. The “bad  apple” theory acts as an excuse for not doing the hard work of cultural reform.  In this process of blaming bad apples, leaders fail to look at what’s happening  to the rest of the barrel. What kind of environment has let the rot set in?\n\nUnderstanding  the full complexity of what forms a culture is important, but our unique  position within the financial system means the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  must do more.\n\nOur Role in Achieving Progress\n\nThree  principles—“connect,” “convene,” and “catalyze”—guide my thinking in this area.\n\nConnecting  people with the latest data and research—and sharing experiences—gives them the  insights and tools they need to make change. Conferences like this one are  critical—as is our online research hub, which acts as a clearing house for the  latest information and initiatives from a wide range of organizations.\n\nBut,  that’s not enough. In this regard, we recently announced the Education and Industry  Forum on Financial Services Culture to support these efforts.\n\nThe  Forum, which kicked off in April, brings together business schools and industry  representatives. Participants will research and design case studies for  business school students. This will mean that students planning to enter the  industry will have the tools to handle the ethical challenges that can arise in  real-life work situations.\n\n“Convene”  means bringing together stakeholders to share best practices. And that’s where  our Supervisors Roundtable comes in. The Roundtable brings together supervisors  from around the world to share their jurisdictions’ approach and what they’ve  learned from it. Participants have developed a shared set of tools for  supervisors that can be leveraged in cultural assessments.\n\nFinally,  let me turn to this principle of “catalyze,” and how we can use our position in  the heart of the Financial District, to create change.\n\nAs  well as talking the talk—we’re walking the walk. This year, for the first time,  this Bank is taking the Banking Standards Board (BSB) Assessment.\n\nThe  BSB Assessment measures the extent to which nine characteristics are  demonstrated by an organization, and it includes things like honesty,  accountability, and respect. The assessment started in the UK, and the Irish  Banking Culture Board now takes a similar approach.\n\nI  would love to see firms in the United States adopt an industrywide survey that  can measure culture and benchmark banks against their peers. Data gathering is  the first step of understanding the nature of organizational culture.\n\nThese  three concepts—“connect,” “convene,” and “catalyze”—will continue to be our  guiding principles on the issue of culture as we build on our current work and  explore new initiatives.\n\nLike  addressing cyber risks and climate change, the journey toward reforming culture  in the banking and financial services industry is a long one. And there’s no  single action that a regulator or a bank can take to make it happen. Getting it  right is going to require the will and expertise of regulators, financial  services firms, academics, and practitioners. And while changing organizational  culture is a long-term, complex, and challenging task, I’m optimistic that we  can and we will make progress. And the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is  committed to being a partner on that journey.\n\nThank  you.",

    "text": "Good afternoon, and thank you,  Governor Yaron, for that kind introduction. It’s truly a pleasure to speak at  this conference.\n\nSo much has happened in the world  and in monetary policy in the year and a half since the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic. However, I will not use my time today to discuss the specific  challenges posed by the pandemic. Rather, I will return to a topic that  predates COVID-19 and will be critically important for central banks in the post-pandemic  era: How inflation targeting should evolve to be successful in the context of a  global economy characterized by very low neutral interest rates.\n\nI  will start by describing the challenges that the combination of the very low  level of real neutral interest rates and the lower bound on nominal interest  rates pose for standard versions of inflation targeting. I will then summarize the theoretical underpinnings of what  is commonly referred to as Average Inflation Targeting, or AIT for short. I  will focus on the key characteristics of various versions of AIT and how they  can help mitigate the deleterious effects of the lower bound on interest rates  on macroeconomic outcomes. I should be clear from the start that the goal of my  presentation is to engage in the broad academic and central bank discussion on  monetary policy strategies, and that this is not, and should not be interpreted  as, a description of the Federal Reserve’s new policy framework or the  practical application of AIT to real-world situations. I would also be remiss  not to mention that most of what I discuss today is based on research conducted  with my esteemed colleague Thomas Mertens at the Federal Reserve Bank of San  Francisco.\n\nWith that preamble, it is time to  give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else  in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Is Past Is Prologue: The Decline in R-star\n\nThe adoption of inflation targeting  by many central banks succeeded in bringing the high and variable inflation  rates of the 1970s and 1980s under control and anchoring inflation  expectations. The success in attaining price stability and well-anchored inflation  expectations was a monumental achievement in central banking and one that is  critically important to sustain.\n\nHowever, the significant decline in  the neutral rate of interest observed across the globe poses a fundamental  challenge to the ability of inflation-targeting central banks to achieve desired  macroeconomic objectives and anchor inflation expectations at the targeted  level. Figure 1 shows the GDP-weighted average of the Holston, Laubach, and  Williams (2017) estimates of the longer-term real neutral interest rates, or  r-star, for Canada, the euro area, the United Kingdom, and the United States  through the second quarter of 2020. As seen in the figure, and consistent with  a variety of other analyses, there has been a dramatic decline in r-star over  the past quarter century. Several global developments have driven this decline—including  demographic shifts, lower productivity growth, and increased demand for safe  assets—and these trends do not appear likely to reverse anytime soon. 1\n\nDue in part to the decline in  neutral interest rates, central banks have been increasingly constrained by the  lower bound on nominal interest rates, including after the outbreak of COVID-19.  The lower bound on interest rates has hindered their ability to use lower  short-term interest rates to offset negative shocks, contributing to inflation rates  averaging below targeted levels in many countries.\n\nA Simple Model of Monetary Policy with a Lower Bound on  Interest Rates\n\nTo highlight the connections between  r-star, the lower bound on interest rates, and below-target inflation, Thomas Mertens  and I analyze a simple New Keynesian model where the lower bound occasionally  constrains the ability of the central bank to offset negative shocks to the  economy. 2 Our analysis shows that due to the presence of the lower bound on interest  rates, standard inflation targeting under discretion leads to inflation that is,  on average, below the target level. This below-target average inflation, in  turn, causes expected inflation to be below the target level, to the detriment  of the achievement of macroeconomic goals.\n\nTo keep the analysis tractable, the inflation-targeting central bank is assumed to follow optimal policy under discretion using the short-term interest rate as its sole policy instrument; that is, we ignore other policy tools like asset purchases that can provide additional monetary stimulus following negative shocks and thereby reduce the severity of the effects of the lower bound on the economy. 3 Absent the lower bound on interest rates, optimal policy would fully offset  demand shocks and partially offset supply shocks. This results in inflation and  inflation expectations that are at the target level on average.\n\nThis happy set of circumstances is  upset by the lower bound on interest rates occasionally constraining the  ability of policy to respond to negative shocks to the economy. Owing to the  inherent asymmetry of the lower bound, monetary policy responds more strongly  on average to positive shocks than to negative ones. From there, it’s a simple  matter of arithmetic: shortfalls of inflation from targeted levels will on  average be larger than overshoots, and, as a consequence, the average inflation  rate will be below targeted levels. 4 With inflation averaging below the target level, inflation expectations will also  be anchored below target. The reduction in inflation expectations, in turn,  exacerbates the effects of the lower bound on the economy. These results hold  whether the central bank targets only the inflation rate or has dual objectives  related to inflation and output.\n\nIn our current research, Thomas  Mertens and I have extended this analysis to a two-country model and examined  the spillovers from the lower bound across borders. The basic conclusion from this  work is that the presence of the lower bound adds to the ways by which economic  conditions spill over across economies that can exacerbate the deleterious  effects of the lower bound in each country. The implication is that the greater  the effects of the lower bound are on the economy of a trading partner, the  greater the challenge for the domestic central bank in achieving its macroeconomic  goals.\n\nAverage Inflation Targeting\n\nA number of modifications to standard  inflation targeting have been proposed to address the effects of the lower  bound on interest rates. 5 Although each proposal has unique features and implications, many can be  broadly described under the big tent of “Average Inflation Targeting” in that they  aim to “overshoot” the long-run inflation target at times so that the inflation  rate is close, or equal, to the targeted level on average. 6\n\nOne relatively modest modification  to standard textbook inflation targeting is what we call Static Average Inflation  Targeting, or SAIT. The SAIT policy is identical to standard inflation  targeting except that it overcomes the downward bias to average inflation  caused by the lower bound by overshooting the inflation target in periods when  the lower bound does not constrain policy. 7 This is equivalent to reducing the intercept in the monetary policy rule by an  appropriate amount, which depends on the probability of being at the lower  bound and other parameters. 8\n\nFigure 2 shows the model responses  of inflation, the output gap, and nominal and real interest rates to a severe  negative demand shock that lasts for one period (labeled period 0 in the  figure), under standard inflation targeting and SAIT. Note that for these  simulations, I assume the following: the long-run target level of the inflation  rate is zero, the  lower bound is -0.5 percent, and the real neutral rate is 1 percent. 9\n\nUnder standard inflation targeting, inflation  is on average below the target, as seen clearly in the levels of inflation in  periods before and after the shock. In response to the negative demand shock,  the lower bound constrains the inflation targeting policy, and the output gap  and inflation fall further below targeted levels before returning to their  corresponding mean levels in the following period.\n\nIn contrast, the SAIT policy delivers  inflation and inflation expectations that are on average equal to the targeted  level. This higher level of expected inflation boosts inflation in the period  of the negative shock and creates more room for policy to lower the real  interest rate below the neutral rate. As a result, the shortfalls in the output  gap and inflation are attenuated relative to standard inflation targeting. Note  that the effectiveness of SAIT is based solely on anchoring inflation  expectations at the target, which is achieved by delivering a longer-term mean  inflation rate equal to the target.\n\nTo better see how the SAIT policy  works, it’s also useful to look at the responses to a positive demand shock,  shown in Figure 3 . Under both standard inflation targeting and SAIT, the demand  shock is fully offset by a higher real interest rate. However, that does not  imply that the output gap equals zero. Under inflation targeting, the fact that  inflation expectations are below target causes policy to be slightly  accommodative, leading to a positive output gap and inflation that is closer to—but  still below—target. Under SAIT, policy intentionally aims for a positive output  gap and inflation rate. This is the overshooting feature of SAIT that provides  the positive offset to outcomes when policy is constrained, thereby bringing  mean inflation and the output gap equal to their respective long-run target  levels. Note that these outcomes under both inflation targeting and SAIT are  invariant to the size of the demand shock as long as policy is unconstrained by  the lower bound.\n\nA number of alternatives to AIT have  been proposed that include dependence on the past state of the economy—either  in terms of interest rates or inflation—and we refer to these as “dynamic  average inflation targeting,” or DAIT. These include policies that target a  multiyear average of inflation, target the price level, or account for past  constraints on the setting of monetary policy. Although they differ in their details,  these proposed policies fundamentally work through the same mechanism of  delivering interest rates that are “lower for longer” following a negative  shock. Under these policies, expectations of easier monetary policy in the  future provide additional policy stimulus while the lower bound constraint is  binding, thus ameliorating the negative effects of the lower bound constraint  on the economy.\n\nTo keep things simple, I will focus  on just one version of DAIT—that is, the proposed policy rule that Dave  Reifschneider and I included in our paper from over 20 years ago. 10 This policy rule is otherwise identical to inflation targeting, but makes up  for past missed monetary stimulus owing to the lower bound constraint. Specifically,  the current setting of policy is adjusted based on a term that keeps track of  the cumulative past effects of the lower bound on the setting of interest rates,  net of past “make-up” adjustments to policy. The behavior of the Reifschneider-Williams  (RW) policy rule following episodes of policy being constrained by the lower  bound is qualitatively very similar to those of policies that target a  multi-period average rate of inflation and price-level targeting. 11\n\nThe RW rule delivers inflation and  inflation expectations that are on average equal to the targeted level, as the “lower-for-longer”  setting of interest rates following periods where the lower bound constrains  policy mitigates the effects of negative shocks on the economy. Figure 4 compares the responses to a negative demand shock under the RW rule to that  under standard inflation targeting. Under the RW policy, the real interest rate  is below the neutral real interest rate in the period following the shock,  reflecting the effect of the make-up for missed monetary stimulus during the  period of the shock. As a result, the output gap and inflation rate are above  target levels in the period following the shock, and then return close to  target levels in the subsequent period. 12 This is the key feature of DAIT policies: the expectation of future stimulus  supports the economy during the time when policy is constrained by the lower  bound. Of course, for this to work in practice, expectations of future policy  actions and their economic consequences must be aligned with the policy  strategy.\n\nSo far, I have aimed to provide the  high-level theoretical underpinnings of AIT policies and their potential  advantages in an environment where the lower bound occasionally constrains  monetary policy. Commentators  have highlighted a number of potential shortcomings of AIT relative to standard  inflation targeting. I will briefly address two in the  time remaining.\n\nThe first claim is that the  overshooting of the inflation target implied by AIT risks undermining the  anchoring of inflation expectations to the upside. I would argue that, if  anything, AIT strengthens the expectations anchor compared to standard  inflation targeting. The main point of AIT is to offset the downward bias to  inflation expectations exerted by the lower bound under inflation targeting.  That said, if the lower bound were to prove to be a less frequent constraint on  policy in the future, then the AIT policies that I have described would act  very much like standard inflation targeting.\n\nThe second claim is that AIT implies  sharp reversals of interest rates as monetary policy exits a “lower for longer”  episode and may find itself “behind the curve.” However, as seen in the  responses of nominal and real interest rates to the shocks shown in Figures  2-4, there is no predictable pattern of sharp reversals or large overshooting  of policy rates relative to neutral, either for static or dynamic AIT policies. 13 It is true that nominal and real interest rates have more room to fall under  AIT policies in response to negative shocks compared to inflation targeting,  and therefore the rebound to the neutral rate is correspondingly larger. But,  that larger rebound is a feature of the success of the policy. In addition, the  RW policy is still below neutral when the output gap and inflation are above  target, so the reversal of rates is actually gradual, not rapid.\n\nOf course, the policy setting  depends on the sequence of shocks and the particular model used for the  analysis. Although the results I have reported are derived from a very simple  model, the main findings about the benefits of AIT also are obtained in much  more complex models with extensive nominal rigidities, as shown in  Reifschneider and Williams (2000).\n\nConclusion\n\nTo close, in this presentation I aimed  to provide a high-level theoretical overview of the mechanisms by which versions  of average inflation targeting can deliver improved macroeconomic outcomes in  the presence of a lower bound on interest rates.\n\nImportantly, the versions of AIT  that I described represent an evolution of inflation targeting, rather than a  revolution. Indeed, the aims are the same: to ensure well-anchored inflation  and inflation expectations at the target level.\n\nThank you.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood  afternoon, and happy new year.\n\nMonetary  policy frameworks are complex, technical, and rarely make it into the public  consciousness. But they are of vital importance to economic prosperity. And as  we stand on the brink of a new decade, it is critically important that we  understand how the frameworks central banks choose influence economic outcomes,  both today and in the future.\n\nWhen  Andy Haldane invited me to be on the panel, he posed the provocative question:  What will monetary policy frameworks look like 30 years from now?\n\nAs a  policymaker, I try to avoid making predictions for the future. But given that I  will assuredly be an ex-central banker in the year 2050, I think I’m safe to  have free rein!\n\nThat  said, I should still give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn  my remarks today, I’ll discuss how the monetary policy landscape has evolved,  and what that means for inflation targeting in 2020, 2050, and beyond.\n\nThe History of Inflation Targeting\n\nBefore  I look forward, it’s worth looking back and highlighting that it’s now 30 years  since the inception of inflation targeting.\n\nIn  1989, the central bank of the small country of New Zealand announced that the  main objective of its monetary policy was to target the inflation rate. 1 In the subsequent decades,  most central banks in major economies coalesced around this approach of aiming  for a low, publicly announced inflation rate.\n\nFor  the past three decades, this approach has been remarkably successful at keeping  inflation low and stable. 2 The inflation targets have  acted as a nominal anchor for inflation expectations, which play a big role in  determining actual inflation.\n\nFor  anyone who was trying to get a mortgage at a double-digit interest rate or seeing  prices go up and up back in the days of high inflation, it’s almost unthinkable  that in 2020 central banks are pondering the opposite challenge: how to prevent  inflation from being too low.\n\nBut  it’s the reality most policymakers face, and the one our monetary policy  frameworks will need to grapple with long into the future.\n\nThe Future of Inflation\n\nSo,  how did we arrive where we are today? Why is low inflation the current challenge,  and why will that likely persist?\n\nTo  answer these questions, we need to look at r-star, or the longer-run neutral  rate of interest.\n\nOne  estimate of r-star in the United States, from a model developed by Holston,  Laubach, and myself, is around half a percent in the United States. That’s  actually now lower than at any time before the Great Recession. 3 We’ve seen similar  declines in r-star in other advanced economies, including in Japan and the euro  area.\n\nIn  fact, the GDP-weighted average of estimates of r-star for Canada, the euro  area, the United Kingdom, and the United States is now also half a percent,  nearly 2 percentage points below where it stood at the turn of this century. 4\n\nThese  very low neutral rates are largely a result of global, longer-term structural  factors. They’re driven by demographic changes, slow productivity growth, and  demand for safe assets—all of which are unlikely to reverse any time soon. 5\n\nOne  key takeaway from these global trends is that interest rates and inflation are  going to stay lower than we’ve come to expect in the past. 6 This means that monetary  policy will likely be more frequently constrained by the lower bound, or LB for  short, creating a set of challenges for policymakers. In particular, life near  the LB means central banks have much less room to maneuver using adjustments in  short-term interest rates when faced with a downturn.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Inflation Targeting\n\nGiven  that inflation targeting was designed in a world where inflation was undesirably  high, does it still work for a world with the opposite problem?\n\nAs I  peer into the future, the question is not so much what is wrong with inflation  targeting, but rather what we need to preserve and, in fact, strengthen it. Any  evolution of the current framework should involve doubling down on fundamental  principles that have proven to be successful.\n\nWhat  do I mean by that? There are three fundamental elements of inflation targeting that  will be crucial as central banks work to prevent inflation from drifting too  low: well-anchored inflation expectations, accountability, and transparency.\n\nInflation Expectations, Accountability, and  Transparency\n\nThe  most critical element is anchoring inflation expectations at the right level.  For those of you who lived through the 1970s and 1980s, the specter of high  inflation probably still looms large. But millennials and Generation Z have  never faced the prospect of paying 15 percent on a mortgage.\n\nIt’s  often claimed that we don’t really understand what drives inflation  expectations. But, in fact, researchers have made significant progress on this  topic. Research using a number of approaches has found that the history of  inflation plays a big role in inflation expectations.\n\nNow,  this does not mean that expectations are a mechanical average of past inflation,  like in traditional versions of adaptive expectations. Instead, the key finding  of this research is that inflation expectations depend on the historical  behavior of inflation as shaped by the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nFor  example, recent work using the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations  shows a decline in longer-run inflation expectations by nearly half a  percentage point over the last six years, to about 2-1/4 percent. 7 This decline reflects both  the low CPI inflation of recent years and demographic shifts, where members of older  cohorts with high expectations (I’m afraid to say) die off.\n\nIf  inflation continues to underrun target levels similar to the past six years,  the downward trend in inflation expectations will likely continue. But there is  still time to avert this fate—in this case, it’s fortunate that the young are  impressionable. If inflation is sustained at target levels consistently, a  further downward trend in expectations can be forestalled.\n\nBut  expectations depend on deeds, not just words, which brings me to the issue of  accountability. One reason inflation targeting has been so successful at keeping  inflation low and stable is that policymakers held themselves accountable for  consistently delivering low inflation near the target.\n\nFinally,  as well as holding ourselves accountable, policymakers need to be transparent  and communicate their actions and the rationale behind them. Much has been made  about whether central banks can credibly commit to future actions and outcomes,  but the experience with inflation targeting gives me encouragement. Inflation-targeting  central banks have proved beyond a doubt that they could bring inflation down  and keep it low and stable. This was not a foregone conclusion, and initially  there were doubts about whether inflation targeting would succeed.\n\nIn  addition, forward guidance delivered in the years following the financial  crisis had a clear and direct effect on driving policy expectations and  financial conditions. Keeping inflation expectations anchored at the right  point will depend not just on policymakers holding themselves accountable for  inflation, but on their ability to clearly execute and communicate their policies.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll  finish with this. It’s risky to make predictions about the future. But in many  ways the future is already here. Low r-star and declining inflation  expectations are clear indicators of what’s to come. There’s been a great deal  of discussion about how central banks around the world, and the Federal Reserve  in particular, are going to deal with the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAs  the FOMC engages on its ongoing framework review, it is important to state  again that any changes to our monetary policy framework must and will be  carefully and thoughtfully considered. As long as we double down on the  fundamentals of inflation targeting by anchoring inflation expectations at the  target level, holding ourselves accountable to delivering on our objectives,  and being transparent about our actions, we will be well positioned to handle whatever  the future might bring.\n\nThank  you.",

    "text": "It's  great to be back in California participating once again in a Hoover Institution  monetary policy event, even if only virtually. These conferences have provided  an excellent opportunity for academic experts, policymakers, and practitioners  to share research and perspectives on critically important issues. John Taylor  is both a friend and a mentor, so it's a particular pleasure to be sharing this  online platform with him today.\n\nThis  summer, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) completed its review of the  Fed's monetary policy framework. This culminated in August with the issuance of  a new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. 1 The FOMC put this strategy  into practice in its September policy statement, explicitly tying its policy  actions and intentions to the new framework. 2\n\nThe  new policy framework represents a substantial evolution of the FOMC's thinking  and approach since the Committee published its first framework statement in  2012.\n\nToday,  I'm going to talk about what these changes mean for policy as the economy  recovers from the effects of the pandemic. But what I'm really looking forward  to is our conversation around these important issues, so I'll keep my opening remarks  brief.\n\nBefore  I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I  express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC  or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOur Dual Mandate Goals\n\nWhile  our monetary policy approach has shifted, our fundamental goals have not. The  Fed has two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. These  \"dual mandate\" goals remain on an equal footing, and our commitment to  delivering on both has not changed. In addition, our assessment that a 2  percent long-run inflation rate is most consistent with achieving both of our dual  mandate goals is unaltered.\n\nWhat  has evolved is how we think about best achieving them. Like all institutions,  the Federal Reserve must be responsive to changing circumstances and adapt to  new realities. Since 2012, we have learned a great deal about the behavior of the  economy, employment, and inflation—both in the short and longer run—and these  lessons have informed our approach to policy.\n\nThere  are three key takeaways worth highlighting: First and foremost is the secular  decline in the neutral rate of interest, or r-star, which has brought neutral  real interest rates to near zero in the United States. This decline in r-star in  turn implies that the constraint on monetary policy from the lower bound on  nominal interest rates has become a central aspect of the landscape with which  policymakers must contend.\n\nSecond,  over the past decade, inflation in the United States has been below our 2  percent longer-run target most of the time, and a number of measures of  inflation expectations have drifted down in recent years. 3\n\nIt  is important to note that these first two observations are closely connected,  as emphasized in the paper with Thomas Mertens that I presented at last year's  Hoover conference. In a world of low r-star and a lower bound on nominal  interest rates, a standard inflation targeting approach can lead to inflation  and inflation expectations that are anchored below the targeted level. 4\n\nThird,  during the long economic recovery following the 2007-09 recession, we saw the unemployment  rate reach 50-year lows without causing an undesired rise in inflation. Structural  changes in the economy—and in particular the labor market—have greatly expanded  the level of employment that can be maintained without creating inflationary  pressures. But, changes like those are hard to see in real time, making  estimates of the natural rate of unemployment or other barometers of the  economy's potential inherently uncertain and subject to change. 5\n\nEvolution in Our Thinking\n\nOne  clear lesson is the critical importance of formulating a policy approach that  effectively and consistently keeps longer-run inflation expectations anchored  at 2 percent. Perhaps the most notable change we announced to our framework was  explicitly describing success in terms of achieving inflation that averages 2  percent over time. In particular, \"following periods when inflation has been  running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely  aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\" 6\n\nA  second tangible evolution in our approach is that we made explicit that in seeking  maximum employment, we are focused on eliminating shortfalls from that goal. We  also emphasized the inclusive nature of our maximum employment goal. This means  thinking more broadly than the aggregate rate of unemployment and examining the  full range of indicators when it comes to assessing shortfalls from maximum employment.\n\nTogether,  these changes position us to deliver on our dual mandate goals in a world of  very low r-star and persistently low inflation.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Policy?\n\nMy  colleagues at the FOMC and I have talked extensively about the nature of these  changes and how we drew our conclusions. But, it's important to apply these  decisions to the current situation. The pandemic has presented us with  extraordinary and devastating economic circumstances.\n\nThe  good news is that the economy has started to recover and the unemployment rate has  come down. About half of the jobs lost during March and April have been  regained. Despite these improvements, we are nowhere near where we want to be: the  total number of nonfarm jobs is still 10.7 million below February's level, and  the unemployment rate is nearly 8 percent.\n\nThese  overall statistics mask the severity of the health and economic hardships felt  by lower-income families and communities of color as a result of the pandemic.  To cite just a few statistics, the Black unemployment rate is above 12 percent  and the Hispanic unemployment rate is over 10 percent, and Black-owned  businesses were shuttered at more than twice the rate of white-owned businesses  during the early stages of the pandemic. 7\n\nIn  terms of monetary policy, the appropriate focus right now is on getting the  country back to work. For that reason, policy is supporting very low interest  rates to provide stimulus to the economic recovery and keeping inflation expectations  anchored at 2 percent.\n\nIn  thinking about the future path of policy, it is important to recognize that the  pandemic engenders a unique and highly uncertain economic outlook. This is not  a standard recession and the economic future is inextricably tied to the spread  of the virus, people's behavior in containing that spread, and the development  of vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nGiven  this uncertainty, transparency and flexibility in our policy approach will enable  us to respond to changes in the outlook as they happen. Indeed, these are key  features of the forward guidance we issued after the FOMC meeting in September. 8\n\nSeptember's  FOMC statement clearly linked our policy to the key elements of the new policy  framework. In particular, it stated that the Committee expects it will be  appropriate to maintain the federal funds rate at its current target range until  labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's  assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is  on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. 9\n\nBy  linking future policy actions to economic outcomes and ultimately our dual  mandate goals, this forward guidance clearly describes the key elements of the  FOMC's reaction function to economic developments and a changing outlook.\n\nReady to Adapt\n\nOne  of the most important, but perhaps overlooked parts of our August announcement  is that we will review our longer-run framework roughly every five years. This  represents the Fed's commitment to transparency and our willingness to continue  to adapt to changing circumstances. Reviewing our longer-run framework and  approach to our goals more frequently will ensure we are well prepared for the  future, whatever it may bring.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll  conclude with this: these are extraordinary times. The announcement of changes  to our longer-run framework comes during one of the most challenging periods  our country and our economy have ever faced. These changes to the framework mean  that we are well positioned to deliver on our dual mandate goals and support a  strong and sustained economic recovery.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nWelcome, everyone. Thank you for joining  us. And a special thank you to those who make today’s event so powerful: the  distinguished speakers, panelists, and event organizers. We have a packed  agenda on a variety of important topics, and I look forward to hearing about  the progress we’ve made and priorities for the future.\n\nTen Years Gone\n\nToday marks our tenth annual U.S.  Treasury Market Conference, and a decade of partnership between our agencies. These  conferences have proven to be a valuable forum to share insights and  perspectives on the evolution of the Treasury market, identify challenges and  risks to smooth market functioning, and, most importantly, discuss ways to enhance  its resilience and effectiveness in both good times and bad times.\n\nThe New York Fed is proud to host this  conference each year. It leverages —sorry, I realize that leverage is not  a popular word in this crowd—it draws upon our strength as a convener of  market participants, academics, policymakers, and central bankers. Today, I’ll  take a look at how our interagency collaboration has strengthened our  understanding of Treasury market resiliency and that of adjacent markets. And  I’ll talk about the importance of continuing this work over the next decade and  beyond. I will also share some news about our ongoing commitment to ensuring  that our financial system continues to stand on a strong foundation of sound  reference rates.\n\nNow, let me give the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nStairway to the Annual Conference\n\nLet’s think back to the middle of  October 2014, when U.S. Treasury yields plunged and then quickly rebounded, an  episode later named the “flash rally.”\n\nThis episode was an impetus for the  drafting of a joint staff report that ultimately led to the inaugural U.S. Treasury  Market Conference in 2015. 1 That conference first brought together what is now known as the “Joint Member  Agencies” to discuss the evolving structure of the Treasury market. That  meeting focused on potential operational risks, regulatory requirements, and  repo market considerations. 2 It drew about 300 people—an impressive figure for the first year. I know that some  who participated in that conference are here again today.\n\nThe organizers recognized that it would  be important to have a regular forum to address developments in the Treasury market  and adjacent markets, in order to continue to study structural issues and explore  ongoing developments as a way to prevent disruptions to the system.\n\nTo be clear, attention on the function  of the Treasury market didn’t start in 2015. In fact, if you read Fed history—a  genre of literature that I particularly enjoy—it’s clear that the importance of  Treasury market functioning was central to the Federal Reserve and the New York  Fed for a long time. But what became apparent in more recent times was that as  the markets evolved, the need for formal joint-agency collaboration and  engagement with the private sector became more pressing.\n\nWhen the Levee Breaks\n\nWhat drives all of our efforts—from  staff reports, to conferences, to actions, and all the communication in  between— is that liquid,  well-functioning markets for Treasury and related securities are absolutely  essential for credit to flow and the economy to prosper. 3 It’s not an overstatement that a well-functioning U.S. Treasury market is  critical to our economy, and, in fact, to the entire world. 4\n\nThe Song Remains the Same\n\nWhat are some of the themes that we’ve  discussed at these conferences, and what’s been the impact on our financial  system?\n\nLet’s take a look back at that first  joint staff report. It made the case on two notable fronts. First, it  highlighted that principal trading firms played a much larger role in the  electronic trading market than was previously understood. Second, it  highlighted the need for improved transparency and increased availability of Treasury  market data.\n\nTen years gone, the song remains the  same. Those themes are still at the forefront of our conversations. For  example, while principal trading firms still continue to be a big presence in  the Treasury market, hedge funds now also play an important role. The work monitoring  the changing investor base and participant types continues through this forum  and the work of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance  and the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\nOn the data side, we’ve made tremendous  progress toward increased data transparency with the Trade Reporting and  Compliance Engine (TRACE) data initiative. And we’ve seen efforts to further  increase the transparency of this data to the public. In March of this year,  TRACE began publishing daily transaction data on on-the-run securities at the  end of the day. In fact, at this very podium last year, I said that we must  continue to prioritize transparency and clarity in financial data, especially  in the age of AI, when the sources of data are harder to ascertain. 5\n\nI’d be remiss if I did not mention  expanded central clearing as another key theme that has emerged over the years.  This is a major shift that is an outgrowth of our work. We’ll hear more about  that in a panel discussion later today, and I look forward to the continued  progress the market will make on this front as we move toward the  implementation deadlines of the SEC’s clearing rule.\n\nWhat Is and What Should Never Be\n\nBefore I cede the stage, I will end on a  topic that is at the core of the financial system and closely connected to the  Treasury market: reference rates. Thankfully, we have said good riddance to  LIBOR, and our financial system is now resting on a safe and solid foundation.\n\nI know I promised not to bring up LIBOR  again at this conference. But the LIBOR saga taught us all two important  lessons. First, enormous systemic risk can build in the global financial system  gradually over time, and second, it took a complex, expensive, decade-long  effort to fix that problem. We must not repeat that experience.\n\nTo that end, I  am pleased to announce that today, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is launching  the Reference Rate Use Committee, or RRUC. It will convene private market participants to support integrity,  efficiency, and resiliency in the use of interest rate benchmarks—or reference  rates—across financial markets, including the rates published by the New York  Fed. Its first meeting will occur in October.\n\nThe RRUC will focus on key issues  regarding reference rates, including how their use is evolving and how the  markets underpinning them may be changing too. It will promote best practices  related to the use of reference rates, including the recommendations set out by  the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) during the transition away  from LIBOR. 6 In  this way, the RRUC will serve as an essential partnership that builds upon the  work and accomplishments of the ARRC, by helping to preserve a robust system of  reference rates. This work will complement international efforts at the Bank  for International Settlements and the Financial Stability Board to monitor  developments in the use of interest rate benchmarks and ensure that we never  have to face a problem like LIBOR again. 7\n\nBring It On Home\n\nI will now bring it on home. We are now  at the bridge to the next 10 years of the U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Although  there has been significant progress, the growth and evolution of this market  remind us of the importance of staying focused on this work and continuing to  make progress in the years ahead. In an era of heightened uncertainty and  volatility, it is essential that the U.S. Treasury market remain liquid and  resilient, so that all financial markets can operate effectively. If you were  ever in doubt of how important this is, the experience of the past several  years should convince you otherwise.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to today’s  conference, and to another decade of partnership and success.",

    "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. I'm so  pleased to be here at Princeton University. It's great to be able to attend an  event like this in person, and to see so many of my esteemed colleagues here  today.\n\nWhenever I visit a college campus, I  am reminded that some of the  concepts I learned as a student can become more meaningful over time, often in  surprising ways. I've thought of that as I've reflected on the significant  challenges we face today—the ongoing pandemic and the Russian invasion of  Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to staggering human suffering,  these events are imposing considerable economic and financial hardships around  the world. If we think back on what many of us learned in statistics about factor  analysis, the pandemic and the  Russian invasion can be seen as factors that have common effects across countries. But there are  also idiosyncratic components that have  distinct effects for the U.S. economy.\n\nI'll talk  more about that today, as well as give you my views on inflation and the economic  outlook. But I want to say at the outset that we at the Federal Reserve are committed  to fulfilling our dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. With inflation too high, we are focused on restoring  price stability, while maintaining a strong labor market.\n\nBefore  I go any further, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I  express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nShared Impacts\n\nIt's striking to  think that just two years ago, the U.S. economy was reaching the trough of the  COVID-19 recession. Back then, we were living through unprecedented lockdowns.  And we had no way of knowing that this would be the shortest recession on  record, or that the rebound would be so dramatic.\n\nIf we think about  the global pandemic as a common factor, shutdowns, contractions, and rapid rebounds  were the shared impacts across countries around the world. But so were  supply-chain bottlenecks, shortages in semiconductors, and backlogs at  ports—issues we grapple with today.\n\nAnd just like the  United States, other countries have experienced imbalances in demand. Since the  initial lockdowns, people have spent more of their money on electronics, cars,  and furniture—and less on entertainment, travel, and restaurants.\n\nMany  nations also showed considerable resilience of economic activity through the  Omicron wave. But global risks remain. The BA.2 variant is now fueling a rise in  cases in some countries, including China, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom.  Their experiences bear close monitoring. In addition, the war in Ukraine poses  significant risks to food and energy prices, as well as to global economic growth.\n\nUniquely American\n\nGoing back to my  analogy of factor analysis, there are idiosyncratic components to the pandemic.  And I think it's important to note areas where we have had a uniquely American  experience in the COVID-19 recovery.\n\nFirst,  the amount of direct fiscal support in the United States was larger than what  most other countries provided. 1 This created a sizable cushion for many households, giving them the ability to maintain  spending through the pandemic and as inflation started to rise.\n\nIn  addition, the U.S. labor market has recovered strongly since the recession  trough, and labor shortages here have become more acute than in many other  countries.\n\nPart  of the reason for a shortage of labor is that the U.S. labor force  participation rate is  still about a percentage point below its level prior to the pandemic,  in what has become known as the Great Resignation . A  portion of this decline reflects longer-term trends related to the aging of the  population. But some left the labor market because they needed to be home to  care for young children or elderly relatives. Others didn't want to risk  exposure to COVID at the workplace. And many simply chose early retirement.\n\nDespite  the challenges presented by the Omicron wave early this year, the unemployment rate  fell to 3.6 percent in March, bringing it in line with the very low levels seen  before the pandemic.  With  low unemployment, solid wage growth, and ample job openings, all indicators  show that the strength of the labor market is at a level consistent with my  view of maximum employment.\n\nInflationary Pressures\n\nThe  other side of our mandate is price stability, and this is where our greatest  challenge now lies. Inflation is far too high. In  February, inflation—as measured  by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index— was nearly 6½ percent.  And high inflation is a key concern in many countries around the world.\n\nEven before Russia's  invasion of Ukraine, the rapid global economic rebound had driven up prices for  oil and many other commodities. Higher inflation is especially  detrimental for those who are least able to meet the growing cost of essentials  like food, housing, and transportation.\n\nThe  war in Ukraine and the global response present even greater challenges and  uncertainty. For  example, Russia and Ukraine are large exporters of key materials, including neon, palladium, and platinum. Those materials are used in the  production of a wide array of products, from auto parts to computer chips. Even  before the war, manufacturers were confronting shortages of important inputs.  Further disruptions to these key products could create spillovers to economies across  the globe.\n\nBut there are  differences in the ways in which countries are experiencing inflation. In the United  States, we are now seeing elevated inflation across many categories of goods and  services. Meanwhile, in Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russia for  energy, rising prices of oil and natural gas are the biggest concern. And in the Middle East, there are fears of a wheat shortage,  given the region's reliance on wheat from Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe one bright spot regarding inflation is  that longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored. This anchoring is  seen in both market-based measures of expected inflation and in surveys of  households and economists.  For example, the  New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations has fielded special survey  questions on five-year-ahead inflation expectations since 2019, and these  expectations have hardly budged since the start of the pandemic. 2 In addition, the pass-through of inflation surprises to revisions in  three-year-ahead inflation expectations is about half as large as it was before  2020. 3 That is, medium-term inflation expectations in this survey are less responsive  to inflation shocks than they were before the pandemic.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nFaced with  rising inflation but otherwise strong economies,  the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been moving away from the  extraordinarily accommodative stances they took in early 2020. Last year, many emerging market  central banks raised their policy rates. In December, the Bank of England  followed suit, followed by the Bank of Canada this March.\n\nCloser to home, the  FOMC decided a little over two weeks ago to raise the target range for the  federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The FOMC's decision to  start the process of reducing monetary support for the economy reflected the  strength and resilience the economy has displayed early this year, as well as  the very high inflation readings of the past several months. In addition to the  decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC  communicated two important messages about the likely future course of monetary  policy.\n\nFirst,  the FOMC indicated that it expects that ongoing increases in the target range  will be appropriate. 4 Although the FOMC did not make any decisions  about future policy actions, its Summary of Economic Projections is informative  regarding the thinking on the Committee at the time of the March meeting. The  median assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end  of next year is expected to be somewhat above the median assessment of its  longer-run level. 5\n\nOf course, these  are only forecasts. Uncertainty about the economic outlook  remains extraordinarily high, and risks to the inflation outlook are  particularly acute. One  of the things we've learned from the pandemic is to expect the unexpected. The  actual path for policy will depend on the evolution of economic conditions, the  outlook, and risks to the achievement of our price stability and maximum  employment goals.\n\nSecond, the FOMC indicated  that  it expects to decide at a coming meeting when to begin  reducing its holdings of securities . This process will be based on the  FOMC's \"Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance  Sheet\" released in January. 6 A key principle is to reduce the  balance sheet in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested  of principal payments received from securities held in the System Open Market  Account. I expect that this process of reducing the size  of the balance sheet can begin as soon as the May FOMC meeting.\n\nOur  monetary policy actions, combined with those of other countries, will help  bring demand for labor and products in closer alignment with available supply.  As this reduction in demand-induced price  pressures takes effect and supply constraints gradually ease, I anticipate inflation  readings will begin to decline later this year, although this process will take  time to fully play out.  For  2022 as a whole, I expect PCE inflation to be around 4 percent, then decline to  about 2½ percent in 2023, before returning close to our 2 percent longer-run  goal in 2024.\n\nThese  actions should enable us to manage the proverbial soft landing in a way that  maintains a sustained strong economy and labor market. Both are well positioned  to withstand tighter monetary policy .  In fact, I expect the economy to continue to grow this year and for the  unemployment rate to remain close to its current level.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are  uncertain times, and the policy questions we face are challenging. But we have learned the lessons of  high inflation from the past. Price stability is essential for sustained  economic prosperity,  and we are strongly committed to using our tools as needed to  achieve our price stability and maximum employment goals.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nWelcome  back!\n\nIt’s wonderful to see so many of our alumni joining  us today as we celebrate the 110th anniversary of the New York Fed—and  the centennial of our Liberty Street home.\n\nBuildings tell stories. And this unique building—made  of sandstone and limestone, with vaulted ceilings and a gold vault in the basement—has  much to say about where we’ve been, where we are, and where we’re going.\n\nIt stood as a beacon of strength during  crises: Black Thursday, Black Monday, 9/11, the Global Financial Crisis, and the  COVID-19 pandemic. And it’s witnessed remarkable change—in the global economy  and financial markets, in technology and the ways we work, and, as you see in the  photos, in hair styles and office attire.\n\nBut just as 33 Liberty Street kept its  distinctive stone exterior as glass skyscrapers grew around it, our dedication  to the mission of serving the American public has remained constant.\n\nAnd  throughout our history, our ability to be at the forefront of anticipating,  adapting, and acting in a fast-changing world has helped us ensure the strength  of the U.S. economy and the stability of the global financial system.\n\nEach of you has played a critical role in  this journey. And today, we’re excited to share a little bit about what we’re  doing to prepare for the future.\n\nYou’ll hear about our plans for the new Cash  Services Center and the ways technology is transforming our work—including how  we are using artificial intelligence. We’ll also discuss the work we do with  communities within the Second District, as well as how we are adapting to a changing  workplace, including increased flexibility in where and how we do our work.\n\nBefore we break into sessions that will delve  deeper into these topics, I’ll provide some of the backstory. And since we are  celebrating our building’s centennial, I’ll use 33 Liberty Street as the  backdrop.\n\nBut first, as you all know, I must give the standard  Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others  in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPaper and Pages\n\nWhen you look at photographs from the past,  what’s most striking is how technology has altered how we do our work. This is  true throughout the history of the New York Fed.\n\nThe early days were defined by paper. Lots of  paper. Paper cards, paper tape, stacks of paper on desks, folders of paper in file  cabinets. We communicated by paper, gave authorizations on paper, and recorded transactions  on paper. Pages hurried down the halls, delivering important papers to people across  the Bank.\n\nAnd of course, there were landline telephones—those  box-like devices with buttons, curly cords, and handles that you would hold up  to your ear. Now they sit at the corner of our desks, gathering dust. In fact,  with the advent of more integrated communications technology, we will soon  dispense with desktop phones altogether.\n\nWe still are tied to our phones, but not by  cords. Many of you remember your BlackBerry—some with fondness, others, well maybe  not so much. Now, we are all connected 24/7/365.\n\nSome of you may have even started your New  York Fed careers working on huge, box-like computers. Although these  technologies often look antiquated today, they were state of the art at the time.\n\nThankfully, computers have gotten smaller and  lighter, wireless networks have made them portable, and data and processing are  moving to the cloud.\n\nThere was also a time when our cash business  was based in this building, with currency verification on the third floor. Employees  would flip through bills like casino dealers dealing cards, eyeballing money to  spot counterfeits. Later, we turned to using jewelers’ microscopes. Now, the  microscopes have mostly been replaced by very high-tech sensors.\n\nOur cash operations business expanded so much  that in 1992, we moved it to EROC, our East Rutherford Operations Center.\n\nEROC was also one of many places in the  Second District that processed checks. This is another business that has changed  radically. At its peak in 2001, EROC alone processed an average of over three million  checks per day.\n\nBut by 2006, check usage had declined dramatically,  and EROC stopped processing them altogether. EROC is now solely focused on the storage,  distribution, and processing of U.S. currency and coin—not just for the Second  District, but internationally as well.\n\nThe Best of Who We Are\n\nBringing the story to more recent times, the  pandemic shutdowns and their aftermath meant the New York Fed once again was  called on to play its pivotal part in helping to stabilize the economy and  financial markets. Historians will long write about events of the past five  years and the role the New York Fed played.\n\nAs an institution, we moved quickly and  decisively. We carried out record amounts of open market operations. And we set  up and operated emergency facilities that, in short order, restored calm and stability  to financial markets disrupted by the onset of the pandemic. My favorite quote  from this time is from a colleague who said that she never imagined doing the  best work of her career in pajamas and flipflops.\n\nLeft unwritten is that our people were also caring  for children and ensuring their elderly parents were safe. Some lost loved  ones. We lost loved ones. And while many of us worked from home, our essential on-site  workers came to the office every day.\n\nI will always remember how we supported each  other while we worked tirelessly to carry out our mission.\n\nThe crisis brought out the best of who we are.  And it forever changed the ways we work. It wasn’t just about going virtual. Technology  helped foster greater collaboration—within teams, among groups, and across the  System.\n\nWe discovered that video calls can be more  personal than phone calls. Brainstorming, once done sitting around a white  board, can now be performed in shared documents from different locations. And processes  are becoming automated and less fragmented.\n\nAll of this has empowered our people to apply  their diverse perspectives and unique talents in new ways. It’s one of the many  reasons we are committed to making the most of the hybrid work model—what we  call our flexible work evolution.\n\nAnd once futuristic technologies are now part  of our present. Our robots (or automated guided vehicles)—with cool names like  Johnny 5, Megahertz, and Super Bad Decepticon—help us process up to $700  million of cash each day.\n\nInnovating and Driving Progress\n\nTechnology has made our work easier, but it’s  our people who are innovating and driving progress.\n\nOur culture is shifting. We’re using Agile  methods to innovate and experiment. To try new things and not be afraid to fail.  To learn from failure and try again. This mindset of experimentation is already  paying dividends.\n\nFor example, our Data & Statistics team  is using generative AI and developing prototypes to analyze data, spot  anomalies, and suggest follow-ups. These efforts will provide deeper insights  and save analysts’ time. Of course, this is in an exploratory stage. But the  opportunities feel endless.\n\nWe are also collaborating with our peers from  around the world through the New York Innovation Center, which is studying the  potential of new technologies in central banking.\n\nAnd we are modernizing technologies in some  of our most critical responsibilities in supplying currency and implementing  monetary policy.\n\nPlans are now  underway to create a next-generation Cash Services Center that eventually will  replace EROC.\n\nAnd  earlier this week, our Markets Group announced the development of FedTrade  Plus, an innovative new trading platform for open market operations and the  account services we provide to other central banks. This is a critical system  that is core to what we do at the Fed: Annually, we carry out nearly 900  operations and process around $32 trillion—that’s trillion with a “T.”\n\nGoing  back to our history, auction bids have been submitted in person, by mail, by  phone, and electronically—with every innovation seeming like a giant step  forward. This new platform will allow us to analyze the performance of open  market operations in real time, and it will substantially simplify the user experience.\n\nOur Greatest Strength\n\nChange has  defined our century at 33 Liberty Street. We have reinvented ourselves many  times, and we can only imagine how our work will evolve over the next 100 years.\n\nBut the  story of 33 Liberty Street is very much about its people. Our people—people  like you—have been, and always will be, our greatest strength.\n\nOur  mission is what brings us together. We are here to serve our communities, to  support the strength of the U.S. economy and global financial system, and to do  so in an environment where we innovate, learn, and move forward together with  agility.\n\nSo today  is a day to celebrate our building’s centennial—and the people who make us who  we are.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIt’s a pleasure to speak at today’s conference on this  critically important issue, one that Bill Dudley and his colleagues have done  tremendous work bringing to the forefront over the past few years. It’s also an  honor to be sharing a stage with Bill today, and I’d like to thank him for his outstanding  leadership of the New York Fed.\n\nI’ve learned a great deal from this conference, especially  hearing the diverse perspectives and experiences of regulators from across the  globe, industry leaders, and academic experts. The speakers and discussions have  already covered a lot of ground, so I’ll keep my remarks brief.\n\nThis afternoon I’m going to talk about the urgent need to  focus our attention on banking culture in supervision and what that means in  practice. Before I go any further, I have to give the usual Fed disclaimer that  the views I express are my own, and not necessarily those of anyone else in the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Good Times Are When to Get Your House in Order\n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis and ensuing economic  downturn, the world’s attention was trained on financial services. The crisis severely  eroded people’s trust in the industry, both here and abroad.\n\nGovernments and regulators quickly got to work fixing the main  deficiencies in the existing regulatory framework. These included requiring much  stronger loss-absorbing capital to weather severe economic downturns, demanding  greater liquidity cushions to withstand market and funding disruptions, and creating  a robust resolution framework to protect both the economy and the taxpayer in  the event of a failure of a systemically important firm.\n\nThese changes were appropriate and necessary. We must not  lose sight of their importance in safeguarding the soundness of the financial  system and in ensuring that future generations do not have to suffer the  economic trauma that we lived through this past decade.\n\nBringing us to the present day, we are in a much, much better  place, in terms of both the financial sector and the overall economy. We have a  more robust regulatory regime in place, and banks are well positioned to survive  future storms.\n\nFurthermore, our economy’s in great shape; we’re in the  second-longest expansion in history, and economic data from both the United States  and countries around the world continue to trend upwards. As a policymaker, solid  growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our target are all exactly  what I want to see.\n\nParadoxically, it’s precisely this sense that things have  gotten so much better that worries me most. Although we have seen marked  improvements in the critical areas of capital, liquidity, and resolution, we  have not yet fully addressed the root causes of many of the problems that have  plagued the financial sector. I am thinking of not only the excessive  risk-taking and leverage in the run-up to the crisis, but also the repeated  scandals related to LIBOR, FX, money laundering, sales practices;  unfortunately, the list goes on and on. Underlying these scandals is often an inadequate  corporate culture, where accountability and ethical conduct have fallen by the  wayside.\n\nThe good times we’re in can exacerbate these problems in  three ways. First, there’s a risk of complacency setting in—an “if it ain’t  broke, don’t fix it” mentality. Second, in a strong economy, the hard numbers that  we tend to focus on when examining profits, losses, capital, and liquidity can look  like everything’s coming up roses, even when an uncomfortable reality lies  beneath. And, finally, culture is a long-run investment that takes many years  to develop and requires constant reinforcement to preserve. If you let it  erode, you can’t go to the market and obtain a new “culture” overnight.\n\nAs I mentioned, establishing a more robust regulatory  framework was absolutely necessary for a healthier, more resilient financial system. But, it is far from sufficient . The danger we face today is  that people may conclude that the hardened defenses are enough, and other  supervisory activities around culture, conduct, and governance are superfluous.\n\nThis feeling that we’ve built a strong fortress able to  withstand any onslaught may create a mood of complacency and detract attention from  the dangers that could be growing within the walls of financial institutions.\n\nThis problem is aggravated by the fact that the hard numbers studied  by regulators and supervisors should look great when the economy’s doing well. Profits are high and loan losses low  when the economy is humming along. But, strong numbers in a strong economy  don’t give you the full picture. They can’t always tell you whether people are  cutting corners, taking excessive risks, or violating rules and regulations. Even  worse, they can distract you from digging into the truth and unearthing unethical  business practices and misconduct that may hide below the surface.\n\nThe well-known challenge with culture is that, in contrast with  things like capital and liquidity, culture feels “softer” and, therefore, more  difficult to measure. And often in finance there’s a tendency to disregard what  can’t be quantified. But just because it’s hard to measure doesn’t mean we  should ignore it or downplay its importance. As we heard throughout today’s  conference, culture shapes every conversation, every decision, and every  action; it is at the root of whether an organization performs in a manner  consistent with its mission, or not.\n\nHow to Achieve a Better Banking Culture\n\nThis brings me back to the issue of  culture as a long-term investment that can’t be “fixed” overnight. Several  years ago, Rich Lyons, Dean at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, spoke at the  San Francisco Fed and talked about culture in a way that has stuck with me ever  since. Transforming a culture is a five- to ten-year project; keeping it that  way is an ongoing mission that requires strong leadership and consistent  action.\n\nAs a leader of a large organization,  I’ve taken that message to heart. I’ve found that a culture based on the  principle of open and authentic dialogue, that embraces our diverse backgrounds  and perspectives delivers better results. I’ve found that well-defined collective  values and direction lead to greater collaboration and innovation. Finally,  I’ve found that this work is never a finished project, but an ongoing one that  constantly evolves.\n\nI started by saying that I feel a  sense of urgency in addressing banking culture. So where do I see the  priorities for supervision?\n\nAs supervisors, we need to ensure  that bank management and boards are exerting strong and effective leadership  with robust governance. That means holding management and boards of directors  to high standards in terms of culture and conduct, even when the numbers look  rosy. It means ensuring corporate values are clearly articulated and incentives  are squarely align with a bank’s strategic goals. It means identifying,  communicating, and mitigating risks in a timely and effective manner. It means that  employees feel empowered to raise their hands if they see wrongdoing, and that comprehensive  fixes are implemented when something goes wrong. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, when times are good, we  rarely feel an urgency to make changes. And these are certainly good times. But  numbers can have a funny way of not revealing the whole truth. A sound  spreadsheet may mask unethical behavior, a well-capitalized bank may be on the  road to ruin, and a neglected corporate culture can turn toxic.\n\nWe must stay vigilant around the  “softer” side of supervision. Strong culture and robust corporate governance  are our first lines of defense. They’re a critical part of the tool kit when it  comes to protecting people, banks, and the economy from risk, scandal, and harm.",

It’s a pleasure to be speaking at the fifth annual  U.S. Treasury Market Conference.\n\nThis conference is particularly  valuable because it brings together market participants and five public sector  bodies—the  New York Fed, the Board of Governors, the Treasury, the SEC, and the CFTC—to discuss the U.S. Treasury  market.\n\nThe Treasury market is  arguably the most important market in the world, and today is a unique opportunity  to discuss some of the big topics in front of us.  Increasing transparency, preparing for future  risks, and taking advantage of innovation in this market are vital areas of  discussion.\n\nThis morning, I’ll begin  with some observations on recent volatility in money markets and the Fed’s  approach to support stability in this critical part of the financial system as  we carry out the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions.\n\nI’ll then pivot to a different  but related topic: the transition away from LIBOR. I think I can get away with it because this conference’s five sponsoring  agencies, which first came together following the “flash rally” in 2014, also  all play a vital role in facilitating the industry’s move to more robust  reference rates. Crucially, they are ex officio members of the Alternative  Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), the private sector group convened to guide  the transition away from LIBOR. And of course the Secured Overnight Financing  Rate (SOFR), the ARRC’s selected replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR, reflects  transactions that finance U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nBefore I go any further,  I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are  mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMarket Conditions\n\nI’ll start with recent developments  in money markets. Conditions in funding markets became highly volatile early  last week, with secured lending rates moving higher on Monday and rising  sharply on Tuesday. We had expected a number of factors—including quarterly  corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury auctions—to put upward pressure on  funding rates. However, the size of the reaction in repo rates, the spillover  to unsecured markets such as federal funds, and the emergence of strains in market  functioning were outside of recent experience. For example, in April and June  of this year, sizable payment flows led to relatively muted movements in  secured lending rates and small movements in unsecured rates.\n\nAs had been done ahead of  prior dates with anticipated significant funding pressures, on Friday,  September 13, the Markets team at the New York Fed, and others in  the Federal Reserve System put in place a plan for increased monitoring of  money markets. This included more frequent reporting on transactions, data, and  information from market participants on Monday.\n\nAlthough conditions  remained calm on that Friday, the simultaneous increase and widening dispersion  in repo rates and, importantly, federal funds rates on Monday indicated that  markets were not effectively distributing liquidity across the system.  The New York Fed’s Markets team built a  timeline and implementation plan in case the Open Market Desk at the New York  Fed (Desk) would need to operate on Tuesday. Early Tuesday morning, it became  clear that this situation had persisted and had the potential to become more acute.\n\nIn response to these  developments, and in keeping with the FOMC’s standing directive to the Desk to  conduct open market operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate  within the target range, on Tuesday morning the Desk announced and conducted a  repo operation. Although such operations were common before the financial  crisis, this was the first non-test repo operation in many years. This was  followed by repo operations each day since.\n\nThese actions had the  desired effect of reducing strains in markets, narrowing the dispersion of  rates, and lowering secured and unsecured rates to more normal levels relative  to other benchmarks.\n\nThe experience of the past week drew attention  to the possibility of the development of strains in funding markets around the  upcoming end of the quarter.  This past Friday  we announced a plan of continued daily overnight repo operations through October  10, accompanied by three two-week term repo operations that span the month end. 1 The goal of these actions is the same as for recent open market operations: foster  conditions in money markets to keep the federal funds rate within the target  range.\n\nThis episode reminds us all  of the importance of having well- functioning markets and the vital role that  the Federal Reserve plays in supplying liquidity to the system when markets are  under stress. We were prepared for such an event, acted quickly and  appropriately, and our actions were successful. Friday’s announcement on open  market operations to address potential quarter-end funding pressures on  interest rates followed this same approach: quickly diagnose the problem,  develop the right action plan, and execute that plan.\n\nAt the same time, it is equally  important that we examine these recent market dynamics and their implications  for the liquidity needs in relation to the overall amount of reserves held at  the Federal Reserve. We will continue to monitor and analyze developments  closely. As Federal Reserve Chair Powell stated in his most recent press  conference, the FOMC will assess the implications for the appropriate level of  reserves and time to resume organic growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet consistent with the successful execution of the FOMC’s ample reserves framework. 2\n\nThat’s enough on recent  events for now. I’ll turn to another very important issue, reference rate  reform.\n\nLIBOR Won’t Last Forever\n\nSome say only two things  in life are guaranteed: death and taxes. But I say there are actually three:  death, taxes, and the end of LIBOR.\n\nEveryone in the financial  services industry needs to be aware that the date when the existence of LIBOR  can no longer be guaranteed is fast approaching.\n\nI titled remarks I gave  on this subject earlier in the year “901 Days” to remind everyone just how  little time both the public sector and market participants have to prepare for  a world without LIBOR. 3\n\nWe are now 831 days away  from that world, and while some institutions are making good progress, others  are sticking their metaphorical heads in the sand, hoping the issue will go  away.\n\nEven more concerning are those wearing  rose-tinted glasses, getting nostalgic about LIBOR and hoping for an extension  to the deadline or a reincarnation of the rate. I cannot emphasize enough that  the clock is ticking and everyone needs to get their firms ready for January 1,  2022.\n\nA look at the numbers,  and recent history, reveals the need for urgency. There are $200 trillion of  financial contracts referencing U.S. dollar LIBOR. 4 But the volume of actual transactions that term LIBOR is based on is very  small. When individual banks make LIBOR submissions they are largely based on judgment,  not real transactions. This makes the rate vulnerable to manipulation, and banks  are increasingly reluctant to provide submissions, adding yet further risk around  using the rate.\n\nThe U.K. Financial  Conduct Authority (FCA) has reached an agreement with banks to keep submitting  rates until the end of 2021, but beyond that date the existence of LIBOR is not  guaranteed. 5 The FCA has made it clear that it expects at  least some banks to leave the LIBOR panels soon after 2021, making LIBOR even  less representative than it is now, and that it would need to judge whether  LIBOR was still representative at that stage. 6\n\nHeadway Is Being Made\n\nWhile the clock is  inevitably ticking, progress is being made.\n\nIn 2017, the ARRC  selected SOFR as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. 7\n\nSince April 2018, the New  York Fed has produced SOFR every business day. It’s based on an important underlying  market with much higher volumes than LIBOR, and is compliant with the  Principles for Financial Benchmarks set forth by the International Organization  of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). 8\n\nThe International Swaps  and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has led really important work on the  development of contingencies for some derivatives products for the scenario  where LIBOR ceases to exist. 9\n\nA key question is what  will happen if the FCA finds LIBOR to no longer be representative. Two large  central counterparties have already indicated that they would expect to move  the LIBOR trades they clear to SOFR if this occurred. The Financial Stability  Board’s Official Sector Steering Group (OSSG) has indicated its support for ISDA  to include such a trigger to avoid fragmentation between cleared and uncleared  derivatives. 10\n\nDerivatives contracts  account for 95 percent of the exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR, so universal  changes to these contracts would be a significant leap forward. If the market  signs up to the ISDA protocol when it’s published, it will be a considerable  milestone and will go a long way toward reducing risks to firms, markets, and  the financial system.\n\nIn addition, the ARRC has  released four sets of recommended fallback language for different types of cash  products and has published potential paths forward for adjustable-rate  mortgages (ARMs). 11 While  mortgages are a small part of the overall exposure, it’s vitally important that  consumers understand what the changes being made mean in real terms.\n\nLast week, the Federal  Reserve Board, the FDIC, the OCC, and other agencies released a proposal on  adjusting margin requirements for covered swap entities that, among other  things, are meant to remove unintended hurdles to signing the ISDA protocol and  moving away from LIBOR. 12 The Financial Accounting Standards Board has  similarly released an exposure draft with proposals to smooth the transition  from an accounting perspective. 13 Finally, earlier this year, the SEC staff  issued a statement highlighting risks and disclosures for market participants  to evaluate proactively as they transition away from LIBOR. 14\n\nThe Challenges Ahead\n\nProgress has been made,  but there’s still much to do.\n\nSOFR is sometimes  criticized for the lack of a term rate, but my message is don’t wait for a term  rate to get your house in order. Don’t use that as an excuse to halt the vital  work of understanding where your exposure to LIBOR lies and how to prepare your  business. The OSSG has produced a document explaining how market participants  can use overnight risk-free rates, as opposed to waiting for term rates. 15 In addition, the New York Fed is  preparing average SOFR rates and a SOFR index, with the goal of publishing them  daily by the middle of next year.\n\nContracts that reference  U.S. dollar LIBOR continue to be written, which only serves to increase the  level of systemic risk. In rare cases where for some reason LIBOR must be  referenced, robust fallback language that accounts for a future without LIBOR  needs to be included. I also strongly encourage market participants to address  legacy LIBOR-linked contracts. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach for  closing out or converting existing LIBOR positions so market participants need  to get ahead of this issue.\n\nWe know this is difficult  and complex work. At the New York Fed, we’re working to identify where we have  potential exposure to LIBOR and other non-IOSCO-compliant reference rates. We  have teams examining monetary policy operations, foreign reserve management  activities, and trading agreements with counterparties.\n\nWe want to hear your  voice so we can incorporate your feedback and facilitate the development of the  tools you need to ensure an orderly transition.  Engage with the official sector about how  LIBOR affects your firm and your challenges in this transition. And note that just  last week, the ARRC published a checklist designed to support market participants  with the adoption of SOFR. 16\n\nImplementation will be  complex: financial contracts need to be scrutinized, operations need to be  evaluated, and technology needs to be updated. The work involves numerous  jurisdictions and multiple asset classes, and will require changes from how  business is conducted to how systems are built. These things take time, and  time is running out.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe LIBOR transition is a  serious issue the industry needs to address. Both the official sector and  market participants have made enormous progress, but we need to see much  broader and consistent preparation for the transition.\n\nIf your firm is one of  those hoping the problem will go away, or feeling nostalgic and counting on an  extension to the deadline, take this message back: The clock is ticking,  LIBOR’s days are numbered, and we all need to play our part in preparing the  industry for January 1, 2022.\n\nThank you, and I hope you  enjoy today’s conference.",

    "text": "Thank  you for the opportunity to speak this morning. In a speech Chair Powell gave  last month, he said, “Low inflation seems to be the problem of this era, not  high inflation.” 1 Persistently low inflation is just one of the reasons the theme of this  conference is very timely.\n\nOur Dual Mandate Goals\n\nAnd  inflation is one of the topics I’m going to address today. The Fed has two  goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. These are also  known as the dual mandate. When I talk about price stability, our objective is  to keep the inflation rate near our symmetric 2 percent goal, 2 so  understanding inflation data and how it fits into the broader economic picture  is critically important.\n\nThis  morning I’m going to set the scene for that broader economic picture and  explain how changes in the landscape influenced the rate adjustment the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) made in July. I’ll then discuss the challenges on  the horizon and how they feed into my thinking on monetary policy.\n\nThis  is as good a time as any to remind everyone that the views I express today are  mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nIf  you do an online search about recent economic developments, the word  “uncertainty” will come up a lot. And it’s true that uncertainty, both at home  and abroad, is playing an important role in my thinking about the economic  outlook and monetary policy, as I’ll discuss shortly.\n\nBut  when you take a step back and look at where things stand today relative to our  goals, the economy is in a favorable place. The current expansion is the  longest on record. The economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, as seen in  the latest GDP numbers. And this growth has supported month after month of job  gains and a pickup in wage growth in the past couple of years.\n\nFurthermore,  the overall unemployment rate is near the lowest it has been in 50 years. And the  benefits of the strong labor market have been broad across the population: Unemployment  rates for African-Americans and Hispanics, while still higher than the overall  rate, are near their all-time lows. These low rates aren’t just a fluke of how  unemployment is measured in the official statistics—the broadest measure of  underemployment, called U-6, is at its lowest level since 2000. These are all  very positive signs when it comes to assessing our maximum employment goal.\n\nThe  economy is in a good place, but not without risk and uncertainty (there, I said  it!). Persistently low inflation is a key area of my attention, with the core  PCE inflation rate—which strips out volatile food and energy prices—running at  1.6 percent, nearly half a percentage point below our 2 percent longer-run  target.\n\nOn  its own, inflation somewhat below our longer-run goal would not be such a big  deal, especially with our economy strong. But the broader context is important.  Ongoing disinflationary pressures from abroad, and the risk that inflation  expectations in the U.S. may have drifted down after many years of inflation  running below 2 percent, form an important part of this picture.\n\nIf  we look beyond the headline GDP figure, which remains good, there are more  mixed signals coming from different sectors. Robust consumer spending is  balanced by signs of slowing business investment. We’ve also seen a decline in  exports and weakening manufacturing data, reflecting slowing global growth and  uncertainty related to trade and geopolitical risks.\n\nI am  carefully monitoring this nuanced picture and remain vigilant to act as  appropriate to support continuing growth, a strong labor market, and a  sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\n\nMonetary Policy Adjustments\n\nThis  brings me to our decision to lower the federal funds rate in July and how that  fits into recent history. Cast your minds back to a year ago, when the Fed was continuing  along the path of normalizing monetary policy. This context provides useful  information for how and why our stance has evolved over time.\n\nDuring  the summer of 2018, the economy was growing above trend as businesses rode the  wave of fiscal stimulus. The unemployment rate had fallen below 4 percent, a  figure not seen since the peak of the tech boom in 2000. The global outlook was  still quite positive, and inflation was close to our 2 percent goal. Against  that backdrop, very gradually bringing interest rates back to more normal  levels was appropriate in order to keep the economy on a sustainable path of  growth.\n\nBut  the economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook have evolved  considerably since then. While there’s not been a dramatic change seen in the  overall numbers yet, the more detailed picture that emerged by summer of this  year pointed to an outlook of slowing growth and inflation falling short of our  goal. This in turn argued for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy  stance.\n\nThe  combination of muted inflation, slowing global growth, and uncertainties  related to trade and other global developments led the FOMC to adjust the federal  funds rate down by a quarter of a percentage point and conclude the run-off of  the Fed’s balance sheet two months earlier than previously indicated.\n\nOur  policy actions and communications have contributed to an easing of financial  conditions that should help sustain the expansion and get us closer to our dual  mandate goals.\n\nChallenges on the Horizon\n\nWhen  I think about the road ahead, my number one goal is to keep the expansion on  track. This is how we will keep unemployment low and bring inflation back to 2  percent. I will be watching closely at how both domestic and broader, global  developments unfold.\n\nAt  present, slowing global growth and geopolitical uncertainty pose particular  challenges. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the International  Monetary Fund downgraded its projection for global growth and highlighted  downside risks. 3\n\nSlower  global growth reduces demand for our exports and puts a dampener on both U.S.  inflation and growth prospects. And these aren’t just projections for the  future—we’re seeing manifestations of slowing growth around the world now. Germany,  the UK, and China are all experiencing slowdowns, and the euro area is of  particular concern. In response, the European Central Bank and several other  central banks have either adjusted, or indicated they will adjust their  monetary policy stance to support their economies.\n\nThese  concerns about global growth are compounded by broader geopolitical  uncertainty. The risk of a no-deal Brexit for the UK is looming large, the  political situation in Italy remains fraught, political tensions continue in  Hong Kong, and Argentina’s economy is coping with a debt crisis.\n\nOn  our own shores, concerns around trade policy with China are adding to an  uncertain picture. My contacts in the business community have said this is  making them more cautious about investment. The effects of this angst are  already showing up in the investment numbers.\n\nAn  additional fly in the ointment, if you will, is the recently released downward  revision for GDP growth covering last year and an announced estimate of a  sizable downward revision to payroll employment. One implication of these  revisions is that the economy’s underlying momentum was already somewhat less  robust than previously thought, even before recent developments pointed to a  less rosy outlook.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nSo  what will the response from the Fed be to all of these developments? Our role  is to navigate a complex and at times ambiguous outlook to keep the economy  growing and strong.\n\nAs  events unfold and conditions evolve, it’s critical we understand which developments  are mere bumps in the road and those that will affect the outlook in a material  way over the longer term. That means maintaining a data-dependent approach that  takes into account the risks and uncertainty that are weighing on the economy.\n\nI  will continue to consult everything from very granular data about individuals’  experiences of employment conditions, through to the macro projections for  global growth. We need to consider all of the information available and be  flexible in our response.\n\nConclusion\n\nLow  inflation is indeed the problem of this era. The current outlook of moderate  growth, low unemployment, but stubbornly low inflation is a reflection of the  broader economic picture—the July rate adjustment an appropriate response to  ease financial conditions and support the economy.\n\nHow  the U.S. outlook evolves in the future is fundamentally tied to the fortunes of  the economies around the world. As I look ahead, I’m keeping a keen eye on all  the data, both domestic and global, and the implications for our economy. With  an uncertain outlook, vigilance and flexibility are essential for achieving our  dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Persistently low  inflation, heightened uncertainty, and global cross-currents make this a  particularly challenging time for monetary policy, and my laser focus is on  doing the best we can to support a strong economy and achieve our 2 percent  inflation goal.\n\nThank  you.",

    "text": "Good morning. I’m an economist, so I’m going  to start with some numbers.\n\nThe unemployment rate for lesbian, gay,  bisexual, and transgender people is nearly double the national average. 1 And the unemployment rate specifically for transgender people is three times  the national rate. 2 As  President of a Federal Reserve Bank, I am focused on two vital economic goals: maximum  employment and stable prices for the U.S. economy. These statistics paint a  clear picture of why conferences like this one are so important: We are not  where we need to be.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to give the  standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in  the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me say, as an ally, that it’s a genuine  honor to be invited to open today’s Forum.\n\nThis Pride Month marks 50 years since the  Stonewall uprising. We’ve come a long way since the 1960s, but we still have  far to go. It was also a great honor to be  able to fly the Pride flag outside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  for the first time this June. But, given that it is 50 years since Stonewall, it’s clear we have more catching up to  do.\n\nAnd this is where we owe OPEN Finance a great  debt of gratitude. OPEN Finance gives us the tools we need to assess how we’re  doing, and where we need to make progress.\n\nWith the support of OPEN Finance, and the  dedication of the Open Network at the New York Fed, we’ve introduced a number  of new policies and measures that drive our efforts to make the Bank the open  and inclusive employer we aspire to be. I’d personally like to thank David  Ignell and Gil Carroll, presidents of our Open Network, for their work moving  us forward.\n\nThese efforts are important because they send  a message to LGBT employees and the organization as a whole about our values  and culture.\n\nI’d like to share one specific example. We  recently created the option to add gender pronouns to our official e-mail  signatures. This is a part of an organization-wide effort to raise awareness  around the use of pronouns. On its own, it may seem like a small change, but it  sends a loud message that part of respecting one another is using the correct  pronouns. This effort has been well received, and a big part of that is because  it’s created spaces for conversations that just weren’t happening before.\n\nBut policies can only go so far.\n\nIn fact, we can have world-class policies, but  if we don’t have a culture where people feel comfortable bringing their whole  selves to work, rules alone won’t get us to where we need to be.\n\nThis is true of every element of diversity and  inclusion. In a culture where taking  extended leave damages your career prospects, a generous parental leave  policy won’t make up for that. In a culture where people don’t feel that their  voices are welcome, few will speak up. In a culture that fails to embrace differences, we won’t reap the benefits of  diversity.\n\nThe data are clear. Nearly half of LGBT people  are closeted at work, and the top reason LGBT workers don’t report negative  comments they hear about LGBT employees is they don’t believe that anything  will be done about it. 3\n\nThis gets to the heart of why the “inclusion”  piece of diversity and inclusion is essential, and a personal priority.  Obviously, there’s a moral imperative for diversity, and numerous studies have  shown the benefits to both productivity and the bottom line. 4\n\nBut for me, it’s my experiences as both an  academic and a policymaker that have made inclusion so important. Economics is  a profession that has a glaring diversity issue. As economists, we have not  done enough to create a diverse profession or an inclusive culture.\n\nWhen I’m sitting in a room and see a bunch of  people who look and sound the same, I know it’s a problem. When everyone has an  identical view, it’s easy to assume it’s because that view is the right one.  But for me it raises questions: Who isn’t in the room? Who’s missing, and why  aren’t they here?\n\nI’m always on the hunt for different  perspectives on how to interpret the data, new takes on old problems, and  innovative approaches to tackle the challenges that lie ahead. If I have a  bunch of cookie-cutter theories and explanations that look like my own, I know  it’s highly probable we’ve not been challenging ourselves enough.\n\nMost CEOs will tell you that that their people  are their greatest asset. I know that  to be true. That’s another reason why an inclusive culture is something that’s  so important, and needs to be embedded across an organization. It’s not enough  for diversity to live in HR documents and policies. We need to create an  environment where everyone has the potential to flourish; to bring their best,  most innovative, and creative selves to work; and to do the best work of their  careers.\n\nSo how do we make progress? We need to have  honest and open conversations every day. Not just about work performance and  ideas, but on everything. We need to make sure that everyone—regardless of  their background, their age, the color of their skin, their sexual orientation,  or their gender identity—feels their perspectives are heard and valued.\n\nCreating an inclusive culture has no end date.  Like so many aspects of culture and values, it’s not a project with a deadline,  where we can say, “OK, we’re done now.” Instead, we need to be constantly  reassessing our goals, refining what we do, and how we do it.\n\nWe need to be vigilant, attuned to change, and  open to new ideas. Because it’s one thing to create an open culture, but a much  harder challenge to keep it that way.\n\nI’m reminded of a quote by Brené Brown, which  I believe sums this up: “To not have the  conversation because of discomfort is the definition of privilege…”\n\nWhen we step back, when the dialogue—however  uncomfortable it may be—stops, or is never initiated in the first place, is  when there’s a problem. It’s the conversations that aren’t spoken that erode  trust, alienate people, and take us back.\n\nI’d like to conclude where I began. I spend a  lot of time examining data, and it’s a source of constant disappointment and  frustration that LGBT people, women, and people of color continue to have less  economic opportunity than their straight, white, male counterparts.\n\nCreating equality of opportunity at the  national level is a challenge the United States continues to struggle with. But  it’s both the right thing to do and the only way we’ll reach our full economic potential.\n\nCreating a more diverse—and equally  important—a more inclusive Federal Reserve is a key priority. We have come a  long way, but there’s no doubt we still have far to go. And this is a journey  without a final destination. When someone tells me “we’re done,” is when I know  we have the furthest to go. It’s also a journey that is so much easier when we  do not walk alone. Partners like OPEN Finance are crucial to our progress.\n\nOnce again, I’d like to thank you for inviting  me to open today’s forum. I know it’s going to be a productive and insightful  day, and one full of the conversations we all need to be having more  frequently.",

    "text": "Good afternoon. I would like to start by thanking Athanasios for inviting me to participate in this event. It is a real honor to highlight the influence of our esteemed colleague Marvin Goodfriend, an outstanding and original researcher, policy advisor, and friend.\n\nMarvin epitomized the role of policy advisor. His research dug deep into the issues, introduced new ideas into the discussion, and developed options for policymakers to consider for the most challenging issues. The fact that we have so many researchers and policymakers here is testament to the importance of his research in shaping the conversations that we are having to this day.\n\nBefore I reflect more on Marvin’s contributions to monetary policy, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn preparation for what I know will be a stimulating discussion, I’d like to highlight a few of the ways that Marvin changed the conversation in the U.S. about what was then commonly referred to as the zero lower bound on interest rates, or ZLB for short. These show how Marvin’s insights shaped some of the most prominent discussions in monetary policy. Before I do so, it’s helpful to look back about 20 years. As the clock ticked down on the 20th century, many people’s attention was not on the ZLB. Most were more concerned about the millennium bug that had the world on high alert. Truth be told, the ZLB wasn’t perceived to be a looming problem in the United States back in 1999. The economy was doing very well and the target federal funds rate was 5-1/2 percent at the end of the year. Up until then, the only historical reference points for the ZLB were from the Great Depression of the 1930s and, more recently, Japan in the 1990s. It was simply not part of the experience of postwar Europe or the Americas. However, a small group of economists, with Marvin at the forefront, was asking whether the ZLB could pose a challenge here in the U.S. and, if so, what would be the consequences and potential remedies. Researchers and policymakers began to turn the dial up on the discussion around the ZLB. The Fed held a conference in Woodstock, Vermont in October 1999 on the ZLB. 1 At that conference, Marvin presented his paper “Overcoming the Zero Bound on Interest Rate Policy,” which was subsequently published in the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking (JMCB) . 2 In January 2002, Marvin briefed the FOMC on aspects of the research that he had presented at the Woodstock conference, as part of a session on the ZLB in which David Reifschneider and I presented our research as well. 3 By that point, the federal funds rate had fallen to 1.75 percent, so the ZLB was starting to get on policymakers’ radar screens. On those occasions, Marvin emphasized the importance of the ZLB as a constraint on policy and urged us to think differently about how central banks could still carry out their missions, even under that constraint. He developed and analyzed what were then considered “outside the box” options for overcoming the ZLB. These helped lay the groundwork for how economists and policymakers think about these issues in both conceptual and practical terms. For example, Marvin was one of the first people to think seriously about how the constraint caused by the ZLB could be relaxed by implementing negative interest rates. Now, I know that the topic of negative interest rates is controversial. But, whatever conclusions you may draw about the relative merits of negative rates, Marvin’s research early on helped identify and explore a broad dimension of issues and potential choices for policymakers. Marvin’s intellectual pursuit of all aspects of the ZLB logically drove him to explore the possibility for currency to have a digital component. Although many think of central bank digital currencies as a new-fangled idea, Marvin was thinking deeply about the prospect long ago. This has become one of the hot topics in the world of central banks today. The conversation that Marvin began in Woodstock in 1999 became the basis for discussions that were had later on at the FOMC meeting in January 2002. At that FOMC meeting, Marvin expanded upon the idea of asset purchases as a policy tool that he had proposed in his paper at the conference in Woodstock. He emphasized that the Fed asset purchases can affect financial conditions and thereby the economy. He was expanding the conversation away from thinking about conventional monetary policy to unconventional options, like the balance sheet. Importantly, he distinguished between central bank purchases of short-term government securities, as the Bank of Japan was doing at that time, versus purchases of longer-term securities. Marvin viewed purchases of short-term securities as ineffective under the ZLB, while he saw purchases of longer-duration securities as potentially powerful owing to a “preferred habitat” motive on the part of investors. Of course, large-scale asset purchases later became a tool of critical importance for easing financial conditions in the United States and abroad. Although the consequences of the predicted Y2K glitch were minimal, the ZLB became a central issue when the financial crisis hit. Thankfully, Marvin, along with others, helped lay the intellectual groundwork and created the vocabulary for us to work through some of the most significant issues facing central banks. His work is a true emblem of how researchers play a vital role in informing and shaping the policy discussion. I look forward to the upcoming conversation. Thank you.\n\nBefore I do so, it’s helpful to look back about 20 years. As the clock ticked down on the 20th century, many people’s attention was not on the ZLB. Most were more concerned about the millennium bug that had the world on high alert.\n\nTruth be told, the ZLB wasn’t perceived to be a looming problem in the United States back in 1999. The economy was doing very well and the target federal funds rate was 5-1/2 percent at the end of the year. Up until then, the only historical reference points for the ZLB were from the Great Depression of the 1930s and, more recently, Japan in the 1990s. It was simply not part of the experience of postwar Europe or the Americas.\n\nHowever, a small group of economists, with Marvin at the forefront, was asking whether the ZLB could pose a challenge here in the U.S. and, if so, what would be the consequences and potential remedies. Researchers and policymakers began to turn the dial up on the discussion around the ZLB.\n\nThe Fed held a conference in Woodstock, Vermont in October 1999 on the ZLB. 1 At that conference, Marvin presented his paper “Overcoming the Zero Bound on Interest Rate Policy,” which was subsequently published in the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking (JMCB) . 2 In January 2002, Marvin briefed the FOMC on aspects of the research that he had presented at the Woodstock conference, as part of a session on the ZLB in which David Reifschneider and I presented our research as well. 3 By that point, the federal funds rate had fallen to 1.75 percent, so the ZLB was starting to get on policymakers’ radar screens.\n\nOn those occasions, Marvin emphasized the importance of the ZLB as a constraint on policy and urged us to think differently about how central banks could still carry out their missions, even under that constraint. He developed and analyzed what were then considered “outside the box” options for overcoming the ZLB. These helped lay the groundwork for how economists and policymakers think about these issues in both conceptual and practical terms.\n\nFor example, Marvin was one of the first people to think seriously about how the constraint caused by the ZLB could be relaxed by implementing negative interest rates. Now, I know that the topic of negative interest rates is controversial. But, whatever conclusions you may draw about the relative merits of negative rates, Marvin’s research early on helped identify and explore a broad dimension of issues and potential choices for policymakers.\n\nMarvin’s intellectual pursuit of all aspects of the ZLB logically drove him to explore the possibility for currency to have a digital component. Although many think of central bank digital currencies as a new-fangled idea, Marvin was thinking deeply about the prospect long ago. This has become one of the hot topics in the world of central banks today. The conversation that Marvin began in Woodstock in 1999 became the basis for discussions that were had later on at the FOMC meeting in January 2002.

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction. I'm so pleased to be here—especially at this time of year, when the autumn colors light up the region. In fact, my wife and I have fallen in love with this area—so much so, that we are now splitting our time between Columbia County and New York City.\n\nOf course, I'm not just here as your neighbor. Part of my job as president of the New York Fed—one of the best parts—is to meet with business and community leaders from across the Federal Reserve's Second District. This gives me the opportunity to see and hear the challenges they face.\n\nAnd throughout the Second District—which includes New York State, Northern New Jersey, Southwestern Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—the issues I hear about consistently have to do with labor shortages and the skills gap. Employers can't find enough skilled workers—and workers can't obtain the skills they need to move up the economic ladder.\n\nBefore I go any further, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Struggle to Fill Jobs\n\nIn the current environment, filling jobs can be a challenge. Employers—including those here in Columbia and Greene Counties—are facing significant worker shortages.  Many are struggling to hire people, especially at the entry level—in construction, nursing, and manufacturing.\n\nThe skills gap is a big obstacle. In 2020, more than half of available job seekers in Columbia and Greene Counties had a high school diploma or less, and only a quarter had an associate degree or higher. 1 Employers, especially those in trucking and the trades, grapple with developing a pipeline of skilled workers.\n\nAn aging population is another issue. Over the past 20 years, the size of the workforce here has declined as the population has stagnated.  Residents here are older—the median age is late 40s, as opposed to late 30s for all of New York State.  In some cases, residents don't need more training—they need retraining so they can obtain new jobs.\n\nThe Jenga Tower\n\nWhenever I talk about economic prosperity, I like to use the analogy of a Jenga tower: Each piece is critical to the stability of the whole. Take one piece out, and the tower becomes unstable. Take the wrong piece out, and the whole tower can collapse.\n\nOur Jenga tower encompasses a whole host of important pieces. Job training is one. Workers need skills that employers are looking for, and job training needs to be accessible.\n\nTransportation is another. Employees need dependable transportation to get to training programs—and to their jobs.\n\nAnd broadband is sorely needed in many households. I can't tell you how many people said, \"Good luck getting broadband,\" when I told them I was buying a home in Columbia County. It's a problem that plagues rural communities throughout the Second District. 2\n\nInvesting in businesses and innovation is also an important piece of our tower. Businesses need resources to innovate so they can grow and prosper—and that, in turn, benefits entire communities.\n\nAll of you here today—representing employers, schools, nonprofits, funders, and community organizations—are key to our tower's foundation. You are what makes our tower strong.\n\nWorkforce Development Components\n\nHow do we reinforce our tower? There have been a number of initiatives—and quite a bit of research—regarding workforce development throughout the Federal Reserve System. This includes a three-volume book called Investing in America's Workforce , 3 which highlights the ways investments can overcome systemic barriers to employment. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, there are many promising efforts to learn from.\n\nThe role of community colleges cannot be overstated. A report released shortly after I came to the New York Fed showed that the typical New York State community college engages with more than 100 local employers, spanning every industry sector. 4\n\nMore recently, the New York Fed hosted an event that explored ways to advance economic prosperity in rural areas. 5 Many great insights were shared, including a framework for workforce development programs that contained four principles:\n\n1) fashioning a strategy around a community's assets;\n\n2) designing programs that are adaptable;\n\n3) including traditionally marginalized groups in decision-making; and\n\n4) bringing together community, business, and government leaders—like you are doing today.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeveloping career-building programs that meet the needs of local employers and are accessible to job seekers is critical to bridging the skills gap. Collaboration is a key component of any successful program. By joining together, we can advance the economic resilience of rural areas like Columbia and Greene Counties—and strengthen our Jenga tower.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank  you for the kind introduction. Hello, from my apartment in Manhattan. It’s a  pleasure to be able to join you today, even under these extraordinary  circumstances. I hope that wherever you are watching, you and your loved ones  are safe and well.\n\nThe  outbreak of the coronavirus and the global pandemic have created an  unprecedented situation. Today, I want to talk about what that means for the  economy and financial markets, and how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  and the Federal Reserve System as a whole, are responding to the challenges  before us. My colleagues and I are dedicated to doing everything within our  power to support the functioning of financial markets and help put the economy  on a strong footing once this crisis is behind us.\n\nBefore  I continue, let me give the Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine  alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee  or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe  coronavirus pandemic has created circumstances we have never experienced before  in our lifetimes. There’s hardly a community in the world that remains  unaffected. I want to emphasize that this is first and foremost a public health  crisis, and a human tragedy. It’s our doctors, nurses, and healthcare  professionals who are on the front lines, fighting this disease and caring for  those who are suffering. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. My sincere  thanks is also with the grocery store workers, those in law enforcement and  transportation, and everyone who continues to carry out essential work each  day.\n\nThe Scale of the Challenge\n\nThe necessary  actions taken to slow and contain the spread of the coronavirus are not only  changing how we live our lives, but are also having a profound effect on the economy  and financial markets, both here and abroad.\n\nAlthough  many people have drawn comparisons with the financial crisis of 2008, the  current turmoil is fundamentally different from recessions of the past. The  challenges before us do not stem from vulnerabilities at banks or the bursting  of a bubble—I can only liken them to a natural disaster of global proportions.\n\nIf  we look back to February, the American economy was strong, with unemployment at  historical lows. But, now, social distancing and other restrictions imposed in  response to the pandemic are causing severe, rapid declines in jobs and income.  Unprecedented numbers have filed for unemployment insurance in the past several  weeks alone, and we know that more economic pain is still to come. The reality  is that the full scale of the economic consequences is still unknown.\n\nThe  economic distress and the extraordinary uncertainty about the future course of  the pandemic have set off a tidal wave of flows of money away from riskier investments  to the safety of cash. This sudden shift led to an evaporation of liquidity and  breakdowns in the functioning of key financial markets. This includes the  market for U.S. Treasury securities, the cornerstone of the global financial  system. These developments, if left unchecked, threaten to starve our economy  of the credit that it badly needs during this difficult time.\n\nThe Response\n\nLast  month, as the risks posed by the coronavirus became increasingly apparent, the  Federal Reserve took swift and decisive action to support the economy and  stabilize financial markets. In two unscheduled meetings in the first half of  March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) quickly brought the target  range for the federal funds rate to near zero. 1 The FOMC also signaled that  it expects to keep interest rates at this level until it is confident that the  economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve the Fed’s maximum  employment and price stability goals. 2\n\nThese  monetary policy actions serve two purposes. First, low interest rates make it  easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing needs during this  time of economic stress. Second, they foster broader financial conditions that  will help promote the rebound in spending and investment needed to return the  economy to full strength.\n\nThe New York Fed\n\nThe  New York Fed has important and unique responsibilities in supporting liquid and  well-functioning financial markets. Working alongside our colleagues in the  Federal Reserve and other agencies, we are taking rapid and significant actions  to supply liquidity and to stabilize critical parts of our financial system. We  are conducting large-scale repo operations to assure ample liquidity in money  markets. 3 In addition, at the  direction of the FOMC, we are purchasing sizable quantities of U.S. Treasury  securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities to  improve functioning in these critical markets. 4 To put the current  situation in context, we are running more open market operations, for greater  sums, than at any time in our history. 5\n\nThe  Federal Reserve is also making liquidity available to key intermediaries to  support market functioning and to keep credit flowing. These actions include  offering term loans to depository institutions through the traditional discount  window, and the establishment of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the  Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. 6\n\nThese  strong and timely actions averted a potential shutdown in the flow of credit  and are providing funding and stability at a time of extraordinary volatility  in markets. Although stresses in financial markets will not entirely abate  until the pandemic is behind us, we have seen material improvements in measures  of liquidity and market functioning in key parts of the U.S. financial system.\n\nOur  work is not done. The Federal Reserve is also standing up programs to support  the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments,  so that they can weather this storm and continue to do their work, both now and  when normal life resumes. 7 Last week, we announced more  details on these programs, which altogether provide additional funding of up to  $2.3 trillion. 8 These programs are executed with the full support of the Treasury. We are also  deeply committed to providing transparency around matters such as usage,  eligibility, governance, vendor selection, and fees for these programs.\n\nThe  actions by the Federal Reserve, while sharing some similarities with those  undertaken during the financial crisis, are specifically designed to deal with  the unique economic challenges posed by the coronavirus.\n\nOur  efforts supporting the provision of credit include a number of programs aimed  at different parts of the economy and work through different channels. One set  of programs supports the availability of credit to businesses—importantly,  including small and medium-sized businesses—through loans, commercial paper,  and corporate bonds. The second set of programs targets the availability of  credit to states and municipalities.\n\nBut  we cannot act alone: fiscal policy is also playing a critically important role.  In particular, it can do what monetary policy cannot: provide for the public  health response and transfer income to those most affected by the outbreak. Fiscal  policy is also a vital partner in the delivery of our own programs, supplying  the financial support necessary for the extraordinary scale of the credit  facilities we’re operating.\n\nAn International Response\n\nThe  Federal Reserve is not unique in taking bold actions. Central banks around the  world are working to support their economies and stabilize their financial  systems. There has been close alignment at the international level about the  monetary policy and other actions needed to tackle this period of extraordinary  economic pain. Given the central role of the dollar in the global economy, the  FOMC has instituted new and enhanced programs to facilitate the ability of  other central banks to provide U.S. dollar funding in their countries. 9\n\nBold Action\n\nThe  economy is under distress in ways we’ve not experienced in our lifetimes. At  the New York Fed we are working tirelessly—leveraging our experience, expertise,  and ingenuity—to address the economic and financial challenges posed by the  pandemic. This crisis requires innovative thinking and bold action. My colleagues  and I are dedicated to doing our utmost to lessen the impact of the crisis on  families and businesses in our communities, and to restore our nation’s  economic prosperity as quickly as possible.\n\nRelated Content",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank  you for the kind introduction. It’s a great pleasure to be here today and a  huge honor to be joining the board of the Economic Club of New York. This  institution has been an essential forum for debate for many decades, and I  sincerely hope today will be no exception.\n\nI’m  going to start with a spoiler: At a certain point during this speech I will  talk about interest rates. I imagine that if I don’t, you’ll feel you’ve been  shortchanged. So before I get going, I’ll give the usual Fed disclaimer that  the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nR-star\n\nNow  that’s out of the way, I want to take you back a long time ago, to a galaxy far,  far away. It’s 2001: Destiny’s Child is topping the charts, you were marveling  over your Motorola flip phone, and I was a young economist at the Board of  Governors in Washington, D.C. At the time, I was burning the midnight oil, along  with a fellow economist, Thomas Laubach, trying to understand what the burst of  productivity growth generated by the tech boom meant for interest rates, both  in the short term and in the long run. This led us to develop a model for  measuring r-star.\n\nI  know what’s going through your mind: “What  is this r-star that you speak of?” R-star is how economists describe the  neutral or natural rate of interest. It’s the rate that we expect to prevail in  the long run when interest rates are neither providing a boost to the economy  nor trying to cool things down. It’s neither accommodative, nor contractionary.  In other words, it’s the “normal” interest rate we expect in “normal” economic  times.\n\nG-star\n\nOne  of the major factors determining r-star is… you guessed it, g-star! G-star is what  economists mean when they describe trend growth, sustainable growth, or  potential growth of the economy. The two main drivers of g-star are labor force  growth and productivity growth.\n\nWe  started trying to understand where r-star was when productivity growth was very  high. During the boom GDP growth averaged over 4 percent per year. Our estimate  of r-star for that time was above 3 percent, a full percentage point higher  than before the tech boom started.\n\nGiven  that this research was originally focused on the reasons r-star had risen, it’s  ironic that I and others have ultimately dedicated much more of our careers to  understanding why it’s dropped. In recent years, r-star has been averaging well  below 1 percent. And it’s actually now lower than at any time before the Great  Recession.\n\nOne  of the reasons for this dramatic decline in r-star lies in changes to the major  factors determining potential growth: labor force growth and productivity  growth.\n\nBaby  boomers are retiring and fertility rates have come down. Both of these  demographic shifts have significantly slowed labor force growth relative to  past decades.\n\nProductivity  growth has also fallen considerably from the boom years of the late 1990s and  early 2000s. All the rapid changes in technology that we see around us every  day may make this seem counterintuitive. But for the moment, being able to  order a Nintendo Switch and have it arrive the same day is, shockingly , not increasing productivity  in a meaningful way. I could go on for quite some time on this topic, but will  leave it to another day!\n\nI  should note that these demographic and productivity trends are not unique to the  United States. In fact, we’ve seen similar slowdowns in growth and sharp  declines in r-star in other advanced economies. 1\n\nSo  why did I take you back to simple days of the millennium bug, when you were  playing Snake on your phone and ordering takeout from a paper menu?\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nUnderstanding  the fundamentals driving g-star and r-star provides a helpful backdrop for  what’s going on in the economy today, and an indication of what we should  expect in the future.\n\nWhat  is the current economic outlook?\n\nThe  potential growth rate, or g-star, currently appears to be about 2 percent. That  may sound low to many of you, but remember that labor force and productivity  trends have slowed considerably relative to the past, and that’s unlikely to  change anytime soon.\n\nBy comparison,  actual GDP growth for 2018 came in at just above 3 percent. A number of  positive tailwinds gave the economy this extra boost. Strong global growth, fiscal  stimulus, and accommodative financial conditions all helped drive strong  headline GDP growth and a tight labor market.\n\nThese  tailwinds have calmed, and in fact reversed in some cases, and I expect growth  to slow considerably relative to last year, to around 2 percent. Three developments  contribute to this view: a downturn in global growth, heightened geopolitical  uncertainty, and the effects of tighter financial conditions.\n\nStarting  with global growth, the outlook in both Europe and China has become less bright,  with the downgrade to the outlook in Europe notable. This means less demand for  our exports.\n\nIn  addition, there’s geopolitical risk on the horizon that’s creating angst. I  know we’re all on tenterhooks waiting to see what will happen at the end of  this month to our good friends across the pond. And concerns around trade  negotiations continue to loom large. These geopolitical risks leave an imprint  on the economy as businesses put off hiring and investment decisions until the  air has cleared.\n\nMoving  away from the global context, back to the United States, the tightening of  financial conditions that occurred late last year will likely restrain consumer  and business spending this year. In fact, we have already seen a sustained  slowing in housing construction, in part reflecting less favorable financing  costs.\n\nNow,  I know this talk of slowing growth is causing uncertainty, some hand-wringing,  and even fear of recession. But slower growth shouldn’t necessarily come as a  surprise. For quite some time, the economic fundamentals have pointed to GDP  growth much lower than what we saw in the 1990s, for example.\n\nIn  fact, my 2 percent growth forecast is right in line with g-star. That means  slower growth isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. Instead, it’s the “new normal”  we should expect. And, it’s important to remember that this is happening at a  time when the labor market is very strong.\n\nFrom  the perspective of monetary policy, the overall picture of the economy is about  as good as it gets: very low unemployment, sustainable growth, and inflation  just about at our 2 percent goal.\n\nGiven  this favorable situation, when you look at monetary policy, things are looking  pretty normal as well. My current estimate for r-star is 0.5 percent, so when  you adjust for inflation that’s near 2 percent, the current federal funds rate  of 2.4 percent puts us right at neutral.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold?\n\nSo what  does the future hold?\n\nWith  a strong labor market, moderate growth, and no sign of any significant inflationary  pressures, the baseline outlook is quite favorable, as I’ve said.\n\nOf  course, there are a number of different scenarios that could play out over the  year ahead. Geopolitical uncertainty and other factors holding back growth may  recede, and the U.S. economy could resume the robust trajectory of last year.  Or GDP growth could continue closer to trend, which is my own forecast.  Finally, there’s always a chance that downside risks could knock GDP growth off  course.\n\nWhat  will the response of the Fed be? My short answer: It depends!\n\nI  promised talk of interest rates, and here it is. I’ve said it before, and no  doubt, I’ll say it as long as I work for a central bank. But in the current  conditions the phrase takes on even more importance. Our response will always be  “data dependent.”\n\nWhen  growth is well above trend, raising interest rates to keep the economy on a  sustainable path is the right decision. Equally, when faced with a crisis like  the Great Recession, it’s incumbent upon policy makers to use every tool at  their disposal to get the economy back on course.\n\nThe base  case outlook is looking good, but various uncertainties continue to loom large.  Therefore, we can afford to be flexible and wait for the data to guide our  approach. In that context, the FOMC decided to keep interest rates where they  were at the most recent meeting, and noted the importance of patience in  determining future policy actions.\n\nTo  use a nautical metaphor, guiding the U.S. economy is like steering a large ship.  Monetary policy decisions can leave a wake several miles long, with  implications that reach far into the future. We’ll consider the full range of  data, the headline statistics, the market indicators, and we’ll listen to our  business contacts on the ground, as we aim to keep the economy on its current  course of a strong labor market, sustainable growth, and 2 percent inflation.\n\nConclusion\n\nR-star  provides a helpful framework, not just for thinking about monetary policy, but also  for understanding the current progress of GDP growth and its likely trajectory  over the coming years.\n\nModerate  growth, both in the U.S. and the global economy, is far less alarming when you know  what the underlying factors might be. And all the signs have been pointing to a  slower growth trend. You may have had Destiny’s Child—Beyoncé—turned up too  loud to spot the signs, but they have certainly been there.\n\nSlow  trend growth and low r-star in the current global context presents certain challenges  to monetary policy, another topic for a future day. In everything that we do,  we need to consider all the information, and exercise data dependence and  flexibility, as we navigate the course ahead.",

    "text": "It’s an honor to be kicking off Bronx Week, and I’d like to thank Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr., for the kind invitation. I first visited the Bronx—and first met Ruben—back in November, when I also spent time with students discussing their plans for the future. I was particularly impressed by their talent, energy, and enthusiasm, which is a true reflection of this vibrant and proud community. Today I’m going to share some brief remarks on the national and global economy. I’ll then discuss what that means for monetary policy today and going forward. For me, the most interesting part of this event is hearing and responding to your questions, so please, don’t be shy when I open the floor for discussion. I’ve warned you that monetary policy is on the agenda, so before I go any further, I have to give the usual Fed disclaimer that everything I say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. The U.S. Economy With that out of the way, let me start by saying the U.S. economy is in a very good place. Late last year, as the long, dark winter closed in, there were considerable jitters in financial markets, with some observers fretting that the economy may be on the verge of a hard landing. Indeed, there was a lot of talk about the possibility of a recession looming. I am happy to report that the economy has emerged from the New York freeze. The sun is out, the tulips and the cherry blossom are now in full bloom and the picture of the economy is similarly rosy. In the first four months of the year, the U.S. economy added over 800,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate is now 3.6 percent—the lowest level in nearly 50 years. The latest GDP numbers indicate that the economy remained in high gear through the first quarter, with growth clocking in at an impressive 3.2 percent annual rate. Despite this very strong economy, we are not seeing any signs of inflationary pressures. In fact, the latest inflation data have come in lower than expected, with core inflation over the past 12 months dipping to 1.6 percent. Now, most people don’t seem that bothered by inflation that is a touch too low, but at the Federal Reserve we have set a long-run inflation goal of 2 percent. When inflation runs persistently above or below that goal, we take that very seriously. So far, the recent downward movement appears mostly to reflect normal volatility in inflation statistics. For example, if you look at my preferred measure of underlying inflation, called trimmed-mean inflation—which removes the most volatile price movements—it’s been running at 2 percent. This measure of inflation hasn’t shown any signs of trending up or down. That said, I will be watching developments closely for signs of a persistent shift away from our 2 percent long-run goal. As I mentioned, the economy started the year with a lot of momentum. But there are reasons to believe that the surge in growth won’t persist through the remainder of the year. Taking into account of all the indicators we follow, I anticipate a step-down of economic growth, from the 3 percent growth recorded last year to a still-solid pace of about 2-1/4 percent in 2019. This is good news. It’s above the economy’s underlying potential, but not unsustainably so. Healthy economic growth should in turn fuel solid job gains, higher wages for workers, and some further declines in unemployment. The strong economy and labor market should also support inflation returning to 2 percent, the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal. The Global Picture In addition to the positive data we’ve been getting for the U.S., we’ve also seen encouraging signs that risks from global economic and financial markets are abating. Last year there were worries that the global growth slowdown centered in China and Europe would spill over onto our shores. This was one factor contributing to a more downbeat assessment of U.S. growth and the stock market sell-off. Since then, we’ve seen more positive readings on China’s economy, in part due to steps the authorities have taken to reignite growth. And financial markets have definitely rebounded from their winter doldrums. Still, we’re not entirely out of the woods regarding risks from a global growth slowdown. Signs of weakness in Japan, South Korea, and some regions of Europe continue, so I am particularly vigilant about monitoring the international data. Trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty regarding Brexit continue to present downside risks. Monetary Policy What does this mean for monetary policy? At last week’s meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, between 2-1/4 and 2-1/2 percent. We also reiterated our patient approach to assessing the need to adjust interest rates in the future. In a nutshell: The economy remains on a path of healthy growth, with a very strong labor market and without the emergence of inflationary pressures. The current setting of policy positions us well to keep it that way. Although my view that we are in the right place in terms of monetary policy has not changed of late, the reasons for it have evolved in line with the economic and financial developments I sketched out earlier in my remarks. The strength of recent data on economic activity, the rebound of growth in China, and the reversal in the tightening of financial markets all imply that near-term risks to growth have receded somewhat. This has increased my confidence that the economy remains on track for moderate growth going forward. At the same time, recent price data reaffirm that inflationary pressures remain muted. Conclusion Looking ahead, although the baseline forecast I laid out looks very good, the situation can change. We need to remain vigilant in responding to evolving economic conditions and the outlook, with our eye on sustaining the expansion, keeping the labor market strong, and fostering price stability. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\n\nToday I’m going to share some brief remarks on the national and global economy. I’ll then discuss what that means for monetary policy today and going forward. For me, the most interesting part of this event is hearing and responding to your questions, so please, don’t be shy when I open the floor for discussion. I’ve warned you that monetary policy is on the agenda, so before I go any further, I have to give the usual Fed disclaimer that everything I say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. The U.S. Economy With that out of the way, let me start by saying the U.S. economy is in a very good place. Late last year, as the long, dark winter closed in, there were considerable jitters in financial markets, with some observers fretting that the economy may be on the verge of a hard landing. Indeed, there was a lot of talk about the possibility of a recession looming. I am happy to report that the economy has emerged from the New York freeze. The sun is out, the tulips and the cherry blossom are now in full bloom and the picture of the economy is similarly rosy. In the first four months of the year, the U.S. economy added over 800,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate is now 3.6 percent—the lowest level in nearly 50 years. The latest GDP numbers indicate that the economy remained in high gear through the first quarter, with growth clocking in at an impressive 3.2 percent annual rate. Despite this very strong economy, we are not seeing any signs of inflationary pressures. In fact, the latest inflation data have come in lower than expected, with core inflation over the past 12 months dipping to 1.6 percent. Now, most people don’t seem that bothered by inflation that is a touch too low, but at the Federal Reserve we have set a long-run inflation goal of 2 percent. When inflation runs persistently above or below that goal, we take that very seriously. So far, the recent downward movement appears mostly to reflect normal volatility in inflation statistics. For example, if you look at my preferred measure of underlying inflation, called trimmed-mean inflation—which removes the most volatile price movements—it’s been running at 2 percent. This measure of inflation hasn’t shown any signs of trending up or down. That said, I will be watching developments closely for signs of a persistent shift away from our 2 percent long-run goal. As I mentioned, the economy started the year with a lot of momentum. But there are reasons to believe that the surge in growth won’t persist through the remainder of the year.

Trade tensions and ongoing uncertainty regarding Brexit continue to present downside risks. Monetary Policy What does this mean for monetary policy?

In a nutshell: The economy remains on a path of healthy growth, with a very strong labor market and without the emergence of inflationary pressures. The current setting of policy positions us well to keep it that way. Although my view that we are in the right place in terms of monetary policy has not changed of late, the reasons for it have evolved in line with the economic and financial developments I sketched out earlier in my remarks.

We need to remain vigilant in responding to evolving economic conditions and the outlook, with our eye on sustaining the expansion, keeping the labor market strong, and fostering price stability. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\n\nThis is good news. It’s above the economy’s underlying potential, but not unsustainably so. Healthy economic growth should in turn fuel solid job gains, higher wages for workers, and some further declines in unemployment. The strong economy and labor market should also support inflation returning to 2 percent, the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal. The Global Picture In addition to the positive data we’ve been getting for the U.S., we’ve also seen encouraging signs that risks from global economic and financial markets are abating. Last year there were worries that the global growth slowdown centered in China and Europe would spill over onto our shores. This was one factor contributing to a more downbeat assessment of U.S. growth and the stock market sell-off. Since then, we’ve seen more positive readings on China’s economy, in part due to steps the authorities have taken to reignite growth.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIt's an honor to serve as chair of the Economic Club of New York. I  am proud of the Club's continuing role as a preeminent forum for both in-person and virtual discussions of the most urgent issues facing  this city and the world today.\n\nEarlier this month, we celebrated the Club's 115th  anniversary at an in-person gathering. Today is a good day to host a virtual  event. That way, you can enjoy your Thanksgiving leftovers at home while I  speak.\n\nIn my remarks, I'll address the No. 1 economic concern across the  globe: inflation. Inflation is far too high, and persistently high inflation  undermines the ability of our economy to perform at its full potential. The  Federal Reserve is mandated by Congress to achieve price stability and maximum  employment, and the two sides of this dual mandate are closely related. Price  stability is essential to achieving maximum employment over the long term.\n\nThe problem of inflation is clear, but how it evolved and what it  portends is more complex. One way I've been thinking  about it is through an analogy that I've been calling \"the inflation onion.\" 1 While onions may not have been the focus of  your Thanksgiving table, they can be found in many dishes. So, I'll give them  the spotlight for the next few minutes and explain the layered features of  inflation, why high inflation emerged last year, and how it is evolving. I'll  also share why I am confident that the Federal Reserve's actions will restore  price stability.\n\nBefore we get into that, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer  that the views I express today are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect  those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nInflation's  Impact\n\nI'll start by highlighting the immense impact that rising  inflation has on families and businesses. The FOMC has set a 2 percent longer-run  goal for inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price  index. This level of inflation is deemed most consistent with the Fed's price  stability and maximum employment mandates. 2\n\nFor the three decades preceding the pandemic, the inflation rate  averaged almost exactly 2 percent. But that changed dramatically last spring,  when inflation suddenly soared to 40-year highs. It's been elevated for the  past several months and currently stands at over 6 percent.\n\nA trip to the supermarket or gas pump will tell you the rest of the  story. But the pain is not felt equally. The data show that those who can least  afford the rise in costs for food, housing, and transportation suffer the most. 3 The priority for monetary policy is clear. The Federal Reserve is strongly  committed to bringing inflation back down to its 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nAn  Allium Analogy\n\nThere are many sources of high inflation, and they are not unique  to the United States. In fact, nearly all economies across the globe are  experiencing unusually high rates of inflation. To better understand the root  of high inflation and what it means for the future, I will start to peel the  \"inflation onion\" that I mentioned earlier.\n\nIn this allium analogy, there are three distinct layers. The outermost  layer consists of prices of globally traded commodities—such as lumber, steel,  grains, and oil. When the global economy rebounded from the pandemic recession,  there was a surge in demand for these critical goods, leading to sizable  imbalances between supply and demand and large price increases. Then, energy and  many commodity prices soared again as a result of Russia's war on Ukraine and  consequent actions. Skyrocketing commodity prices led to higher costs for  producers, which in turn got passed on as higher prices for consumers.\n\nThe middle layer of the inflation onion is made up of  products—especially durable goods like appliances, furniture, and cars—that  have experienced both strong demand and severe supply-chain disruptions. There were  not enough inputs to manufacture products, which meant not enough products to  sell—all at a time when demand has been sky-high. This imbalance contributed to  outsize price increases.\n\nIf we continue paring the onion, we'll reach the innermost layer:  underlying inflation. This layer is the most challenging of the three,  reflecting the overall balance between supply and demand in the economy and the  labor market. Prices for services have been rising at a fast clip. Measures of the  cost of shelter, in particular, have increased briskly, as an earlier surge  of rents for new leases filtered through the market. And widespread labor  shortages have led to higher labor costs. And this is not limited to a few  sectors—inflation pressures have become broad-based.\n\nA  Multilayered Reality\n\nWhen examining where all these inflationary layers stand today, we  are seeing a multilayered reality. So, what can we expect to see in the future?\n\nI'll start with the outer layer, where there have been positive  developments that point to some relief on this front. The prices of commodities  have come way down from peaks reached earlier this year. Absent further disruptions  to supply, I expect that slowing global growth, in part reflecting tighter  monetary policy here and abroad, will continue to reduce demand for these  products, putting downward pressure on their prices.\n\nCore goods prices that make up the middle layer have yet to come  down from elevated levels, as demand continues to outstrip supply. But there  are signs that this is changing.\n\nFor one, we've seen significant improvement in global supply chains.  Unlike last year, there are no longer ships stalled at ports in California. The  Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, developed by economists at the New York  Fed, shows that global supply chain disruptions soared to unprecedented levels late  last year. Since then, this index has retraced about three quarters of that  rise, and I expect improvements in global supply chains to continue. 4\n\nWe have also seen wholesale used auto prices decline by more than 15  percent since the start of the year, and these decreases are starting to pass  through to consumer prices. New auto inventories are slowly edging back up,  which should in turn bring relief to new car prices. Overall, the combination  of waning global demand, improving supply, and falling import prices from the  strong dollar points to slowing core goods inflation going forward.\n\nHowever, lower commodity prices and receding supply-chain issues will  not be enough to get inflation back to our 2 percent inflation goal—it's the  innermost layer where the hard work lies. Overall demand for labor and services  still far exceeds available supply, resulting in broad-based inflation, which  will take longer to bring back down.\n\nThat said, a few forward-looking indicators paint a more  encouraging picture. Growth in rents for new leases has slowed sharply  recently, implying that average rent growth and housing shelter price inflation  should turn back down. We're also seeing some signs that the heat of the labor  market is starting to cool, with quits and job openings declining from the high  levels of the spring, along with indicators of slowing wage growth.\n\nThe  FOMC's Policy Actions\n\nBut there is still more work to do. This brings me to the FOMC's  strong, decisive policy actions in support of our steadfast commitment to price  stability.\n\nTo help bring demand back to levels consistent with supply, and thereby  bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal, the FOMC  raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 3-3/4 to 4 percent at our meeting  earlier this month, the sixth consecutive increase. 5 The FOMC statement indicated that \"the Committee anticipates that  ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a  stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation  to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target  range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of  monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity  and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the FOMC continues  reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency  mortgage-backed securities.\" 6\n\nMany other  central banks are focused on taking strong steps to reduce inflation in their  economies as well. One concern that has arisen is that large and rapid shifts  in monetary policy across the globe could contribute to stresses and expose  vulnerabilities in global financial markets. And heightened uncertainty can add  to market volatility, resulting in diminished market liquidity. For example,  measures of liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market have declined this year, but  this is largely in line with the historical relationship between volatility and  liquidity. Importantly, Treasury and funding markets continue to function well,  effectively transmitting monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\n\nBecause many  of the sources of inflation are global, these policy actions from around the  world should alleviate supply-chain issues, speed the  process of restoring balance to global supply and demand, and reduce global inflationary  pressures.\n\nThere are  other factors that work in our favor too. The Fed's commitment to achieving and  sustaining 2 percent inflation as a bedrock principle has no doubt had a  positive effect on the public's inflation expectations. 7 The transparency about our objectives provides a \"North Star\" for policy  decisions and improves the public's understanding about our goals and actions.\n\nThe benefits  are evident in the stability of longer-run inflation expectations. Even during  the current period of high and volatile inflation, longer-run inflation  expectations in the United States are very well anchored in the past year and a  half. They are at levels broadly consistent with the FOMC's longer-run goal.  Although inflation uncertainty has increased, it does not appear to be due to  unmoored longer-run expectations. 8\n\nEconomic  Outlook\n\nWe are already  seeing some of the effects of tighter monetary policy. Broad measures of  financial conditions, including borrowing and mortgage rates and equity prices,  have become significantly less supportive of spending. This has led to a  decline in activity in the housing market and signs of general slowing in  consumer expenditures and business investment spending. As this continues, I  expect real GDP to increase only modestly this year and in 2023.\n\nThe labor market remains remarkably  tight: Hiring is robust, and we still are seeing rapid wage gains. But with  growth slowing, I anticipate that the unemployment rate will climb from its current  level of 3.7 percent to between 4-1/2 and 5 percent by the end of next year.\n\nTurning to  inflation, I expect cooling global demand and steady supply improvements to  result in declining inflation for goods that rely heavily on commodities, as  well as for those that have been heavily affected by supply chain bottlenecks.  These factors should contribute importantly to inflation slowing from its  current rate to between 5 and 5-1/2 percent at the end of this year, and to slow  further to between 3 and 3-1/2 percent for next year.\n\nBringing down underlying inflation—the inner layer of the  inflation onion—will take longer. But further tightening of monetary policy should  help restore balance between demand and supply and bring inflation back to 2  percent over the next few years.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to the complicated nature of inflation and assessing  the economic outlook, it's important to know your onions. Tighter monetary  policy has begun to cool demand and reduce inflationary pressures. It will take  some time, but I am fully confident we will return to a sustained period of  price stability.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood evening. I’m pleased to see my fellow economists and  colleagues enjoying a long summer evening in the city in the best way  possible—indoors and prepared for a robust discussion on the economic outlook.\n\nI’ve been looking forward to this conversation for some time. But  before we turn to the discussion and Q&A, I’d like to take a few minutes at  the start of the program to share my assessment of recent economic data and how  it’s informing my outlook for the economy. Particularly, I’ll explain what the  data are telling us in light of economic uncertainty, and how I expect the  effects of tariffs to take shape.\n\nNow is when I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views  I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSoft  Data/Hard Data\n\nYou all read the news and are familiar with the facts and figures.  The changing landscape around trade policy has heightened economic uncertainty  among households, businesses, and financial market participants. The response  to these developments and the associated uncertainty has led to interesting and  sometimes contrasting dynamics in both the soft data and hard data.\n\nSoft data, such as the regional business surveys conducted by the  New York Fed, have highlighted an elevated degree of uncertainty about the  economic outlook over the past few months. All told,  concerns about tariffs have been widespread, resulting in a reported pullback  on capital spending.\n\nSimilarly, our national Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)  shows that consumers’ uncertainty along a number of dimensions remains elevated  as well, leading many households to scale back on their expected spending  growth on nonessential items. 1 In  addition, survey respondents report that their uncertainty about future  inflation remains elevated.\n\nBut some soft data have provided more encouraging news. For  example, in the SCE, longer-run inflation expectations have remained stable, while  short- and medium-term inflation expectations have returned to their  pre-pandemic ranges. This is critically important, because well-anchored  inflation expectations are essential for sustained price stability.\n\nNow I’ll turn to some hard data. And by these measures, the U.S.  economy remains in a good place.\n\nReal GDP growth data have been unusually noisy, largely reflecting  effects from the front-running of tariffs earlier this year. That said, the  data are suggesting that economic growth has slowed relative to last year’s  pace.\n\nAll of this data—both hard and soft—feed into my assessment of how  the economy is faring with regard to the Fed’s dual mandate goals of maximum  employment and price stability.\n\nOn the employment front, the most recent data show a solid labor  market, as demonstrated by measures of unemployment, employment, vacancies,  hiring, and quits. Job growth is slowing, but so is labor supply, owing to  lower immigration. Overall, labor supply and demand are well balanced and there  are no signs that the labor market is adding inflationary pressures.\n\nWith regard to price stability, inflation has continued on a gradual, albeit bumpy downward path toward our 2 percent longer-run goal. Based on my reading of the June CPI and PPI data, I estimate that the 12-month percent change in headline PCE inflation in June will be about 2-1/2 percent, and core inflation will be about 2-3/4 percent.\n\nThe  Effects of Tariffs\n\nI often say that I look at the totality of the data to track  underlying trends and evolving conditions. So, in addition to closely watching  the data and trends that I just mentioned, I’ve been keenly watching the  effects of tariffs on the prices of goods and services.\n\nOne question comes up a lot these days: “All we hear about is  tariffs, tariffs, tariffs. But then why hasn’t inflation gone up?”\n\nTo answer this question, you need to dig into the details of how  tariffs affect prices, and that means getting into the data at a more granular  level.\n\nWe are seeing initial effects of tariff increases on core  goods prices. Specifically, for items that are more exposed to higher  tariffs—household appliances, musical instruments, luggage, tableware—price  increases so far this year have been well above what one would expect based on  past trends. Using granular import price data and linkages measured through  input-output tables, we can see if these patterns occur broadly across  categories of goods and services. 2 And  in fact, there is a positive relationship between a category’s exposure to  tariffs and its price increase to date this year relative to its prior trend.\n\nIt's important to note that it’s still early days for the effects  of tariffs, which take time to come into full force. Combining enacted and  announced tariffs, estimates of the resulting average effective tariff rate  range somewhere between 15 and 20 percent. But actual tariffs in effect in  recent months were much smaller than that, as seen by the amount of tariff  revenue collected each month. Net tariff receipts as a share of imports rose  from about 2-1/4 percent in the first three months of the year to about 8  percent in May.\n\nOn top of that, it takes time for the tariff increases to pass  through to domestic prices. In particular, businesses and consumers bought  imported goods in droves in anticipation of the higher tariff rates, likely delaying  their effects on domestic prices.\n\nNonetheless, businesses are very focused on tariffs and say that  they expect to respond by increasing prices. A special New York Fed survey of  businesses indicates that firms passed on at least some of the higher tariffs  to their customers, with nearly a third of manufacturers and about 45 percent  of service firms fully passing along all tariff-induced cost increases by  raising their prices. 3\n\nAll in all, although we are only seeing relatively modest effects  of tariffs in the hard aggregate data so far, I expect those effects to  increase in coming months. Overall, I expect tariffs to boost inflation by  about 1 percentage point over the second half of this year and the first part  of next year.\n\nAnother element to the inflation outlook is that the lower foreign  exchange value of the dollar we have seen this year likely will add somewhat to  inflationary pressure going forward.\n\nWe won’t know exactly the magnitude or timing of how these various  factors will play out until we see more data. That’s why I’ll continue to be  vigilant and monitor prices and broad movements over time to best assess  evolving conditions.\n\nMonetary  Policy\n\nThe combination of continued uncertainty, a solid labor market,  and inflation still above our 2 percent goal led the FOMC to decide to leave  the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent  at its most recent meeting last month. 4\n\nMaintaining this modestly restrictive stance of monetary policy is  entirely appropriate to achieve our maximum employment and price stability  goals. It allows for time to closely analyze incoming data, assess the evolving  outlook, and evaluate the balance of risks to achieving our dual mandate goals.\n\nIn addition, the FOMC continues to reduce its holdings of Treasury  securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. That process  continues to go very smoothly.\n\nThe  Economic Outlook\n\nI’ll conclude my remarks with the question that likely brought you  all here this evening. What is my outlook for the economy?\n\nGiven all the uncertainty, a number of outcomes are possible. But  based on what the data tell us today, I expect uncertainty and tariffs to  restrain spending and reduced immigration to slow labor force growth. As a  result, I expect real GDP growth this year to be about 1 percent.\n\nWith this slowdown in growth, I expect the unemployment rate to  rise to around 4-1/2 percent by the end of this year. I anticipate inflation will come in between 3 and 3-1/2 percent in 2025, and then fall back to about 2-1/2 percent  next year before reaching 2 percent in 2027.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the summer progresses and we look toward the remainder of the  year and beyond, I’ll remain focused on all of the data—the soft data  from surveys, the hard data we see in the real GDP growth and consumer  spending, and tariffs’ effects on goods and services—and what it ultimately means  for the achievement of our dual mandate goals.\n\nThere’s definitively heightened uncertainty about the path of the  economy, but it’s too early to say what the trajectory of the hard data will  be. No matter what the future holds, I am committed to supporting maximum  employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nThank you for hosting me this evening. I look forward to your  questions.",

We are so pleased to be co-hosting this conference with the Bretton  Woods Committee.\n\nMy remarks today will focus on the  economic picture in the United States, including the monetary policy actions we  are taking and my outlook for the economy. Before I go further, I need to give  the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and  do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate, set  by Congress, to achieve maximum employment and price stability. We are doing  well on the employment side of the mandate. The unemployment rate has been  below 4 percent for the past 21 months. That’s the longest stretch since the  1960s. And it’s in line with my 3-3/4 percent estimate of the unemployment rate  expected to prevail in the economy in the longer run.\n\nBut the imbalances between supply and  demand that have persisted since the onset of the pandemic have contributed to unacceptably  high inflation. As measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  price index, inflation surged to a 40-year high of just over 7 percent in June  of last year. Since then, we have seen the inflation rate fall to 3 percent. This is a  significant and welcome decline. Nonetheless, inflation is still too high.\n\nPrice stability is the bedrock upon  which our economic prosperity stands and is essential to ensure maximum  employment over the long term. The FOMC is committed to returning inflation to  its 2 percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.\n\nThe Inflation Onion\n\nTo understand  why inflation rose so much and why it’s moderating, I’ve been using the metaphor  of an onion for the past year. 1 Each layer  represents a different sector of the economy.\n\nThe outermost layer of our inflation onion  represents globally traded commodities. As demand for commodities soared at the  onset of the pandemic, inflation surged, then rose again when Russia invaded  Ukraine. By late June of last year, food price inflation had increased to over 10  percent, and energy price inflation had skyrocketed to over 40 percent.\n\nOver the past year, global demand has  come into better balance with supply, thanks in part to restrictive monetary policy  from many central banks around the world. Commodity price inflation has come  down significantly. Food price inflation has dropped to about  2-1/2 percent—even the  cost of a Thanksgiving dinner was cheaper than a year ago. 2 And energy prices have been falling over the past year, pulling down the  overall inflation rate rather than pushing it higher.\n\nThe onion’s second layer is made up of core  goods that exclude food and energy. Here, too, we’re seeing the effects of a  rebalancing of supply and demand. And global supply-chain bottlenecks, which triggered  widespread shortages of goods during the pandemic, are mostly a thing of the  past. The New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which measures the  extent of supply-chain disruptions, attained its most favorable reading on  record in October, based on data going back to 1998. 3\n\nAs a result of the rebalancing of supply  and demand and an easing of supply-chain bottlenecks, core goods inflation is  now running around  1/4 of a percent.  And it appears to be on its way to returning to pre-pandemic rates.\n\nWhile the outer layers of our onion have  seen the fastest and largest improvements, the inner layer is making progress,  too. After peaking at about 5-3/4 percent earlier this  year, core services inflation is now around 4-1/2 percent, and more recent readings point to  further slowing of inflation in this category.\n\nA big driver of the surge in core services  inflation has been sharp increases in the price of shelter. Shelter price inflation  was boosted by strong demand and limited supply during much of the pandemic and  in its aftermath. More recently, rents for newly signed leases have been increasing  at closer to pre-pandemic rates. As these data are incorporated into the  official statistics, the inflation rate for shelter should continue its  downward trend. Inflation for services excluding  housing and energy is also beginning to move in the right direction. Over the  past six months, inflation in this category has slowed to about 4 percent, well off the 5-1/4 percent  peak we saw in December of 2021.\n\nFuture Indicators\n\nThat summarizes what’s happening with the  various layers of the onion. But what does it mean for inflation going forward?\n\nInflation expectations are one important  indicator of future inflation. And longer-run inflation expectations are at  levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. According to the New York  Fed’s monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations, medium-term expectations, which were  elevated during 2021-2022, are now fully back to pre-pandemic levels. 4\n\nMeanwhile, one-year-ahead inflation  expectations have fallen dramatically since peaking at nearly 7 percent last  June. They are now only about three quarters of a percentage point above  average levels seen over 2014-2019.\n\nA second useful indicator for inflation trends  is the New York Fed’s Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation. After reaching nearly  5-1/2 percent in June of last year, the MCT was 2.9 percent in September. Other  indicators of underlying inflation are similarly showing significant declines  since last year.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nLet me now turn to the other side of our  dual mandate: employment.\n\nAfter the recovery from the pandemic  recession, the labor market turned red hot. Demand far exceeded supply. And this  imbalance contributed to rising wage growth and higher inflation.\n\nNumerous indicators point to a gradual  return to balance. Job openings continue to trend downward. The quits and hires  rates are back to pre-pandemic levels. So are perceptions of jobs availability  and the ability to fill jobs. Wage growth, although still elevated, has slowed  considerably.\n\nWe’ve seen meaningful improvements in  the supply side of the labor market. Labor force participation has increased  significantly. And immigration rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. But  there are limits to how much supply can increase, and some further reduction in  demand is needed to fully return balance to the labor market.\n\nA Restrictive Monetary Policy Stance\n\nThe FOMC has reached a restrictive  stance of monetary policy. This is working to bring demand into balance with  supply and inflation back to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Earlier this month,  the FOMC kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to  5-1/2 percent. 5\n\nAlong with our restrictive policy  actions, financial conditions have tightened, driven in part by an increase in  longer-term Treasury yields since the summer. While statistical models of  Treasury yields generally attribute most of the increase to a rise in the term  premium, financial market participants have expressed a wide range of views,  with little conviction around any single explanation. The rise in yields and  the elevated volatility likely reflect heightened uncertainty about the outlook  for the economy and future interest rates.\n\nTaking into account tighter financial  and credit conditions, I expect GDP growth to slow next year to about 1-1/4  percent, and the unemployment rate to rise to around 4-1/4 percent.\n\nI expect inflation to continue to move down  to our 2 percent longer-run goal. As I mentioned earlier, slowing shelter price  inflation should help bring the inflation rate down. And, based on New York Fed  research that shows a strong relationship between the Global Supply Chain  Pressure Index and goods price inflation, I expect to see additional  disinflationary pressures on this layer of the inflation onion as well. 6 My forecast is that PCE inflation will be around 3 percent for 2023 as a whole,  then decline to around 2-1/4 percent next year, before closing in on 2 percent  in 2025.\n\nAll of that said, the future remains  highly uncertain, and our decisions will continue to be data dependent. The  risks are two-sided, with the possibility of inflation remaining stubbornly  persistent weighed against the risk of a weaker economy and employment.\n\nIn balancing these risks, and based on  what I know now, my assessment is that we are at, or near, the peak level of  the target range of the federal funds rate. Based on model estimates of the  longer-run neutral interest rate that incorporate forecasts for the current  quarter, the stance of monetary policy is quite restrictive; indeed, it is  estimated to be the most restrictive in 25 years. 7 I expect it will be appropriate to maintain a restrictive stance for quite some  time to fully restore balance and to bring inflation back to our 2 percent  longer-run goal on a sustained basis.\n\nI will continue to carefully watch the  totality of the data to assess whether the current stance of policy is  sufficient to achieve our inflation goal. If price pressures and imbalances  persist more than I expect, additional policy firming may be needed.\n\nBefore I close, a word on our balance  sheet. At our last meeting, the FOMC said it will continue to reduce its  holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed  securities, according to the framework announced in 2022. The strategy and  implementation of the reduction in our security holdings is working exactly as  designed. 8 We have so far reduced our securities holdings by over $1 trillion, with no  signs of adverse effects on market functioning. 9\n\nCommitted to Our Goal\n\nSince I first started to unpeel the  inflation onion a year ago, we have seen meaningful progress on bringing  inflation down and restoring balance to the economy.\n\nBut our work is not nearly done. I am committed  to achieving our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal, creating a strong  foundation for our economic future.",

    "text": "Thank you for the warm introduction. When the  United States entered the pandemic in March, I never expected that three and a  half months later I would still be making speeches from my apartment: I look  forward to the day when gathering in groups is safe and we can meet in person.\n\nWe're now 17 weeks into a catastrophic  pandemic which has cost over 500,000 lives worldwide and has had a devastating  effect on economies across the globe. 1\n\nToday I'm going to talk about the current state  of the U.S. economy, our goals for the recovery, and how the Federal Reserve is  responding to the worst recession in living memory.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the usual disclaimer  that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of  the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Different  Kind of Recession\n\nThe economic effects of the coronavirus have  caused great hardship and created enormous uncertainty. The root of this downturn—a  global pandemic—means this is a completely different kind of recession compared  to anything we've experienced in the past.\n\nAs the pandemic unfolds, many people are  starting to ask questions about our economic future: What will the recovery  look like? When will it begin? And how will it be affected by the virus?\n\nIt's easiest to start with the last of these  questions first. The virus will continue to be at center stage throughout the economic  recovery. We are traveling down a narrow path, balancing a return of economic  activity with effective containment of COVID-19.\n\nThe overall unemployment rate reached nearly  15 percent in April, and around 20 million Americans have lost their jobs—numbers  I hoped I would never see in my lifetime. These figures understate the full  extent of the pandemic's toll on the economy.\n\nThe pandemic and the ensuing economic downturn  have done disproportionate harm to communities of color. Black and Hispanic  families, as well as lower-wage workers, have suffered the most. 2 Those who least can afford it have been hardest hit, making a strong and full  economic recovery of paramount importance.\n\nAs the recent surge in cases in some states  demonstrates, much is still unknown about how the pandemic will play out in the  months ahead. That said, there have been signs that we may be past the worst of  the extreme economic distress, and early indications of a recovery have started  to emerge.\n\nAs states began to open up and people returned  to eating in restaurants and shopping in stores we've seen sizable increases in  consumer spending. We've also seen increases in building permits, signaling a  turnaround in the construction industry. 3 People  have been getting back to work and the unemployment rate has started to edge  down. Although this improvement is welcome, the economy is still far from  healthy and a full recovery will likely take years to achieve.\n\nOne of the things that's been unique about  this recession is the lightning speed of events. Traditional macroeconomic data  sources—like the labor market report and GDP—are published with lags of weeks  or months and don't typically allow one to see the changes within the month or  quarter.\n\nIn response, economists at the Federal Reserve  and elsewhere have increasingly turned to analyzing a wide variety of high-frequency  data, which—as the name suggests—are published daily or weekly, with only short  reporting lags. 4 High-frequency data give us more timely and granular information about what's  going on in the economy in between the standard macro data releases. They also  help us paint a more detailed picture of people's behavior and how it's  changing in the midst of unprecedented circumstances.\n\nThese data tell us whether small businesses  are hiring and whether people are eating in restaurants, staying in hotels, and  boarding airplanes. When states started to reopen, signs from both the standard  macro data and the high-frequency granular data have been encouraging. Together,  they indicate that we've likely seen the low point of the downturn and that the  overall economy has begun to recover.\n\nEven in New York, the hardest hit state, we have  seen initial signs of a turnaround. Surveys of manufacturing and services firms  rebounded significantly in June, following record lows in April and May, and  revenues of small businesses in New York have gradually picked up as well. 5\n\nIn contrast to these positive signs, we are  seeing some indications of a slowing in the pace of recovery in states that are  currently experiencing large-scale outbreaks. This is a valuable reminder that  the economy's fate is inextricably linked to the path of the virus. A strong  economic recovery depends on effective and sustained containment of COVID-19.\n\nTurning to the question of what the goals for  recovery are: one measure of success is a return to the sustained growth and  historically low unemployment that we had attained before the pandemic. I know  this seems a long way from where we are today and may seem unreachable during  these darkest days of the recession. But history teaches us that the economy  can get back to full strength, even after deep downturns.\n\nPolicy  Responses\n\nThe unique nature of this recession and the  uncertainty that comes with it mean that the policy responses—public health,  fiscal, and by the Fed—need to be designed to reflect the nature of the  pandemic and the challenges it poses to the economy. Although I will focus on  events in the United States, it is important to stress that this is a global  health and economic crisis. Most other countries are facing similar challenges  and are likewise engaged in a range of policy actions.\n\nOur economic prospects are tied to our ability  to contain the spread of the virus, care for those who fall ill, and develop  effective treatments. In addition, fiscal policy has played a critically  important role in providing financial support to families, small businesses,  and those who are out of work during the crisis. This timely support  contributed greatly to the rebound in consumer spending and jobs that we have  seen over the past two months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken  rapid and significant actions to stabilize critical parts of our financial  system and to support the flow of credit, thereby helping position the economy  for a strong and sustained return to maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn March, the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) brought the target range for the federal funds rate to near  zero. 6 The  FOMC has indicated that it expects to keep interest rates at this level until  it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to  achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. 7\n\nBringing interest rates down to  near zero makes it easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing  needs and fosters favorable financial conditions that will help promote a  rebound in spending and investment.\n\nIn addition, the Fed has been  conducting large-scale repo operations and purchasing sizable quantities of  U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities to support  market functioning at a time of extraordinary volatility in markets. 8 These actions averted a potential shutdown in the availability of credit, which  would have made the current economic crisis even more severe.\n\nAlthough functioning in financial  markets has improved since March, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will  continue to increase asset holdings to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby  fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial  conditions. 9\n\nIn addition to stabilizing  financial markets, the Federal Reserve has instituted a number of programs to  support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local  governments. These actions will enable them to continue to do their work, both  now and when normal life resumes. 10\n\nTaken together, these programs  have helped restore the functioning of financial markets, foster favorable financial  conditions, and support the continued flow of credit to businesses and  households.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll conclude with this: This  pandemic and this recession form a pivotal moment for the Federal Reserve. We  are seeing signs that the economy has started to recover. Still, the economic  outlook remains highly uncertain and it's going to take considerable time to  restore the economy to its full potential. But rest assured, we are committed  to using our full range of tools to support the economy and bring about a full  and robust recovery.",

    "text": "Thank you and good  morning.  It’s a pleasure to speak at the  Central Banking Forum co-organized by Bank Indonesia and the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York.  This is our second  joint conference, and I am very much looking forward to the exchange of ideas  and views on important economic issues affecting our regions.  At the outset, I would like to thank Governor  Perry and Bank Indonesia for their leadership and support in sponsoring this  conference, amid what I am sure has been a very busy time with the IMF/World  Bank meetings.  Let me also say that our  thoughts and hearts go out to everyone affected by the recent devastating earthquake  and tsunami.\n\nIn my remarks, I  will focus on the outlook for U.S. monetary policy.  The good news is that on the 10th  anniversary of the worst days of the global financial crisis, the U.S. economy  is doing very well.  From the perspective  of the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, quite  honestly, this is about as good as it gets.   As a result, the Fed has naturally been moving toward more “normal”  monetary policy.\n\nAnd that brings me  to a theme of my remarks today:  What does  “normal” monetary policy look like going forward?  Before I say even one more word, I should stress  that what I have to say represents my own views and not necessarily those of  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nStrong,  Strong, Strong\n\nMy view on the U.S.  economy is well summarized by the most recent FOMC statement, in which variations  on the word “strong” appeared five times in describing the U.S. economy. 1 Central bank communication can be difficult  at times, but, at least in this case, our message is very clear.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve has attained its dual  mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability about as well as it  ever has.  Most indicators point to a  very strong labor market—including an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent—and  inflation is right on target.\n\nWith fiscal  stimulus and favorable financial conditions providing tailwinds to the U.S. economy,  the outlook is for more strong growth.  Let  me put some hard numbers to that:  I  expect real GDP to increase by around 3 percent this year and by 2.5 percent in  2019.  Assuming this forecast comes to  fruition, this will be the longest expansion in U.S. history based on data  going back over 150 years.  This  above-trend pace of growth should lead to continued solid job gains and further  declines in the unemployment rate.  I  expect the unemployment rate to edge down to slightly below 3.5 percent next  year, the lowest level in nearly 50 years.\n\nIn keeping with this  strong economic outlook, I expect price inflation to move up a bit above 2  percent.  Importantly, I don’t see any  signs of greater inflationary pressures on the horizon.  This is all very good news, especially in the  context of the slow recovery and low inflation that has persisted in the years  since the financial crisis.\n\nIn light of the  progress we’ve made on our monetary policy goals, the FOMC has been in the  process of gradually normalizing monetary policy for the past few years.  Looking forward, I continue to expect that  further gradual increases in interest rates will best foster a sustained  economic expansion and achievement of our dual mandate goals.\n\nSince first raising  rates from near-zero back in December 2015, the FOMC has continued to raise the  target range for the federal funds rate as the economy has improved and moved toward  our maximum employment and 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.  Our most recent rate increase came in late  September, when the FOMC set the target range between 2 and 2.25 percent. 2\n\nThroughout, we’ve repeatedly  stressed that we foresaw this to be a process of gradual normalization,  reflecting the balancing of risks to reaching our goals.  In particular, downside risks to the  achievement of our employment and inflation goals amid very low interest rates  were compelling arguments for a relatively cautious and predictable approach to  policy.  This proved its worth:  The U.S. economy continued to expand at a  healthy pace even as the Fed raised rates numerous times.\n\nFor those who  follow the Fed closely, you’ve noticed that the FOMC has been slimming down its  statements of late and using less forward guidance about the future path of policy.   In this vein, the FOMC in its recent  statement removed language indicating that monetary policy remains  accommodative. 3 Let me make clear, these more concise  statements do not signify a shift in  our monetary policy approach.  Instead, they  represent the natural evolution of the language describing the factors  influencing our policy decisions in the context of the strength of the economic  outlook and inflation being near our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nThese changes in  our communication of policy views are a sign that we are nearing the end of the  process of normalizing monetary policy and are inching closer to conducting  normal monetary policy. Arguably, it’s been a long time since monetary policy  was normal, so it’s worth describing what “normal” looks like in some detail.\n\nAt its most basic  level, monetary policy-making will remain the same:  The path of interest rates will continue to be  guided strategically by our dual mandate objectives and shaped tactically by  the data and their implications for the economic outlook.  We’ll continue to be transparent about our  thinking about the economy and monetary policy.\n\nBut, changing  circumstances call for some changes in how the FOMC communicates its policy  views. Now that interest rates are well away from zero and the economy is humming  along, the case for strong forward guidance about future policy actions is becoming  less compelling.  For one, the future  direction of policy will no longer be as clear as it was during the past few  years.  When interest rates were  extremely low, it was obvious that the direction for rates was upward, toward  more normal levels, and our forward guidance reinforced that point.  At some point in the future, it will no longer  be clear whether interest rates need to go up or down, and explicit forward  guidance about the future path of policy will no longer be appropriate.\n\nIn addition, as we  have moved far away from near-zero interest rates, it makes sense to shift away  from a focus on normalizing the stance of monetary policy relative to some benchmark  “neutral” interest rate, often referred to as “r-star.”  Now, I have spent a good deal of my career  studying r-star and I find it to be a useful concept for describing the  economy’s longer-run behavior.\n\nHaving said that, at  times r-star has actually gotten too much attention in commentary about Fed  policy.  Back when interest rates were  well below neutral, r-star appropriately acted as a pole star for navigation.  But, as we have gotten closer to the range of  estimates of neutral, what appeared to be a bright point of light is really a  fuzzy blur, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in measuring r-star. 4 More than that, r-star is just one factor affecting  our decisions, alongside economic and labor market indicators, wage and price  inflation, global developments, financial conditions, the risks to the outlook…  the list goes on and on.\n\nI’ve talked a lot  about normalizing our policy around interest rates.  In addition, about a year ago we started the  process of gradually reducing the Fed’s balance sheet as we work to unwind the  asset purchase policies put in place during the crisis.  In the now-standard Fed practice of  communicate, communicate, and communicate, we published detailed plans well in  advance on how we would gradually and predictably reduce the balance sheet. 5 This process has proceeded smoothly without creating  undue market disruption or volatility. 6\n\nWith balance sheet  normalization well underway, the Fed is studying the question of what exactly the  new normal looks like.  We have indicated  that we plan to shrink the balance sheet to the smallest size consistent with  the efficient and effective conduct of monetary policy—and that, in the long  run, the asset side of the balance sheet will consist primarily of Treasury  securities. 7 That’s our strategy, but its execution will  depend on the operating framework of monetary policy, among other factors.\n\nHere, the Fed basically  has two choices.  We could return to a  system similar in spirit to that used before the financial crisis, in which the  supply of reserves in the banking system was kept relatively scarce, and the interest  rate was set by adjusting reserves on a frequent basis through open market  operations.  Alternatively, we could  continue with the system that we’ve been using since the crisis, in which bank reserves  are abundant and the federal funds rate target is achieved through adjustments  to administered rates.  This approach is  working very well at controlling interest rates and has proven to be easy to  communicate and adaptable to changing market conditions. 8 The Fed will be looking closely at these  options in the coming months and will subsequently make a decision on the future  operating framework.  And, as is our  standard practice, we will be sure to communicate our thinking and decisions on  this issue as soon and as thoroughly as practicable.\n\nGlobal  Dimensions of U.S. Monetary Policy\n\nSo far, I have  described the economic and monetary policy outlook from the perspective of the  U.S. economy and policy. This should not be surprising given that the Fed’s mandate—as  defined by the U.S. Congress—concerns domestic economic conditions.  Of course, that does not imply that one can  view the U.S. economy and our policy actions in isolation from global economic  and financial developments.  Far from it.\n\nIn today’s highly  interconnected global economy and financial system, international developments affect  the U.S. economy, and our policy actions in turn impact the rest of the world.  Therefore, we devote considerable effort to monitoring  and analysis of developments around the world to understand how our actions affect  the global economy and indirectly feed back to our own economy.  These considerations play an important role in  my thinking about the economic outlook and the appropriate path for monetary  policy, as well as how we best communicate our perspectives and plans.\n\nMoreover, we  actively engage with international counterparts in a range of forums, such as  today’s.  These exchanges help us  understand economic and financial conditions affecting our respective regions  and provide opportunities to share perspectives and insights.  A key lesson about policy-making in an  interconnected world is that transparency and open lines of communication are  critical to minimizing misunderstanding, market disruption, and volatility that  can interfere with our common goals of having strong and stable economies.  As I have mentioned a number of times already,  effective communication that provides clarity and predictability to our policy  actions is a critical component of successful policy-making.\n\nConclusion\n\nMonetary  policy-making has perhaps never been more challenging than it was following the  financial crisis.  But, as we move toward  more “normal” conduct of monetary policy, we must not rest easy.  We will confront our own fair share of future  challenges.  The most important monetary  policy challenge in the United States today is sustaining the long economic  expansion without allowing risks to grow that ultimately undermine economic  prosperity.  Whatever the future may  bring, I will be guided by our dual mandate, a heavy dependence on data, and a  steadfast commitment to transparency.  Such  an approach, in my view, will help support prosperity both in the United States  and abroad.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Thank  you for that kind introduction. Good evening, everyone. It's great to be here  with the Money Marketeers.\n\nOne  of the big issues facing the economy is inflation. Inflation is far too high,  and high inflation is hardest on those who can least afford essentials like  food, shelter, and transportation.\n\nSo  today, I'm going to talk about the actions the Federal Reserve is taking to restore  price stability. I'll also give my views on the economic outlook.\n\nBut  before I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the  views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nThe Dual  Mandate\n\nFor  a group like the Money Marketeers, the economic and financial events of the  past few months—and even years—have provided a lot to talk about. In fact, the high  inflation we see today stems from imbalances between demand and supply that  started with the pandemic.\n\nA more  recent issue has been the stresses that emerged last month in parts of the  banking system. Conditions in the banking sector have stabilized, and the  banking system is sound and resilient. Nonetheless, these developments will  likely lead to some tightening in credit conditions for households and  businesses, which in turn will weigh on spending. It is still too early to  gauge the magnitude and duration of these effects, and I will be closely  monitoring the evolution of credit conditions and their potential effects on  the economy.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price  stability. These goals are intrinsically linked—price stability is essential to  sustaining maximum employment over the long term and for the economy to reach  its full potential.\n\nRight  now, while there are some indications of gradual cooling in the demand for  labor, the labor market remains very tight. Job growth continues to be robust. Job  openings far outnumber applicants. And at 3.5 percent, the unemployment rate is  near 50-year lows.\n\nThat  brings us to inflation.  Inflation soared to a 40-year high of 7 percent  last June, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.  It has since moderated to 5 percent, and the most recent data indicate that  this trend of slowing inflation is continuing. Still, inflation is well above  the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nThis inflation target  is an important bedrock principle for the FOMC. It provides a \"North Star\" for  policy decisions and helps to improve the public's understanding of our goals  and actions. 1 We are committed  to attaining—and maintaining—a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to achieve  our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nIndeed,  throughout this period of high inflation, one of the bright spots is that  various measures of longer-run inflation expectations have remained remarkably  well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent target. 2\n\nImbalances Endure\n\nOur  most important policy tool is the setting of the target range for the federal  funds rate, which influences demand for goods and services by affecting  borrowing costs.\n\nSo far, tighter monetary policy from the Federal  Reserve and central banks around the world is helping to bring a better balance  between supply and demand. Inflation has declined in a number of sectors,  particularly for many categories of commodities and goods.\n\nIn addition, the supply-chain bottlenecks that had constrained  the supply of goods have largely dissipated. For example, the New York Fed's  Global Supply Chain Pressure Index has declined to a level that indicates  supply pressures are now actually somewhat lower than normal. 3 I hear the same from business leaders from around the  Federal Reserve's Second District, who confirm that supply chains have improved  considerably.\n\nAt the same time, data on rents for new leases provide  early signs of slowing inflation for shelter. This is important because shelter  inflation had been a significant driver of higher inflation over the past year.\n\nHowever,  despite the moderation of inflation, imbalances endure, with overall demand  still exceeding supply in the economy. This is seen in the inflation rate for  core services excluding housing, which has been running around 4-1/2 percent  since last August.\n\nFOMC Actions\n\nAgainst this  backdrop, the FOMC has taken decisive actions to curb demand, restore balance  to the economy, and bring inflation down.\n\nLast month, the  FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent,  its ninth consecutive increase. In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC said it  \"will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for  monetary policy.\" 4\n\nThe Committee also  said it \"anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in  order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to  return inflation to 2 percent over time.\" According to the median projections  in the FOMC's March Summary of Economic Projections, the stance of monetary  policy remains restrictive this year and next year. 5\n\nIn addition, the  FOMC said it will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and  agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, according to the framework  announced last May. 6\n\nEconomic  Outlook\n\nBecause of the  lag between policy actions and their effects, it will take some time for the  FOMC's actions to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target. With inflation  expectations well anchored, I expect inflation to decline to around 3-1/4  percent this year, before moving to our longer-run goal over the next two years.\n\nTurning to GDP, the  data flow for the first quarter indicates that the economy continues to expand  at a solid pace. I expect real GDP to grow modestly this year as tighter  monetary policy continues to take effect, with growth picking up somewhat next  year.\n\nIn addition, we  are beginning to see some signs of cooling in the labor market. I expect slow  growth will likely lead to some softening, with unemployment gradually rising  to about 4 to 4-1/2 percent over the next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, inflation  is still too high, and we will use our monetary policy tools to restore price  stability. I am confident that we will attain and maintain a sufficiently  restrictive stance to bring inflation down to our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nAnd now, I look  forward to our discussion.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. I want to  thank Sue Henderson for that kind introduction, and New Jersey City University  for hosting today's discussion. I always enjoy speaking with students, and I look  forward to the time—hopefully soon—when we can have these types of events in  person.\n\nToday, our virtual setting is  Jersey City, one of the most diverse cities in the world—and one known for  terrific pizza. Now, it's not my place to get into the debate over who has the  best pizza, and I know that people have strong views on that subject. As  president of the New York Fed, I proudly represent both sides of the Hudson  River, and my job is to make the economy stronger and the financial system more  stable for all.\n\nBefore I move on from the topic  of pizza to economics, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views  I express today are mine alone. They do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee—what we call the \"FOMC\"—or others in the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nAs you well know, the economy—like many facets of our lives—continues to  be shaped by the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus. As  I've said before, the pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis. While  omicron was milder for many—and thankfully the wave subsided relatively quickly—it  still caused terrible hardship for countless families.\n\nYou can see the  economic effects of the pandemic right here in New Jersey. What struck me this  week as I met with New Jersey business, community, and political leaders was the  different ways that COVID-19 affects local economies. Just a few miles from  Jersey City, Port Newark and Port Elizabeth are humming with activity. But across  the Turnpike, Newark Liberty International Airport has seen a big reduction in  the number of flights and passengers relative to pre-pandemic trends. Likewise, the pandemic has led to empty  office buildings and fewer travelers in New York City, which affects businesses  here in New Jersey as well.\n\nToday I'm going to talk about how the economy has  continued to recover despite the many disruptions and imbalances that COVID-19 has  caused. I'll also discuss the labor market and the rise in inflation. Then, I'll describe how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is  working to help restore balance and stability to the economy during these  uncertain times.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nSince it's the Friday before a holiday weekend, I won't  test any of you on the functions of the Federal Reserve System. But I do want to take a moment to discuss the Fed's dual  mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability. U.S. monetary policy is  set by the FOMC, which is made up of the Board of Governors and five  of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nWe make our decisions after studying the data—lots of  data. We look at everything from food and gas prices to retail sales and  inventories, from labor costs and employment figures to semiconductor  inventories and shipping expenses, and from the demand for goods and services  to readings on public health.\n\nAnd we consider more than just numbers on spreadsheets  and charts. We also regularly hear from business and community leaders who tell  us firsthand what is happening in the economy. This occurs both through regular  meetings with our Boards of Directors and advisory groups, as well as in  ongoing discussions with local leaders. That is why it's so important for me to  make trips like this one—even virtually—so I can meet with  leaders to hear their perspectives. For example, earlier today I spoke with  officials at the Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal about supply chains and  logistics. And yesterday, I met with groups in North Jersey who are working to  bridge the gap in health outcomes and housing—two critically important issues  that can affect economic mobility.\n\nDespite the disruptions from COVID-19, the overall economy has shown  remarkable strength and resilience over the past year. To put this in  perspective, the onset of the pandemic in 2020 caused the sharpest U.S.  economic contraction since World War II. Since then, we have seen a remarkable  turnaround. The economy, measured by real gross domestic product, or GDP, grew about  5-1/2 percent over the course of last year, the fastest pace of growth since 1984.  To get an idea how long ago that was, 1984 was the year I finished college.\n\nThe labor market has  also improved dramatically and is now very strong. Over the past 12 months  through January, the economy added over 6-1/2 million jobs. The unemployment  rate has fallen from the pandemic peak of 14.7 percent to just 4 percent today. In fact, there are many more job openings now than there  are people looking for work. Another clear sign of the hot labor market is  that wages rose sharply last year, especially for lower-paid jobs.\n\nInflation\n\nI mentioned earlier that the Federal Reserve has two goals:  maximum employment and price stability. The very strong  labor market is great news in terms of achieving maximum employment. However, we have seen inflation  rise to a level that's far too high. Ten years ago, the FOMC set a longer-run  goal of 2 percent inflation—that is, prices rising 2 percent per year on  average. 1 From 2012 through 2020, inflation averaged below this  2 percent goal. But the inflation rate started rising sharply in 2021. The Fed's preferred price measure, the personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) price index, rose 5-3/4 percent last year, its highest reading since the  early 1980s.\n\nThis sudden, sharp rise in  prices reflects a unique set of circumstances that has driven supply and demand  out of balance. For those of you who have studied economics, you will  not be surprised that I ascribe this rise in inflation to demand outpacing  supply. But, the rapidly changing situation of the past two years has been  extraordinary, and it is worth discussing in some detail.\n\nAfter the onset of the pandemic, Americans shifted  their spending from services to goods, spending less on restaurants, vacations,  and entertainment, and more on things like cars, appliances, and furniture. As businesses  tried to meet the surge in demand for goods, distribution channels backed up. Supply-chain  bottlenecks and shortages emerged, both here and abroad. Too many ships arrived  at the ports—particularly those in California. When the ships were finally able  to dock, there weren't enough workers and drivers to unload and transport goods  to stores—or to people's homes.\n\nIn  addition, we have seen a large pullback in the number of people willing and  able to work, in part reflecting the challenges and risks of working during the  pandemic. Some businesses can't hire people fast enough to help meet the strong  demand. This has contributed to an acceleration in wages and higher prices for  a variety of goods and services, including food and housing. High inflation is hardest on those already struggling to make  ends meet.\n\nThe Fed's  Response\n\nThis  brings me to the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As I said  earlier, demand for goods and some services is now far outstripping supply,  resulting in elevated inflation. With the labor market  already very strong, it's important to restore the balance between supply and  demand and bring inflation down. A number of factors should help accomplish  this rebalancing, and monetary policy has an important role to play.\n\nFirst,  with the omicron wave now ebbing and COVID vaccines and treatments much more  widely available across the globe, we should see a gradual  restoration of supply and a resolution of associated bottlenecks and shortages. Over time, consumers  should also start to cut back on buying goods that are in short supply and  switch back to in-person activities like travel, dining, and entertainment,  where supply is less constrained overall. Together, these developments should contribute to more balance  between supply and demand in the economy.\n\nThe  second factor is fiscal policy, which provided a huge  boost to the economy during the past two years but is unlikely to be as  significant a source of demand this year. This is true not only for the  United States, but also for many other economies.\n\nLast—but  definitely not least—is monetary policy.  After providing  maximum support to the economy for the first year and half of the pandemic, the  FOMC is adjusting the stance of monetary policy with the aim of bringing demand  in balance with supply and thereby bringing down inflationary pressures. The  same is true for many other central banks, which either already have moved in  this direction or are expected to this year.\n\nThe  initial step in that process was the FOMC's decisions to first reduce, and then  end, its net purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. 2 These purchases  pushed longer-term interest rates lower, making it less costly for consumers  and businesses to borrow, and contributed to favorable overall financial  conditions that supported spending.\n\nThe next step will be to raise the FOMC's target range  for the federal funds rate the short-term interest rate at which banks lend to  each other. In March 2020, the FOMC reduced the target range for  the federal funds rate by 1-1/2 percentage points to near zero. This very low  interest rate contributed to the sharp rebound in demand, which propelled the  strong labor market recovery over the past year.\n\nBut  with today's strong economy and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run  goal, it is time to start the process of steadily moving the target range back  to more normal levels. In particular, I expect it will be  appropriate to raise the target range at our upcoming meeting in March.\n\nOnce  the interest rate increases are underway, the next step will be to start the  process of steadily and predictably reducing our holdings of Treasury and  mortgage-based securities, which had grown significantly as a result of the purchases  that began in March 2020. Last month, the FOMC released a set of principles  that will guide that process. 3 Assuming the  economy develops roughly as I expect, I foresee this process getting started  later this year.\n\nTaken together, these two sets of actions steadily raising  the target range for the federal funds rate and steadily bringing down our  securities holdings—should help bring demand closer to supply. In fact, even though  we haven't done either of these things yet, financial conditions have already  responded based on the expectation of Fed  action. For example, medium- and longer-term Treasury yields and fixed-rate  mortgage rates have risen close to their December 2019 levels. Of course, our  actions will be driven by the data and a determination to achieve our maximum  employment and price stability goals.\n\nWith these three factors working together to restore  balance between supply and demand, I am confident we will achieve a sustained, strong  economy and inflation at our 2 percent longer-run goal. For this year, I look forward to continued growth and receding  inflation, both for the nation and North Jersey. Specifically, my forecast for the U.S. economy is for  real GDP to grow a bit below 3 percent this year, for the unemployment rate to  end the year around 3-1/2 percent, and for PCE price inflationto drop back to around 3 percent, before falling further next  year as supply issues continue to recede.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic two years ago, this has  an extraordinary  time for the economy and monetary policy. As we work to help restore balance to the economy and  bring down inflation, our actions will always be driven by the data, and we will remain focused on achieving maximum employment  and price stability.",

    "text": "Thank you, Tom. It's a pleasure to share  the stage with you today.\n\nAs a member of the New York Fed's Board  of Directors, Tom Murphy represents the Federal Reserve's Second District. Our directors  ensure that a diversity of viewpoints on economic and banking conditions are  represented, so we can better understand and anticipate developments in our economy,  both locally and nationally. As you well know, a lot has occurred since Tom  joined our board two years ago. And we have benefited immensely from his thoughtful  insights and perspectives.\n\nToday, it should come as no surprise  that I'll be spending much of my time discussing inflation, which remains my  No. 1 concern. I'll also talk about how we are using our monetary policy tools  to restore price stability. And, I'll give you my economic outlook.\n\nBefore I go further, I'd like to do three things:  First and foremost, I want to thank the New York Bankers Association for inviting  me here. Second, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I  express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n  \n  \nAnd third: I'd  like to wish everyone a happy Valentine's Day. As Rihanna sang at the Super  Bowl, I hope you all have someone to stand under your umbrella.\n\nInflation Is Still Too High\n\nEconomic developments over the past  three years have been extraordinary. The pandemic contributed to dramatic  swings in our economy  —  and economies around the world—that  we are still grappling with today. At the onset, we experienced the deepest  —  but also the shortest—recession in U.S. history, as well  as an immediate spike in unemployment, the highest since the Great Depression.\n\nThen, along with Russia's war against Ukraine,  the pandemic contributed to skyrocketing inflation, which reached 7 percent  last June, as measured by the  personal consumption  expenditures (PCE) price index  . That's a level we had not seen for four decades,  and one that is well above the FOMC's longer-term goal of 2 percent.\n\nHigh inflation hurts everyone, but it's  hardest on those who can least afford essentials like food, housing, and  transportation. Persistently high inflation also undermines the ability of our  economy to reach its full potential. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate,  set by Congress, to promote price stability and maximum employment. And price  stability is essential for the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained  basis.\n\nOver the past year, the FOMC has taken strong  actions to bring inflation down. Although we have seen some moderation in  recent months, the inflation rate remains far too high at 5 percent.\n\nIn addition, measures of underlying  inflation also remain elevated and well above our 2 percent longer-run goal.  For example, after declining earlier in 2022, the New York Fed's Multivariate  Core Trend has been hovering around 3-3/4 percent for the past few months. 1 Similarly, both the Dallas Fed's trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate and core inflation  that excludes food and energy prices averaged around 3-3/4 percent over the  past six months.\n\nSo, our work is not yet done. Inflation is  still well above our 2 percent target, and it is critically important that we  reach that goal.\n\nSupply and Demand Misalignment\n\nTo help illustrate how tighter monetary policy is  working to reduce inflation, I like to use an analogy inspired by a mechanism  that consists of different gears. 2 In this case, I'll hearken back to a time before rechargeable  batteries, and even before quartz, to the age of the mechanical watch.\n\nOur watch represents the economy, and its gears are different  sectors. Some gears spin quickly; others turn slowly. They need to turn at the  right speed to keep time accurately—or, in this example, to maintain balance in  the economy.\n\nThe gears are propelled by supply and demand, which act  as the mainspring of our watch. But they have been misaligned since the onset  of the pandemic. At first, when people were home and factories were shuttered,  demand shifted strongly from services to goods, which were scarce due to supply-chain  bottlenecks. Then, once people got out of their homes and businesses reopened, we  saw a rotation in demand away from goods and back to services. But even with  this rebalancing and the contributions of tighter policy, overall demand still  exceeds supply.\n\nSimilar imbalances exist in the labor market. After  the pandemic forced mass shutdowns, unemployment surged. But as businesses  reopened and the demand for workers rebounded, suddenly there weren't enough  people to fill jobs. Today, the labor market remains extremely tight. Job gains  are robust. Job openings are near all-time highs. Quit rates and wage gains  remain elevated. And the unemployment rate, at 3.4 percent, is the lowest since  1969. As some of you may recall, that was the year \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" was the  best-selling album. And the title track is, of course, another great  Valentine's Day song.\n\nTurning the Inflation Gears\n\nInflation has its own set of gears, and some are  spinning faster than others. The one that's turning quickest  relates to globally traded commodities—such as lumber, steel, and grains—that  are sensitive to international economic and financial conditions. Thanks in  part to tighter policy in the United States and around the world, those prices are  below the levels we saw following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe gear that represents many other goods—such  as cars, appliances, and furniture—has also started to turn. Higher interest  rates, both here and abroad, are damping global demand for goods. In addition,  the severe supply-chain bottlenecks that initially affected this category began  to improve last year, which likely contributed to the easing of prices for some  durable goods in recent months.\n\nHowever, there are factors that may  throw sand in this gear going forward.\n  The economic  resiliency of Europe and a rebound in growth in China following the end of  COVID restrictions will likely increase global demand for goods. And further  improvement in global supply-chain disruptions has stalled over the past few  months. For example, the New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index remains  elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe slowest gear to  turn is the one that represents non-energy services. It's influenced by the  balance of overall supply and demand, and it will take the longest to rotate at  the right pace for low and stable inflation. One area where we are seeing signs  of this gear turning is in shelter costs. After a sharp rise, we have seen a steep  decline in the rate of increase in new lease rents. Assuming this trend  continues, we should see a slowing of overall rent inflation during this year. That  said, we have yet to see the gears turn for inflation of non-energy services  excluding housing, which is still quite elevated, averaging 3-3/4 percent over  the most recent six months.\n\nTightening Monetary Policy\n\nTaking into account the different speeds  the gears are moving, it is clear that overall demand remains well in excess of  supply, and inflation is running far above our 2 percent target. When it comes  to monetary policy, we must restore balance to the economy and bring inflation  down to 2 percent on a sustained basis.\n\nEarlier this month, the FOMC raised the  target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent, the eighth  consecutive increase. The FOMC said it anticipates \"ongoing increases in the  target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy  that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In  determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Committee  will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags  with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and  economic and financial developments.\" 3\n\nThe Committee also said it will continue  to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency  mortgage-backed securities, according to the framework it announced last May. 4\n\nOne aspect of inflation that's important  for achieving and sustaining price stability is the anchoring of inflation  expectations. Since 2012, the FOMC has clearly and consistently communicated  its resolute commitment to its 2 percent longer-run inflation goal and the  importance of well-anchored inflation expectations consistent with that goal. 5 This  provides a \"North Star\" for our policy decisions and has helped keep  longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. 6 According to our most recent \n  Survey of Consumer Expectations,  three-year-ahead inflation expectations are now where they were before the  sharp increase in inflation that started in 2021, and one-year-ahead  expectations have been trending down since the middle of last year. 7\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nDeclines in commodity and goods prices  will not be enough to bring inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. We  need all the gears turning at the right pace to restore balance between demand  and supply in the entire economy. We still have some way to go to achieve that  goal. And it will likely entail a period of subdued growth and some softening  of labor market conditions. As a result,\n  I expect real GDP  growth to come in around 1 percent for 2023. And I anticipate the unemployment  rate to edge up over the next year to between 4 and 4-1/2 percent.\n\nAs tighter policy actions continue to work to restore  balance to supply and demand, I expect PCE inflation to fall to 3 percent in  2023, before moving closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal in the next few  years.\n\nConclusion\n\nI am confident that the gears of  monetary policy will continue to move in a way that will bring inflation down  to 2 percent. We will we stay the course until our job is done.",

    "text": "Good  afternoon, and welcome to the New York Fed. It’s wonderful to see so many of  you here in person and online for the fourth event in our Economy That Works  for All series.\n\nThe New  York Fed is a mission-driven organization. And these gatherings go to the heart  of our mission, which is to make the U.S. economy stronger and the financial  system more stable for all segments of society.\n\nIn  prior years, we have used these events to discuss issues like equitable growth  and low-income homeownership.\n\nToday,  we’re going to talk about a topic that comes up in almost every conversation I  have with business, government, and community leaders throughout the Second  District—and that is housing affordability. It is not an exaggeration to say  that this is the No. 1 economic topic in our region today.\n\nBefore  I go further, let me give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express  today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHousing  affordability affects different groups in different ways. For households, it  encompasses not only the cost of buying or renting a place to live, but also  the ways those costs affect the lives of individuals and families.\n\nIf rent  or a mortgage payment takes up most of a household’s income, affordability  becomes unaffordability. This creates ripple effects that can impact the  ability of a household to afford other essentials, such as food, clothing,  transportation, healthcare, childcare, and so much more.\n\nThe  repercussions reverberate through all aspects of our economy. Housing  affordability affects the ability of communities to attract businesses, and it  affects the ability of employers to attract and retain workers—and grow their  businesses.\n\nAs an  economist, I naturally think about economic issues through the lens of supply  and demand. Imbalances between supply and demand not only affect inflation and  employment, but also access to housing, healthcare, childcare, and broadband. Restoring  the balance between supply and demand is one of the biggest challenges faced by  policymakers at local, regional, and national levels.\n\nLook no  further than our experience over the past five years, when the pandemic and its  aftermath delivered enormous shocks to the economy. New York City and this  region were hit particularly hard. Businesses closed, unemployment surged, and  many people who were able to work remotely moved away.\n\nToday,  it’s a very different story. As the economy came into balance, businesses reopened.  We more than recovered the jobs lost during the pandemic. And the demand for  housing surged.\n\nBut the  recovery has been uneven. With regard to housing, demand far exceeds the  available supply, contributing to high costs and limiting the ability of our region’s  economy to reach its potential. Meeting this demand is critical to achieving sustained  economic prosperity.\n\nAnd  that’s what brings us here today. The New York Fed’s efforts in this area are  shaped by three verbs: connect, convene, and catalyze. We connect stakeholders with  the latest data and research. We convene stakeholders in forums such as this  one to share best practices and thought leadership. And we aim to catalyze action.\n\nTo that  end, you’ll hear more about the impact of higher housing costs on individuals  and communities. We’ll discuss best practices that can help increase the supply  of housing for low- and middle-income families, as well as help them manage the  burden of housing costs. The goal is that these discussions will help identify promising  solutions that will help tackle the housing affordability problem.\n\nWe have  a number of terrific speakers and panelists. I want to thank them all for their  participation—and for their dedication to this important work. So, without  further ado, let’s get started.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon. I’ve been waiting for the right opportunity to visit  Iceland, and this conference is a wonderful reason to be here. I would like to  thank Governor Jónsson for the invitation.\n\nWe are experiencing a moment of great uncertainty and change. I’d  like to take this time to step back and revisit the lessons of the past several  decades of monetary policy under uncertainty, a topic I have devoted most of my  career to as a researcher and policymaker. In particular, I’ll discuss the key characteristics  of monetary policy approaches that are robust to uncertainty.\n\nBefore diving deeper into this topic, I must give the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nUncertainty  Is Pervasive and Multifaceted\n\nAfter 30 years in central banking, I can unequivocally say: “ Uncertainty  is the only certainty in monetary policy.” 1 Or,  in the words of Alan Greenspan, former Chair of the Federal Reserve:  “Uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape;  it is the defining characteristic of that landscape.” 2\n\nAnd there’s no doubt that uncertainty will continue to be the  defining characteristic of the monetary policy landscape for the foreseeable  future. This is a direct result of structural changes in the global economic  environment such as those posed by artificial intelligence, deglobalization,  and innovations in the financial system—not to mention the perennial challenges  of measuring the so-called star variables such as r-star.\n\nRules  vs. Discretion\n\nSo, what foundational principles, approaches, and debates have  already been established with regard to monetary policy under uncertainty?\n\nI’ll begin with the “rules vs. discretion” debate. In both theory  and practice, the tradition in monetary economics circles has been to  counterpose the value of predictable, rule-like behavior against the need for  discretionary actions in the face of uncertainty and rapid change. For example,  some say the world is too complicated and uncertain to design a useful policy  rule, much less follow one, and discretion is essential. On the other side,  discretion can contribute to poor outcomes.\n\nAlthough the rules-vs.-discretion debate has helped clarify  fundamental issues, the right answer, in practice, is a blend of the two. As  renowned macroeconomist, monetary theorist, and public policy expert John  Taylor pointed out, a simple equation does reasonably well in describing the  Fed’s interest rate setting during the early Greenspan years, even though  Greenspan himself highlighted the risk management nature of policymaking. 3 And policy rules themselves cannot be immutable since they implicitly or  explicitly incorporate structural factors that are subject to change over time.\n\nRobust  Policy Under Uncertainty\n\nThis is where robust policy comes into play. The goal of robust  monetary policy is to blend a high degree of predictability and consistency  with the ability to perform effectively across a wide range of circumstances.  In so doing, it increases the scope for rule-like behavior and reduces the need  for discretionary actions. It inherently trades off fine-tuning to a particular  view or model of the world with robustness in a world of unknowns. Early  advocates of this approach included Bennett McCallum and John Taylor, and it has  been studied extensively since then. 4\n\nA useful analogy is decision-making by a policy committee. 5 Each member of the committee holds a particular view of the behavior of the  economy (represented, say, by a particular macroeconomic model). A robust  policy is one that yields decisions that may not be the first choice of any individual  committee member but is acceptable to most members.\n\nFoundations for Robust Monetary Policy\n\nWith robust monetary policy being so important, how can we ensure  that we get it right?\n\nIt all goes back to foundations. And the features of robust  monetary policy are inextricably linked to the core foundations of successful  monetary policy identified through decades of theory and evidence.\n\nToday, I will highlight three principles: accountability and  independence, transparency, and well-anchored inflation expectations. 6 It’s important to note at the outset that these are mutually reinforcing.\n\nI’ll start with accountability and independence. History teaches  us that central banks can be more successful at delivering price stability when  they own the responsibility for that goal and have the independence of action  and tools to achieve it. Too often in the past—most notably in the 1970s—some central  banks behaved as if they were powerless to control inflation. Today, regardless  of economic shocks, changes in government policies, or swings in globalization  and deglobalization, central banks recognize that maintaining price stability  is their job: they are the protectors of price stability.\n\nThe second principle is transparency, which provides  predictability and clarity, and thereby enhances effectiveness. This includes  clear communication of a central bank’s strategy and policy decisions, and an  explicit numerical longer-run inflation target. Transparency reinforces public  accountability for price stability and focuses the internal policy debate on  how to best achieve that goal. For households and businesses, transparency takes  some of the uncertainty off the table so they can better plan. Central banks  that adopted inflation targeting led the way on this. For the Federal Reserve,  these concepts are described in the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and  Monetary Policy Strategy, which was introduced in January 2012. 7\n\nThe third key principle, which has become a bedrock of modern  central banking, is well-anchored inflation expectations. In the 1960s and  1970s, both short- and longer-term inflation expectations in the U.S. became  unmoored, rising as actual inflation rose. This made it more difficult to  maintain stable prices amid the shocks of that period. By communicating an  explicit inflation target—and then delivering inflation consistent with that  target—central banks have earned credibility with the public. This feedback  loop between effective policy actions and communications, well-anchored expectations,  and price stability short-circuits so-called second-round effects in wage and  price setting that exacerbate and prolong the effects of shocks, as was the  case in the 1970s.\n\nRisk Management and Fault Tolerance\n\nWith these three foundational aspects of successful monetary  policy squarely in mind, I will now turn to the design of robust policy. The  basic premise is that policymaking under uncertainty is intrinsically an  exercise in risk management: guard against risks that have high costs in terms  of possible outcomes, and accept risks that don’t.\n\nIn the remainder of this presentation, I will describe monetary  policy in terms of a policy rule that stipulates the setting of interest rates  as a function of different variables. The Taylor Rule  is one prominent example, whereby the nominal interest rate depends on an  estimate of the natural rate of interest, the inflation rate, and the deviation  of a measure of economic activity from its natural rate (such as the output or  unemployment gap). Although the characteristics of robust policy can be  described in different ways, the policy rule formulation helps illustrate some  basic concepts. 8\n\nFault  Tolerance\n\nA useful way to describe the conditions for robust policy is  through the lens of “fault tolerance.” 9 Fault tolerance is a concept originally used in engineering and is defined as ‘‘the  ability of a system or component to continue normal operation despite the  presence of…faults’’. 10 Applying  this to monetary policy, fault tolerance is related to the sensitivity of  macroeconomic outcomes across various models to changes in the parameters of a monetary  policy rule.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates two representative cases of fault tolerance. In  this example there are two competing models of the economy: A and B in the left  panel, and B and C in the right panel. For the purposes of this figure, the  monetary policy rule is assumed to be fully described by the parameter β. The  two curves trace out the relationship in each model between the parameter β (on  the x-axis) and a measure of the resulting macroeconomic outcome, where larger  values are worse (for example, the outcome could be the variance of the  inflation rate). The optimal choice of the policy parameter is indicated by  β*(X) for model X.\n\nThe left panel of the figure illustrates the case of a high degree  of fault tolerance in both models in that outcomes are not very sensitive to  the choice of the policy parameter. The right panel illustrates the case of low  fault tolerance in model C for values of the parameter β that diverge  significantly from the optimal choice, while model B is the same as in the left  panel.\n\nRobust policies are designed to operate in high-fault-tolerance regions  and avoid low-fault-tolerance regions. In the case illustrated in the left  panel of the figure, a robust policy is characterized by a value of β somewhere  between the optimal values in the two models. This policy is not exactly  optimal in either model but performs well across the two models.\n\nIn the case shown in the right panel of the figure, the robust  policy avoids the intolerant region for model C and is therefore biased toward  the optimal value in model C. Such a policy provides insurance against the  possibility that model C is the true description of the world. The exact choice  of the robust policy depends on the precise specification of the central bank’s  objective function and beliefs about the uncertainty across models.\n\nThree Examples\n\nFault tolerance provides a conceptual framework for thinking about  uncertainty and robust monetary policy. I will now consider three examples of  uncertainty—regarding models, the formation of expectations, and the star  variables like r-star—where robust policies differ from the optimal policy in a  given model and effectively manage the risk of having the wrong model. Each of these cases fits into the examples of fault  tolerance illustrated in Figure 1 .\n\nModel  Uncertainty\n\nThe broadest type of uncertainty for monetary policy is related to  economic models. This can be due to uncertainty about model parameters within a  model or uncertainty about how the economy works across models.\n\nResearch on model uncertainty has highlighted two key findings. 11 First, policies that are designed to be optimal in one model can miss the mark  in other models. This can be especially problematic when policies are optimized  to idiosyncratic features of a particular model that are not common to other  models. Second, even when policies optimized for a specific model are not  robust to model uncertainty, it is generally possible to find robust policies  that perform very well across models. That is, as illustrated by Figure 1 , the  costs of robustness are relatively small compared to the gains in terms of risk  management.\n\nUncertainty  about Expectations Formation\n\nA particularly relevant form of uncertainty for monetary policy  concerns the formation of expectations. In many standard models with rational  expectations, inflation expectations are a priori assumed to be well  anchored. In practice, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding how the  public forms expectations.\n\nIn models where longer-run expectations can become unmoored,  robust policies act more strongly to keep expectations near the target rate than  would otherwise be the case. 12 Specifically, the risk of unmooring of inflation expectations tends to increase  with the persistence and magnitude of inflation deviations from the target—this  is the region of fault intolerance—or low fault tolerance. Therefore, robust  policies are biased to avoid such regions by responding more strongly to  inflation relative to output or unemployment gaps. Furthermore, to the extent  that transparency regarding the central bank’s goals and strategy can help  anchor longer-run expectations, the trade-offs between optimal and robust  policies improve.\n\nBlurry  Stars and Difference Rules\n\nThe final example is uncertainty over the so-called star  variables, such as the natural rates of interest and unemployment. Monetary  policy rules often rely on these, but they are measured imprecisely and change  over time. Under some assumptions, uncertainty about the values of star  variables in isolation should not affect optimal policy; that is, certainty  equivalence holds.\n\nHowever, given the wide range of uncertainties that prevail—including  uncertainty about the processes that determine the star variables—the  assumptions underlying this theoretical conclusion are unlikely to hold in  practice. In this case, acting as if one knows the star variables when making  policy can lead to persistent deviations of inflation from the target that risk  unmooring inflation expectations. 13\n\nFortunately, research has shown that approaches that “follow the  data” and don’t rely as much on estimates of starred variables perform very  well when the uncertainty is very high. 14 A  simple and effective approach is represented by “difference rules,” where the  short-term nominal interest rate is raised or lowered in response to inflation  and changes in economic activity. Combining uncertainty about the formation of  expectations and the star variables exacerbates the risks of unmooring  expectations and reinforces the robustness quality of difference rules. 15\n\nConclusion\n\nMany types of uncertainty are associated with relatively high  fault tolerance and are therefore manageable by taking a robust policy approach  that takes into account a variety of models. In other cases, such as  uncertainty about the formation of expectations and the star variables, fault  tolerance can be lower and non-robust policies can perform very poorly. In  these cases, the risk management implication is to pay the insurance cost in  terms of second-best performance to protect against bad outcomes. A critical  lesson from this research is the importance of maintaining well-anchored  inflation expectations, especially when uncertainty is very high.\n\nThe robust policy approach does not pretend to solve the rules-vs.-discretion  debate, nor does it tell policymakers what they should do in every  circumstance. Instead, it provides insights into the conditions under which  different policy approaches are likely to be successful or not. As such, they  can be useful guides to navigating a highly uncertain world.\n\nFigure",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThis is the ninth year that our joint member agencies have come  together for this conference. It’s been a wonderful five-way partnership. But the  honorific of “greatest crossover of all time” must be awarded to the theme and corresponding  title of my remarks today.\n\nFor those who know of my proclivity to lace my speeches with music  references, no, I am not referring to the crossover of Taylor Swift and  Travis Kelce. Instead, I’m referring—of course—to the epic 29th  episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation , titled “Elementary, Dear Data,”  in which 221B Baker Street meets Enterprise-D in a brilliant Sherlock Holmes-style  mystery. It’s a perennial fan favorite for Trekkies and Sherlockians alike. But  the reason I mention it today is that I’d like to speak about  how data—transactions-based, transparent, and well documented—is elementary to  our collective understanding and decision-making at the Federal Reserve and  beyond.\n\nBefore  I get in any deeper, and rest assured I will, I need to give the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nData  Dashboard\n\nSherlock Holmes stressed the importance of “data, data, data.” I,  too, have been often quoted emphasizing the need to be “data dependent.” 1 In  Sherlock’s world, data means fingerprints, footprints, handwriting, and  ciphers. In our world, data means economic indicators like gross domestic  product, the Consumer Price Index, and the unemployment rate. These numbers make  up the dashboard of what’s happening in the economy.\n\nThese are numbers we can trust. Government agencies in the U.S.  and abroad put an enormous amount of effort into developing the methodology,  implementation, and design of these official statistics. While no specific data  series is without its limitations, we have an excellent understanding of how  these numbers come together and behave over time.\n\nFinancial markets have their own data dashboards too. Equity  indexes, bond yields, and the value of the dollar are just a few aspects of  understanding what’s going on in markets.\n\nAnd policymakers like me aren’t the only ones who are data dependent.  Businesses, households, journalists, and so many others rely on data to support  their understanding of the world around them.\n\nCapital  Mistake\n\nTo be clear, having access to an abundance of data is a wonderful  problem to have. Think about the plethora of data you can pull from a terminal  and the endless ways to use it. Many of us have spent more hours than we’d like  to admit analyzing, plotting, and running regressions on data. And while we  assume that most data are “good,” there are, unfortunately, “bad” data, too.  The very same terminal that gives you access to numbers that are supported by  millions of transactions could also give you access to numbers that have not  seen a transaction in quite some time, if ever. And it can be very hard—too  hard, in fact—to spot the difference.\n\nThis is dangerous. I will echo the warning of our detective friend  Sherlock Holmes: “It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.”  I’ll go a step further and say that it is a capital mistake to theorize before  one fully understands the origins of the data one has downloaded.\n\nLIBOR  No More (But Still Important)\n\nOf course, the prime example of a capital mistake of this nature is  LIBOR. Which, by the way, officially ended 139 days ago, not that I’m still counting. 2, 3 Good riddance! OK, I had to slip in one music reference, but that’s all.\n\nThe lesson of LIBOR is that there are times when what we think of  as strong financial market data is only a mirage. LIBOR was one of the most  widely used benchmarks in the world, underpinning hundreds of trillions of  dollars — that’s trillions, with a “T”—of financial instruments and  contracts. We all know how that ended: LIBOR was inherently fragile and subject  to manipulation. It is astonishing to think about the entire global financial  system relying on the small set of transactions underlying LIBOR. In fact,  during periods of financial market stress, LIBOR was based on no transactions, which is what opened the door to the fraud and bad behavior we  now associate with it.\n\nLIBOR was a wake-up call. It led to the collective realization  that things we think of as data may be merely smoke and mirrors. That’s why the  Federal Reserve, the Financial Stability Board, and many others invested heavily  in the transition off of LIBOR and on to robust reference rates—like the  Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)—that are accurate, carefully  constructed, and transparent.\n\nGood  Data\n\nAs we move forward in the post-LIBOR era, it’s important that we  continue to prioritize transparency and clarity in data, especially financial  market data. This is particularly true in the age of AI, when the sources of  data are harder to trace.\n\nSo,  in addition to SOFR, what do “good data” look like? How can we, as Captain  Picard would say, “Make it so”?\n\nTo  start, I’d point to the Principles for Financial Benchmarks set forth by the International  Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which established a very  stringent and specific model for reference rates. As an administrator and producer of reference rates,  the New York Fed is committed to producing rates aligned with this gold  standard. 4\n\nOther examples include our  regular market surveys. 5 , 6 Questions for both the Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market  Participants are readily available on our website, as are  the respondents and aggregated responses. Our Survey of Consumer Expectations  follows a similarly demanding standard. 7 If  data are worth using, it’s absolutely worth the effort to make sure people know  what they are getting.\n\nWe have also increased transparency with Trade Reporting and  Compliance Engine (TRACE) data. This initiative, which was started in 2017 to  fill in the gaps on Treasury transaction data, is a significant component of a  broader interagency effort to enhance understanding and transparency of the  Treasury securities market. This has proven valuable as it has allowed the  official sector to closely track developments in the cash Treasury market. Also currently underway are efforts to further increase  the transparency of this data to the public, including plans to share  transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupon securities. 8 , 9\n\nCan’t  Make Bricks Without Clay\n\nEfforts like these are important because increased transparency  and clarity around data leads to better decision-making. “I can’t make bricks  without clay,” Holmes said in The Adventure of the Copper Beeches . He understood  that he first needed to compile the facts before building out the case. I argued  a similar point in 2021 about LIBOR. If you try to build on a foundation that  is not absolutely sound, you are risking trouble at some point in the future. 10\n\nUnfortunately, this issue is frequently  underappreciated by users of financial market data, as transparency and  information on the sources of data are often scant.\n\nI will use my  favorite example of inflation options to illustrate the broader point. During the  recent bout of high inflation, some journalists, researchers, and analysts have  trumpeted the “market’s estimate” of the probability of certain high inflation  outcomes using “data” on the prices of inflation options. These so-called “prices”  are easily downloaded from data platforms.\n\nBut here’s  the catch: based on our market contacts and public  reporting of derivatives transactions, these aren’t data at all. There have  been no trades reported in the U.S. inflation options market since early 2021. The  so-called data that people are citing are generated by a model, not from  investors putting real money on the line as is frequently claimed. The  situation is similar in Europe. Although there are scattered trades in euro area  and UK inflation options, market contacts tell us that liquidity in that market  is extraordinarily thin, and most of what little activity there is in this  market is related to complex financial products and the risk of deflation and  not hedging higher inflation.\n\nMore broadly, there is an opportunity for central banks, governments,  and the private sector to come together to improve data transparency and  accuracy. It takes a global village—regulatory groups, industry groups, and global  standard setters like IOSCO all have a role to play. We must use forums and  collaborations like these to think through the opportunities to further develop  data transparency and make improvements. One benefit of this conference is the  partnerships it has fostered. Participants have accomplished so much by working  together. And given our collective reliance on data, this must continue to be a  priority moving forward.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that increasing transparency in some  cases may face challenges. But that is not a reason to hinder our work in this  space. Past experiences have proven that there are solutions that allow for  greater transparency and confidence in data, without distorting or undermining  the markets themselves.\n\nClosing\n\nI hope that you took two things away from my remarks today. The  first is that you’ve been inspired to go home and dust off your Star Trek DVDs.  The second is to heed my call to action. We must continue to work together to  increase data transparency and understanding, so that we can have greater  market confidence and make better decisions.\n\nIt is elementary, my dear colleagues.",

    "text": "Thank  you for the warm introduction. It’s an absolute pleasure to be back at the  London School of Economics, where I completed my Master’s degree in the late  1980s. Studying at the LSE, with remarkable professors like Richard Layard,  Chris Pissarides, George Evans, and the late Tony Atkinson, inspired me to  pursue a career in economics and public policy. I owe a great debt of gratitude  to this institution and am in awe of how it has evolved and grown in the past 30  years.\n\nI  will say that there are a few things I have not missed since my days in London:  the food (yes, that has changed!), the high cost of living (some things never  change), and the endless studying for and worrying about final exams. But I  have missed the dear friends I made, the book shops, and the library.\n\nIt’s  ironic that I find myself back at the London School of Economics and NOT talking about economics. The views I  bring to today’s discussion come from professional and personal, rather than  academic experience.\n\nI’ve  now led two major organizations, and culture is both the hardest and the most  important thing to get right. Culture is at the heart of behavior and norms,  and the single most important factor driving the decision-making of employees.  It’s not an exaggeration to say that culture is critical—both when things go  right, and when they go wrong.\n\nBefore  I get any deeper into ideas about culture, I should give the standard Fed  disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily  reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nCulture Shapes Our Working Lives\n\nWhen  we talk about company culture in the context of financial services, the first  thing that comes to mind is the risky, unethical, and sometimes criminal  behavior in the banking industry, particularly during the financial crisis. And  10 years on from the crisis, this behavior persists. Instances of fraud, money  laundering, and scandals related to foreign exchange and LIBOR continue to make  the headlines. 1\n\nThis  behavior puts a spotlight on the essential role of robust regulation and strict  enforcement.\n\nBut  illicit and unethical behavior is rarely the result of an isolated “bad apple.”  It’s more often the symptom of a rotten culture. And rotten cultures don’t  appear overnight—nor for that matter do positive, inclusive ones, where people  feel empowered and accountable to upholding the values of the organization.\n\nCulture  is created—intentionally or otherwise—by the structures, incentives, and  behavioral norms that shape our working lives.\n\nToday  I want to move our attention away from the extreme behavior that makes the  headlines, and think more deeply about organizational cultures.\n\nWhat  does a good culture look like? How can leaders in the industry establish a  positive culture within their firms? And perhaps hardest of all, how do you  ensure that a firm’s culture adapts to the changing world, but still stays true  to its values and purpose?\n\nAn Ethical Dilemma\n\nConsider  this: 2\n\nA  junior banker on a successful real estate investment team is asked to run  projections for future rental income for a mall in Hong Kong. As part of her  research she notices a number in a spreadsheet that inflates future cash flows  by 4 percent. She asks a senior analyst if the number should be flagged as an optimistic  assumption, so it’s clear it’s not based on evidence. The senior analyst  responds by saying the number is a more conservative estimate than many. He  says it’s a “judgment call” and that they can discuss it once the project has  concluded.\n\nBut  the project comes and goes, everyone is busy, and the senior analyst doesn’t  bring it up again.\n\nThis  scenario raises numerous questions: Should the junior team member raise the  issue again or should she let it go? What was driving the behavior of the  senior analyst? And why did no one else on the team view the situation as an  ethical dilemma?\n\nThese  are the kinds of issues that people often face in a work environment. And this  example demonstrates many of the ways culture influences behavior.\n\nEmployees  may enter an organization with a strong sense of right and wrong. What they may  not realize is that group norms can exert a powerful magnetic pull on their  moral compass.\n\nThe  junior banker knew the way the number was being presented was unethical, and  yet she complied with her boss. The response from the senior analyst,  describing the situation as a “judgment call,” is a common phenomenon. Using a  euphemism to describe the inflated statistic camouflages the wrongdoing and  makes it sound more acceptable to others.\n\nWe  see it in our daily lives—terms like “troublemaker” and “not being a team  player” are often used to shift the onus from the person whose behavior is  being challenged to the challenger.\n\nAnn  Tenbrunsel’s work has been very important for revealing how we use language to  disguise or excuse behavior we know to be unacceptable. 3\n\nOne  of the other issues this example illustrates is how organizational norms affect  our own sense of what’s right and wrong and whether to speak up.\n\nMany  of you here today will be familiar with the Asch experiment, where students  participated in a vision test. There was a control line and three other lines  labelled A, B, and C. Participants had to state aloud which line was the same  length as the control. But they had to do so after a group of actors had given  an incorrect answer. 4\n\nAbout  one third of participants went along with the majority, even though it was  readily apparent their answers were incorrect. 5 When asked why they went along with the group they said it was because they  wanted to fit in, or because they believed the group was better informed than  they were.\n\nDoes  the junior banker drop the issue in an effort to fit in? Does she raise the  issue in private, or does she call a company hotline? The answer depends on the  complex relationship between the individual and the culture in which they work.\n\nI’m  particularly looking forward to hearing from Celia Moore. She spoke at the New  York Fed last year and discussed how organizations set goals and motivate  people to achieve them. Praise, penalties, and rewards all influence an individual’s  behavior. Signals from the organization’s leadership also have a major role to  play: do the higher echelons of management value divergent views? Do they  foster a culture where people feel empowered to speak up? 6\n\nAll  of these things shape how an individual will respond to an ethical dilemma,  whether they will acknowledge it as such, and how they will lead others as they  move up in an organization.\n\nAs  financial services professionals with great technical expertise, we often fall  into the trap of thinking we can solve all of our problems on our own. But we  have so much to learn from experts in other fields.\n\nStrengths as Blind Spots\n\nOne  of the most important lessons I’ve learned as a CEO is that there’s no fixed  endpoint when it comes to shaping an organization’s culture. You can never take  a step back and say, “We’ve finished the culture project. Well done! Now it’s time  to focus our efforts elsewhere.”\n\nCulture  is constantly evolving, and therefore needs to be constantly nurtured. One of  the most challenging elements is that there’s no clear benchmark for success.  And sometimes your greatest strengths can become your blind spots.\n\nAs  an organization with a public mission and regulatory responsibilities, the Fed needs  to have a particular focus on compliance. But cultures with a heavy focus on  compliance can breed a sense that individuals aren’t responsible for their  actions.\n\nAs  a CEO, I’ve tackled these issues by focusing on principles and values rather  than writing extensive policies that try to cover every potential decision.  This puts a premium on individual accountability to do what’s right and  creating an environment where everyone has the ability and responsibility to  speak up. Somewhat paradoxically, focusing on principled decision making and  accountability, rather than relying exclusively on rules and policies, can be  the most effective safeguard against wrongdoing and unethical behavior.\n\nWhat’s the Way Forward?\n\nCreating  a positive work culture is challenging and ongoing work. And there’s no silver  bullet that can solve cultural problems overnight.\n\nIn  terms of how to move forward I’d like to make three brief points before I  close:\n\nFirst,  the fact that we’re all sitting here in this room is a very positive sign. That  so many leaders from major firms are here today, engaged in these issues, is a  symbol of how organizational culture is moving up the agenda.\n\nThe  second is that the Banking Standards Board survey is a terrific tool for  getting a snapshot of what your organization’s culture looks like and how it’s  changing over time. It goes far beyond typical engagement questionnaires and  provides powerful insights into the values of employees and the characteristics  of an organization. 7 It’s impossible to make progress if you don’t have an accurate picture of your  starting point.\n\nThe  third is that when it comes to culture, I encourage everyone to look beyond  their own lens of expertise. The Fed couldn’t do its work without the deep  knowledge of economists, lawyers, and statisticians. But the solutions to  challenges related to a firm’s culture are unlikely to be found if we keep our  focus narrowly trained on our own specialties. We have so much to learn from experts  in psychology, ethics, and management.\n\nThat’s  one reason I’ve been so looking forward to today’s panel discussion. It brings  together experts from many of these fields, whose combined insights are the key  to moving us all toward the business culture we want to see.\n\nLearn more about the New York Fed’s work on governance and culture reform .",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI’m honored to be here today among so many Economic Club of New  York members, fellows, students, and staff. The Club has the privilege of  hosting incredible speakers, but it’s our members who truly create the robust,  dynamic environment for our discussions. Thank you for being part of this  wonderful organization.\n\nAs  I look ahead to the end of my term as Club chair, I’d like to thank my  predecessor in this role, Marie-Josée Kravis; our board members; our tireless President  and CEO, Barbara Van Allen; and the small yet remarkably productive staff of  the Club. When I began my term as chair back in June of 2020, the ECNY was strong  and vibrant, all thanks to their vision, commitment, and hard work.\n\nAt  the same time, 2020 was a period of tremendous uncertainty for the ECNY. After  all, our hallmark was in-person events. With the onset of the pandemic, we  needed to reinvent what it meant to be the ECNY in very short order. We all quickly  came together and innovated to an incredible degree so that we could reach our members  in new ways. Zoom became our meeting room, and we later found success in hybrid  events. We launched new programs, including a series focused on Diversity,  Equity, and Inclusion, the Innovation and Social Impact Challenge, and the  podcast. And we did it while maintaining the financial strength of the Club.\n\nHere  is one statistic that captures the dramatic evolution of the Club. Over the  past four years, we held 100 events, or 25 per year, on average. That compares  to 660 events in the prior 113 years, or about six per year. That’s over a 300  percent increase in productivity! There are many exciting things planned for  the future, and I look forward to watching the Club evolve and prosper in the  years to come.\n\nFor today’s discussion, I’ll transition away from my role as ECNY chair  and back to my job as president of the New York Fed. I’ll spend some time  focusing on how the Federal Reserve is working to achieve both maximum  employment and price stability. I’ll also discuss the progress we’ve seen in  the economy in terms of getting supply and demand in better balance and  bringing inflation back down to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) 2  percent longer-run goal. Finally, I’ll share my view on where the economy is  headed.\n\nNow  I need to provide the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today  are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in  the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe  Dual Mandate\n\nAs I never tire in saying, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy  goals are clear: maximum employment and price stability. The overarching  objective of monetary policy today is to bring inflation down to 2 percent over  time while maintaining a strong labor market.\n\nEconomic  Progress\n\nThe good news is that over the past two years, we have made  considerable progress toward these objectives. After last year’s strong GDP and  job growth, incoming data point to a slowing, but still solid pace of growth in  economic activity in the first half of this year. Demand-supply imbalances have  diminished. Global supply chains, which were severely disrupted during the  pandemic and early in the recovery, have mostly returned to normal. At the same  time, inflation has come down considerably.\n\nLet me dive deeper into the maximum employment side of our  mandate. First and foremost, the labor market remains quite strong. Labor supply has been boosted by high levels  of labor force participation among individuals aged 25-54 years, as well as by  increased immigration flows. The unemployment  rate has been under 4 percent for more than two years—the longest such stretch  in over 50 years. This measure—now at 3.9 percent—is close to my estimate for  the unemployment rate that is likely to prevail over the longer run.\n\nEven as the economy and labor market remain  strong, various labor market indicators show that demand-supply imbalances that  emerged following the pandemic continue to recede. Most of these measures have  returned to pre-pandemic levels. But two are still signaling a tighter labor  market than before the pandemic: job vacancies and wage growth. After  skyrocketing over the course of 2021 and early 2022, the rate of job openings  has subsequently steadily declined, but still remains elevated relative to  pre-pandemic levels. Wage  growth has displayed a similar pattern,  including for so-called job switchers for whom wage growth is highly sensitive  to labor market conditions. 1 That said, wage growth has yet to fully return to levels consistent with 2  percent price inflation on a sustained basis.\n\nThat provides a nice segue to the topic of inflation, the other  half of our mandate. Inflation has declined significantly since mid-2022. This  drop has been broad-based, with inflation lower in all major categories—food,  energy, goods, and services. The 12-month percent change in the personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) price index has continued to decline, falling  from its 40-year high of above 7 percent in mid-2022 to 2.7 percent in the  latest reading. The decline in inflation has benefited from a reduction in  demand and supply imbalances, both here in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nIndeed, this phenomenon is not unique to  the United States. Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European economies  experienced historically high inflation and have similarly seen relatively  rapid declines in inflation as well. In fact, based on the Harmonized Index of  Consumer Prices, the inflation rates in the euro area, Sweden, the United  Kingdom, and the United States are all now nearly the same. While every region  has its own set of conditions, global factors affected inflation in advanced  economies around the world. 2\n\nEven with this good news, inflation in the United States remains  too high, and in recent months there has been a lack of further progress toward  our 2 percent goal. Extracting the signal from the noise when it comes to  inflation readings is especially challenging now, since the economy is still  feeling the aftershocks of the supply chain issues and high inflation following  the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\n\nI’ll point to a few areas of research  developed by my colleagues at the New York Fed to better understand the data. The  most recent reading of our Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation measure was  2.6 percent in March, about the same level as it was in December, and down nearly  3 percentage points from its peak in June 2022. 3 Furthermore, measures of inflation expectations from our  Survey of Consumer Expectations have remained broadly stable and are generally in  line with their pre-Covid ranges at all horizons. 4 And global supply chain issues have  mostly receded, according to both our Global Supply Chain Pressure Index and evidence  from our regional surveys of businesses. 5, 6\n\nOverall, I see some of the recent inflation readings as  representing mostly a reversal of the unusually low readings of the second half  of last year, rather than a break in the overall downward direction of  inflation. With the economy coming into better balance over time and the  disinflation taking place in other economies reducing global inflationary  pressures, I expect inflation to resume moderating in the second half of this  year. But let me be clear: inflation is still above our 2 percent longer-run  target, and I am very focused on ensuring we achieve both of our dual mandate goals.\n\nEconomic  Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy?\n\nIt’s important to note that many factors beyond monetary policy influence  the economy and financial markets. These include global drivers of supply and  demand, as well as factors that are currently affecting the supply side of the  U.S. economy that are driving up GDP and job growth. Therefore, the stance of  monetary policy needs to be considered in this broader context, and cannot be understood  simply by looking at the growth rate of the economy, or comparing the interest  rate to its longer-run level or r-star.\n\nLooking at this broader context, the behavior of the economy over  the past year provides ample evidence that monetary policy is restrictive in a  way that helps us achieve our goals. We are seeing clear and consistent signs  that the imbalances between supply and demand in the economy are receding. And  we have seen a broad-based decline in inflation. Overall, the risks to  achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals have moved toward  better balance over the past year.\n\nAt its May meeting, the FOMC kept the  target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In  announcing that decision, the Committee said it “does not expect it will be  appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence  that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” 7\n\nAdditionally,  the Committee said it will  “continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and  agency mortgage‑backed securities,” and beginning in June, “will slow the pace  of decline of its securities holdings.” The decision to  slow the pace is in no way indicating an imminent cessation of shrinking the  balance sheet. Rather, by slowing the pace,  we’re better able to monitor conditions and facilitate a smooth  transition to the appropriate level of ample reserves.\n\nI see the  current stance of monetary policy as being well positioned to continue the  progress we’ve made toward achieving our objectives.  In terms of my forecast for the economy, I expect GDP growth this year to be between  2 and 2-1/2 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to be about 4 percent at  the end of this year, and then move gradually down to its longer-run level of  3-3/4 percent thereafter. As the growth of economic activity gradually slows  and demand and supply continue to come into better balance, I expect overall  PCE inflation to moderate to about 2-1/2 percent this year, before moving  closer to 2 percent next year.\n\nIt goes without saying that the outlook is uncertain. The risks  are two-sided, with geopolitical events and China’s growth outlook prominent  examples. Because of this, we will continue to keep an eye on the totality of  the data, so that we make policy decisions that ensure that we get inflation  sustainably back to 2 percent while maintaining a strong labor market.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll close with this. We have seen a great deal of progress toward  our goals over the past two years. I am confident that we will restore price  stability and set the stage for sustained economic prosperity. We are committed  to getting the job done.",

    "text": "Connecticut is home to many important business ideas and  inventions: the toothpaste tube, the can opener, and the Frisbee, which  everyone knows really originated here , not in California. And in 1889, inventor  William Gray installed the world’s first payphone just a short walk from where  we are gathered today. He turned a personal need into a business opportunity.  As the saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention.\n\nThere’s a wonderful legacy of Connecticut business leadership. And  I’m honored to speak before the entrepreneurs and innovators here today who are  building a dynamic economy and ensuring a strong future for the state.\n\nIn recent years, swings in inflation and the labor market have  greatly affected businesses—undoubtedly including many of yours. So today, I’m  going to discuss the rise and fall of inflation—from unacceptably high to  within striking distance of the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run goal—as well as the  labor market’s return to balance. I’ll also talk about how monetary policy is  working to achieve the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price  stability. And finally, I’ll speak about what’s going on specifically in this  region before providing my economic outlook.\n\nBefore I continue, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that  the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve  System.\n\nWhere  the Economy Stands Today\n\nWith the start of a new year, it’s important to establish where  the economy stands today before we dive in to where it’s headed.\n\nRight now, the economy is in a very good place. Over the past two  and a half years, the labor market has cooled gradually from its red-hot peaks but  remains solid. Inflation has likewise cooled but is still somewhat above our 2  percent longer-run target. And GDP growth continues to be strong, averaging  about 3 percent per year over the past two years.\n\nOverall, the economy has returned to balance. I’ve been calling  this balance “equipoise”—a word you may only come across in a Merriam-Webster  dictionary. Which, by the way, is thanks to yet another great Connecticut  innovator!\n\nBecause of these trends, the FOMC has taken steps to move its  monetary policy stance from one that tightly constrains demand to one that is less  restrictive. The target range for the federal funds rate is currently 4.25% to  4.5%, reflecting the Committee’s three rate cuts in the latter part of 2024. 1\n\nI’m often asked why the Fed cut rates in the face of such strong  growth. And the answer is that while growth in demand has been strong, growth  in supply has been even stronger. Specifically, robust growth in both the labor  force and in productivity has meant that the economy has been able to expand at  a faster pace than we saw before the pandemic, without creating inflationary  pressures.\n\nSince the Federal Reserve’s mandate is to achieve maximum  employment and price stability, we want to see demand in line with supply and  keep the risks to achieving our goals in balance. Because that balance has now  been achieved, our job is to ensure the risks remain in balance.\n\nThe  Inflation Journey\n\nBefore I explain more about how we’ll do that, I’ll dive deeper  into each side of our mandate, starting with inflation.\n\nThe past five years since the onset of the pandemic have been  quite a journey—and not an easy one. The enormous pandemic-related shocks to  the global economy, along with Russia’s war against Ukraine and other factors,  caused inflation to surge to a 40-year high of 7-1/4 percent in June of 2022,  as measured by the 12-month percent change in the personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) price index. Although there have been bumps along the way, that number  has made its way back down. Inflation is now a little below 2-1/2 percent,  according to the latest reading.\n\nThat’s a dramatic fall, and the process of disinflation remains in  train. But we are still not at our 2 percent goal, and it will take more time  until we can achieve that on a sustained basis.\n\nI’ll highlight a number of indicators that reinforce my view that  inflation is moving toward our goal of 2 percent.\n\nFirst, the disinflation process has been broad-based, including  all the major categories of goods and services. The one laggard is housing  inflation, which largely encompasses rises in rents for rental units and in  implied rents for homes that are owned. But I expect the disinflationary  process to continue there, too, as rate increases for new leases remain low,  and are gradually being reflected in official inflation measures.\n\nA second set of indicators that I look at includes measures of  underlying inflation. I’ll mention two—namely, the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE  inflation and the New York Fed’s Multivariate Core Trend inflation. As  inflation rose following the pandemic and the onset of Russia’s war on Ukraine,  both measures climbed sharply, peaking at about 5-1/2 percent in the summer and  fall of 2022. Since then, we’ve seen rapid declines, with both falling to about  2-1/4 percent, although the progress has been choppy and has slowed over the  past year and a half. 2\n\nThe final indicator that I’ll highlight is that survey- and  market-based measures show that inflation expectations remain well anchored. The  latest Survey of Consumer Expectations shows inflation expectations have stayed  within their pre-pandemic ranges across all horizons. 3\n\nA  Labor Market in Balance\n\nAll in all, we are making great strides to bring inflation down.  And looking at the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we have  also seen significant progress and the labor market has come into balance.\n\nIn the aftermath of the pandemic, there were too many job openings  and not enough people to fill them. Since then, labor supply has increased  meaningfully, and demand has eased.\n\nOver the past two and a half years we have seen a gradual cooling  in the labor market from very tight conditions. We saw this cooling across a wide  range of indicators, including measures of vacancies, quits and hires rates,  surveys of job and worker availability, and job finding and layoff rates. We  are now seeing some signs of stabilization in the labor market. In particular, after  touching a historically low level of 3.4 percent in early 2023, the  unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent and has changed little over the  past six months.\n\nGiven this encouraging evidence, I do not expect the labor market  to be a source of inflationary pressures going forward.\n\nRegional  Developments\n\nOn a more local level, developments across the Federal Reserve’s  Second District—which includes western Connecticut as well as New York, northern  New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—largely mirror those at  the national level.\n\nHere, too, economic activity has held steady. Inflation has made  its way back down, as the pace of both output and input price increases has mostly  returned to pre-pandemic norms. And although there are limited signs of  layoffs, businesses report that demand for workers is softening.\n\nZooming in on Connecticut in particular, I’ll note that while economic  conditions for workers here have mostly normalized, the pandemic created shifts  in the types of jobs people have, as there’s been a churn in the industry  composition. For the most part, “office jobs” that are conducive to remote work  are doing well. Healthcare is booming. Sectors that rely on foot traffic from  office workers and others, however, have not bounced back quite as much.\n\nData-Dependent  Monetary Policy\n\nLet me bring it back to what we can expect in 2025 and beyond.\n\nAs I say often, the path for monetary policy will depend on the  data. The economic outlook remains highly uncertain, especially around  potential fiscal, trade, immigration, and regulatory policies. Therefore, our  decisions on future monetary policy actions will continue to be based on the  totality of the data, the evolution of the economic outlook, and the risks to  achieving our dual mandate goals. Our focus is on using our tools to best  achieve our goals.\n\nBased on what we know today, I expect real GDP growth to slow  somewhat to around 2 percent this year, in part reflecting the effects of lower  immigration. I anticipate the unemployment rate will remain around 4 to 4-1/4  percent this year. Looking ahead, I expect inflation to gradually decline  toward our 2 percent goal in the coming years.\n\nIn terms of the Fed’s balance sheet, the Committee’s process to  slow the pace of decline of our securities holdings is proceeding smoothly.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll close by reiterating that the economy is in a very good place  and has returned to balance, as have the risks to the two sides of our mandate  of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nBut much like the development of all great inventions, there is  still work to be done. While I expect that disinflation will progress, it will  take time, and the process may well be choppy. Monetary policy is well positioned  to keep the risks to our goals in balance.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood  morning, and welcome to the seventh annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference.  This is our second time gathering virtually. Although I miss seeing all of you  in person here at the New York Fed, I am pleased that so many of you could join  us today.\n\nThis  conference is a great opportunity for market participants, as well as members  of five public-sector bodies—the Treasury, the Board of Governors, the SEC, the  CFTC, and the New York Fed—to come together and take stock of the U.S. Treasury  market. The events of the past 20 months have further underscored this market's  significance in the global economy—and the important role our five entities  perform in ensuring that it functions as it should.\n\nIn  fact, the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG)  came together to examine recent, notable disruptions to the Treasury market,  and it issued a report ahead of this conference that identifies steps to  strengthen its functioning and resilience. 1 I won't have time to go  over the report in detail, but I strongly encourage everyone to read it.\n\nSevere  disruptions to critical financial markets like we saw last spring should be  rare. But just as a town ravaged by flooding will seek to rebuild in ways that  help it withstand the next big storm, so, too, must we think about how to shore  up the Treasury market so it can better endure the next big shock.\n\nToday,  I'm going to touch on the notable market disruptions that have taken place over  the past decade. Then, I'll discuss the imperative of a resilient Treasury  market. I'll close by challenging all of us to come together to prepare for the  future.\n\nAs  always, before I continue, I must give the standard Fed disclaimer that the  views I express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLook Back to  Prepare for the Future\n\nA  well-functioning U.S. Treasury market is critically important for our economy  and, in fact, the entire world. It enables the safe and stable flow of capital  and credit to households, businesses, and governments. It serves as a primary  benchmark for pricing in other financial markets, both domestic and global.  Last, but definitely not least, it's vitally important for the effective  transmission of monetary policy to the broader financial system and to the  economy.\n\nThankfully,  most days—most years—the Treasury and related markets function incredibly well.  But in the past decade, these markets have experienced three abrupt and notable  disruptions, each of increasing severity. First was the so-called flash rally  of October 2014; then, the repo market distress in September 2019; and third,  the extraordinary dislocations at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March  of 2020.\n\nGeneral  George Patton once said, \"Prepare for the unknown by studying how others in the  past have coped with the unforeseeable and unpredictable.\" It's a good piece of  advice—and one that should guide our work on Treasury market reform.\n\nThe  IAWG report I mentioned earlier reviews these events, so I won't repeat them  here. However, two lessons are clear. First, the unforeseeable and  unpredictable will happen, and can result in significant stresses in the  Treasury and related markets that may spread to broader financial conditions.  Second, when disruptions have been sufficiently severe and persistent, the  market has not been able to quickly self-correct without official-sector  intervention.\n\nThe  severe disruptions to the Treasury and funding markets in March of last year  illustrate these points. The incipient breakdown in market functioning quickly  spread to other segments of the U.S. and global financial markets, risking a  broad-based pullback in the availability of credit that is essential for our  economy.\n\nThe  speed and extent of the market disruption necessitated immediate and dramatic  action, the scale of which was truly unprecedented. At the New York Fed, we are  used to talking in very large sums, but even for us, the figures were  staggering. We were offering overnight repos of up to $1 trillion, as well as  substantial amounts of term repos of longer maturities. 2 The sizeable offerings  were designed to meet the markets' needs and provide confidence that liquidity  would be available. At their peak in mid-March of 2020, our repo operations  reached nearly $500 billion.\n\nBut  repos alone were not enough to restore smooth market functioning. The FOMC also  directed the Open Market Trading Desk at the New York Fed to engage in  large-scale purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) to support smooth functioning of those markets.\n\nThe  pace and amount of asset purchases during this period was unmatched. During the  worst of the crisis last year, the Federal Reserve was purchasing more than  $300 billion of Treasuries per week, which was more than the Treasury purchases  in the entire first round of quantitative easing in response to the Global  Financial Crisis. And in the three months starting in the middle of March, the  Federal Reserve purchased more than $2.3 trillion of Treasury and agency MBS  combined.\n\nThese  actions, along with prompt fiscal measures enacted by Congress and emergency  steps taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies, ultimately  proved successful at restoring functioning in the Treasury and other financial  markets. Together, these measures averted what could have been a severe  financial crisis that would have had devasting effects on the economy. But they  are also a stark reminder that these markets are not nearly as resilient as  they should be.\n\nThe Imperative of  Resilience\n\nAfter  studying this event and others, the IAWG has proposed a number of principles to  guide public policy for Treasury market reform. 3 It has also established  several workstreams to study aspects of the Treasury market and help us achieve  our collective objectives of financing the government efficiently, supporting  the broader financial system, and implementing monetary policy.\n\nThe  IAWG's No. 1 principle and No. 1 workstream center around improving market  resilience. I think it's safe to say that strengthening resilience is at the  top of everyone's Treasury reform list.\n\nResilience  is the imperative of all markets—and that is especially true in the Treasury  market because of its central role in the financial system. The adage of the  financial markets is that Treasuries are safe havens, even in the most  turbulent times.\n\nThe  Treasury market has been able to absorb many shocks through the years. But as  the world changes, the market, too, evolves. The growth of electronic trading  has transformed the mix of intermediaries and trading practices. Firms now  increasingly have access to multiple financial markets, and markets are  increasingly interconnected.\n\nWhen  the Treasury market breaks down, when trading is disrupted, or when interest  rates move in ways that are not based on fundamentals, the ripple effects can  be swift—and devastating to the flow of credit to businesses and households.\n\nWhat  we've learned during crises is that when the flow of credit to the economy is  at stake, we must act quickly and decisively. This is not a choice. If we don't  act effectively, the repercussions on the U.S. economy—and the global  economy—are severe. In each of the past two notable market dislocations, the  dysfunctions arose swiftly, and we, too, acted quickly to take steps that were  effective in restoring the functioning and confidence in markets.\n\nBut  each event exposed weaknesses. Over time, weaknesses can erode confidence. So  now, the challenge before us is this: How do we strengthen the most important  market in the world in a way that helps us avoid having to take dramatic steps  to cure impairments during the middle of a future crisis?\n\nHow  do we prepare for what we can't foresee and can't predict?\n\nThink Differently\n\nOne  thing that is clear when examining the causes of these market disruptions is  that they were not primarily driven by economic forces, but rather by a failure  of the markets to function in the ways they were expected to do in response to  those particular circumstances.\n\nThese  sharp market disruptions teach us important lessons. A number of experts in  this field—including the IAWG—have been doing excellent work in identifying  potential solutions to ensure that similar disruptions don't happen again. It's  essential that we all continue to work together to increase the resilience of  the Treasury market—and this conference is a great opportunity to move that  process forward.\n\nIt's  also clear that we need not start from a position of how things are, but  instead, how they should be. Let's not think of how we can reform, but how we  can design. Let's create a system that can better withstand the unforeseeable  and the unpredictable.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese  are difficult, complicated issues. But complexity doesn't need to get in the  way of getting back to principles or impede necessary action. Look no further  to what we just accomplished with LIBOR. On January 1st, we are  taking a giant leap in moving to a post-LIBOR world. That's a monumental feat  for financial market reform—and it was made possible by a significant,  prolonged, and coordinated effort by the private and official sectors across  the globe.\n\nWith  Treasury market reform, we must take the same approach of bringing together the  best ideas from the public and private sectors. Three episodes of market  dysfunction over the past decade are too many. Let's work together to build a  system that is truly resilient and can withstand the challenges of our time—and  of the future.\n\nThank  you.",

    "text": "It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to participate in the 42nd annual Central Banking Seminar. This is truly an impressive group—our largest ever—with so many countries, institutions, and central bank departments represented. The program and speakers are similarly wide-ranging: You can expect to hear not only about the global economy, monetary policy, financial stability and supervision, technology, operations, and payments, but also about issues outside the usual central banking orbit. We see this breadth of coverage and participation as a key distinction and strength of the Seminar.\n\nThe long history of the Central Banking Seminar reflects the New York Fed’s deep commitment to strengthening central bank cooperation over the long term. Such cooperation is vital to better understanding the world around us and the execution of our responsibilities. Those relationships are also essential during times of financial stress, and were critical to managing events during the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nA broad perspective is absolutely necessary for central bankers today given the tremendous array of issues we face, the high level of economic and financial integration across the globe, and a range of uncertainties within and outside our traditional remit. A short list of current issues includes policy normalization in the advanced economies; potential spillovers to emerging market economies (EMEs); fragility in some EMEs; ongoing economic and financial adjustment in China; trade policy tensions; and Brexit.\n\nSo, there should be no shortage of things to talk about. Diverse perspectives often lead to better thinking and outcomes, and given the variety of experiences represented today, I expect a very fruitful set of discussions.\n\nAnd that brings me  to a key theme of my remarks today:  What  does “normal” monetary policy look like?   Before I go any further, I should note that what I have to say  represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nStrong,  Strong, Strong\n\nMy take on the  economy is well summarized by the most recent FOMC statement, in which we used variations  on the word “strong” five times in only four short paragraphs.  The statement references “strong” labor  market conditions, “strong” job gains, and a “strong” rate of growth in  economic activity, household spending and business fixed investment. 1 Although this may suggest that we really need  to consult a thesaurus, at least we can’t be accused of ambiguity.\n\nThe Fed has attained  its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability about as  well as it ever has, with most indicators pointing to a very strong labor  market indeed—including an unemployment rate below 4 percent—and an inflation rate  very near our longer-run goal of 2 percent.\n\nWith fiscal  stimulus and favorable financial conditions providing tailwinds to the economy,  the outlook is for more of the same.  Let  me put some hard numbers to that:  I  expect real GDP to increase by 3 percent this year and by 2.5 percent in  2019.  This above-trend pace of growth  should lead to continued solid job gains and further declines in  unemployment.  I expect the unemployment  rate to fall slightly below 3.5 percent next year, the lowest level in nearly 50  years.\n\nIn keeping with  the strong economy, I expect price inflation to edge up a bit above 2 percent,  but don’t see any signs of greater inflationary pressures on the horizon.  And, I continue to expect that further  gradual increases in interest rates will best foster a sustained economic  expansion and achievement of our dual mandate goals.\n\nI should hasten to  add that not everyone has shared equally in this otherwise strong economy.  The unevenness of the recovery is evident in  my travels around the Second District, where, for example, the economic recovery  in upstate New York continues to lag the nation as a whole.  So, while the national economy is in good  shape, longer-run economic challenges have meant that not all Americans have benefited  from the improvement in the economy.  Beyond  supporting a strong overall economy, monetary policy has limited reach into  these issues, which are best addressed through other means, such as investments  in education, workforce development, and economic development.\n\nThree  Stages of Monetary Policy Normalization\n\nIn thinking about  the outlook for monetary policy, it’s useful to remember how we got to where we  are today.  The financial crisis and the  Great Recession led the FOMC to lower the federal funds rate target to near  zero and to keep it there for seven years.   This lengthy spell at zero reflected the long shadow of the  crisis—evident in the subsequent subdued growth rate and inflation rate—and the  need for the economy to convalesce after enormous trauma.  With the unemployment rate still very high  and inflation low, the Federal Reserve embarked on a long journey through terra incognita of unconventional  monetary policy actions, including large-scale asset purchases and forward  guidance on the future path of interest rates.   We weren’t alone:  Indeed, some central  banks across the globe went even further down the road of unconventional  policies.\n\nIn part due to the  Fed’s actions, the U.S. economy gradually recovered, and as a result the FOMC has  been slowly but surely moving monetary policy “back to normal.”  This process can be thought of in three  stages.\n\nStage  1: Lift-off\n\nThe first stage in  policy normalization focused on the lift-off of the federal funds rate target from  near zero, which occurred in December 2015.  But, well before that happened, the FOMC went to  great effort to communicate its thinking to the public to better prepare it for  the upcoming change in policy. 2 Importantly, we also made extensive  preparations to ensure that we were ready and able to raise rates as needed, in the context of a very large Fed  balance sheet and bank reserves.  And,  consistent with the Fed’s aim to be as transparent as possible, we published our  plans on how we would use interest rates paid on bank reserves and overnight  reverse repurchase agreements to keep the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s  target range. 3\n\nAt the time—in  light of the shallow recovery and low inflation—the FOMC was very focused on  balancing the risk of a premature removal of accommodation against concerns  that excesses could eventually develop in the economy.  In the end, lift-off went without a hitch.  The approach developed back then has served  us extremely well in controlling the federal funds rate, and has proven to be  flexible as market conditions have evolved.   I will come back to this point later.\n\nStage  2: Normalization\n\nThe second stage  of normalization followed lift-off and has involved two processes:  1) raising the federal funds target closer to  more normal levels, reflecting the ongoing improvement in the economy, and 2) gradually  reducing the Fed’s balance sheet as we work to unwind the asset purchase  policies put in place during the crisis.\n\nLet’s start with  interest rate normalization. Since lift-off, we’ve raised interest rates as the  economy moved toward maximum employment and our 2 percent longer-run inflation  objective.  We continued this process  with our most recent rate increase this week. 4 Throughout, we’ve repeatedly stressed that we  foresaw this to be a process of gradual normalization, reflecting the balancing  of risks to reaching our goals.  In  particular, downside risks to the achievement of our employment and inflation  goals amid very low interest rates were compelling arguments for a cautious and  relatively predictable approach to policy.  This approach proved its worth:  The economy continued to expand at a healthy  pace even as the Fed raised rates numerous times.\n\nI’ll now turn  briefly to the normalization of the balance sheet.  We began this process about a year ago.  In the now-standard Fed practice of  communicate, communicate, and communicate, we published detailed plans well in  advance on how we would gradually and predictably reduce the balance sheet. 5 As with lift-off, this process has proceeded  smoothly without market disruption or volatility—and that’s the way we like it. 6\n\nStage  3: “Normal”\n\nThis brings me to  the third stage, that of “normal” monetary policy.  As interest rates have moved well away from  zero and the balance sheet has started shrinking, a natural question arises:  What does normal monetary policy look like?  As before, I’ll start with interest rate  policy and finish with the balance sheet.\n\nFor those who  follow the Fed closely, you’ve noticed that the FOMC has been slimming down its  statements of late and using less forward guidance about the future path of policy.   In this vein, the FOMC this week removed  language from its statement indicating that monetary policy remains  accommodative. 7 Let me make clear, these more concise  statements do not signify a shift in  our monetary policy approach.  Instead, they  represent the natural evolution of the language describing the factors  influencing our policy decisions in the context of the strength of the economic  outlook and inflation being near our 2 percent longer-run goal.  These changes in how we communicate our policy  views are a sign that we are nearing the end of the second stage of the normalization  process, and are inching closer to conducting normal monetary policy.\n\nArguably, it’s  been a long time since monetary policy was “normal,” so it’s worth describing  what normal looks like in some detail.  At  its most basic level, policy-making will remain the same:  The path of interest rates will continue to be  guided strategically by our dual mandate objectives and shaped tactically by  the data and their implications for the economic outlook.  We’ll continue to be transparent about our  thinking about the economy and monetary policy.\n\nBut, changing  circumstances call for some changes in how the FOMC communicates its policy  views. Now that interest rates are well away from zero and the economy is humming  along, the case for strong forward guidance about future policy actions is becoming  less compelling.  For one, the future  direction of policy will no longer be as clear as it was during the past few  years.  When interest rates were  extremely low, it was obvious that the direction for rates was upward, toward  more normal levels, and our forward guidance reinforced that point.  At some point in the future, it will no longer  be clear whether interest rates need to go up or down, and explicit forward  guidance about the future path of policy will no longer be appropriate.\n\nIn addition, as we  have moved far away from near-zero interest rates, it makes sense to shift away  from a focus on normalizing the stance of monetary policy relative to some benchmark  “neutral” interest rate, often referred to as “r-star.”  Now, I have spent a good deal of my career  studying r-star and I find it to be a useful concept for describing the  economy’s longer-run behavior.\n\nHaving said that, at  times r-star has actually gotten too much attention in commentary about Fed  policy.  Back when interest rates were  well below neutral, r-star appropriately acted as a pole star for navigation.  But, as we have gotten closer to the range of  estimates of neutral, what appeared to be a bright point of light is really a  fuzzy blur, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in measuring r-star. 8 More than that, r-star is just one factor affecting  our decisions, alongside economic and labor market indicators, wage and price  inflation, global developments, financial conditions, the risks to the outlook…  I think you get the point.\n\nReturning to the  balance sheet, the question of what exactly the new normal looks like is still  being analyzed and discussed at the Fed.   We have indicated that we plan to shrink the balance sheet to the  smallest size consistent with the efficient and effective conduct of monetary  policy, and that, in the long run, the asset side of the balance sheet will  consist primarily of Treasury securities. 9 That’s our strategy, but its execution will  depend on the operating framework of monetary policy, among other factors.\n\nHere, the Fed basically  has two choices.  We could return to a  system similar in spirit to that used before the financial crisis, in which the  supply of reserves in the banking system was kept relatively scarce, and the interest  rate was set by adjusting reserves on a frequent basis through open market  operations.  Alternatively, we could  continue with the system that we’ve been using since the crisis, in which bank reserves  are abundant and the federal funds rate target is achieved through adjustments  to administered rates.  As I said, this  approach is working very well at controlling interest rates and has proven to  be easy to communicate and adaptable. 10 The Fed will be looking closely at these  options in the coming months and will subsequently make a decision on the future  operating framework. And, as is our standard practice, we will be sure to  communicate our thinking and decisions on this issue as soon and as thoroughly  as practicable.\n\nConclusion\n\nMonetary  policy-making has perhaps never been more challenging than it was following the  financial crisis.  But, as we move toward  more “normal” conduct of monetary policy, we shouldn’t rest easy and think we  won’t confront our own fair share of future challenges.  The most important one in front of us today is  sustaining the long economic expansion without allowing risks to grow that  ultimately undermine economic prosperity.   Whatever the future may bring, I will be guided by our dual mandate, a  heavy dependence on data, and a steadfast commitment to transparency.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Presentation to the Western Economic Association International\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on July 2, 2012\nMonetary Policy, Money, and Inflation\nGood morning. I’m very pleased to be in such eminent company, especially that of my\nformer advisor at Stanford, John Taylor. And I’ll begin my presentation with a reference to\nanother pathbreaking monetary theorist. Milton Friedman famously said, “Inflation is always\nand everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a\nmore rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output.”1 We are currently engaged in a test\nof this proposition. Over the past four years, the Federal Reserve has more than tripled the\nmonetary base, a key determinant of money supply. Some commentators have sounded an alarm\nthat this massive expansion of the monetary base will inexorably lead to high inflation, à la\nFriedman.\nDespite these dire predictions, inflation in the United States has been the dog that didn’t\nbark. As Figure 1 shows, it has averaged less than 2 percent over the past four years. What’s\nmore, as the figure also shows, surveys of inflation expectations indicate that low inflation is\nanticipated for at least the next ten years.\nIn my remarks today, I will try to reconcile monetary theory with the recent performance\nof inflation. In my view, recent developments make a compelling case that traditional textbook\n1 Friedman (1970), p. 24.\n1\n\nviews of the connections between monetary policy, money, and inflation are outdated and need\nto be revised. As always, my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nI’ll start with two definitions. The monetary base is the sum of U.S. currency in\ncirculation and bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve. Figure 2 shows the key components\nof the monetary base since 2007. Up until late 2008, it consisted mostly of currency, with a\nsmall amount of bank reserves held mostly to meet regulatory requirements. Since then, the\nmonetary base has risen dramatically, primarily because of a $1.5 trillion increase in bank\nreserves. The money stock is a related concept. It is the total quantity of account balances at\nbanks and other financial institutions that can easily be accessed to make payments. A standard\nmeasure of the money stock is M2, which includes currency, and certain deposit and money\nmarket accounts.\nHere I should make an important point about something that often confuses the public.\nThe worry is not that the Fed is literally printing too much currency.2 The quantity of currency\nin circulation is entirely determined by demand from people and businesses. It’s not an\nindependent decision of monetary policy and, on its own, it has no implications for inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve meets demand for currency elastically. If people want to hold more\nof it, we freely exchange reserves for currency. If people want less, then we exchange it back.\nOf course, currency doesn’t pay interest. People hold it as a low-cost medium of exchange and a\nsafe store of value. In fact, over the past four years, U.S. currency holdings have risen about 35\npercent. This reflects low interest rates, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding currency.\n2 Technically, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing prints paper currency. The Federal Reserve is responsible for\nprocessing and distributing currency to the banking system. The Federal Reserve also distributes coins, which are\ndistinct from paper currency, to the banking system, but the amount of coins in circulation is comparatively small.\n2\n\nIt’s also due to worries about the economy and the health of the banking system, both here and\nabroad. In fact, nearly two-thirds of U.S. currency is held outside our borders.3 U.S. currency is\nwidely seen as a safe haven. When a country is going through economic or political turmoil,\npeople tend to convert some of their financial assets to U.S. currency. Such increased demand\nfor U.S. currency is taking place in Europe today.\nFor monetary policy, the relevant metric is bank reserves. The Federal Reserve controls\nthe quantity of bank reserves as it implements monetary policy. To keep things simple, I’ll start\nwith what happens when the Fed doesn’t pay interest on reserves, which was the case until late\n2008. I’ll return to the issue of interest on reserves toward the end of my talk.\nBefore interest on reserves, the opportunity cost for holding noninterest-bearing bank\nreserves was the nominal short-term interest rate, such as the federal funds rate. Demand for\nreserves is downward sloping. That is, when the federal funds rate is low, the quantity of\nreserves banks want to hold increases. Conventional monetary policy works by adjusting the\namount of reserves so that the federal funds rate equals a target level at which supply and\ndemand for reserves are in equilibrium. It is implemented by trading noninterest-bearing\nreserves for interest-bearing securities, typically short-term Treasury bills.\nNormally, banks have a strong incentive to put reserves to work by lending them out. If a\nbank were suddenly to find itself with a million dollars in excess reserves in its account, it would\nquickly try to find a creditworthy borrower and earn a return. If the banking system as a whole\nfound itself with excess reserves, then the system would increase the availability of credit in the\neconomy, drive private-sector borrowing rates lower, and spur economic activity. Precisely this\n3 See Goldberg (2010).\n3\n\nreasoning lies behind the classical monetary theories of multiple deposit creation and the money\nmultiplier, which hold that an increase in the monetary base should lead to a proportional rise in\nthe money stock.\nMoreover, if the economy were operating at its potential, then if the banking system held\nexcess reserves, too much “money” would chase too few goods, leading to higher inflation.\nFriedman’s maxim would be confirmed. Here’s the conundrum then: How could the Fed have\ntripled the monetary base since 2008 without the money stock ballooning, triggering big jumps\nin spending and inflation? What’s wrong with our tried-and-true theory?\nA critical explanation is that banks would rather hold reserves safely at the Fed instead of\nlending them out in a struggling economy loaded with risk. The opportunity cost of holding\nreserves is low, while the risks in lending or investing in other assets seem high. Thus, at near-\nzero rates, demand for reserves can be extremely elastic. The same logic holds for households\nand businesses. Given the weak economy and heightened uncertainty, they are hoarding cash\ninstead of spending it. In a nutshell, the money multiplier has broken down.4\nThe numbers tell the story. Despite a 200 percent increase in the monetary base,\nmeasures of the money supply have grown only moderately. For example, M2 has increased\nonly 28 percent over the past four years.5 Figure 3 shows that the money multiplier—as\nmeasured by the ratio of M2 to the monetary base—plummeted in late 2008 and has not\nrecovered since. Nominal spending has been even less responsive, increasing a mere 8 percent\nover the past four years. As a result, the ratio of nominal gross domestic product, which\nmeasures the total amount spent in the economy, to the monetary base fell even more\n4 For a discussion of this, see Williams (2011a).\n5 Similarly, an alternative measure of the money stock, MZM, increased 26 percent over the past four years.\n4\n\nprecipitously, as the figure shows. This ratio also has not recovered, illustrating how profoundly\nthe linkage between the monetary base and the economy has broken.\nA natural question is, if those reserves aren’t circulating, why did the Fed boost them so\ndramatically in the first place? The most important reason has been a deliberate move to support\nfinancial markets and stimulate the economy. By mid-December 2008, the Fed had lowered the\nfederal funds rate essentially to zero. Yet the economy was still contracting very rapidly.\nStandard rules of thumb and a range of model simulations recommended setting the federal funds\nrate below zero starting in late 2008 or early 2009, something that was impossible to do.6\nInstead, the Fed provided additional stimulus by purchasing longer-term securities, paid for by\ncreating bank reserves. These purchases increased the demand for longer-term Treasuries and\nsimilar securities, which pushed up the prices of these assets, and thereby reduced longer-term\ninterest rates. In turn, lower interest rates have improved financial conditions and helped\nstimulate real economic activity.7\nThe important point is that the additional stimulus to the economy from our asset\npurchases is primarily a result of lower interest rates, rather than a textbook process of reserve\ncreation, leading to an increased money supply. It is through its effects on interest rates and\nother financial conditions that monetary policy affects the economy.\nBut, once the economy improves sufficiently, won’t banks start lending more actively,\ncausing the historical money multiplier to reassert itself? And can’t the resulting huge increase\nin the money supply overheat the economy, leading to higher inflation? The answer to these\n6 See Chung et al. (2011) and Rudebusch (2010).\n7 See Williams (2011b) for details.\n5\n\nquestions is no, and the reason is a profound, but largely unappreciated change in the inner\nworkings of monetary policy.\nThe change is that the Fed now pays interest on reserves. The opportunity cost of\nholding reserves is now the difference between the federal funds rate and the interest rate on\nreserves. The Fed will likely raise the interest rate on reserves as it raises the target federal funds\nrate.8 Therefore, for banks, reserves at the Fed are close substitutes for Treasury bills in terms of\nreturn and safety. A Fed exchange of bank reserves that pay interest for a T-bill that carries a\nvery similar interest rate has virtually no effect on the economy. Instead, what matters for the\neconomy is the level of interest rates, which are affected by monetary policy.\nThis means that the historical relationships between the amount of reserves, the money\nsupply, and the economy are unlikely to hold in the future. If banks are happy to hold excess\nreserves as an interest-bearing asset, then the marginal money multiplier on those reserves can be\nclose to zero. As a result, in a world where the Fed pays interest on bank reserves, traditional\ntheories that tell of a mechanical link between reserves, money supply, and, ultimately, inflation\nare no longer valid. In particular, the world changes if the Fed is willing to pay a high enough\ninterest rate on reserves. In that case, the quantity of reserves held by U.S. banks could be\nextremely large and have only small effects on, say, the money stock, bank lending, or inflation.\nAs I noted earlier, inflation and inflation expectations have been low for the past four\nyears, despite the huge increase in the monetary base. Of course, if the economy improved\nmarkedly, inflationary pressures could build. Under such circumstances, the Federal Reserve\nwould need to remove monetary accommodation to keep the economy from overheating and\n8 For details on the Fed’s planned exit strategy, see the minutes for the June 2011 FOMC meeting (Board of\nGovernors 2011).\n6\n\nexcessive inflation from emerging. It can do this in two ways: first, by raising the interest rate\npaid on reserves along with the target federal funds rate; and, second, by reducing its holdings of\nlonger-term securities, which would reverse the effects of the asset purchase programs on interest\nrates.\nIn thinking of exit strategy, the nature of the monetary policy problem the Fed will face is\nno different than in past recoveries when the Fed needed to “take away the punch bowl.” Of\ncourse, getting the timing just right to engineer a soft landing with low inflation is always\ndifficult. This time, it will be especially challenging, given the extraordinary depth and duration\nof the recession and recovery. The Federal Reserve is prepared to meet this challenge when that\ntime comes.

    "text": "Commencement Address\nEconomics Department\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nBerkeley, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 20, 2013\nLife’s Unpredictable Arc\nProfessor Powell, distinguished members of the faculty, parents, students, and, most of\nall, graduates—it’s truly an honor for me to return to my old stomping ground of the Berkeley\nEconomics Department and this campus that’s so familiar. Standing here with you today, I’m\ntransported back 28 years to my own graduation as an Econ major at Cal. It seems like\nyesterday. I vividly remember listening to Kenneth Arrow deliver the commencement address\non means and ends in economic policies. I was saying good-bye to amazing teachers and\nclassmates and, with less regret, the dreary windowless classrooms of Evans Hall.\nYou all undoubtedly carry your own images from your time at Cal. For me, it’s the\ndouble cappuccinos at Caffe Strada and midnight runs to Top Dog to fuel up for a few more\nhours of study. And, of course, there’s The Play. I was a junior when Cal beat Stanford in the\nlast seconds of the Big Game by executing the greatest play in the history of college football.\nI’m a big sports fan, and I’ve seen the Giants and the 49ers both win championships. But\nnothing has ever equaled Kevin Moen threading his way through the Stanford band and taking\nthe ball into the end zone as time ran out.\nI tell you all this to let you know that I understand a little of what you’re feeling today.\nFirst and foremost, there’s enormous pride in having successfully completed one of the most\ndemanding courses of study in American university life—a pride that’s shared by your\nprofessors, your friends and family, and, most importantly, your parents, who’ve worked so hard\n1\n\nto see this day come true. There’s excitement about ending one phase of your life and beginning\nanother. And, with that naturally comes anxiety about leaving the cocoon of college life and\nmaking your way in a world that can sometimes seem daunting and unforgiving.\nAs if that were not enough, many of you—perhaps even most of you—aren’t really sure\nwhere life’s journey will take you from here. After all, an economics degree is not like an\nengineering degree, where you can go out and get a job as an engineer. A bachelor’s in\neconomics doesn’t often take you on a straight path like that. At my commencement, the student\nspeaker summed it up honestly, if brutally: One of you will become the chairman of the White\nHouse Council of Economic Advisers, he said. Another of you will become chairman of the\nFederal Reserve. As for the rest of you … good luck!\nYou may be wondering then, should I go on to graduate school? Should I look for a\npromising job outside of my field? Or should I move to San Francisco and become a barista for\na few years while I figure out the next step? You may have student loans to pay off. And you’re\nprobably nervous about the economy, which is still recovering from the worst downturn since the\nGreat Depression.\nBy the way, on that economy thing … we’re on it.\nSo here’s my message to you: If you don’t have a crystal ball to see your future, don’t\nworry. Embrace it! Follow the crooked path. To the extent that your circumstances allow, be\nopen to new things, even if they don’t obviously lead in a straight line to your ultimate goal.\nWhen you’re in your early 20s—or for that matter your early 50s—you don’t have to know what\nyou’re going to do with the rest of your life. Even those of you who have chosen what seems\nlike a clear career path, rest assured that life will hand you plenty of surprises. Like Kevin Moen\nin the Big Game, you will encounter twists and turns you can’t possibly imagine, and they will\n2\n\noffer unexpected and rewarding opportunities. But you must be ready and willing to take\nadvantage of them.\nI speak from personal experience. When I graduated, I didn’t know what I wanted to do\nwith my life. I really liked studying economics, and I was pretty good at it. But I wasn’t sure I\nwanted to be an “economist”—whatever that meant—for the rest of my life. And my job\nprospects were daunting. Like today, the economy was recovering from a harsh recession.\nFinding a job was tough. Luckily, I had the good fortune of landing a job at a revered Berkeley\ninstitution, steeped in tradition. I’m talking, of course, about Blondie’s Pizza.\nWho would have thought, but working at Blondie’s turned out to be a life-changing\nexperience. In fact, it helped prepare me for the job I have today. I soon became the general\nmanager and found myself doing things I’d never done before, things that I’d never even thought\nabout before. Hiring and firing, planning schedules, ordering supplies, you name it. If you’re\nrunning a business, you never know what’s going to get thrown at you next. When you’ve got a\nline of hungry people out the door, you’d better come up with something quick—even when you\nfind yourself running out of flour or the pizza oven refuses to light. I thought the Econ 141 final\nwas hard. But I was never tested in college like I was at Blondie’s.\nI knew that making pizza was probably not my long-term career goal. But, instead of\nseeing this as a distraction from my career, I chose to dive in and see where it took me. I was\npassionate about my work. I cared about my customers, my coworkers, and my pizza. I tried to\nbe the best pizza store manager I could be. And, on top of everything else, I met my wife.\nAfter four years at Blondie’s, I was ready for the next step on life’s journey, which turned\nout to be a master’s degree at the London School of Economics. This was followed by a\ndoctorate at Stanford, some teaching, and a professional life in the public sector, including the\n3\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the San Francisco\nFed. Looking back, it may seem like I was following a plan. But it sure didn’t feel that way at\nthe time.\nYour lives may not be so different. I have no doubt that the great majority of you will\nalso have rewarding careers. You’ve had one of the best educations available. You’re smart and\ntalented. The world is full of opportunities. You will find your niche in the world. But not\nnecessarily by next week.\nSo, as you leave the Greek Theatre and take one last stroll through the campus that’s been\nyour home for the past several years, you are starting down your own path, however crooked or\nstraight it may be. Here are some thoughts from someone who has walked a decidedly crooked,\nbut very happy, path.\nFirst, be sure to use what you learned in your economics courses. It applies to all sorts of\nlife situations. Carefully weigh the costs and benefits of decisions you make. When you make\nchoices, take into account how they open or close options down the road. Suppose, for example,\nyou’re thinking about graduate school, but you’re ambivalent. What’s the cost of postponing\nthat decision for a few years? By then, you may be ready for graduate school. Or you may end\nup going in an entirely different direction. The point is, by carefully assessing costs—including\nopportunity costs—and benefits, and equating marginal costs to marginal benefits, you’re more\nlikely to make wise decisions.\nSecond, don’t be afraid to take risks along your journey. Now, I’m not talking about free\nclimbing in Yosemite. I’m talking about reasonable risks, where the hazards to life and limb are\nsmall. That means, for example, when you reach a fork in the road, consider going down the\nroad you haven’t traveled before. I am reminded of something Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said\n4\n\nseveral years ago about the importance of lifelong learning. Speaking from his own experience\nas a professor who left academic life for public service, he said that when you’re in your comfort\nzone and have achieved many of your professional goals, that’s exactly the time to take on new\nchallenges.\nOf course, that was before the financial crisis, and he just may have gotten more of a\nchallenge than he bargained for. But he rose to the occasion, rewrote the monetary policy\nplaybook to respond to an extreme crisis, and will be remembered as one of the great Fed\nchairmen.\nThird, don’t be afraid to fail. Failure is an inevitable part of a life well lived and a\nnecessary prelude to success. In this regard, college is bad preparation for life because we all\nwant to get straight As. But, when you’re out of college, it’s not about grades. It’s about what\nyou contribute. In my career, I’ve messed up more times than I care to count. But I learned\nfrom those experiences. In fact, I learned far more on days when everything seemed to go wrong\nthan when things went smoothly.\nAnd, fourth, look for ways to give back to society through public service. The people of\nCalifornia invested in your education. Your knowledge of economics means you have a skill\nthat can be of great use. It’s vital that our state and our country pursue good economic\npolicies—policies that put us on sound fiscal and environmental paths, that promote the general\nwelfare, address the shameful gap between rich and poor, and offer the prospect of a decent life\nto everybody. Even if you don’t stay in economics, I hope that building a better society and a\nbetter world will be an integral and substantial part of your lives.\nIn closing, I can tell you that Berkeley will always be with you. It will be with you in the\nthings you’ve learned and the skills you’ve acquired. It will be with you in your memories of\n5\n\nfriends and teachers, and in what you’ve learned about yourself. And it will be with you in your\nvalues, in the way you see the world, and in your ability to think critically and independently.\nTreasure those things. Go out from here confidently. And enjoy your journey down whatever\npath life takes you.\nGood luck. And Go Bears!\n6",

But it’s also an\nopportunity to talk about some of the policy decisions the Fed has made, what the future holds,\nand to address some of the apprehensions some people have about the Fed’s actions. So I’d also\nlike to speak to a few of the concerns and criticisms I hear most frequently. Now is a perfect\ntime to pause for the usual disclaimer that the views I express today are wholly my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nFirst, the economic outlook. In a nutshell, the U.S. economy is looking a lot better these\ndays. There have been some glitches; most notably, gross domestic product (GDP) shrank in the\n1\n\nfirst quarter. However, the evidence points to transitory factors being the main culprit there,\nsuch as the terrible weather that afflicted large portions of the country. With that behind us, I\nexpect a rebound to moderate growth in the second quarter and for the rest of this year. Looking\npast the first-quarter drop, I expect real GDP growth to run above 3 percent for the remainder of\nthe year. That’s in no way blisteringly fast, but it is enough to keep the labor market moving in\nthe right direction.\nIndeed, despite the bad news on GDP in the first quarter, the employment data have been\noutright encouraging. Nationally, we’ve added an average of about 200,000 jobs per month,\npushing the total number of jobs back above its pre-recession peak.\nThis is an important milestone, and I’m optimistic about the outlook—but I should stress\nthat the labor force has grown quite a bit since the recession started; we would need to surpass\npre-recession numbers to get back to a normal labor market. A labor market working at full\nspeed has reached what economists refer to as the “natural rate” of unemployment—that’s the\nlowest rate we can reasonably expect in a well-functioning, healthy economy. Obviously, that\nnumber will never be zero—in a dynamic, ever-changing economy like ours, people will get laid\noff and quit jobs, and new people will enter the workforce. I put the natural rate at around 5¼\npercent. So with the current unemployment rate at 6.3 percent, there’s still a way to go before\nwe’re at full employment.\n2\n\nThat’s for the whole U.S. economy, however. Things are a lot better in Utah and\nMontana—both have unemployment rates well below the national average and closer to\nhistorical norms.\nA key contributor to the improving economy is strengthening balance sheets, both for\nhouseholds and the banking sector. As house prices have climbed over the past few years, the\nnumber of borrowers underwater has come way down. Combined with the increase in jobs, that\nmeans fewer mortgages are going into foreclosure.\nBanking conditions more generally continue to improve.1 Banks in our District are better\ncapitalized and more liquid, earnings have risen, and loans are growing. I know that there are\nconcerns about narrow interest rate margins and the impact of the eventual rise in interest rates,\nparticularly among community bankers. There’s no doubt that narrow interest margins have held\ndown banks’ earnings, but as banking conditions and the overall economy continue to\nstrengthen, I see earnings recovering as well.2 Now, some banks, looking to increase income,\nhave added to their holdings of longer-term assets. This increases their interest-rate risk, which\nremains a focus area for our bank supervisors.\nAlthough the economy in general is on a good trajectory, we’ve seen some loss of\nmomentum in the housing market’s recovery. House prices have rebounded nicely from post-\ncrash lows, but the gains posted in home sales and construction have not been as strong as hoped.\n1 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Banking Supervision and Regulation (2014).\n2 Genay and Podjasek (2014).\n3\n\nHigher mortgage rates explain a large part of the slowdown.3 That isn’t likely to reverse, but\nthere are other factors that lead me to be optimistic about housing going forward. The recession\nforced a lot of adults to move back home, and as the recovery continues, they’ll move out and\nbuy houses or move into apartments. Homes are also still relatively affordable, incomes are\nrising, and despite last year’s jump in mortgage rates, they’re still low by pre-recession\nstandards.\nLet me wrap this all into a forecast for the next few years. I see real GDP growth\naveraging a bit above 3 percent in 2015 and 2016, which should be enough to generate relatively\nstrong job growth. I expect the unemployment rate to gradually decline, hitting about 6 percent\nat the end of this year, falling below 5 ½ percent by the end of next year, and reaching my\nestimate of the natural rate by the first half of 2016.\nI’ll also say a few words about inflation. Those of us born before the 1970s reflexively\nworry about high inflation, but the problem for the past few years has actually been inflation\nthat’s persistently low. The inflation rate the Fed follows most closely—the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index—has been running at about 1¾ percent over the past year.\nThis is below the Federal Open Market Committee’s preferred 2 percent longer-run goal. This\nisn’t all that surprising in light of the fact that the economy is still running below capacity and\n3 Krainer (2014).\n4\n\nwage growth has remained modest. As the economy moves closer to full employment, I expect\ninflation to edge up gradually towards 2 percent.\nAddressing some common concerns\nI said I’d like to address some of the issues I hear, most of which have to do with\nconcerns about, and criticisms of, the Fed’s actions over the past six years or so.\nAs a brief refresher, the Fed’s monetary policy stance has been very accommodative\nsince the economy fell into recession in the wake of the global financial crisis. We lowered the\nfederal funds rate to near zero back in December 2008, we’ve been pretty explicit about where\nwe think those rates are headed, and we’ve engaged in several large-scale asset-purchase\nprograms, commonly known as quantitative easing, or QE.4\nWe often say, when describing these measures, that extraordinary economic times call for\nextraordinary economic measures. And that’s true. But I don’t want to give the impression that\n“extraordinary” means “radical” or “unprecedented.” Some of the unease around the Fed’s\npolicies probably stems from that misunderstanding. But these policies weren’t dreamed up on\nthe fly.5 They’re different, and they’re unconventional, but they’re not outside the natural realm\nof central bank theory or practice.\nIn normal times, the Fed buys and sells securities in order to keep the federal funds rate at\nits target level. This, in turn, affects other interest rates—such as those on car loans, mortgages,\n4 Williams (2012).\n5 Bernanke and Reinhart (2004) and Bernanke, Reinhart, and Sack (2004).\n5\n\nand bonds—which affects other financial conditions and, ultimately, the spending decisions of\nhouseholds and businesses. With short-term interest rates close to zero, however, the Fed shifted\nthe emphasis to buying longer-term assets, in order to bring down longer-term interest rates. So\nwhat we have is still essentially standard monetary policy, adjusted to reflect the reality that\nshort-term interest rates are near zero.\nEnough is enough?\nAlthough there’s general consensus that the measures we took in the immediate wake of\nthe crisis were necessary, critics of the Fed’s policies believe that we’ve been too\naccommodative since then, and that after 2010, we should’ve stepped back and let the economy\nmove on its own. I often hear that the economy’s recovering, so why is the Fed still intervening?\nOr, in other words: “enough is enough.”\nEnding accommodative policy prematurely would have been a major mistake. In 2010,\nthe economy wasn’t yet back on track—in fact, it had barely begun to recover. When we\ninitiated the second round of asset purchases, or QE2, in November 2010, the unemployment rate\nwas around 9½ percent—only slightly down from its peak of 10 percent.\nThe latest round of asset purchases—or QE3—was announced in September 2012, when\nthe economy was better, but still well short of healthy. At around 8 percent, the unemployment\nrate had improved, but was still very high by historical standards, and inflation was running\nbelow the preferred 2 percent longer-term goal. In both situations, the very real danger of the\n6\n\nrecovery stalling and the economy slipping into a state of prolonged stagnation called for\nadditional monetary stimulus.\nWhen you break a leg, you don’t just snap the pieces back into place; you leave the cast\non until the bone heals. Otherwise, you risk doing even greater damage. And in this case, the\neconomy wasn’t ready to walk on its own. Not doing anything, or not doing enough, would just\nhave led to more pain and the need to take even stronger measures down the road.\nI was recently in Japan, which offers a real-life example. They shied away from\nsufficiently aggressive policy and the Japanese economy remained mired in deflationary\nstagnation for 20 years. Only now are they starting to put more forceful policies into place, and,\nhappily, they’re working—but those policies are much more forceful than they would’ve been\nhad they been instituted 15 or 20 years ago. In keeping with the patient analogy, you can keep\nthe cast on for a few weeks and let it heal, or you can go without and require extensive surgery\nlater. So if we take the longer view, the Fed’s actions are in line with people who prefer a light\npolicy touch: we’re essentially doing less now to avoid having to do more later.\nIt was Milton Friedman—one of the greatest economists of the past century and a leading\nexpert on the Great Depression—who taught us that when inflation is too low, monetary policy\nneeds to do more than just lower short-term interest rates near zero. In particular, he said it can\nbuy longer-term bonds to add additional monetary stimulus.6 That’s what we’ve done and it’s\n6 Friedman (2000).\n7\n\nworked. We’ve avoided deflation and helped the economy start moving back towards normal.7\nThe journey’s not complete, but we’re much further down the road than we would have been had\nwe executed an early exit from accommodative policy.\nIs accommodative policy an “enabler”?\nThe second concern I hear is that the Fed’s policies are papering over holes in the\neconomy, falsely propping up failing businesses, and, for lack of a better term, enabling\ncongressional and White House inaction. The argument is that, by keeping the economy on an\neven keel, we’re allowing businesses that would otherwise fail to limp along and Washington to\nput off making difficult decisions.\nThere is a ring of truth to the idea that low interest rates might be acting as life support\nfor companies that are destined to fail. The flip side of that coin, however, is that low rates gave\ngood companies the ability to get back on their feet before they went bankrupt. It’s important to\nprovide an economic environment that allows fundamentally sound firms to thrive. That may\nprovide a temporary crutch to some companies that will eventually go bankrupt, but over the\nlonger term, the right companies will survive. Nothing in life is perfect, and in terms of a trade-\noff, I’m happy with a few bad companies staying in the game for a while if it means a lot of good\nones have a chance to survive, too.\n7 Chung et al. (2012).\n8\n\nRegarding political inaction on federal policy, I will say that from an economic\nperspective, there is reason to worry about the lack of action in Washington. When\nbrinkmanship comes to a head, it creates uncertainty that has real, quantifiable effects. If you\nlook at measures of uncertainty, you’ll see a spike during the debt ceiling standoff in 2011, the\nfiscal cliff of 2012, and the government shutdown last year. Estimates put the toll of policy\nuncertainty as adding around 1¼ percentage points to the unemployment rate, which translates\ninto roughly 2 million lost jobs.8\nSo it’s important that federal fiscal policy gets done. But I don’t believe that the Fed is,\nin the parlance of pop-psychology, an “enabler” of what most characterize as Washington’s\nintransigence on fiscal policy. This position argues that the Fed is somehow too reliable; that\nbecause we have the tools to manage a crisis, other institutions will avoid their own areas of\nresponsibility because they can rely on us to pull an economic rabbit out of our hat. If there’s no\nurgency, they can avoid action on politically volatile legislation, and the can gets kicked further\nand further down the road.\nLet me be clear that us doing our jobs doesn’t absolve anyone of the responsibility to do\ntheirs. Decisions about taxes, spending, and entitlement programs will always collectively be a\npolitical third rail, and monetary policy—be it accommodative or fully normalized—won’t\nchange that. The idea that the Fed’s “propping up” of the economy is letting Congress avoid\n8 Leduc and Liu (2013).\n9\n\ndecision-making doesn’t hold; that implies that the only prompt to action would be an economy\nin freefall, something no one wants. Congress has many reasons to act on fiscal policy—not\nleast of which being a growing population and shifting demographics that will see the largest\ngeneration in our history moving into old age—and nothing we do to interest rates will alter that\nreality.\nThe “enabling” argument is largely driven by an underlying concern that the Fed has\nsomehow lost its independence, or that it’s becoming too active a player in the economy. But\nnothing could be further from the truth. We hold our independence as sacrosanct, because it’s\nnecessary for us to make the best policy decisions we can. If we step out of our assigned role,\nwe could endanger that independence, and that would fundamentally alter our ability to do our\njobs.\nCan the Fed manage monetary policy with such a large balance sheet?\nThe third concern I hear, and it’s one of the most frequently voiced, is that the size of the\nFed’s balance sheet poses inflationary and other risks as we seek to normalize the stance of\nmonetary policy. I’m very cognizant of this issue, as is everyone at the Fed, and it’s one we take\nseriously.\nThere’s no question that our asset-purchase programs have massively expanded the size\nof the Fed’s balance sheet. On the eve of the financial crisis, we owned roughly $850 billion in\nassets. Today, that number stands at close to $4.5 trillion, with about $2.7 trillion in bank\n10\n\nreserves on the liability side. Eventually, after we bring rates back up and normalize monetary\npolicy, we’ll have to unwind much of that balance-sheet growth.\nWe’ve spent the past several years testing out various tools that will help us raise and\nnormalize interest rates. Importantly, we can now pay interest on reserves held at the Fed and\nwe have other tools to reduce reserves even with a large balance sheet. This means that the usual\nprocess of the money multiplier—whereby ample bank reserves can fuel rapid growth in the\nmoney supply—is short-circuited. These tools mean we can control short-term interest rates as\nneeded to stem any inflationary pressures down the road.\nWe’re also going to be very clear in our communications when we eventually bring rates\nback to normal. Making that communication work won’t necessarily be easy, as the taper\ntantrum reminded us last year. But we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into ensuring that, once\nit’s appropriate to normalize the stance of monetary policy, we can raise interest rates as needed,\ncommunicate our intentions to the markets, manage the balance sheet over time, and bring us\nback to full employment without undue inflationary pressures. So I understand the concerns, but\nwe are aware of them, we’re planning for them, and we’ve got the tools to manage them.\nHas the Fed run out of tools?\nThe fourth fear people express is that the Fed has run out of firepower. This is one I\nreally want to be clear on, because the biggest mistake a central bank can make is to throw up its\nhands and say it can’t get the job done. The economists Christina and David Romer wrote a\n11\n\nmust-read paper showing that this kind of policy apostasy has historically been catastrophic—\nfrom the Great Depression to the inflation of the 1970s, any time a central bank decided its\npolicies couldn’t hold up in a fight led to disaster. 9 The most obvious example they cited was\nduring the Great Depression, when Fed policymakers lost confidence that aggressive monetary\npolicy would work. Some thought that monetary policy was already so accommodative that it\ncouldn’t do any more than it already had. Others thought the source of the crisis was the\nirresponsibility and excess leading up to the stock market crash, which they didn’t think\nmonetary policy could address. Either way, their inaction contributed to the depth and length of\nthe Great Depression.10\nLikewise, the Romers noted that the Fed failed to intervene sufficiently to combat\ninflation during much of the 1970s—again, in part because policymakers didn’t think that\nmonetary policy could address spiraling inflation. Because they didn’t act, inflation took years\nand a deep recession to get under control.11\nI see the historical precedent as strong support for the Fed’s actions over the past seven\nyears, and as a cautionary tale for the future. Adam Smith wrote that all money is a matter of\nbelief, and in this case, the same goes for policy. It’s crucial to understand both the power and\n9 Romer and Romer (2013).\n10 Friedman and Schwartz (1963).\n11 Romer and Romer (2013).\n12\n\nlimits of the tools at your disposal. Not believing in their strength is effectively relinquishing\nresponsibility; and once you relinquish responsibility, you’ve failed in your mandate.\nImplications for current monetary policy\nI am aware that not everyone is a fan of the Fed or of accommodative policy. I’m not\ndeaf to criticism, and reasonable people disagree on policy all the time. But the bottom line is, it\nhas worked. And the asterisk is that it’s not permanent. We won’t raise interest rates for some\ntime, which is the real marker of tightening policy. However, we’ve already considerably\nreduced the pace of our asset purchases, which will likely end this year. We’re moving towards\nnormalization, and as the economy continues to improve, we’ll take off the cast; when it’s able to\nmove on its own, we’ll take away the walking stick. The events of the past several years\ndemanded strong policy action, and we were right to take it. But it doesn’t reflect a fundamental\nshift in our goals or strategy.\nConclusion\nIt’s been a long road back from recession. The recovery has been slower than I would\nhave liked, and there are a thousand different views on the Fed’s decision making. But the path\nwas eased by strong monetary policy, and it helped us to get where we are today—on the road\nback to full employment and price stability.\nThank you.\n13\n\n14\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., and Vincent R.

    "text": "Presentation to the SEMI 2013 Industry Strategy Symposium\nHalf Moon Bay, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 14, 2013\nThe Economy and Monetary Policy in Uncertain Times1\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be with you this morning. I’m especially glad to be\nspeaking at a SEMI event. Many of the nation’s semiconductor companies are based in the 12th\nFederal Reserve District, and your industry contributes in a big way to the vitality of our region’s\neconomy. At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, we follow the information technology\nsector closely. In fact, we have our own monthly index of the tech sector’s economic health,\ncalled the Tech Pulse Index, published on our website.2 It’s one of the better gauges of the\noverall health of the sector. And I should add that I’ve greatly benefited from the contacts I’ve\nmade with leaders of the semiconductor industry and other areas of the tech sector.\nHowever, my subject today isn’t the latest wonders to come out of Silicon Valley.\nInstead, I’ll be talking about the uneven progress of the U.S. economy and my outlook for the\nperiod ahead. One key theme will be the critical role that uncertainty about the future has played\nin holding the economy back. That was demonstrated starkly in recent weeks by the political\ndrama surrounding the fiscal cliff, a spectacle that sapped the confidence of consumers and\nbusinesses alike.\nI’ll also talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to help our economy get back on\ntrack. The Fed has taken some bold steps this past year, both in the approaches we take to\nstimulating the economy and the way we talk about our policy. In particular, for the first time\n1 I want to thank Rob Valletta and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 See http://www.frbsf.org/csip/pulse.php.\n1\n\nwe publicly announced numerical thresholds for unemployment and inflation that will guide us\nin future policy decisions. In essence, we’ve made it clear that we do not intend to begin to\nremove monetary accommodation until the economy reaches specific milestones. These\ninitiatives represent important changes in the way the Fed conducts monetary policy and\ncommunicates it to the public, although they’re best understood as an evolution rather than a\nrevolution in our approach. I’ll do my best to explain what we’ve done and why we did it. I\nshould note that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nSo then, where do things stand? The economy has been growing in fits and starts for the\npast three-and-a-half years. Every time economic growth appears to be picking up steam,\nsomething happens that brings it back down again. Sometimes the barriers to growth are natural,\nlike the tsunami of 2011, and the drought and Superstorm Sandy last year. Other times they are\nman-made, like the crisis in Europe and our own fiscal cliff drama. With a little luck and a big\nboost from the Fed’s monetary stimulus, I expect the recovery to gradually pick up steam. But\nthere’s a significant risk that growth will fall short of my expectations, especially if further\npolitical wrangling over the federal budget leads to prolonged confrontation and uncertainty.\nThese dynamics are clearly visible in the job market. We’ve come a long way since the\ndepths of the recession. Payrolls have risen by nearly 5 million jobs from the low point reached\nabout three years ago.3 This increase in jobs has helped bring the unemployment rate down by\nover 2 percentage points to 7.8 percent. Nonetheless, despite these important gains, we still have\na long way to go to get back to an economy operating at its potential.\n3 These reported employment gains since the recession are likely to be revised up, according to a preliminary\nannouncement by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The revisions will be implemented with the release of the January\n2013 employment report. See U.S. BLS (2012).\n2\n\nOn the plus side, two sectors hit hard in the recession, autos and housing, have turned the\ncorner, contributing to the recovery. Thanks to pent-up demand, fabulous rates on auto loans,\nand an improving labor market, motor vehicle sales have rebounded to a rate of roughly 15\nmillion vehicles a year from their recession low of around 9 million.\nThe news on the housing front is also very encouraging. Fewer homes are going into\nforeclosure. And, with mortgage rates at rock bottom, home sales have picked up. The stepped-\nup sales activity and the limited inventory of homes have helped support prices. In 2012, home\nprices look to have risen for the first time since 2006. New housing construction is up\nsignificantly from the historic lows that followed the housing crash. Still, the pace of home\nconstruction is well below trend levels, and this sector has far to go to get back to full strength.\nDespite significant progress in areas such as autos and housing, we’re still not seeing the\nrobust job gains needed to bring the economy quickly back to its potential. The gradual pace of\nrecovery stems in large part from the lingering effects of the 2007–08 financial crisis. Many\nfamilies are still snowed under by debt, leaving them unwilling or unable to spend.4 After\nexperiencing huge loan losses, many lenders have kept credit relatively tight for small businesses\nand consumers, despite some modest signs of easing.\nBut the direct hangover from the financial crisis is not the only reason for sluggish\ngrowth. Most banks and other financial institutions have largely returned to health, and many\nnonfinancial businesses have been piling up cash. Their balance sheets look exceptionally\nstrong. For businesses that can get credit, interest rates have rarely, if ever, been lower. You\nwould think this is a great time to expand your business. Yet, many businesspeople appear to be\n4 See Mian, et al. (2012).\n3\n\nlocked in a paralyzing state of anxiety. As one of my business contacts said recently, “They’re\njust not willing to stick their necks out.”\nWhat’s going on? The terrifying financial crisis followed by a bumpy recovery, the crisis\nand recession in Europe, the budget mess in the United States, questions about taxes and health-\ncare reform—these and other factors have combined to undermine the confidence of Americans\nand make them suspicious about the durability of the economic recovery. Indeed, an index of\npolicy uncertainty developed by academic economists recently soared to the highest level\nrecorded in over 25 years.5 In a pattern reminiscent of the debt ceiling debate in the summer of\n2011, the recent rise in uncertainty has been accompanied by a sharp drop-off in business and\nconsumer confidence.\nThere’s pretty strong evidence that the rise in uncertainty is a significant factor holding\nback the pace of recovery now. At the San Francisco Fed, researchers have looked closely at\nhow uncertainty affects the economy.6 They found that, when uncertainty rises, capital spending\nand full-time employment fall, but part-time employment goes up. Evidently, businesses hesitate\nto expand in ways that would be costly to reverse if conditions sour. Instead of hiring full-time\nworkers, they increase the hours of their existing workers and take on part-time workers to meet\nproduction and sales needs. More generally, research shows that heightened uncertainty slows\neconomic growth, raises unemployment, and reduces inflationary pressures.\nThis pattern has held over the past three decades, but the effects have been particularly\nnotable in recent years. For example, capital spending has downshifted noticeably since early\nlast year. In particular, business spending on information technology, which had been a source\nof strength early in the recovery, fell back last year, driven by a sharp drop in spending on\n5 The index can be seen at http://www.policyuncertainty.com/results.html.\n6 See Leduc and Liu (2012a, b) for estimates of the effects of uncertainty and references to the literature.\n4\n\nhardware. The job market also shows the effects of uncertainty. During much of the past year,\nan unusually large share of job growth involved part-time workers who wanted full-time\npositions.\nI spoke earlier about some of the sources of uncertainty. Of course, the one that was\nuppermost in everybody’s mind was the fiscal cliff. This refers to the massive federal tax hikes\nand spending cuts that were scheduled to take effect automatically at the beginning of 2013. In\nterms of potential economic impact, the cliff amounted to a triple whammy. The spending cuts\nand tax increases represented a crippling dose of austerity for an economy that was already\nstruggling. Higher taxes and lower government spending would have meant less disposable\nincome for consumers, smaller government payrolls, and less work for government contractors.\nIn addition, the political clash stoked uncertainty and held down growth by frightening\nbusinesses and consumers.\nFortunately, the impasse over the tax aspects of the fiscal cliff was resolved, and most of\nthe scheduled spending cuts were halted, at least temporarily. Still, the federal budget had\nalready become more austere in the past few years as stimulus measures passed during the\nrecession wound down and spending cuts were enacted. That’s weighed on growth and forced\nthe private sector to shoulder more of the burden of powering the recovery. Despite the latest\nagreement, we are in for greater federal fiscal austerity this year. For example, the end to the\ntwo-percentage-point cut in the payroll tax means less money in paychecks. What’s more, it’s\nunclear how much the fiscal cliff accord will relieve uncertainty. We’ve already moved to the\nnext round of the budget battle as spending issues and the federal debt limit come to the fore. In\nother words, we still have plenty of drama on these issues to rattle the public for some time to\ncome.\n5\n\nAs far as my outlook is concerned, I expect the economic expansion to gain momentum\nover the next few years. When final numbers come in, I expect growth in real gross domestic\nproduct—the nation’s total output of goods and services—to register about 1¾ percent in 2012.\nMy forecast calls for GDP growth to rise to about 2½ percent this year and a little under 3½\npercent in 2014. That pace is sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down gradually over the\nnext few years. Specifically, I anticipate that the unemployment rate will stay at or above 7\npercent at least through the end of 2014. And I expect inflation to remain somewhat below the\nFed’s 2 percent target for the next few years as labor costs and import prices remain subdued.\nMy forecast takes into account both the fiscal cliff agreement and the various stimulus measures\nthe Fed has put in place.\nWhat about monetary policy then? There’s no question that slow growth, high\nunemployment, and significant uncertainty are challenges for monetary policy. Let’s look at the\ngoals set for us by Congress. First, there’s maximum employment. Economists think of\nmaximum employment as the lowest unemployment rate that can be sustained without inflation\npicking up. When unemployment falls below the maximum-employment level, workers are in\nstronger bargaining positions and wage pressures tend to build up, potentially feeding inflation.\nIt’s not easy to pinpoint the noninflationary unemployment rate. The number moves around\ndepending on structural factors, such as whether workers have skills that match available jobs.7\nEconomists generally estimate that the noninflationary level of unemployment today is between\n5 and 6 percent.8 The current 7.8 percent unemployment rate is clearly well above that.\nPrice stability is the Fed’s second mandated goal. Fed policymakers have specified that a\n2 percent inflation rate is most consistent with our maximum-employment and price-stability\n7 See Daly et al. (2012), Lazear and Spletzer (2012), and Williams (2012b).\n8 See Board of Governors (2012a).\n6\n\nmandates.9 But our primary inflation measure averaged only about 1½ percent over the 12\nmonths ending in November, noticeably below this target. And I expect inflation to run about\n1½ percent this year as well.\nHere it is in a nutshell: The Fed is missing on both of its goals, especially the maximum-\nemployment mandate. And there are risks that the economy will slow further. The implications\nare clear. The Fed must do what it can to help the economy improve.\nOur main tool for stimulating the economy is to lower the federal funds rate, our\nbenchmark short-term interest rate. We pushed that rate down close to zero in 2008, so there’s\nnot a lot more that can be done on that front. Since then, to provide additional support to the\neconomy, we’ve adopted a series of unconventional stimulus measures. For example, since\n2008, we’ve purchased more than $2 trillion in longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. You may have heard the financial press call these purchases QE1, 2, and 3, with the\nQE standing for quantitative easing. We also carried out a related program, nicknamed\nOperation Twist, in which we trimmed our holdings of short-term Treasury securities and built\nour holdings of long-term Treasuries.\nThe purpose of these programs is to lower longer-term interest rates. They work through\none of the most basic principles of economics: the law of supply and demand. Our purchases\ncreate huge demand for longer-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. We all know\nwhat happens when demand goes up. Prices also rise, and that’s exactly what’s taken place with\nthose securities. As their prices have climbed, their yields have come down. The result is that\nlonger-term interest rates have fallen across the board, producing financial conditions more\n9 For more information, see the statement of longer-term goals and policy strategy released by the FOMC in January\n2012 (Board of Governors 2012b).\n7\n\nfavorable for economic growth.10 Lower interest rates have made it cheaper for consumers to\nbuy homes and cars, and for businesses to finance new projects. For example, conventional 30-\nyear mortgage rates have dropped to historically low levels, which helped bring the housing\nmarket back to life last year.\nAt our policy meeting last month, we decided to continue adding to our economic\nstimulus with the goal of speeding progress towards our maximum-employment and price-\nstability goals. First, we announced we will keep buying mortgage-backed securities at the rate\nof $40 billion per month, a program started back in September. Second, following the expiration\nof Operation Twist at the end of 2012, we announced that we will continue to buy $45 billion in\nlonger-term Treasury securities each month.11\nCritically, we indicated that we will continue these purchases until the outlook for the job\nmarket improves substantially, in the context of stable prices. In other words, instead of setting\nan expiration date for these purchases as we have in the past, we’ll be looking for convincing\nsigns of ongoing improvement in the labor market and a range of other economic indicators\nbefore we stop this program. I anticipate that continued purchases of mortgage-backed securities\nand longer-term Treasury securities will be needed well into the second half of 2013. Of course,\nmy forecast for the economy may be wrong, and we’ll adjust our plans as appropriate.\nMoreover, we’ll watch the effects of these programs closely to make sure the benefits to the\neconomy exceed the costs.\nAt last month’s meeting, the Fed also adopted a new way of telling the public about the\ndirection our policy is likely to take in the future. Specifically, we said we expect to keep our\nbenchmark short-term interest rate exceptionally low at least as long as, one, “the unemployment\n10 See Williams (2011, 2012a).\n11 See Board of Governors (2012c, d).\n8\n\nrate remains above 6½ percent”; two, “inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to\nbe no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal”; and,\nthree, longer-term inflation expectations remain in check.12\nThis form of policy guidance represents a major improvement from previous forward-\nlooking Fed statements in which we said we expected to keep our benchmark exceptionally low\nthrough a specific date. For example, in October we said we expected low rates “at least through\nmid-2015.” Now our guidance about future policy is expressed in terms of economic conditions\nsuch as unemployment and inflation. This means that the public’s expectations of future\nmonetary policy actions will naturally adjust as the economic outlook evolves, without people\nneeding to wait for the Fed to signal a change. Importantly, such language makes it plain that we\nwill keep rates low as long as needed to promote recovery and move toward our goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability.\nThe new way of communicating our expectations is a logical extension of our long-\nstanding effort to make the Fed a more open and transparent institution. Since the early 1990s,\nwe’ve steadily increased the quantity and clarity of information we provide the public about\nmonetary policy. That’s why I view this move as more of an evolution than a revolution in Fed\ncommunications.\nWhile this form of guidance makes our policies more transparent and predictable, it does\ncarry some risks. After all, it’s impossible to express all the information that goes into monetary\npolicymaking in terms of a few thresholds. In particular, this guidance shines a bright spotlight\non the unemployment rate. This is appropriate, because high unemployment is our biggest\nproblem right now. But the unemployment rate is not the only measure of the health of the job\n12 See Board of Governors (2012d).\n9\n\nmarket. It’s best to view this unemployment-rate threshold as a guidepost that helps us\ndetermine how well we’re moving toward maximum employment. In the final analysis, we’ll\nconsider all kinds of information about economic conditions to help us decide whether we’ve\nmade enough progress to start raising interest rates.\nAs far as inflation is concerned, keep in mind that our target remains 2 percent on\naverage. Sometimes inflation will go a bit above and sometimes a bit below that level. Setting\nan inflation threshold at 2½ percent is in no way a slackening of our commitment to price\nstability or a departure from our 2 percent longer-run inflation target. Instead, the inflation\nthreshold gives us maneuvering room to right the economy while simultaneously making it clear\nwe will tighten policy if inflation starts to edge up too much. Finally, we’re also determined to\nkeep a lid on inflation expectations. We will not allow hard-won confidence in the Fed’s\ncommitment to price stability to melt away.\nNone of the measures I’ve described are cure-alls. By themselves, they won’t turn a\ntortoise recovery into a hare. But our policies are working, as the newfound vigor in the auto and\nhousing markets demonstrates. I am convinced we are charting the best course to get us to\nmaximum employment and price stability. Thank you very much.\n10\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012a. “Economic Projections of Federal Reserve\nBoard Members and Federal Reserve Bank Presidents, December 2012.” December 12.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20121212.pdf\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012b. “Press Release.” January 25.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012c. “Press Release.” September 13.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012d. “Press Release.” December 12.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm\nDaly, Mary C., Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert Valletta. 2012. “A Search and Matching\nApproach to Labor Markets: Did the Natural Rate of Unemployment Rise?” Journal of Economic\nPerspectives 26(3, Summer), pp. 3–26.\nLazear, Edward P., and James R.

    "text": "SPEED LIMITS AND STALL SPEEDS:\nFOSTERING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH\nIN THE UNITED STATES\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nAt the\nUNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY\nSydney, Australia\nJune 26, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nIt’s great to be with you today. In my travels, I often find myself in a debate about\nwhich is the greatest city in the world to live in. Naturally, Sydney and San Francisco\nalways come out at the top of the list, owing to their natural beauty nestled on the\nwater’s edge, rich cultural diversity, cosmopolitan lifestyles, and culinary excellence,\nnot to mention sky-high real estate prices.\nAll that’s true, but I would claim that we are kindred spirits at a much deeper level.\nWe are steeped in a frontier spirit that bravely looks ahead toward a future of\nboundless possibilities. At a time when many around the world have become mired in\npessimism and look longingly to the past, it’s important to reignite this spirit of\nunbridled optimism in seeing our way through the obstacles before us.\nAmong our other commonalities is a mutual stake in the economic well-being of the\nother. Of the many exports and imports that flow between our two nations, one of\nmy favorites is the great Australian rock band, AC/DC. One advantage of being a\nrock star is that you can live by the motto, “we’re just livin’ for today.”\nPA CCE 1\n\nFor those of us who aren’t rock stars, but are more concerned with r-star, well, we\nneed to have an eye toward tomorrow. In the current context, that means turning our\nattention from getting the economy back on track to keeping it there, while guarding\nagainst the next calamity.\nIn the United States, we have reached a turning point; a transition from recovery to\nongoing economic expansion. The main goal of U.S. monetary policy is therefore to\nkeep the expansion going as long as possible. That entails bringing monetary policy\nback to a more normal setting and taking actions to keep the economy on a path that\nneither exceeds its speed limit, nor stalls. This is what I will discuss with you today.\nAnd this is a good time to insert the usual Fed disclaimer that the views expressed are\nmine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nTHE U.S. ECONOMY HAS RECOVERED\nFirst some context: The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. It\nhas a unique public-private structure, with some policymakers appointed by the\nPresident of the United States, and others, like myself, appointed by private boards.\nAs President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, I lead one of\nthe 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. My District, which includes the western\nUnited States, covers about one-fifth of the U.S. population and economy. Among\nmy responsibilities, I bring the perspectives of my region to the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or FOMC – the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy committee.\nI once had a T-shirt printed up that reminded folks that the decisions we make at the\nFed are “data-driven,” and they are. Although we live in a hyper-political era, the Fed\nis strictly apolitical … and as one of America’s great exports, Lady Gaga, would say, we\nwere “born this way.” Our enterprise is unique within the U.S. government in both\nfunction and structure, and our design allows us to make decisions independent of\nshort-term political influence. We base our decisions on what’s best for the long-term\nhealth of the economy, rather than “living for today.”\nThe U.S. Congress has mandated that our job is to keep the economy stable and on\ntrack, with a focus on two big goals: maximum employment and price stability. We\nwant everyone who wants a job to be able to find one and for inflation to average 2\npercent per year over the long run.\nPA CCE 2\n\nToday, the U.S. economy is about as close to these goals as we’ve ever been. Among\nother things, we’ve fully recovered from the recession.\nWhen it comes to our employment goal, this is typically viewed in terms of the\nunemployment rate relative to the natural rate of unemployment – by this I mean the\nlevel consistent with an economy that is running neither too hot nor too cold. We\ncan’t know precisely where this magic number is, but I put it at about 4¾ percent.\nToday, the U.S. unemployment rate is 4.3 percent – meaning that we’ve not only\nreached the full employment mark, we’ve exceeded it by a fair amount. Given the\nstrong job growth we’ve been seeing in the United States, I expect the unemployment\nrate to edge down a bit further and remain a little above 4 percent through next year.\nMeanwhile, inflation has been running somewhat below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent\nfor the past few years. In the past, this low rate of inflation was the product of a\nnumber of factors – the recession and the strength of the U.S. dollar being the two\nmain ones. Recently, some special transitory factors have being pulling inflation\ndown. But with some of these factors now waning and with the economy doing well,\nI expect we’ll reach our 2 percent goal sometime next year.\nRISK\nNow, I’d love to be able to tell you that the news is all rosy and that our work here is\ndone. Unfortunately, they don’t call economics “the dismal science” for nothing. I’m\npaid to consider what potholes may be dotting the road ahead.\nFor starters, the very strong labor market actually carries with it the risk of the\neconomy exceeding its safe speed limit and overheating, which could eventually\nundermine the sustainability of the expansion.\nWhen you’re docking a boat in Sydney Harbour, the San Francisco Bay, or elsewhere,\nyou don’t run it in fast towards shore and hope you can reverse the engine hard later\non. That looks cool in a James Bond movie, but in the real world it relies on\neverything going perfectly and can easily run afoul. Instead, the cardinal rule of\ndocking is: Never approach a dock any faster than you’re willing to hit it. Similarly, in\nachieving sustainable growth, it is better to close in on the target carefully and avoid\nsubstantial overshooting.\nGOLDILOCKS\nPA CCE 3\n\nWhat this means is that we do not want our economy to run too hot or too cold.1\nLike Goldilocks, we want our porridge to be just right.\nDuring the recession and recovery, jump-starting and speeding the recovery required\nhistorically low interest rates. Today, interest rates in the United States remain low –\nand this is even true after the most recent Fed action, which I’ll get to in a moment.\nI’m sometimes asked why we don’t just leave things as they are and not raise interest\nrates. After all, if things are going well, why change? The answer is that gradually\nraising interest rates to bring monetary policy back to normal helps us keep the\neconomy growing at a rate that can be sustained for a longer time.\nIf we delay too long, the economy will eventually overheat, causing inflation or some\nother problem. At some point, that would put us in the position of having to quickly\nreverse course to slow the economy. That risks stalling the expansion and setting us\nback into recession.\nMy goal is to keep the economic expansion on a sound footing that can be sustained\nfor as long as possible. The last thing any of us want is to undermine the hard-won\ngains we’ve made since the dark days of 2008 and 2009, when it seemed like the U.S.\nand world economies were on the verge of collapse.\nTherefore, we’re in the process of normalization. At our June meeting, the FOMC\nundertook the second ¼ percentage point increase in our main policy interest rate this\nyear. And we announced that we expect that economic conditions will warrant\nfurther gradual increases in the future.2\nNow, I know there has been some general concern that as we normalize our monetary\npolicy in the United States, it could cause market turbulence in countries near and far.\nWhile my own primary focus as a U.S. policymaker is on what’s best for our domestic\neconomy, I want to reassure you that we are cognizant of the fact that our domestic\nactions have a global impact. The last thing we want to do is fuel unnecessary or\navoidable volatility or disruption – whether we’re talking about domestic markets or\ninternational markets. That’s one of the advantages of the gradual approach to\nnormalization that we’re taking and why we’re being very clear, transparent, and open\nabout how we’re making decisions.\n1 Williams (2017).\n2 Board of Governors (2017a).\nPA CCE 4\n\nTHE BALANCE SHEET\nMy focus to this point has been on what we often call conventional monetary policy –\nthat is, changes in short-term interest rates. We also made use of so-called\nunconventional policy actions over the past decade that will also need to be\nnormalized.\nFor those who might not be as familiar with this, let me offer some background: The\nperiod since the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007 through 2009 has been\nextraordinary … and that’s an understatement.\nTo save the U.S. economy from deeper recession and accelerate the economic\nrecovery, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars of long-term Treasury and mortgage-\nbacked securities. By reducing long-term interest rates and helping to stabilize\nfinancial markets during the crisis, the Fed helped the U.S. economy achieve the\nrelatively healthy state that it’s in today.3\nAfter making these purchases, we significantly increased the size of the Fed’s\nholdings. Right now, the Fed’s balance sheet is around $4.5 trillion. We are currently\nkeeping it at that level by reinvesting any principal payments we receive.\nNow that the U.S. economy has fully recovered, the Federal Open Market Committee\nindicated earlier this month that it intends to gradually reduce these holdings by\ncutting back on the amount we reinvest every month.4 We said we would likely start\nthis process of normalizing the balance sheet this year, assuming the economy evolves\nbroadly as expected.\nAt the outset, we’ll start nice and easy, letting our holdings of Treasury securities\ndecline by $6 billion a month, and those of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $4\nbillion per month. Thereafter, we’ll increase these caps by $6 billion and $4 billion,\nrespectively, every three months, until they reach $30 billion per month for Treasuries\nand $20 billion per month for MBS. From then on, we’ll leave these caps in place,\nand our securities holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable\nmanner.5\nWe’ll continue this process of letting the balance sheet gradually shrink until we get to\nthe point that we’re holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary\npolicy efficiently and effectively. While we haven’t settled on what that exact number\n3 Williams (2014) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).\n4 Board of Governors (2017a).\n5 Board of Governors (2017b).\nPA CCE 5\n\nwill be, it will definitely be a lot lower than it is now. With that said, it will be higher\nthan before the financial crisis.6\nWe also affirmed that balance sheet management is to take place in the background.\nIndeed, our modus operandi throughout this process will be similar to that which\nwe’ve adopted for normalizing conventional monetary policy: widely telegraphed,\ngradual, and – yes – boring.\nOf course, none of us have a crystal ball. The FOMC has made clear that it would be\nopen to changing course if changes in the economic outlook were to warrant such a\nmove.7 Most importantly, we will continue to use conventional monetary policy tools\n– raising and/or lowering interest rates – as the primary lever we operate to keep the\neconomy from overheating or running too cold. 8\nCONCLUSION\nTo summarize, it’s been a long, hard road, but we in the United States have finally\nattained a recovery from the global financial crisis and the Great Recession.\nBecause no good deed goes unpunished, monetary policymakers who worked very\nhard to help our economy recover are now faced with the challenges of protecting\nwhat we’ve gained and preparing for the next storm.\nOur goal, therefore, is to foster sustainable growth. This requires keeping our\neconomy in the Goldilocks zone: not too hot, not too cold. It also necessitates\nbringing both conventional and unconventional monetary policy back to normal.\nThe more public understanding, the less chance that said actions will fuel\nunnecessarily volatility in the markets. Therefore, our process has been widely\ntelegraphed and it will continue to be gradual, predictable and transparent … or in a\nword, “boring.”\nI hope I’ll not be perpetuating an unfair stereotype about economists if I say that\n“boring” is a virtue. Indeed, my new mantra is, “Boring is the new exciting.”\nThank you very much.\n6 Board of Governors (2017b).\n7 Board of Governors (2017b).\n8 Board of Governors (2017b).\nPA CCE 6\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017a. “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement.” Press release, June 14.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614a.ht\nm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017b. “FOMC Issues\nAddendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.” Press release, June\n14.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.ht\nm\nEngen, Eric M., Thomas Laubach, and David Reifschneider. 2015. “The\nMacroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary\nPolicies.” Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Finance and Economics\nDiscussion Series 2015-005, January.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015005pap.pdf\nWilliams, John C. 2014. “Monetary Policy at the Zero Lower Bound: Putting Theory\ninto Practice.” Working paper, Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at\nBrookings. https://www.brookings.edu/research/monetary-policy-at-the-zero-\nlower-bound-putting-theory-into-practice/\nWilliams, John C. 2017. “Keeping the Recovery Sustainable: The Essential Role of an\nIndependent Fed.” Presentation to the Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce, Santa\nCruz, California.

    "text": "Presentation to the Mesa Chamber of Commerce\nMesa, Arizona\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on July 15, 2015\nThe Recovery’s Final Frontier?\nGood morning, it’s a pleasure to be here. I’d like to give you the “straight, no chaser”\nview today; my outlook on the economy, where we are, where we’re headed, and what that\nmeans for monetary policy going forward. While the headline is not quite “man bites dog,” I’m\nhappy to say that, overall, things are looking better and better—and are actually quite good. Our\nemployment goal is in sight, though there’s still some way to go until we can say the same for\ninflation. And that means these continue to be interesting times for monetary policy.\nAs always, my views are mine and mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nInterpreting first-quarter growth\nA good deal of the recent commentary—and concern—has focused on the admittedly\nweak official reading of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), which was essentially flat.\nThere’s been a lot of speculation about what it all means: Is it an indication that the recovery is\nstalling? What does it mean for employment? At the risk of sounding like an apostate, it actually\ndoesn’t bother me too much. Because on closer inspection, and with alternative analysis, the\nnumbers were much better than they seemed.\nThe government agency that computes GDP and related economic statistics, the Bureau\nof Economic Analysis, uses a bottom-up method to account for seasonal adjustments to arrive at\nits overall numbers. They do this for a number of reasons that are appropriate for their purposes.\nBut for monetary policy, it’s preferable to have the most accurate reflection of the broader\n1\n\neconomy. Research at the San Francisco Fed and elsewhere has highlighted that even after the\nBEA’s seasonal adjustment, first-quarter GDP growth tends to come in well below that in other\nquarters.1 To get a measure that avoids seasonal patterns, SF Fed economists ran a second round\nof seasonal adjustment, not just on GDP, but on gross domestic income (GDI) and something\ncalled GDP Plus, a new measure of economy-wide activity that combines GDP and GDI and\nstrips out the extraneous noise.2\nAfter making this modification for recurring seasonal patterns, the data show GDP\nactually grew about 1½ percent in the first quarter. GDI and GDP Plus grew at about 3 and 2¾\npercent, respectively.\nBased on these revised numbers, and relative to trend growth of around 2 percent, the\nfirst quarter appears to have been more or less on track. More recent data on spending have also\nbeen encouraging, indicating the economy is still on a solid trajectory with a good deal of\nforward momentum. Looking forward, I expect growth to average about 2¾ percent for the\nremainder of the year, then slow to a more sustainable pace next year.\nInternational outlook\nWhile first-quarter GDP has been a major focus of discussion lately, the other subject\nthat’s been dominating the headlines is, of course, the situation abroad.\nA full global forecast would take up more time than I have—and more patience than you\nhave—so I’ll focus on the two countries everyone cares about most: China and Greece.\nI visited China recently, and I arrived fully cognizant of the concerns people highlight—\nslower growth, the unsustainability of the current export-driven model, debt buildup, bubbles in\n1 Rudebusch, Wilson, and Mahedy (2015). See also Gilbert et al. (2015), Groen and Russo (2015), Liesman (2015),\nand Stark (2015).\n2 For more information on GDP Plus, see Aruoba et al. (2013) and http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/real-time-center/gdpplus/.\n2\n\nthe equity and housing markets, the risk of falling investment, and the overall international\nimplications of those risks. But I have to say that, after talking to officials and academics there, I\nwas a lot less concerned about China’s near-term economic outlook on my return flight than I\nwas heading over.\nThe Chinese government is again facing a tradeoff between their short-run growth goal\nand their longer-term reform agenda. But it’s clear that when the Chinese authorities see growth\nslowing, they take steps to keep it near their target level. Many of the issues that overseas\ncommentators are worried about can be addressed with fiscal and other policies, and China has\nshown that it has both the will and the leeway to take the necessary policy actions.\nAs for Greece, an ultimate decision appears to be a moveable feast. What I can say is\nthis: Yes, there are risks, but I see them as unlikely to overturn the otherwise strong\nfundamentals of the U.S. economy. The financial situation there is certainly precarious. And the\npossibility of a Greek exit from the euro remains a risk. However, the direct exposure of foreign\ninvestors is relatively limited, and the European Central Bank appears to have the means and will\nto limit the financial fallout that could affect the rest of the euro area. While a worst-case\nscenario of a Greek exit from the euro leading to sizable financial and economic impacts on the\nglobal economy cannot be ruled out, it remains an unlikely tail risk.\nEmployment\nReturning to the U.S., there were some concerns that the apparent slowdown in spending\ngrowth could spill over to employment, but the signs from the labor market have been\nconsistently resilient and positive. Not only has there been solid job growth, but the data show\nmost of those new jobs are full-time and higher paying. We have also seen a dramatic decline in\n3\n\nlong-term unemployment over the past few years. In fact, a wide set of measures of labor market\nconditions have continued to show improvement across the board.\nArizona is a good example of just how far we’ve come. Some areas suffered more during\nthe recession than others, and you were one of the hardest hit. Unemployment’s peak here was\njust over 11 percent, more than a full point higher than the national average. Now, Arizona is\nvery close to the national rate. Further, a sharp drop in the unemployment rate so far this year\nsuggests solid momentum. As an aside, this is one of the reasons that the Fed has kept its policy\naccommodative: Neither the recession’s effects nor the recovery’s influence were evenly felt.\nBecause areas like Mesa were harder hit than, say, New York City, they had further to go to\nrebound. Until recovery was evident across the nation—including in parts of Arizona, Nevada,\nand elsewhere in my District—we needed the solid foundation for growth that accommodation\nprovides.\nOverall, our employment goal is in sight. Economists tend to think of full employment as\nhaving reached the “natural rate” of unemployment, the rate we should expect in a fully\nfunctioning economy. Most put it between 5 and 5.5 percent; my estimation, to be exact, is 5.2\npercent. So, with the unemployment rate now at 5.3 percent, we are obviously tantalizingly\nclose. My forecast sees the unemployment rate continuing to edge down, falling to around 5\npercent by the end of this year, and even drifting slightly below 5 percent next year.\nOf course, there are other measures of labor market underutilization. As I said, we’re\nmaking good progress across a broad spectrum of indicators. For instance, people who’ve\ndropped out of the labor force but still want to work. That figure has come way down and is now\nabout where you’d expect it to be given the overall state of the labor market.\n4\n\nBut there are other areas that suggest there may be some lingering slack. One is the still\nlarge number of part-time workers who would rather be full time. So-called involuntary part-time\nwork soared during the recession and has remained unusually high during the recovery. The\nquestion we’re asking is: How much of that is due to an economy that still hasn’t reached full\nstrength and how much is due to more persistent influences? Recent research by SF Fed staff\nshows that most of the rise in involuntary part-time work was, in fact, related to the economic\ndownturn. But there is an outside component—largely reflecting changes in industry\nemployment shares and demographics—that may account for much, if not all, of the rest of it.3\nWe aren’t yet sure about the life span of these factors; they could dissipate over time, or they\ncould reflect a permanent shift—another “new normal” of the post-recession world. But when\nyou take them into account, they point to the current rate of involuntary part-time employment\nbeing more or less in proportion, slack-wise, to other indicators.\nSo, while I have the policymaker’s curse of approaching things with a certain amount of\ntrepidation, it looks like the labor market is bringing home a good report card in just about every\nclass.\nAnother positive sign is the recent increases in wages. For some time, there was concern\nthat wages were somehow immune to the recovery’s positive influences. In fact, the stagnation in\nwage growth wasn’t particularly surprising, because history and experience show us that wages\ndon’t usually start to pick up until the economy nears full employment.4 Now that wage growth\nis starting to take off, based on the most comprehensive indicators, it offers further confirmation\nthat the labor market is nearly healed. While businesses aren’t always thrilled about the prospect\nof paying workers more, this pickup is a sign of a healthy economy. It’s good for the labor\n3 Valletta and van der List (2015). See also Cajner et al. (2014).\n4 Daly and Hobijn (2014, 2015).\n5\n\nmarket, household income, and consumer spending, and is therefore good for business. In fact,\nwhat’s really been missing in this recovery is wage growth of around 3 or 3½ percent. That’s the\nrate I’d expect in a fully functioning economy with a 2 percent inflation rate. Now we’re starting\nto see that come to fruition, and it’s a good sign.\nThe employment side of our mandate has made tremendous progress over the past few\nyears, and taken together, all signs point to a labor market that is zeroing in on full employment.\nHowever, as we make our way back to an economy that’s at full health, it’s important to\nconsider what we should expect along the way. The pace of output and employment growth, as\nwell as the decline in the unemployment rate, have slowed recently…but that’s to be expected.\nLast year the economy added slightly more than 3 million jobs. So far this year, we’re on track to\nadd about 2.5 million, with a further slowdown likely. When unemployment was at its 10 percent\npeak during the height of the Great Recession, and as it struggled to come down during the\nrecovery, we needed a fast pace of decline. With the goal in sight, however, the urgency is not\nthe same. Then, we needed to create lots of jobs to get the economy back on track; now that\nwe’re getting closer, the pace of job gains needs to start slowing to more normal levels.\nLooking towards next year, what we really want to see is an economy that’s growing at a\nsteady pace of around 2 percent. If jobs and growth kept the same pace as last year, we would\nseriously overshoot our mark. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and\nit’s actually desirable, that the pace is slowing.\nInflation\nOf course, nothing is perfect. I generally think of myself as an optimist, and as someone\nonce said, “Being an optimist after you’ve got everything you want doesn’t count.” Accordingly,\neven with the positive signs I’ve mentioned, I still don’t have everything I want: Inflation is still\n6\n\nwell below our 2 percent goal. In fact, it has been virtually intransigent, stubbornly refusing to\nmeet our goal for over three years now.\nToday’s low rate is in part due to transitory factors like the past fall in energy prices and\nthe strength of the dollar.5 With oil prices having moved back up from past lows and the dollar\nretracing some of its past gains, their effects on inflation will recede. In addition, with the\neconomy nearing full strength, we should start seeing signs that underlying inflation trends are\ncoming back up.\nBut, so far, that remains a forecast, not a reality. Recent inflation readings are fine, to use\na technical economic term. But they haven’t yet shown convincing signs that the underlying\ntrend has bottomed out and is poised to start moving back up to 2 percent. In a nutshell: the\ninflation data haven’t been discouraging, but they haven’t been as encouraging as I would like,\neither.\nNonetheless, I still expect inflation to move back up to our target over the next couple of\nyears. With a strengthening economy, special factors dissipating, wages on the rise, inflation\nexpectations stable at 2 percent, and, importantly, full employment right around the corner, I see\nall the factors in place to meet our inflation goal by the end of next year.6 But the point of being\ndata dependent is that information drives your decisions; and while my forecast looks great, I am\nwary of acting before gathering more evidence that inflation’s trajectory is on the desired path.\nImplications for monetary policy\nWhich leads to everyone’s favorite question: What does this mean for monetary policy?\nBy which, I obviously mean interest rates, which is apparently what most people care about.\n5 Williams (2015).\n6 See Nechio (2015) regarding inflation expectations.\n7\n\nAs I say without fail, policy is data dependent. And the difficulty of being data dependent\nis that data can be all over the place. Until I have more confidence that inflation will be moving\nback to 2 percent, I’ll continue to be in wait-and-see mode. That doesn’t mean I’m changing my\nforecast; it means economic forecasting and the data-based assessments required to make\nimpactful policy decisions are two different things. I’ll be looking at the evidence, and, as I’ve\nsaid almost as much as I’ve uttered the phrase “data dependent,” every FOMC meeting is on the\ntable.\nI still believe this will be the year for liftoff, and I still believe that waiting too long to\nraise rates poses its own risks. I know not everyone agrees and there are those who believe we\nshould wait until we’re nipping at the heels of 2 percent. My reasons for advocating a rise before\nthat happens remain the same. Monetary policy has long and variable lags, as Milton Friedman\nfamously taught us.7 Specifically, research shows it takes at least a year or two to have its full\neffect.8 We’re therefore dealing with my favorite analogy: The car speeding towards a red light.\nIf you don’t ease up on the gas, you’ll have to slam on the brakes, possibly even skidding into\nthe intersection. Waiting until we’re close enough to dance with 2 percent means running the\nvery real risk of having to dramatically raise rates to reverse course, which could destabilize\nmarkets and potentially derail the recovery. I see a safer course in starting sooner and proceeding\nmore gradually.\nIt’s also important to remember that when we do raise rates, we will not be instituting\ntight policy; we’ll be easing back on extremely accommodative policy, and those are two very\ndifferent things. Policy will continue to be accommodative, and the Fed’s $4 trillion-plus balance\n7 Friedman (1961).\n8 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n8\n\nsheet will continue to provide substantial stimulus. There’s no need to worry that we’re cutting\nthe legs out from underneath the economy.\nConclusion\nAll in all, things are looking good. I see growth on a solid trajectory, full employment\njust in front of us, wages on the rise, and inflation gradually moving back up to meet our goal. I\ncan’t tell you the date of liftoff, but I can say that it’s going to be an interesting rest of the year\nfor monetary policy, and the Fed in general. Thank you.\n9\n\nReferences\nAruoba, S.

    "text": "Presentation to the Arizona Council on Economic Education, Tempe, AZ\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 7, 2015\nAll’s Well That Ends Better:\nThe Outlook, Education, and the Future of the American Economy\nThank you, Brahm. And congratulations, Nicholas. You and Mrs. Steyer are the reason\neveryone at the Arizona Council on Economic Education does what they do. Thank you, too, to\neveryone involved in the ACEE. And most of all, thank you to the teachers who take the time—\nand often the out-of-pocket expense—to make sure they arm their students with the tools to be\nfinancially and economically fluent. Please give yourselves a round of applause.\nThank you. Now I can go home and tell my wife and sons that I was getting applause\nfrom the second I took the stage….\nI’ve been told that, incongruously, people want to hear an economic forecast after a social\nevent and dinner on a Saturday. I aim to please, so I’m going to give you an overview of the\neconomy and where I see things going. This is my first public speech since the Federal Open\nMarket Committee met last week, and it turns out there’s more than the usual amount of interest\nin what the Fed is doing. You might notice the reporters in the back of the room…. In any case,\nit’s a pleasure to be able to do it by addressing this crowd, who make economic education a\npriority, and I’m honored to be here. Now is a good time to interject that anything I say tonight\nreflects my views alone and does not necessarily reflect the opinions of my Fed colleagues.\nThe outlook\nMoving headlong into the issue everyone wants to hear about: The FOMC again decided\nto hold off on raising interest rates. To my mind, the decision was a close call, in part reflecting\n1\n\nthe crosscurrents we’re navigating: On one hand, the U.S. economy continues to grow and is\nclosing in on full employment. On the other, in large part due to developments abroad, inflation\nhas remained lower than we’d like.\nIn any event, we should fully celebrate that the economic expansion is entering its\nseventh year with good momentum. Real GDP growth has averaged a little over 2 percent over\nthe past five years and the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly a percentage point per year.\nConsumer spending is powering the economy and has increased more than 3 percent over\nthe past year. Strong fundamentals point to continued solid gains going forward and business\nspending is increasing as well. Overall, I see real GDP increasing at about a 2 percent annual rate\non average over the second half of 2015 and next year.\nAs for the labor market, we’re on pace to add about 2½ million jobs this year and job\nopenings are plentiful. With the unemployment rate now at 5 percent, we’ve reached my estimate\nof full employment based on that measure. Given the progress we’ve made and the momentum\nwe’re seeing, we should reach or exceed full employment across a broad set of measures by the\nend of this year or early next year.\nTurning to inflation: It is still much lower than I’d like, hovering just above zero for the\npast year. There are a number of reasons that inflation has remained low despite an economy\nnearing full employment. First and foremost, the rise of the dollar and the fall in oil prices over\nthe past year have lowered import prices and pushed inflation down. Based on past experience,\nthese effects should prove transitory. Second, the prices for health care have been rising much\nmore slowly than is usual of late. This in part reflects legislated changes in payments made to\nhospitals and other providers.\n2\n\nTherefore, in trying to gauge the underlying trend in inflation, I find it useful to follow\nmeasures that strip out the volatile components that may reflect temporary or special factors. My\npreferred measure is the trimmed mean rate constructed by the Dallas Fed. That actually shows\nthe underlying inflation rate for the past year to be 1.7 percent—still below our 2 percent target,\nbut not by much. Looking ahead, as the effects of the dollar and oil prices ebb, and as the\neconomy strengthens further, I see inflation moving back up to our 2 percent goal within the next\ntwo years.\nMy forecast has some upside risks, specifically an even stronger and faster rebound in\nhousing. And there are, of course, the downside risks: the threat of slowdowns and spillovers\nfrom abroad, or the dollar appreciating further.\nNormalizing policy\nThese developments factor into the question of whether or not to raise rates. A\nconsiderable amount of ink has been spilled on the subject, and just about everyone has an\nopinion. Which, of course, I’m always delighted to hear. Our decisions are based on a careful\nanalysis of two sides of the ledger: the one that argues for a little more patience and the one that\nprefers the “sooner rather than later” approach.\nOn the patience side, there are two main concerns. First, there’s what we call the\nconstraint of the “zero lower bound.” That is, rates are essentially zero right now and can’t go\nmuch lower. If the economy slows or inflation falls even further, we don’t have much room to\nlower rates. Conversely, it’s much easier to respond to a move in the other direction: If growth or\ninflation pick up quickly, we can raise rates without difficulty.1\n1 Evans et al. (2015).\n3\n\nSecond, there’s inflation, which has stayed stubbornly below our 2 percent target for\nnearly 3½ years now. The inflation conundrum is not unique to the U.S.; it’s a problem in\nvirtually every part of the world. And while we can ultimately control our own inflationary\ndestiny, as it were, there’s no question that globally low inflation, and the policies other countries\nhave adopted to combat it, has contributed to downward pressure in the U.S. As I said, I see\ninflation bouncing back. But forecasts aren’t guarantees, and there is always the risk that it could\ntake longer than I expect. Some ask: “What’s the rush to raise rates when inflation has been\npersistently so low?”\nThat brings me to the other side of the issue, the arguments for raising rates sooner rather\nthan later.\nMilton Friedman famously taught us that monetary policy has long and variable lags.2\nResearch shows it takes at least a year or two for monetary policy to have its full effect.3 So the\ndecisions we make today have to aim for where we’re going, not where we are, and the economy\nis a moving target. We can’t wait until we see the whites of inflation’s eyes; if we did, we would\novershoot the mark.\nAn earlier start to raising rates would also allow a smoother, more gradual process of\npolicy normalization, giving us space to fine-tune our responses to any surprise changes in\neconomic conditions. If we were to wait too long to raise rates, the need to play catch-up\nwouldn’t leave much room for maneuver. Not to mention, it could roil financial markets and\nslow the economy in unintended ways.\nFinally, experience shows that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate\nimbalances that ultimately lead to either excessive inflation or an economic correction and\n2 Friedman (1961).\n3 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n4\n\nrecession. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was runaway inflation. In the late 1990s, the expansion\nbecame increasingly fueled by euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. And in the first half of the 2000s, the economy\nwas propelled by irrational exuberance over housing, sending house prices spiraling far beyond\nfundamentals and leading to massive overbuilding. If we wait too long to remove monetary\naccommodation, we hazard allowing these imbalances to grow, at great cost to our economy.\nSo those are the main arguments on both sides of the ledger.\nMy view has been, as all my economic views are, data-driven. In the past, I found the\narguments for greater patience to clearly outweigh those for raising rates. The labor market was\nstill far from full strength and the risk to the recovery’s momentum was very real. As the\neconomy closed in on full employment, the other side of the ledger started gaining greater weight\nand the arguments moved into closer balance.\nMy forecast is that we’ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the near future\nand I’m increasingly confident that inflation will gradually move back to our 2 percent goal. It\nmakes sense, therefore, to start gradually moving away from the extraordinary stimulus that got\nus here. We already took a step in that direction when we ended QE3. Given the progress we\ncontinue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as the start of a process of\ngradually raising interest rates. That’s the “how”; as I said, the data will determine the “when.”\nI also want to stress that when we’re looking at monetary policy choices, it’s important to\nremember that we’re in a very different place now than when we first instituted extremely\naccommodative policy. Since the dark days of late 2009, we’ve added 13 million jobs; more than\n3 million of those came last year, and most of those were full-time. It’s been a tough journey\n5\n\nback, and when I look ahead, I’m highly conscious that monetary policy played a crucial role in\nhealing a once-ailing economy.4\nThe new normal\nAs we make our way back to an economy that’s at full health, it’s also important to\nconsider what constitutes a realistic view of the new normal—a perhaps over-used, but apt,\nphrase.\nThe pace of employment growth and the decline in the unemployment rate have slowed a\nbit this year relative to last year. But that’s to be expected. When unemployment was at its 10\npercent peak, and as it struggled to come down during the recovery, we needed rapid declines to\nget the economy back on track. Now that we’re getting closer, the pace has to start slowing.\nOnce the economy is operating at full strength, we’re only going to need between 60,000 and\n100,000 new jobs a month to keep up with the growing labor force.5 In the mindset of the\nrecovery, that sounds like nothing; but in the context of a healthy economy, it’s what we’ll need\nfor stable growth.\nAs the next year unfolds, we want to see a steady pace of economic growth at around 2\npercent. If jobs and growth kept the same pace as last year, we would seriously overshoot our\nmark. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and it’s actually desirable,\nthat the pace is slowing.\n4 See Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n5 Aaronson et al. (2014).\n6\n\nEducation and human capital\nI firmly believe that monetary policy has helped heal a fractured economy and is crucial\nfor economic stability. But monetary policy is by no means alone in its effect on the economy or\nthe nation’s prosperity or success. In fact, all monetary policymakers can really do is focus on\nour dual mandate—and it’s all we should do. The rest takes the proverbial village.\nOur greatest resource, and our greatest engine of growth, is human capital.6 This is not a\nnew concept. From ancient times to the modern day, philosophers, academics, and leaders of\nnations have known that education is the foundation of fortune. Aristotle said all who think about\ngoverning are “convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth.” Nelson\nMandela said education is “the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”\nAnd another great teacher, Yoda, summed it up best: “pass on what you have learned.”\nTeachers are the people who do that, and we all owe a debt to those who help cultivate\nour means of strength and growth, as a community, a region, and a country.\nI’d like to end with this: It’s human instinct to want to leave our mark. We all want to\nknow that somehow, some way, we’ve made a difference. When I was a teenager I aimed to do\nthat by being a world famous Dungeons & Dragons player, but that goal eluded me. Instead, my\nfamily instilled in me a sense of public service. But nothing leaves a legacy like a teacher. I\nknow that it’s long hours, and people don’t recognize all the work that goes into it outside of the\nschool day. It can be difficult and unglamorous and thankless and it’s far, far too underpaid. But\na teacher who reaches a student changes a life. You make your mark on someone’s personal\nhistory. Whether you’ve helped someone tap into a talent, find a calling, or understand that\n6 See, for example, Fernald and Jones (2015).\n7\n\neducation is vital. When you’ve shown someone that they can, in fact, pass the test, go to\ncollege, or be anything they want to be. All of that has an impact not just on your students, but\non their friends, their families, and the families they’ll have down the road. You’ll help to build\nthe next generation of adults in this country who prize education and know that it’s the greatest\nresource they can provide their own children. You have an effect that resonates in perpetuity.\nAnd you build this country’s human capital.\nSo thank you for that. And again, give yourselves a round of applause. And again, I’m\ngoing to tell everyone how hard you clapped at the end….\nThank you for your time and your dedication, and thank you for inviting me to share\ntonight with all of you.\n8\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G.

    "text": "Presentation to The Forecasters Club\nNew York, New York\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 21, 2013\nThe Economy and Monetary Policy: Follow the Demand1\nThank you very much. It’s great to be here today with a group of people whose job—like\nmine—includes trying to predict the course of the economy. It goes without saying that forecasts\nare critical for the conduct of monetary policy, which works with a considerable lag. Decisions\nwe make today have their peak economic effects one or two years down the road. So, policy\nneeds to be based on where we think things will be, not where they are now. Of course, having\ngood forecasts is only one part of effective policymaking. For monetary policy to succeed, we\nalso need to understand the underlying factors behind those forecasts. For example, is the pace\nof recovery being hampered by inadequate aggregate supply, or demand? Should we expect the\nunemployment rate to return to historical levels, or do we need to adjust to a “new normal”? The\nappropriate stance of monetary policy hinges on these questions.\nToday, I’ll discuss some of the reasons the recovery has been so tepid, give my\nperspective on where we are now, and offer my outlook for the period ahead. In doing so, I’ll\ndig a little deeper into the key developments shaping the recovery and their implications for\nmonetary policy. Here’s a spoiler alert: The main point I want to convey is that, although the\nevents of the past six years have undeniably left their mark on the supply side of the economy,\nthe primary reason unemployment remains high is a lack of demand.\nGiven the shortfall of demand, it’s crucial that the Fed keep doing all it can to help the\neconomy return to full employment. The Federal Reserve has taken pathbreaking steps in this\n1 I want to thank Rob Valletta and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nrespect, both in our actions and our words. Last year, we extended our unconventional asset\npurchases. As for our communications, we have publicly announced numerical thresholds for\nunemployment and inflation that will guide us in future policy decisions. In a nutshell, we’re\nsaying we don’t expect to pull back monetary accommodation at least until the economy reaches\nspecific milestones. This statement of intent clarifies our actions and increases the effectiveness\nof monetary policy. And this is the point of the talk where I should stress that my remarks\nrepresent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that introduction, let me review the state of the economy. Since the recovery began\nin mid-2009, output growth has been discouragingly slow, with real GDP growth averaging an\nanemic 2.1 percent. Indeed, on a per capita basis, real GDP is still 1.6 percent lower than it was\nfive years ago, before the recession started. The last time it took more than five years for per\ncapita real GDP to regain its pre-recession level was after the downturn that followed the end of\nWorld War II.\nProgress has been halting in the job market as well. The good news is that we’ve gained\nabout 5½ million jobs from the low point reached three years ago. But, even so, over the past 12\nmonths, we’ve been adding only about 170,000 jobs per month on average. With job growth so\nlackluster, the unemployment rate has edged down by less than half a percentage point over the\npast year. And, for the past five months, it’s been stuck close to its current level of 7.9 percent.\nSo, why has the recovery been so tepid? What does this mean for the future? And, what\ndoes this tell us about the mix of supply and demand shocks holding back the economy? In\nanswering the first question, it’s important to recognize that a variety of factors are at work.\nFirst, the economy still bears the scars of the housing bubble and crash. In addition to its\ndirect depressing effect on home construction, the housing crash has been a powerful restraint on\n2\n\nconsumer spending.2 Families buried in debt accumulated during the housing boom are still\ntrying to dig their way out. Homeowners without sufficient equity find themselves unable to\nrefinance their mortgages or sell their homes. More generally, loans remain hard to get for many\nconsumers and small businesses, despite significant improvements in overall credit conditions.\nSecond, austerity at various levels of government has reduced aggregate demand to an\nunusual extent during this recovery, and this has directly impinged on growth. In the short run,\nhigher taxes and lower government spending mean less disposable income for consumers,\nsmaller government payrolls, and less work for government contractors. Over the past few\nyears, we saw this mostly at the state and local government levels, where spending was slashed\nand taxes were increased. But the federal budget has also been shifting toward greater austerity,\nwith the payroll tax cut expiring at the start of this year and spending reductions under way.\nFurther deep cutbacks are likely. Indeed, if the full sequestration cuts occur, they’re likely to\nreduce growth this year by roughly two-thirds of a percentage point.3\nThird, many advanced economies have been weak, especially in Europe, where austerity\nmeasures have been widespread. This has eroded demand for our exports.\nFinally, an important legacy of the crisis and the events that followed has been unusually\nhigh levels of uncertainty. The effect has been to sap confidence and undermine the willingness\nof consumers and businesses to spend and invest. Initially, that uncertainty reflected the brute\nforce of the crisis and recession, which gave us all a sense of living in dangerous and uncharted\nterritory. Since then, uncertainty has been fueled by the crisis in Europe, repeated clashes over\ntax and spending policy at home, and the sputtering progress of the recovery itself.\n2 Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2012).\n3 See, for example, Congressional Budget Office (2013) for discussion of the impact of federal fiscal austerity on\neconomic growth.\n3\n\nThe economic effects of increased uncertainty are sizable. You might think that because\nuncertainty and confidence are psychological in nature, they would be hard for economists to pin\ndown. In fact, researchers have made great strides in studying the determinants and economic\neffects of uncertainty.4 In recent research, economists at the San Francisco Fed examined the\neffects of broad measures of uncertainty on the economy. They found that heightened\nuncertainty slows economic growth and raises unemployment.5 Specifically, their estimates\nsuggest that uncertainty boosted the unemployment rate by 1 to 2 percentage points since the\nstart of the financial crisis in 2008.\nThese are four key factors holding back growth during the recovery. Let me now turn to\nthe question of whether they primarily affect supply or demand. This is a critical issue for\nmonetary policy. Indeed, in my own research with Athanasios Orphanides, we found that the\nFed had an overly optimistic assessment of the supply side of the economy during the latter part\nof the 1960s and the 1970s. Specifically, Fed policymakers believed that the sustainable level of\nunemployment was lower than it actually was. This misperception implied that the economy\nwas performing under its potential, which contributed to policy decisions that led to sustained\nhigh inflation back then.6 We don’t want to make that kind of mistake again.\nSo, is the problem today inadequate supply, or demand, or both? A useful way to think\nabout this question is to compare the unemployment rate with the natural rate of unemployment.\nBy the natural rate, I mean the unemployment rate that minimizes labor market imbalances and\npressures—either upward or downward—on inflation. The unemployment gap—the difference\nbetween the unemployment rate and its natural rate—measures the degree to which labor\n4 See, for example, Bloom (2009) and Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013).\n5 See Leduc and Liu (2012, 2013) for estimates of the effects of uncertainty and references to the literature.\n6 Orphanides and Williams (2005, 2013).\n4\n\ndemand is unequal to supply. Movements in the natural rate itself reflect changes in supply. Of\ncourse, we can’t directly measure the natural rate of unemployment. Rather, we must estimate it.\nThis topic has appropriately garnered a great deal of attention among economists at the Federal\nReserve and elsewhere in recent years.\nExtensive analysis of the labor market comes to a clear conclusion: Supply-side\nconsiderations explain only some of the rise in unemployment. Most of that rise is explained by\na lack of labor demand. Let’s look at this more closely. Prior to the recession, a typical estimate\nof the natural rate of unemployment was between 4¾ and 5 percent.7 The empirical evidence\nsuggests that the recession and policy responses to it, such as extended unemployment insurance\nbenefits, contributed to dislocations in the labor market. These have pushed the natural rate\nabove its pre-recession level by about 1 percentage point.8 Consistent with these findings, my\nestimate of the current natural rate of unemployment is about 6 percent, roughly 2 percentage\npoints below the current unemployment rate. This 6 percent figure is consistent with many other\nestimates, including the most recent median estimate of the Survey of Professional Forecasters.9\nFortunately, many of the influences that have elevated the natural rate of unemployment\nsince the crisis and recession should fade over time. In fact, this process is already under way.\nThe extended unemployment insurance programs have been scaled back and are affecting fewer\nand fewer people. Eventually these programs will be phased out. In addition, measures of\nmismatch between workers and available jobs are receding.10 And, at least so far, we are not\n7 Williams (2013).\n8 See Congressional Budget Office (2013) and Daly et al. (2012b).\n9 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (2012).\n10 Lazear and Spletzer (2012) and Șahin et al. (2012).\n5\n\nseeing permanent scarring effects of long-term unemployment.11 I expect that, in coming years,\nthe natural rate will return to a more historically typical level of about 5½ percent.\nI should note that the fact that economists are busily studying, debating, and revising their\nassessments of the supply side of the economy is encouraging. It makes a repetition of the\nmistakes of the late 1960s and 1970s much less likely. In our research, Orphanides and I found\nthat, if economists and policymakers had similarly reevaluated their views back in the 1960s and\n1970s, the stagflation of that period could have been avoided.12\nThe conclusion that the economy is suffering primarily from weak demand rather than a\nshortage of supply receives additional support when the factors weighing on recovery are\nanalyzed. The finding of the research that I mentioned on the economic effects of uncertainty—\nthat heightened uncertainty raises unemployment and depresses inflation—is evidence that\nuncertainty primarily acts as a barrier to demand, not supply. Other research supports that view.\nIn recent work published by the San Francisco Fed, Atif Mian and Amir Sufi compare state-level\nemployment performance during the recession and recovery with state-level survey data from the\nNational Federation of Independent Business.13 The NFIB survey asks small business owners to\nidentify the single most important problem they face. Answers include taxes, poor sales, labor\ncosts, government regulation, insurance costs, et cetera. Mian and Sufi find that declines in state\nemployment were highly correlated with the percentage of respondents in each state citing lack\nof demand as their most important business problem.\nSo far, I’ve painted what might seem like a bleak picture, highlighting a slew of\nreasons—including fiscal austerity, the global slowdown, and uncertainty—why the recovery\n11 Valletta (2013).\n12 Orphanides and Williams (2013).\n13 Mian and Sufi (2013).\n6\n\nremains in check. Despite all this, I expect the economic expansion to gain momentum this year\nand over the next few years. In fact, I am cautiously hopeful that we could be at a point where\nthe economy really starts to shake off its doldrums.\nThe improvement partly reflects the effects of Fed monetary policy, which has kept\ninterest rates extraordinarily low across the board. The positive effects of monetary policy can\nbe seen in two rate-sensitive sectors, autos and housing, that are now contributing to the recovery\nin big ways. Vehicle sales have rebounded to a rate of above 15 million vehicles a year from\ntheir recession low of around 9 million. Attractive auto loan rates have contributed to the\nstrength in this sector.\nMeanwhile, the housing market finally bottomed out about a year ago and has been on an\nupswing since, thanks in part to a drop in conventional mortgage rates to historically low levels.\nHomebuilding has risen significantly from the lows that followed the housing crash, though the\npace of construction is still well below long-term trend levels. After subtracting a cumulative 3½\npercentage points from real GDP from 2006 to 2010, real residential investment contributed a\npositive 0.3 percentage point to growth in 2012. It stands to make an even larger contribution in\n2013. Importantly, a virtuous cycle appears to be setting in, with sales volumes growing, home\nprices increasing, and foreclosures coming down. This should help restore confidence in\nhousing and lure buyers scared off by the events of the past decade back into the market.\nAfter a disappointing 2012, my forecast calls for GDP growth to pick up to 2¾ percent\nthis year and about 3¼ percent in 2014. Unfortunately, such growth won’t be enough to push the\nunemployment rate down quickly. I expect the rate to stay at or above 7 percent at least through\nthe end of 2014 and not drop below 6½ percent until the second half of 2015.\n7\n\nOne reason I expect such a gradual decline in the unemployment rate is that I anticipate\nthat some of those who have dropped out of the labor force in recent years will jump back in as\njobs become more plentiful. Labor force participation plunged during the recession and\nrecovery. Retirement of baby boomers and other demographic factors contributed to this drop.\nBut much of it appears to have been cyclical. Widespread job losses kept many people\nordinarily in the labor force from looking for work.14 A cross-state comparison supports the\nview that the drop in participation included an important cyclical component. The states that saw\nthe largest increases in unemployment during the recession generally experienced the largest\ndeclines in participation rates as well.15\nThese dynamics are also important for inflation. I expect the unemployment rate will\nremain well above the natural rate for some time, and wage and other cost pressures will remain\nsubdued. As a result, I anticipate that inflation as measured by the personal consumption\nexpenditures price index will run at about a 1½ percent rate over the next few years, about the\nsame as last year. This is below the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run inflation target.16\nThis brings me to monetary policy. The Fed’s dual mandate from Congress is to pursue\nmaximum employment and price stability. We are missing on both of these goals, with severe\nconsequences for American households and businesses. Unemployment is far too high and\ninflation is too low. Sometimes our maximum employment and price stability goals can conflict.\nBut that’s not the situation today. Moreover, an aggregate demand shortfall is exactly the kind of\n14 See Daly et al. (2012a).\n15 Based on data for the 50 states plus the District of Columbia, the correlation between the change in a state’s\nunemployment rate and the change in its labor force participation rate, weighted by the size of the state’s labor force,\nis –0.46 measured from the low point in the U.S. unemployment rate in May 2007 to the high point in October 2009.\nThe correlation between the decline in log total nonfarm payroll employment and in labor force participation,\ncalculated in the same manner, is of similar magnitude, but has the expected positive rather than negative sign.\n16 For more information, see the statement of longer-term goals and policy strategy released by the FOMC in\nJanuary 2012 (Board of Governors 2012a).\n8\n\nproblem monetary policy can—and should—address. We need powerful and continuing\nmonetary accommodation to move toward our mandated goals.\nIn normal times, monetary policy relies on changes in our short-term interest rate\nbenchmark, the federal funds rate. But we pushed that rate close to zero late in 2008. Since\nthen, to provide additional support to the economy, we’ve put in place a series of unconventional\nstimulus measures. We’ve relied on two primary tools. The first is forward policy guidance,\nthat is, public communications aimed at guiding expectations about the future path of the federal\nfunds rate. The second is large-scale asset purchases, which also go by the name quantitative\neasing. As I’ll explain, both of these tools stimulate the economy by lowering longer-term\ninterest rates.\nOur forward guidance appears in the official statements released after each meeting of the\nFederal Open Market Committee. It’s interesting to trace the recent evolution of these\nstatements. Beginning in August 2011, we specified the length of time we expected to keep the\nfederal funds rate exceptionally low. Initially, we said we expected the rate to stay exceptionally\nlow “at least through mid-2013.” By late 2012, that period had stretched to “mid-2015.”\nThen, at our December 2012 meeting, we shifted gears. Instead of identifying a calendar\ndate for beginning to raise the federal funds rate, we laid out economic guideposts for our\ndecisions. We said we expected to keep the rate exceptionally low at least as long as, one, “the\nunemployment rate remains above 6½ percent”; two, “inflation between one and two years ahead\nis projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-\nrun goal”; and three, longer-term inflation expectations remain in check.17\n17 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n9\n\nForward guidance works by influencing the public’s expected path of short-term interest\nrates. Expectations of low yields on short-term assets for a prolonged period make investors\nmore willing to purchase and hold longer-term securities. That, of course, increases their prices\nand reduces their yields. To give you a sense of the impact of this tool, the unexpected extension\nof our forward guidance in August 2011 lowered yields on longer-term Treasury securities by\nabout 0.2 percentage point.18 That’s comparable to a cut in the funds rate of ¾ to 1 percentage\npoint.19 When we cut the funds rate that much, financial markets sit up and take notice.\nForward guidance works best when the intention to hold interest rates low is both clear\nand credible.20 In this regard, our evolution from calendar-based guidance to readily observable\neconomic guideposts, such as the unemployment rate, makes this tool more effective.\nOur new way of communicating our expectations continues our long-standing effort to\nmake the Fed a more open and transparent institution. Since the early 1990s, we’ve steadily\nincreased the quantity and clarity of information we provide the public about monetary policy.\nThe current language cuts to the chase by spelling out the economic conditions we’ll be looking\nfor before we start to raise rates. Moreover, with the calendar approach, we had to shift expected\ndates as our economic projections changed. Most importantly, the new language acts as an\nautomatic stabilizer, allowing financial markets to react to new information in a way that\nreinforces monetary policy. For example, as economic developments alter the projection for\nunemployment, projections will also change for the federal funds liftoff date. Market interest\nrates will adjust accordingly, helping us accomplish our monetary policy goals.\n18 Swanson and Williams (2013).\n19 See Chung et al. (2012) and Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005).\n20 See, for example, Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003, 2006), Reifschneider and\nRoberts (2006), and Williams (2006).\n10\n\nAdmittedly, this guidance focuses attention on the unemployment rate. But, the\nunemployment rate is only one measure of the health of the economy, and it’s vital that we don’t\nview it in isolation. Instead, we should consider it in the context of other measures of the job\nmarket’s health. The Fed’s unemployment-rate threshold can best be understood as a key signal\nthat will help us determine how well we’re moving toward maximum employment. But when\nwe consider when to start raising the federal funds rate, we’ll examine the full range of\ninformation about the labor market and broader economic conditions.\nAsset purchases are another unconventional policy tool. Since 2008, we’ve purchased\nmore than $3.2 trillion in longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.21 We’ve done\nthis through three distinct programs, nicknamed QE1, QE2, and QE3, and a related program,\nOperation Twist.\nAsset purchases work by increasing demand for longer-term Treasury and mortgage-\nrelated securities. Our purchases bid up Treasury and mortgage security prices and push down\ntheir yields. What’s more, lower Treasury and mortgage yields spill over into other markets and\nhelp make general financial conditions more favorable for economic growth.22\nLower interest rates produced by forward guidance and asset purchases are providing a\nmuch-needed boost to the economy. Lower financing costs encourage businesses to expand and\nconsumers to buy homes, autos, and other durable goods. At our January FOMC meeting, we\nannounced we will continue buying longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a\npace of $85 billion per month.23 Critically, we indicated we will continue these purchases until\nthe outlook for the job market improves substantially, in the context of stable prices. I anticipate\n21 Swanson and Williams (2013)\n22 See Williams (2011, 2012).\n23 See Board of Governors (2013).\n11\n\nthat purchases of mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury securities will be needed\nwell into the second half of this year.\nSome analysts have argued that our policy initiatives have increased the risk of an\nundesirable rise in inflation. I want to assure you that in no way have we relaxed our\ncommitment to our price stability mandate. We constantly monitor inflation trends and inflation\nexpectations. And we will not hesitate to act if necessary. In this regard, I want to emphasize\nthat we remain committed to our 2 percent inflation target. The 2½ percent inflation threshold in\nour forward guidance is not a weakening of that commitment.\nAs I noted earlier, both the employment and the inflation signals are flashing the same\nmessage, and that is that strong monetary stimulus is essential. I am convinced we are charting\nthe best course to lead us toward maximum employment and price stability. Thank you very\nmuch.\n12\n\nReferences\nBaker, Scott R., Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J.

Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Feb. 13, 2012\nThe Federal Reserve’s Mandate and Best Practice Monetary Policy\nGood evening and thank you for coming tonight. It is a great honor to be part of the\nMarian Miner Cook Athenaeum Lecture series. I saw that Allan Meltzer spoke at an Athenaeum\nluncheon a few weeks ago. Allan wrote what many consider to be the definitive history of the\nFed. So, many of you have already embarked on an intensive course in money and banking this\nsemester. I hope my remarks, on top of the wisdom you heard from Allan, will contribute to a\nbetter understanding of monetary policy.\nThis evening, I’ll try to give you a real sense of how I, and many central bankers, think\nabout monetary policy. We must make difficult decisions in the face of intense pressures and\nconflicting demands. For example, at any given time, should we worry more about\nunemployment or inflation? What are the most dangerous risks to the economy and how can we\ndefuse them? My aim is to explain some of the ways we analyze such questions. This is a\nparticularly compelling subject now, more than two-and-a-half years into a lackluster recovery\nmarked by weak demand and a still very high unemployment rate.\nI’ll start my talk by describing the mission Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve,\noften described as our dual mandate. I’ll describe how the Fed interprets the mandate and the\nways in which our goals may reinforce each other and when they may conflict. That will lead to\n1\n\na discussion of how we carry out policy operationally, what might be called “best practices”\nmonetary policy. And I’ll close with a brief description of our current policy stance. I should\nstress that I am speaking entirely for myself and not for anybody else in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThe Federal Reserve’s mandate\nLet me start with the Fed’s mission. It’s often said that Congress assigned the Federal\nReserve a dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices. But, that’s not quite accurate.\nIn fact, the Fed has a triple mandate. Section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act calls on the Fed to\nmaintain growth of money and credit consistent—and I quote—“with the economy’s long-run\npotential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”1\nThese are excellent and desirable aspirations. However, they fall short in providing\nspecifics. After all, what does it mean to say “maximum” employment or “stable prices”? Is a 4\npercent interest rate moderate? Six percent? Ten percent? Moreover, what do we do if these\ngoals are in conflict with each other?\nTo answer these questions, let’s take a closer at each individual goal in turn. Let me start\nwith the goal of stable prices. Now, taken literally, stable prices would seem to imply that the\ncosts of all goods and services should be frozen in time. But, that can’t be right. After all, prices\nfluctuate all the time in response to shifts in supply and demand. For example, a deep freeze in\n1 See Slide 1. A copy of the Federal Reserve Act is provided online by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm . It is interesting to note that the Federal Reserve’s legal\nmandate has evolved over time in response to economic events and advances in understanding of how monetary\npolicy and the economy function. For example, in the original Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the Fed had no\nmandate for macroeconomic stabilization and was only charged with providing an “elastic currency” and to act as a\nlender of last resort for banks. The quote here originates in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 and remains in\nplace today. See Judd and Rudebusch (1999) for some discussion and more details.\n2\n\nFlorida sends orange juice prices soaring. Flat panel TV prices tumble as production becomes\nmore efficient. These kinds of relative price movements are beyond the control of a central bank\nlike the Fed. The Fed can’t do anything about the weather or the development of new TV\nmanufacturing technologies. Nor should it. Relative price movements—with some prices going\nup and others going down—are a natural part of a well-functioning market economy. It’s the\nway markets signal which goods are scarce and which are relatively abundant.\nInstead, the Fed looks at price stability in an overall, or average, sense. We strive to make\nsure that the average prices of a comprehensive set of consumer goods and services don’t change\nmuch from month to month or year to year. The well-known consumer price index is one\nmeasure of average prices. We at the Fed tend to focus more on the somewhat broader personal\nconsumption expenditures, or PCE, price index, which is reported along with the GDP data.\nWhat objective should we seek for the rate of increase of average prices? Should we strive\nfor no change at all, that is, zero inflation? At first blush, that seems sensible. But, there are a\nnumber of reasons why aiming for zero inflation would be too low and inconsistent with our\nmaximum employment mandate. Here I’ll mention two.\nFirst, a small amount of inflation can help grease the wheels of the labor market. There is\nconsiderable evidence that nominal wages don’t easily fall even when demand is weak,\nsomething economists call downward wage rigidity.2 In other words, it’s unusual for workers to\nhave the dollar value of their wages reduced. In this regard, wages are very different from, say,\nairline ticket prices, which are quickly discounted when seats can’t be filled. Weak labor\ndemand may necessitate a reduction in real wages, that is, wages adjusted for inflation. Even if\nthe nominal, or dollar value, of wages won’t budge, the real wage will fall as prices rise. As a\n2 See Dickens et al. (2007).\n3\n\nresult, a little bit of inflation can help the labor market adjust to negative shocks and, in this way,\nhelp keep employment closer to its maximum level.3\nSecond, a small amount of inflation gives the Fed a little more maneuvering room to\nrespond to negative shocks to the economy.4 The problem is that nominal interest rates can’t go\nbelow zero. Economists refer to that limit as the zero lower bound. Let me define terms. The\nnominal interest rate can be divided into its two components: the real, or inflation-adjusted,\ninterest rate; and expected inflation. A little bit of inflation tends to raise nominal rates on\naverage in order to provide a positive yield to investors. That gives the Fed more room to lower\ninterest rates in a recession before hitting the zero lower bound.\nThe more we can lower interest rates when appropriate, the more we can stimulate the\neconomy and boost employment when needed. That helps us keep closer to our maximum\nemployment goal. Research on this question has found that an inflation objective of 2 percent or\nhigher generally provides plenty of maneuvering room for the Fed, except in the most severe\nrecessions.5\nSo a little bit of inflation may be desirable. But, of course, too much inflation would be\ninconsistent with our price stability mandate. Moreover, high inflation carries with it\nconsiderable costs in terms of economic efficiency. Weighing these considerations, my fellow\nFed policymakers and I have concluded that a 2 percent inflation rate—as measured by the\npersonal consumption expenditures price index—is most consistent, over the longer run, with our\nmandate. It represents the best compromise between having inflation close to zero, but not so\nlow that downward nominal wage rigidity or the zero lower bound pose significant problems for\nthe economy. The Federal Reserve’s policy body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or\n3 See Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996).\n4 See Summers (1991) for an early exposition on this point.\n5 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and Williams (2009).\n4\n\nFOMC, officially announced this objective of 2 percent inflation in a statement entitled “Longer-\nRun Goals and Policy Strategy” released following our most recent meeting in January.6\nWhat about the second component of the Fed’s mandate—maximum employment? The\ndictionary defines “maximum” as “the greatest quantity possible.” Once again, that goal can’t be\ntaken too literally. It’s absurd to interpret the law to mean that every man, woman, and child in\nthe nation should be working three full-time jobs, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year! Child labor\nlaws and the human needs for food, rest, and recreation make it plain that maximum employment\nmust mean something far short of nonstop work. Nor does maximum employment suggest we\nshould be aiming for an unemployment rate of zero.\nA more reasonable and practical interpretation is that maximum employment is the level\nthat’s consistent with the other aspects of the mandate. To make this clear, I’ll need to delve into\neconomic theory about the relationship between inflation and employment.\nImagine that the economy was stronger than it is today and that the rate of unemployment\nwas low. What would happen if the Fed tried to stimulate the economy further and drive\nemployment even higher? It would be harder for employers to find and keep qualified workers.\nEmployers would have to offer hefty increases in pay and benefits, driving up labor costs\nrapidly. Since labor costs make up around 60 percent of the cost of producing U.S. goods and\nservices, employers would feel rising pressure to boost prices or accept narrower profit margins.\nIn other words, if the Fed attempted to drive unemployment too low, labor costs and prices\nwould eventually spiral upwards. And that would run smack into our mandate to promote stable\nprices.\n6See Board of Governors (2012). Other central banks have generally chosen inflation goals of around 2 percent as\nwell, presumably for much the same reasons as I laid out here. See Kuttner (2004).\n5\n\nEconomists speak of the Phillips curve, which describes how, in the short run, inflation\ntends to rise as unemployment falls below a certain level. And inflation tends to fall when\nunemployment is high. The level of unemployment at which there are no upward or downward\npressures on inflation is called the natural rate of unemployment. Importantly, if the central bank\nwere to try to push unemployment consistently below its natural rate, the result would be an\nuncontrollable upward spiral of wages and prices. In the end, such a policy would fail to drive\nunemployment below its natural rate anyway!7\nThe logic of the Phillips curve tells us that literally maximum employment—or minimum\nunemployment—is inconsistent with the price stability mandate. To strike a balance between\nthese conflicting objectives, we need to interpret our employment mandate as the goal of\nachieving maximum sustainable employment. By sustainable, we think of a level of\nemployment that doesn’t create pressure for inflation to rise or fall—that is, one consistent with\nthe unemployment rate equaling the natural rate of unemployment.\nBut what actually is the natural rate of unemployment, that is, the level that creates neither\nupward nor downward pressure on inflation? Clearly, it’s not a zero unemployment rate. Even\nin an ideal economy, it takes time to search for work and actually get hired, just the way it takes\ntime to find a mate using a computer dating service. We use the word “frictions” to describe the\nthings that make finding a job—or a spouse—time consuming. Because of these frictions, the\nnatural rate of unemployment is a positive number that depends on the dynamics of the labor\nmarket.\nIn this regard, the Fed’s maximum employment goal fundamentally differs from the price\nstability goal. In the long run, inflation is determined by the actions the central bank takes—in\nother words, by monetary policy. So we Fed policymakers can set an inflation target we think\n7 See Friedman (1968) and Phelps (1968) for early expositions of this principle.\n6\n\nbest. But the natural rate of unemployment is not determined by the central bank. Rather, the\nnatural rate reflects market forces and tends to shift as labor market frictions change. According\nto the FOMC statement that I mentioned before, quote, “The maximum level of employment is\nlargely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor\nmarket,” and “These factors may change over time.”\nUnfortunately, there is no way to know exactly what the natural rate of unemployment is.\nIt’s not a number you can look up in a statistical table. In fact, the natural rate is the subject of\nintensive economic research and debate. Economists must estimate it using economic or\nstatistical models. In addition, because it fluctuates over time due to changes in labor force\ndemographics and other factors, economists must regularly refine these estimates as new data\ncome in. As a result, each FOMC participant estimates the natural rate of unemployment for him\nor herself, and makes policy judgments accordingly.\nTypical estimates of the current natural rate of unemployment tend to range between 6 and\n7 percent.8 These estimates are higher than usual because of the damage the recent recession did\nto the efficient functioning of the labor market. Slide 2 shows estimates of the natural rate of\nunemployment computed by the staff of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, along with the\nactual unemployment rate. Since 2008, the unemployment rate has been far above our estimates\nof the natural rate. In fact, the gap between unemployment and our natural rate estimates has\nbeen larger than at any time in the past 25 years. Economists generally expect the natural rate of\nunemployment to decline somewhat over the next decade as the effects of the recession on the\nlabor market diminish. In the Federal Reserve’s recent statement, most FOMC participants’\nlonger-run estimates of the natural rate of unemployment range from 5 to 6 percent.\n8 For other estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, see Weidner and Williams (2011), Daly et al. (2011), and\nthe Congressional Budget Office (2012).\n7\n\nNow, let’s turn to the third part of the Fed’s mandate, the injunction to promote moderate\nlong-term interest rates. This goal receives the least attention of the Fed’s three mandates. And\njustifiably so. That’s because it’s a natural corollary of the price stability goal. To see this, it’s\nhelpful to break down an interest rate into two parts: the inflation-adjusted, or real, rate; plus\nexpected inflation. Slide 3 shows the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds and the rate of inflation\nfrom 1960 to 2010. It also shows a survey measure of 10-year expected inflation, which starts in\n1980. As you can see, expected inflation was high in the early 1980s, when inflation was high.\nIt has been much lower and more stable over the past decade, when inflation has been low.\nThere’s no question that Fed policy affects long-term interest rates in the economy. But\nmonetary economists have long known that the Fed cannot permanently affect the first part of\nthe interest rate equation—the real interest rate. In the long run, real interest rates depend\nprimarily on real returns to investments in productive capital, such as plant and equipment. The\nFed has little ability to control long-term trends in the productivity of investment in the U.S.\neconomy.\nHowever, we can and do affect long-term interest rates through our influence over the\nsecond part of the equation—long-term inflation expectations. If we succeed in keeping these\nexpectations low, then, all else being equal, long-term interest rates should be moderate on\naverage. In this way, the Fed’s mandate to achieve moderate long-term interest rates is simply a\nreaffirmation of its mandate to keep inflation low and prices stable. And that’s the reason most\npeople speak of the Fed having a dual mandate, rather than a triple mandate.\nBest practice monetary policy\nSo far, I’ve translated the broad mandate that Congress gave us in terms of two more-\nconcrete goals. First, aim for an average inflation rate of 2 percent. And, second, try to keep the\n8\n\nunemployment rate near our best estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. To a great\nextent, these goals are harmonious and monetary policy is pretty straightforward. Sometimes\nthough, we face tradeoffs between our goals. And that’s when difficult policy choices are\nunavoidable.\nLet me quote again from the FOMC statement: “the Committee seeks to mitigate\ndeviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the\nCommittee’s assessments of its maximum level,” end quote. If the Committee judges that these\ngoals are in conflict in the short run, then, quote, “it follows a balanced approach in promoting\nthem, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time\nhorizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent\nwith its mandate,” end quote. In other words, we look at how much unemployment and inflation\nare deviating from ideal levels. And we consider how long it is likely to take them to return to\nideal levels. Let me elaborate.\nA large literature argues that monetary policymakers should set the policy interest rate in\nsuch a way as to bring the expected future paths of unemployment and inflation as close to their\ngoals as possible.9 Technically, a simple way to capture this idea is for monetary policymakers\nto formulate a plan for interest rates and any other monetary policy instruments that minimizes a\nloss function.\nI’m going to leave the equations to an extended footnote.10 What I want to stress here is\nthat such a technical exercise provides a clear summary of the kind of real-world choices Fed\n9 See Woodford (2003).\n10 A simple way to capture this idea mathematically is for monetary policymakers to formulate a plan for interest\nrates and any other monetary policy instruments that minimizes a loss function. The following equation has several\nparts.\n(cid:2998)\nmin (cid:1831) (cid:3533)(cid:2012)(cid:3047)(cid:4670)(cid:4666)(cid:2024) (cid:3398)(cid:2024)∗(cid:4667)(cid:2870)(cid:3397)(cid:2019)(cid:4666)(cid:1873) (cid:3398)(cid:1873)∗(cid:4667)(cid:2870)(cid:4671)\n(cid:4668)(cid:3036)(cid:3295)(cid:4669)\n(cid:3047)(cid:3116) (cid:3047) (cid:3047) (cid:3047)\n(cid:3047)(cid:2880)(cid:3047)(cid:3116)\n9\n\npolicymakers must make. Unemployment and inflation typically fluctuate around the longer-run\nlevels consistent with our mandates because of various economic shocks. Sometimes they veer\nvery far from the levels consistent with our mandates. Certainly, that’s the case now with\nunemployment. Given these fluctuations, it’s impossible for the FOMC to achieve a perfect\noutcome. Instead, we must try to do the best we can, given that monetary policy affects output\nand inflation with substantial lags.\nLet me give an example from before the financial crisis to drive home this point. Let’s\nsuppose that the economy is hit by a large increase in oil prices. This has all the features of a\nclassic supply shock. It causes both the unemployment rate and the inflation rate to increase.\nOur employment and price stability goals may be in conflict.\nEasing policy would help bring unemployment back to its natural rate. But that would\nimply that it would take longer to get back to 2 percent inflation. Even worse, it might mean that\n2 percent inflation wouldn’t be attainable at any reasonable time horizon! Conversely, tightening\nmonetary policy would bring inflation back to 2 percent more quickly. But unemployment\nwould take longer to get back to its natural rate.\nIn this example, the extent to which monetary policy should ease or tighten depends on\nmany factors. It would partly depend on the relative weight we assign to economic losses caused\nby unemployment and excess inflation. Other important considerations would be how quickly\nThe minimization operator in front denotes that policymakers are trying to minimize the loss function to the right by\nchoosing the optimal interest rate plan, {i}, where t ranges over all future dates and the plan for interest rates or\nt\nother monetary policy instrument i will typically be a function of the realizations of shocks and new information\nt\nthat come to light as time progresses. The expectations operator E means that there is uncertainty about the loss\nfunction, and policymakers are trying to minimize the expected value, or average of that loss function, across all\npossible uncertain outcomes. The sum is over all future dates t, and the quantity δ < 1 describes the rate at which\npolicymakers, on behalf of society, discount the future relative to the present. The variable π denotes the inflation\nt\nrate at each future date t, and π* denotes the mandate-consistent inflation rate of 2 percent per year. The variable u\nt\ndenotes the unemployment rate at each future date t, and (cid:1873)∗ denotes the natural rate of unemployment, which might\n(cid:3047)\nvary over time. The parameter λ represents the relative weight that policymakers place on stabilizing unemployment\nvs. stabilizing inflation around their mandate-consistent levels. It is important to note that both the deviation of\ninflation from its mandate-consistent level and the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate are squared—\nthat is, the loss function penalizes us for letting unemployment or inflation get too low as well as too high.\n10\n\nunemployment and inflation would be expected to return to levels consistent with our mandate.\nAnd we would want to estimate the relative sizes of the effects of monetary policy actions on\nunemployment and inflation. But, whatever the specific policy choices, the important point is\nthat both inflation and unemployment would eventually return to levels consistent with our goals.\nThe current stance of monetary policy\nWhat does this tell us about where monetary policy should be now? Inflation in 2012 and\n2013 is likely to come in around 1½ percent, below the FOMC’s 2 percent target. And clearly,\nwith unemployment at 8.3 percent, we are very far from maximum employment. At the San\nFrancisco Fed, our forecast is that the unemployment rate will remain well over 7 percent for\nseveral more years.\nThis is a situation in which there’s no conflict between maximum employment and price\nstability. With regard to both of the Fed’s mandates, it’s vital that we keep the monetary policy\nthrottle wide open. This will help lower unemployment and raise inflation back toward levels\nconsistent with our mandates. And we want to do so quickly to minimize total economic\ndamage. The longer we miss our objectives, the larger the cumulative loss to the economy.\nWhat does this mean in practice? Our ability to affect the economy is rooted in our\ninfluence over interest rates. In the simplest terms, when the Fed raises interest rates, that tends\nto damp economic activity and lower inflation. By contrast, cutting interest rates spurs economic\nactivity and allows inflation to rise.\nOur standard tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks pay to borrow from each\nother on overnight loans. We have substantial control over the federal funds rate through what\nare called open market operations, that is, buying and selling U.S. Treasury securities to inject or\nwithdraw money from the banking system. The federal funds rate serves as a benchmark for\n11\n\nother short-term interest rates, and it indirectly influences longer-term rates as well. In this way,\nthe Fed has a broad ability to affect the level of interest rates throughout the economy.\nWe have pushed the federal funds rate close to zero because of the severe recession of\n2007 through 2009, and the weak recovery since. We’ve said we expect to keep the federal\nfunds rate extremely low at least through late 2014. Meanwhile, with the fed funds rate near\nzero, we’ve used some unconventional monetary policy tools to try to push down longer-term\ninterest rates further. Our policy initiatives are a major reason why interest rates across the entire\nyield curve are at or near record low levels for the post-World War II period.\nThis is truly an extraordinary time for monetary policy. I’ve talked about some of the\ntradeoffs central bankers face. But I don’t see such tradeoffs today. Now is one of those\nmoments when everything points in the same direction. The Fed is committed to achieving\nmaximum employment and price stability. And we’re doing everything in our power to move\ntowards those goals. Thank you very much.\n12\n\n13\n\nReferences\nAkerlof, George A., William T. Dickens, and George L.

    "text": "Presentation to The Columbian’s 2012 Economic Forecast Breakfast\nVancouver, Washington\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 10, 2012\nThe Federal Reserve and the Economic Recovery\nGood morning. It’s a great pleasure to join you at The Columbian’s Economic Forecast\nBreakfast. It’s amazing to think that Lewis and Clark came by here on their way to the Pacific\nOcean just a little more than 200 years ago. Of course, I arrived by plane and didn’t need\nSacagawea to show me the way. Yet, despite all the changes, this area is still majestic and truly\na pleasure to visit.\nThe subject of my talk is the economy and what the Federal Reserve is doing to\nencourage economic growth while keeping inflation low. This morning, I’ll review the events of\nrecent years, with a special eye on how the boom and bust in housing affected the recession and\nthe economic recovery. I’ll talk about the measures the Federal Reserve has taken to combat the\nfinancial crisis and to bolster the economy. That leads naturally to the current economic\nsituation and my forecast of where things are going from here. I’ll focus on the progress we’re\nmaking toward the two goals Congress has assigned the Fed: maximum employment and stable\nprices. I’ll conclude with a few words about the current stance of Fed policy. I should stress that\nI’m expressing my own views and not those of anybody else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. economy has been growing for the past two-and-a-half years. Nonetheless, we\nare still suffering from the aftereffects of the worst recession of the post-World War II period.\nThe economic recovery has been notably weak and the unemployment rate is still shockingly\n1\n\nhigh. And, as I will explain in a few minutes, I expect the pace of economic growth to be\nfrustratingly slow and the unemployment rate to remain very high for years to come.\nSo, why isn’t our economy doing better? What’s holding us back? To answer these\nquestions, we need to roll back the clock to when our problems started. Let me take you back to\nthe early 2000s. Back then, we were also in the midst of a sluggish recovery—from the\nrecession that followed the dot-com crash. At the time, the housing market was starting to take\noff. The housing boom provided a welcome boost to the economy. As house prices rose, people\nfelt wealthier and began spending money more freely.\nBuyers rushed into the housing market, confident that prices would keep going up and up.\nMeanwhile, lenders became convinced that home prices would stay on the escalator up, and they\nthought the risk of a major housing downturn was remote. Mortgages became easier and easier\nto get, and the terms became more and more generous. Amidst all this, the subprime mortgage\nmarket mushroomed. After all, if prices are rising, even a loan to a borrower with less-than-\nsterling credit looks safe.\nFinancial engineers sliced and diced all these mortgages into securities that few could\nunderstand, and they sold those securities to investors around the world. Lenders threw caution\nto the wind, knowing they could sell even the riskiest mortgages to investors hungry for slightly\nhigher interest rates. Even people who lacked the income to make monthly payments could just\nsign their name and walk away with a mortgage. They didn’t even have to make a down\npayment. Add to that a dash of fraud and a dollop of weak regulation, and you have a recipe for\na bubble of historic proportions.\nEverything appeared just dandy as long as house prices kept rising. And, indeed, prices\nwere shooting up at double-digit rates every year. Ordinary folks found themselves sitting on\n2\n\ntens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in home equity. It was easy to convert that equity\ninto cash to buy an SUV or a new dining room set. And, despite all the risky lending, home\ndelinquencies were low. As long as home prices rose, everybody was happy. Financial\ninstitutions had plenty of capital and made lots of money.\nTragically though, the boom contained the seeds of its own destruction. By one measure,\nhouse prices were about 70 percent overvalued at their peak in 2006. Since then, of course,\nhouse prices have plunged—by about 30 percent nationwide, and even more in places such as\nLas Vegas, Phoenix, and Florida. As prices tumbled, many borrowers behaved exactly the way\nyou would expect—they stopped making payments. Foreclosures surged, and home sales\nplummeted. It turned into a free fall of catastrophic dimensions.\nProblems first surfaced in subprime mortgages, but they soon spread far beyond. At one\npoint, nearly 10 percent of all mortgages were in serious trouble or in foreclosure. As\nforeclosures and delinquencies skyrocketed, lenders and other financial institutions that had\nplaced big bets on the mortgage market posted massive losses. Investors in U.S. mortgages were\nspread all over the world. No one was sure who was left holding the bag. Financial institutions\nbecame afraid to lend money to anybody, including other financial institutions. That choked off\nthe routine flow of funds that financial institutions depend on to finance their day-to-day\noperations. It culminated in 2008 in an enormous financial panic that destroyed some of the\nbiggest players in the financial industry and came close to bringing down the global financial\nsystem.\nThink back to the fall of 2008. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, institutions central to the\nAmerican system of home finance, had become insolvent and were taken over by the\ngovernment. A major investment bank, Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt. WaMu, the nation’s\n3\n\nlargest savings and loan, and an institution you Washingtonians knew well, failed. AIG, the\nnation’s largest insurance company, was on the brink of failure because of bets it had made on\nthe mortgage market. Money market funds, a symbol of safety for tens of millions of\nAmericans, were threatening to impose losses on customers who had thought their investments\nwere rock solid. No one knew how big the problem was or which companies would survive.\nThe result was panic, with everyone trying to take cover from risk at the same time.\nThis kind of massive financial panic could have ushered in a major depression. Indeed, it\nwas for just this reason that the Federal Reserve System was created nearly 100 years ago. Back\nin the second half of the 19th and the early 20th centuries, financial panics wiped out banks and\nother financial institutions, large and small. During those repeated panics, credit, the lifeblood of\nour economy, became almost entirely unavailable to households and businesses. These episodes\nwere marked by widespread bankruptcy and economic depression.\nIn late 2008, we were facing just such a panic, teetering on the edge of an abyss. If the\npanic had been left unchecked, we could well have seen an economic cataclysm as bad as the\nGreat Depression, when 25 percent of the workforce was out of work.\nWhy then didn’t we fall into that abyss in 2008 and 2009? The answer is that a financial\ncollapse was not—I repeat, not—left unchecked. The Federal Reserve did what it was supposed\nto do. The Fed is the nation’s government-chartered central bank, charged by law with\nsafeguarding the financial system. Among other things, that means acting as lender of last resort\nduring periods of panic. One of the Fed’s jobs is to supply emergency loans to financial\ninstitutions when normal funding isn’t available. At the same time, the Fed and other federal\nagencies set up an array of special programs to support vital financial markets. For example, the\n4\n\nFed backstopped the market that corporations use to get short-term funding to finance payrolls,\ninventories, and the like.\nNow there are many myths associated with these emergency programs. I would like to\ntake this opportunity to dispel some of them. First, these programs were not “secret.” The fact is\nthat all of these programs were publicly announced and reported on regularly. Indeed, the\namounts lent in each program were shown on Fed financial documents made public every week.\nThe only thing that wasn’t disclosed at the time was the names of specific borrowers and the\namounts lent to them. Second, this lending did not put taxpayer money at significant risk. All of\nthe lending was backed by good collateral and the vast majority of it has been fully repaid.\nIndeed, these emergency lending programs alone generated an estimated $20 billion in interest\nincome. That income, like all the net income the Fed generates after its expenses, went to the\nU.S. Treasury. Third, borrowers did not get below-market interest rates. Many of our programs\ncharged penalty rates so that borrowers would want to go back to the private markets as soon as\nthey opened up again. Fourth, the Fed is audited. Our financial books are subject to a stringent\nreporting process and regularly reviewed by Congress.1\nThe Fed’s actions, along with those of the U.S. Treasury and other agencies, succeeded in\nstemming the global financial panic. I recognize that some of these actions have not been\npopular, especially at a time when so many people are suffering. But, in the midst of a financial\npanic, they were essential to stabilizing the financial system and saving the economy.\nThere’s no doubt that these programs helped us avert a depression. But the damage done\nby a burst housing bubble and a financial crisis was great, and we couldn’t escape a very painful\nrecession. The lingering effects of those dramatic events are still with us today in the form of a\n1 For more information on audits of the Federal Reserve, see the website\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm.\n5\n\nrecovery that’s unusually slow and weak. More than 13 million Americans remain out of work.\nIt’s astonishing that nearly a third of them have been without a job for a year or more. The level\nof unemployment is a national calamity that demands our attention.\nI’d like to turn now to why the recovery has been so weak. The answer is that the\nbursting of the housing bubble and the resulting financial crisis unleashed at least four powerful\nforces that have sapped the recovery of its vigor: First, it destroyed household wealth. Second,\nit left the housing market in a deep depression. Third, it made credit hard to get. And, fourth, it\nleft a legacy of uncertainty that clouds the future. Let’s consider those in order.\nThe collapse of house prices contributed to a decline in the wealth of households of some\nsix-and-a-half trillion—that’s trillion with a “T”—dollars. And, with the financial system and\neconomy on the brink, the stock market plummeted. This one-two punch deprived households of\nboth the means and the will to spend. So it’s hardly surprising that consumer spending has been\nsubdued.\nWhat about housing? Past recoveries typically got a jump-start from home construction\nand spending on household goods, such as furniture, appliances, and the like. This time though\nthe housing market is mired in a historical state of depression. We still see millions of homes in\nforeclosure, and millions more on the verge. With the housing market so distressed, there’s little\nsign that prices are poised to rise. Meanwhile, nearly 30 percent of all mortgages are currently\nunder water, meaning that borrowers owe more than the homes are worth. No wonder that\nconstruction and new home sales are still near the lowest levels recorded since the early 1960s.\nWeak consumer spending and depressed housing are closely related to a third powerful\nforce holding back the recovery—tight credit. It’s the nature of a financial crisis that the\npendulum swings from loose credit, when it’s easy to borrow, to tight credit, when loans are hard\n6\n\nto get. This time, that swing was breathtaking. In today’s mortgage market, customers without\nexcellent credit scores and cash for a hefty down payment find it tough to borrow. Likewise,\nmany small businesses are shut out of the loan market because they may not be able to use\nresidential or commercial real estate as collateral. Anecdotal reports and surveys suggest that\ncredit conditions have been easing. Indeed, corporations that can sell securities in the financial\nmarkets have great access to capital. But, for households, the going is still tough. And small\nbusinesses find that many of the community banks they relied on are too weak to open the credit\nspigots.\nThe final force I want to mention is the depressing effect on spending and investment\ncaused by uncertainty. By almost any measure, uncertainty is high. Businesses are uncertain\nabout the economic environment and the direction of economic policy. Households are uncertain\nabout job prospects and future incomes. Political gridlock in Washington, D.C., and the crisis in\nEurope add to a sense of foreboding. I repeatedly hear from my business contacts that these\nuncertainties are prompting them to slow investment and hiring. As one of them put it,\nuncertainty is causing firms to “step back from the playing field.” Economists at the San\nFrancisco Fed calculate that uncertainty has reduced consumer and business spending so much\nthat it has potentially added a full percentage point to the unemployment rate.\nYet, even in the face of these obstacles, the economy is growing at a moderate pace.\nProspects are that it will continue to do so. This is a testament to the natural resilience of our\neconomic system. As I mentioned, credit conditions are slowly improving. Little by little,\nhouseholds are repairing their finances. Businesses are gradually increasing production and\nhiring extra hands. The housing market is no longer falling, and home construction eventually\nwill recover to levels consistent with a growing population.\n7\n\nThe broadest barometer of economic conditions is gross domestic product, which\nmeasures the nation’s total output of goods and services. My forecast calls for GDP to rise\nnearly 2½ percent this year and about 3 percent in 2013. That’s an improvement from 2011,\nwhen I estimate GDP grew about 1¾ percent. Unfortunately, such moderate growth will not be\nenough to take a big bite out of unemployment. The unemployment rate is currently 8.5 percent.\nI expect it to remain over 8 percent well into next year and still be around 7 percent at the end of\n2014.\nI should mention one risk that would cause the economy to perform much worse. That’s\nthe situation in Europe. The governments of several countries that use the euro as their currency\nhave been struggling to pay their debts. Greece in particular appears unable to meet its\nobligations. At the same time, countries such as Italy have been forced to pay unsustainably high\ninterest rates. This has raised questions about the health of European financial institutions that\ninvest in government bonds.\nEuropean leaders have been working to solve this problem and they may be able to\nmuddle through. But, if they fail, all bets are off. The agreement binding together the countries\nthat use the euro could break up, sending shock waves through financial markets around the\nworld. Under such circumstances, the United States could hardly escape unscathed.\nI’d like to say a brief word about inflation. Some observers feared that the Fed’s\naggressive actions to boost the economy would cause inflation to jump. That simply hasn’t\nhappened. The prices of oil and other commodities did jump last year in the face of strong\nglobal demand. But commodity prices have retreated notably since then and so has the overall\ninflation rate. And there’s no sign that the public or financial markets expect inflation to rise\nmuch. I expect inflation to come in under 1½ percent this year and next, down from about 2½\n8\n\npercent in 2011. That would put inflation a bit below the rate of about 2 percent that most Fed\npolicymakers consider healthiest.\nSo what does the story I’ve told mean for Federal Reserve policy? The Fed has taken\nextraordinary action to boost growth. That effort is ongoing.\nThe Fed sets policy with an eye on the two goals Congress has assigned it: maximum\nemployment and stable prices. Inflation is likely to fall a bit below what I consider the level\nmost consistent with the stable-prices mandate. And clearly, with unemployment at 8.5 percent,\nwe are very far from maximum employment. During the recession, Congress and the White\nHouse used the federal budget to stimulate the economy by raising spending and trimming taxes.\nNow, the agenda in Washington, D.C., is to control spending and cut the federal budget deficit.\nThose are essential goals in the long run. But, in the short run, such government austerity is\ndamping the economy, not boosting it. And it’s being reinforced as state and local governments\nalso pare spending. In this situation, it’s vital that the Fed use all the tools at its disposal to\nachieve its mandated employment and price stability goals.\nThe Fed influences the economy through its ability to affect interest rates. When the\neconomy is overheating, we raise interest rates, which dampens economic activity. When the\neconomy is not performing well, we cut interest rates, which stimulates activity. Our usual tool\nis the federal funds rate, which is what banks pay to borrow from each other on overnight loans.\nThe federal funds rate serves as a benchmark for other short-term interest rates and it indirectly\ninfluences longer-term rates as well. In this way, the Fed has a broad ability to affect the level of\ninterest rates throughout the economy.\nWe at the Fed have guidelines that allow us to set interest rate targets based on the levels\nof unemployment, inflation, and other economic indicators. So what do those guidelines tell us\n9\n\nnow? With inflation under control and unemployment so high, those guidelines tell us\nsomething most unusual: the federal funds rate should actually be in negative territory.\nOf course, it’s not possible for the federal funds rate to go below zero, which is about\nwhere we’ve put it for the past three years. But that doesn’t mean that we are out of ammunition.\nWe’ve created new ways to stimulate the economy. For example, we’ve purchased over one-\nand-a-half trillion dollars of longer-term securities issued by the U.S. government and mortgage\nagencies.\nThis policy works through the law of supply and demand. When we buy large quantities\nof securities, we increase demand for those securities. Higher demand equals lower interest\nrates. As the yields on longer-term Treasury securities come down, other longer-term interest\nrates also tend to fall. That reduces the cost of borrowing on everything from mortgages to\ncorporate debt. Our securities purchases are an important reason why longer-term interest rates\nare at or near post-World War II lows.\nIn addition, we’ve publicly stated that we expect to keep the federal funds rate\nexceptionally low through at least mid-2013. That kind of statement can lower interest rates\ntoday by letting investors know that rates are likely to stay low for a long time.\nMy message this morning is that we at the Fed are doing everything we can to move the\neconomy forward. We’ve pushed short-term interest rates about as far down as they can go.\nAnd our unconventional programs have pushed longer-term rates down as well. These are not\nmagic. Lower interest rates alone can’t fix all the economy’s problems. But they do help.\nConditions are far better today than they would be if the Fed hadn’t administered such strong\nmedicine. What’s also needed are tax and spending policies that work together with Federal\nReserve programs to stimulate the economy. For example, I’d like to see federal programs that\n10\n\nsupport the housing market.2 Housing has been at the center of the crisis and is one of the big\nimpediments to recovery.\nOne thing we are hard at work on now is improving our communication of the Fed’s\nmonetary policy strategy and plans. Our moves toward greater openness in recent years have\nmade our policies more effective and helped the public understand the Fed’s actions better. Just\nlast month, we decided to start reporting our expectations for the likely future course of short-\nterm interest rates. This should reduce public uncertainty and confusion about our thinking and\nour plans regarding monetary policy. Another step toward more transparency and accountability\ncould include laying out more explicitly our policy strategy and our longer-run goals.\nThe policy actions the Fed takes from here on out will depend on how economic\nconditions develop. I want to assure you that the Fed will do its level best to achieve the goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices. Thank you very much.\n2 For a detailed discussion of the problems in the housing market and policy options to address these issues, see\n“The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations,” Board of Governors white paper,\nJanuary 4, 2012, http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/files/housing-white-paper-20120104.pdf.\n11",

    "text": "Presentation to the Bishop Ranch Forum\nSan Ramon, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on Feb. 8, 2012\nThe Federal Reserve and the Economic Recovery\nGood morning. I want to thank Alex and all of you for coming to the forum this\nmorning. I get to travel all over the world to give talks, but I’ll admit it’s nice to be able to just\njump in my car and not have to go through airport security and delays to be with you today.\nThe subject of my talk is the economy and what the Federal Reserve is doing to\nencourage economic growth while keeping inflation low. This morning, I’ll review the events of\nrecent years, with a special eye on how the boom and bust in housing affected the recession and\nthe economic recovery. I’ll talk about the measures the Federal Reserve has taken to combat the\nfinancial crisis and to bolster the economy. That leads naturally to the current economic\nsituation and my forecast of where things are going from here. I’ll focus on the progress we’re\nmaking toward the two goals Congress has assigned the Fed: maximum employment and stable\nprices. I’ll conclude with a few words about the current stance of Fed policy. I should stress that\nI’m expressing my own views and not those of anybody else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe good news is that the U.S. economy has been growing for the past two-and-a-half\nyears. The unemployment rate has fallen about three-quarters of a percentage point in the past\nfour months, and is now at its lowest level in nearly three years. Nonetheless, we are still\nsuffering from the aftereffects of the worst recession of the post-World War II period. Compared\nto the pattern seen in past recessions, the economic recovery has been weak. And, despite\nrelatively strong job gains in recent months, the unemployment rate remains very high. As I will\n1\n\nexplain in a few minutes, I expect the pace of economic growth to be frustratingly slow and the\nunemployment rate to remain high for years to come.\nSo, why isn’t our economy doing better? What’s holding us back? To answer these\nquestions, we need to look back at events during the housing boom when the problems plaguing\nus today got started. Let me take you back to the early 2000s, when the housing market took off.\nAs house prices rose, people felt wealthier and began spending money more freely.\nBuyers rushed into the housing market, confident that prices would keep going up and up.\nMeanwhile, lenders became convinced that home prices would stay on the escalator up, and they\nthought the risk of a major housing downturn was remote. Mortgages became easier and easier\nto get, and the terms became more and more generous. Amidst all this, the subprime mortgage\nmarket mushroomed. After all, if prices are rising, lending to a borrower with less-than-sterling\ncredit looks safe.\nFinancial engineers sliced and diced all these mortgages into securities that few could\nunderstand, and they sold those securities to investors around the world. Lenders threw caution\nto the wind, knowing they could sell even the riskiest mortgages to investors hungry for slightly\nhigher interest rates. Even people who lacked the income to make monthly payments could just\nsign their name and walk away with a mortgage. They didn’t even have to make a down\npayment. Add to that a dash of fraud and a dollop of weak regulation, and you have a recipe for\na bubble of historic proportions.\nEverything appeared just dandy as long as house prices kept rising—and rise they did.\nOrdinary folks found themselves sitting on tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in\nhome equity, which could be turned into cash to buy an SUV or a new dining room set. Despite\nall the risky lending, home loan delinquencies were low. As long as home prices rose,\n2\n\neverybody was happy. Financial institutions had plenty of capital—at least on paper—and made\nlots of money.\nTragically though, the boom contained the seeds of its own destruction. By one measure,\nhouse prices were about 70 percent overvalued at their peak in 2006. Since then, of course,\nhouse prices have plunged—by about 30 percent nationwide, and even more in places such as\nLas Vegas, Phoenix, and Florida. As prices tumbled, many borrowers behaved exactly the way\nyou would expect—they stopped making payments. Foreclosures surged, and home sales\nplummeted. It turned into a free fall of catastrophic dimensions.\nProblems first surfaced in subprime mortgages, but they soon spread far beyond. At one\npoint, nearly 10 percent of all mortgages were in serious trouble or in foreclosure. As\ndelinquencies and foreclosures skyrocketed, lenders and other financial institutions that had\nplaced big bets on the mortgage market posted massive losses. Financial institutions became\nfearful of lending money to anybody, including other financial institutions. That choked off the\nflow of funds that financial institutions depend on to finance their day-to-day operations. It\nculminated in 2008 in an enormous financial panic that destroyed some of the biggest players in\nthe financial industry and came close to bringing down the global financial system.\nThink back to the fall of 2008. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, institutions central to the\nAmerican system of home finance, had become insolvent and were taken over by the\ngovernment. A major investment bank, Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt. WaMu, the nation’s\nlargest savings and loan, failed. AIG, the nation’s largest insurance company, was on the brink\nof failure because of bets it had made on the mortgage market. Money market funds were\nthreatening to impose losses on customers who had thought their investments were rock solid.\n3\n\nNo one knew how big the problem was or which companies would survive. The result was\npanic, with everyone trying to run for cover at the same time.\nThis kind of massive financial panic could have ushered in a major depression. Indeed, it\nwas for just this reason that the Federal Reserve System was created nearly 100 years ago. Back\nin the second half of the 19th and the early 20th centuries, financial panics wiped out banks and\nother financial institutions, large and small. Credit is the lifeblood of our economy. During\nthose repeated panics, loans became almost entirely unavailable to households and businesses.\nThose episodes were marked by widespread bankruptcy and economic depression.\nIn late 2008, we were facing just such a panic, teetering on the edge of an abyss. If the\npanic had been left unchecked, we could well have seen an economic cataclysm as bad as the\nGreat Depression, when 25 percent of the workforce was out of work.\nWhy then didn’t we fall into that abyss in 2008 and 2009? The answer is that a financial\ncollapse was not—I repeat, not—left unchecked. The Federal Reserve did what it was supposed\nto do. The Fed is the nation’s government-chartered central bank, charged by law with\nsafeguarding the financial system. Among other things, that means acting as lender of last resort\nduring periods of panic. One of the Fed’s jobs is to supply emergency loans to financial\ninstitutions when normal funding isn’t available.

Many of our programs\ncharged penalty rates so that borrowers would want to go back to the private markets as soon as\nthey opened up again. Fourth, the Fed is audited. Our books are subject to a stringent reporting\nprocess and regularly reviewed by Congress.1\nThe Fed’s actions, along with those of the U.S. Treasury and other agencies, succeeded in\nstemming the panic.

The lingering effects of those dramatic events are still with us today in the form of a\nrecovery that’s unusually slow and weak. Almost 13 million Americans are still out of work.\nIt’s astonishing that nearly a third of them have been without a job for a year or more.\nI’d like to turn to why the recovery has been so weak. The answer is that the bursting of\nthe housing bubble and the resulting financial crisis unleashed at least four powerful forces that\nhave sapped the recovery of its vigor: First, it destroyed household wealth. Second, it left the\n1 For more information on audits of the Federal Reserve, see the website\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm.\n5\n\nhousing market in a deep depression. Third, it made credit hard to get. And, fourth, it left a\nlegacy of uncertainty that clouds the future. Let’s consider those in order.\nThe collapse of house prices contributed to a decline in the wealth of households of some\nsix-and-a-half trillion—that’s trillion with a “T”—dollars. And, with the financial system and\neconomy on the brink, the stock market plummeted. This one-two punch deprived households of\nboth the means and the will to spend. So it’s hardly surprising that consumer spending has been\nsubdued.\nWhat about housing? Past recoveries typically got a jump-start from home construction\nand spending on household goods, such as furniture, appliances, and the like. This time though\nthe housing market is mired in a historic state of depression. We still see millions of homes in\nforeclosure, and millions more on the verge. With the housing market so distressed, there’s little\nsign that prices are poised to rise. Meanwhile, about one in four home mortgages are currently\nunder water, meaning that borrowers owe more than the homes are worth. No wonder that\nconstruction and new home sales are still near the lowest levels recorded since the early 1960s.\nWeak consumer spending and depressed housing are closely related to a third powerful\nforce holding back the recovery—tight credit. It’s the nature of a financial crisis that the\npendulum swings from loose credit, when it’s easy to borrow, to tight credit, when loans are hard\nto get. This time, that swing was breathtaking. In today’s mortgage market, customers without\nexcellent credit scores and cash for a hefty down payment find it tough to borrow. Likewise,\nmany small businesses are shut out of the loan market because they may not be able to use\nresidential or commercial real estate as collateral. Anecdotal reports and surveys suggest that\ncredit conditions have been easing. Indeed, corporations that can sell securities in the financial\nmarkets have great access to capital. But, for households, the going can still be tough. And\n6\n\nsmall businesses find that many of the community banks they relied on are too weak to open the\ncredit spigots.\nThe final force I want to mention is the depressing effect on spending and investment\ncaused by uncertainty. By almost any measure, uncertainty is high. Businesses are uncertain\nabout the economic environment and the direction of economic policy. Households are uncertain\nabout job prospects and future incomes. Political gridlock in Washington, D.C., and the crisis in\nEurope add to a sense of foreboding. I repeatedly hear from businesspeople that these\nuncertainties are prompting them to slow investment and hiring.\nYet, even in the face of these obstacles, the economy continues to grow. Prospects are\nthat it will continue to do so. This is a testament to the natural resilience of our economic\nsystem. As I mentioned, credit conditions are slowly improving. Little by little, households are\nrepairing their finances. Businesses are gradually increasing production and hiring extra hands.\nThe housing market is no longer falling, and home construction eventually will recover to levels\nconsistent with a growing population.\nThe broadest barometer of economic conditions is gross domestic product, which\nmeasures the nation’s total output of goods and services. My forecast calls for GDP to rise about\n2¼ percent this year and 2¾ percent in 2013. That’s an improvement from 2011, when GDP\ngrew only a little over 1½ percent. Unfortunately, such moderate growth will not be enough to\nkeep taking big bites out of unemployment. The unemployment rate is currently 8.3 percent. I\nexpect it to remain over 8 percent well into next year and still be well over 7 percent at the end of\n2014.\nBut, that’s a forecast, and things could obviously turn out differently than I expect. One\nrisk in particular could cause the economy to perform much worse than this forecast. That’s the\n7\n\nsituation in Europe. The governments of several countries that use the euro as their currency\nhave been struggling to pay their debts. Greece in particular appears unable to meet its\nobligations. At the same time, countries such as Italy have been forced to pay what might be\nunsustainably high interest rates. This has raised questions about the health of European\nfinancial institutions that invest in government bonds.\nEuropean leaders have been working to solve this problem and they may be able to\nmuddle through. But, if they fail, all bets are off. The agreement binding together the countries\nthat use the euro could break up, sending shock waves through financial markets around the\nworld. Under such circumstances, the United States could hardly escape unscathed.\nSo what does the story I’ve told mean for Federal Reserve policy? The Fed has taken\nextraordinary action to boost growth and keep inflation low. That effort is ongoing.\nThe Fed sets policy with an eye on the two goals Congress has assigned it: maximum\nemployment and stable prices. Clearly, with unemployment at 8.3 percent, we are very far from\nmaximum employment. And I expect inflation to run somewhat below the 2 percent level that\nwe at the Fed are aiming for. In this situation, it’s vital that the Fed use all the tools at its\ndisposal to achieve its mandated employment and price stability goals.\nThe Fed influences the economy through its ability to affect interest rates. When the\neconomy is overheating, we raise interest rates, which dampens economic activity. When the\neconomy is not performing well, like today, we lower interest rates, which stimulates activity.\nOur usual tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks pay to borrow from each other on\novernight loans. The federal funds rate serves as a benchmark for other short-term interest rates\nand it indirectly influences longer-term rates as well. In this way, the Fed has a broad ability to\naffect the level of interest rates throughout the economy.\n8\n\nThe Fed’s monetary policy body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or\nFOMC. Back in December 2008, in response to the deepening recession, the FOMC lowered the\nfederal funds rate close to zero. The Committee has kept the funds rate near zero since then. In\nfact, given the weakness in the economy, standard monetary policy benchmarks indicate that the\nfederal funds rate should have gone deep into negative territory. But, of course, it’s not possible\nfor interest rates to go much below zero.\nSo the Fed has had to look for alternative or “unconventional” ways to stimulate the\neconomy. For example, we’ve purchased over one-and-three-quarters trillion dollars of longer-\nterm securities issued by the U.S. government and mortgage agencies.\nThis policy works through the law of supply and demand. When we buy large quantities\nof securities, we increase demand for those securities, which causes their prices to rise. This\ntranslates into lower interest rates. As the yields on longer-term Treasury securities come down,\nother longer-term interest rates also tend to fall. That reduces the cost of borrowing on\neverything from mortgages to corporate debt. Our securities purchases are an important reason\nwhy longer-term interest rates are at or near post-World War II lows.\nIn addition, we’ve publicly stated that we expect to keep the federal funds rate\nexceptionally low at least through late 2014. This guidance has helped lower longer-term\ninterest rates, like those on home mortgages, car loans, and corporate bonds, by letting investors\nknow that short-term interest rates are likely to stay low for a long time. It’s important to\nemphasize that this is not a promise or commitment to keep rates near zero. Instead, it’s our best\ncollective judgment about the likely future course of policy. And, of course, it will change if the\neconomic outlook changes.\n9\n\nIn addition to these policy actions, we have been hard at work on improving our\ncommunication of the Fed’s monetary policy strategy and plans. We’ve recently taken a number\nof steps in this direction. First, we released a statement of our longer-run goals and strategies—\nessentially, a statement of our monetary policy principles.2 That statement noted that we view a\n2 percent inflation rate as most consistent with our mandates. It also emphasized that we will\ncontinue to carefully balance our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability in\nmaking our policy decisions. This statement is the latest in a series of Fed initiatives toward\ngreater openness and accountability.\nSecond, we now regularly report our views about the probable course of short-term\ninterest rates over the next few years. Unemployment is high, of course, and it’s likely that\ninflation will be below our 2 percent objective for years to come. In those circumstances, most\nFed policymakers expect that we will keep short-term interest rates at their current very low\nlevels into 2014 or later. Releasing the views of policymakers in this fashion should reduce\npublic uncertainty about our plans for monetary policy. And that, in turn, improves the\neffectiveness of our policies.\nWe at the Fed are doing everything we can to move the economy forward. We recognize\nthat monetary policy cannot perform magic. Lower interest rates alone can’t fix all the\neconomy’s problems. But they do help. Conditions are far better today than they would be if the\nFed hadn’t administered such strong medicine. Looking ahead, we may still need to provide\nmore policy accommodation if the economy loses momentum or inflation remains well below 2\npercent. Should that occur, restarting our program of purchasing mortgage-backed securities\nwould likely be the best way to provide a boost to the economy.\n2 For more information, see http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm.\n10\n\nThe policy actions the Fed takes from here will depend on how economic conditions\ndevelop, and they will change as economic circumstances change. I want to assure you that the\nFed will do its level best to achieve the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Thank\nyou very much.\n11",

    "text": "Presentation to Seattle-Area Community Leaders\nBellevue, WA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on June 6, 2012\nThe Economic Outlook: Global and Domestic Challenges to Growth1\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to be with you today. You know, I’m a big Giants fan,\nand I’m thrilled to visit Tim Lincecum’s hometown. Now, Timmy is having a tough start this\nseason. But I have great faith in his ability to bounce back. The subject of my talk is another\nstory about getting back on track—but this one concerns our nation’s economy. We are now\nnearly three years into a recovery from a very severe recession. We’ve made up a lot of ground.\nBut the aftereffects of that terrible downturn are still with us, particularly an unacceptably high\nunemployment rate.\nThis afternoon, I’ll offer my economic outlook for the period ahead. I’ll describe some\nlooming threats that could cause growth to fall short of my expectations, most notably the drama\nplaying out in Europe. I’ll close with my thoughts about Federal Reserve policy. I should note\nthat my remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nAs I noted, our economy has been expanding for nearly three years now. But the pace of\ngrowth has been considerably less robust than in the typical post-World War II recovery. And\nthe gains have been halting. Sometimes the economy seems to build up a head of steam. At\nother times, the momentum flags. This sputtering progress reflects a constellation of forces that\n1 I want to thank John Fernald, Mark Spiegel, and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nhas weighed on economic performance, including the most traumatic housing crash since the\nGreat Depression, tight credit, and widespread uncertainty.2\nDespite these obstacles, the nation has been adding jobs, consumer sentiment has\nimproved over the past year, and household spending has been on the rise. Credit is still tight,\nbut it’s easier to borrow than it used to be. For those who can get credit, borrowing costs are\nexceptionally low, thanks in part to the Fed’s low-interest-rate policies.\nOverall, consumer and business demand pent up during the downturn is slowly reviving.\nTake motor vehicles. Car sales plummeted during the recession and people made do with what\nthey had in the garage. In 2011, the average age of motor vehicles on the road reached a record\n10.8 years. But people get tired of driving old, worn-out cars. With the economy improving and\nauto financing rates at rock bottom, it’s not surprising that traffic in auto showrooms has been\nbrisk. Motor vehicle sales over the first five months of this year are up more than 12 percent\nover the same period last year.\nSimilarly, businesses have been carrying out some of the capital investment postponed\nduring the downturn, especially in the information technology area. Over the past year, business\ninvestment on equipment and software rose over 8 percent, adjusted for inflation.\nWe’re even seeing glimmerings of good news on the housing front. To be sure, we’ve\nbeen fooled by false dawns in housing before. Nonetheless, a number of indicators suggest that\nwe’ve started to claw our way off the bottom. Nationally, house prices no longer appear to be\nfalling. And there are signs that inventories of unsold homes are coming down. There’s still an\nenormous backlog of foreclosed properties. However, anecdotal reports suggest that those\n2 See Williams (2012a) for a discussion of the financial roots of the crisis and how they have affected the pace of\nrecovery.\n2\n\nproperties have been pretty well picked over, encouraging builders to break new ground. As a\nresult, home building is finally rising, though it’s still at extraordinarily low levels.\nAll these are the good signs for our economy. But some others aren’t so encouraging.\nTwo major developments have been holding back growth, and they threaten to derail the\nrecovery in the future. The first is the budget squeeze at all levels of government. Federal\nspending rose in response to the downturn, but that’s been unwinding. At the same time, state\nand local governments have been implementing austerity programs as they seek to close budget\ngaps. Since the recovery began, states and local government payrolls have fallen by about half a\nmillion workers.\nThe fiscal burden on the economy could turn significantly worse at the end of this year,\nwhen federal spending cuts and tax increases are scheduled to kick in. Unless Congress acts,\nnumerous significant tax reductions will expire next year. In addition, large spending cuts will\ntake place automatically under the sequestration procedure agreed to by Congress and the White\nHouse. A recent Congressional Budget Office report suggested that scheduled cuts in spending\nand increases in taxes could knock around 4 percentage points off economic growth in 2013.\nFortunately, I don’t think that will happen. I expect an agreement will be reached that\nwill forestall such a sudden massive swing to fiscal contraction. Still, federal fiscal policy is\nmoving toward greater belt tightening, and that will put a significant drag on economic growth\nnext year. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding the federal budget appears already to be taking\na toll on business and consumer confidence.\nThe second development restraining the U.S. economy is the European sovereign debt\ncrisis. Needless to say, Europe’s prospects are vitally important to the United States. Our\neconomy is closely tied to Europe on a number of levels. First, the countries of the European\n3\n\nUnion take close to a fifth of our total exports. Second, our financial systems are bound tightly\ntogether. Developments in European financial markets spread to our markets as well.\nTo some extent, this is already happening. Europe’s economic slowdown is limiting\ndemand for our exports. As worries about Europe have escalated, investors across the globe\nhave flocked to the safety of high-quality investments, such as U.S. Treasury securities. This has\npushed Treasury yields down to levels not seen since the 1940s. On their own, lower Treasury\nrates help U.S. economic growth. However, other spillovers from Europe are offsetting these\nbenefits. The flow of money to the United States has boosted the value of the dollar, which\nmakes our goods and services more expensive overseas. The European crisis has also prompted\ninvestors to avoid risky assets more generally, including U.S. stocks and corporate bonds.3\nLower stock prices and higher credit costs weigh on both the willingness and the wherewithal of\nAmerican consumers and businesses to spend.\nAmid these crosscurrents, we’ve managed to maintain a moderate pace of economic\ngrowth, including job gains of about 150,000 per month over the past year. I’m sure you noticed\nthe disappointing employment report for May. However, in looking at the economy, it’s\nimportant not to get carried away by one month’s data. We saw very good jobs numbers early\nthis year, and some commentators rushed to declare that the economy was taking off. More\nrecently, we’ve seen weak numbers, which has prompted commentary that the economy has\nstalled. The fact is, these data fluctuate from month to month. Even the weather can cause big\nswings in job growth. In thinking about where the economy is headed, we should focus on\nunderlying trends and not get caught up in short-term gyrations. In that regard, the underlying\n3 Hale, Marks, and Nechio (2012) show that U.S. corporate bond spreads tend to rise as a result of negative shocks\nin Europe.\n4\n\ntrend in job growth is probably closer to the 150,000 monthly job gain number that we’ve seen\nover the past year than to the recent weaker data.\nAdding jobs at such a pace should bring the unemployment rate down slowly and\nsteadily. Surprisingly though, the unemployment rate has fallen much faster over the past year\nthan one would expect, given the moderate pace of job gains. Just in the past nine months, the\nunemployment rate has declined nearly a percentage point. If it were to continue to drop at this\npace, it would reach 5½ percent by the summer of 2014. That would put it close to its normal,\nlong-term trend level.\nIn fact, I don’t expect the unemployment rate to keep dropping that fast. It’s more likely\nto come down much more gradually over the next few years. To understand why, we have to\nlook at how the unemployment rate is measured. Each month, households are surveyed about\nwhether family members were working and, if not, whether they were actively looking for a job.\nIf they weren’t looking, they aren’t considered part of the labor force. So, if an unemployed\nperson stops looking for work, then the official count of the unemployed drops by one. Clearly,\nsuch a decline doesn’t represent a real improvement in the labor market. It’s just the opposite.\nAnd there’s the key to a significant part of the decline in the unemployment rate over the\npast year or so. Lots of people have simply stopped looking for work and left the labor force.\nOfficially, they are no longer counted as unemployed, even if they want a job. In thinking about\nwhat’s going to happen to the unemployment rate over the next few years, a critical question is\nwhether these people will rejoin the labor force when jobs become available. We can get a clue\nby examining more closely just who has been dropping out of the labor force.\nTo do that, it helps to look at the labor force participation rate, which is the percentage of\nadults in the labor force. Since the start of the recession, the participation rate has dropped from\n5\n\n66 percent to a little under 64 percent, a substantial fall of about 2 percentage points. About half\nof this decline reflects long-running demographic trends.4 For example, there is an ongoing\nprocess of lower labor force participation as the baby boom generation reaches retirement age.\nMost of these boomers are unlikely to reenter the labor force.\nHowever, the other half of the falling labor force participation rate reflects a large exodus\nof young people and adults of prime working age. Many of the prime-age workers who have left\nthe labor force report that they want jobs and are available to work. They just aren’t actively\nlooking for a job, so they’re not counted as unemployed. Most of these people will probably\nreturn to the labor force as things get better. Indeed, many of them have already done so.\nOverall labor force participation has leveled off over the past several months, and participation\namong prime-age males appears to have picked up.\nAs these workers come back into the labor force, I expect the unemployment rate to fall\nmore slowly than it has over the past year. In a sense, this is just arithmetic. Some new jobs will\nbe filled by people reentering the workforce who weren’t previously counted as unemployed.\nThus, as workers reenter the labor force, the unemployment rate is going to come down more\ngradually—even if we create jobs at the past year’s pace.\nPutting it all together, my forecast calls for real gross domestic product to expand at a\nmoderate pace of about 2¼ percent this year and about 2½ percent next year. I expect the\nunemployment rate to remain at or a bit above 8 percent for the remainder of this year, and then\ngradually decline to a little above 7 percent by the end of 2014.\nHowever, the uncertainty around this forecast is great. I mentioned the looming threat of\nautomatic large tax increases and cuts in spending at the start of next year. And the ongoing\nEuropean crisis represents another wild card for the U.S. economy. It’s impossible to predict\n4 Aaronson, Davis, and Hu (2012). The authors examine participation trends since 1999.\n6\n\nwith any certainty how the situation in Europe will play out. My forecast assumes that Europe’s\ndistressed pattern of the past two years will continue. The severe austerity measures\nimplemented in many European countries have choked off economic growth. And that makes it\nharder to trim government deficits. Recurrent spikes in fear and uncertainty are followed by\npiecemeal actions that buy time. What hasn’t emerged is a credible, comprehensive solution to\nEurope’s problems.\nNot surprisingly, the approach Europe has taken so far hasn’t worked well. We’ve seen\nthis in Greece, where each effort to contain the crisis has unraveled. Now, fears that Greece\ncould go through a disorderly default and drop the euro are again capturing headlines. These\nworries have caused people to pull their investments and bank deposits out of Greece, which\nmakes things worse.\nThe crisis has also flared up in Spain, illustrating the need for a much more\ncomprehensive, pan-European approach. The Spanish banking system needs to be recapitalized\non a large scale. Failure to do so would undermine confidence in the banking system, and that\ncould lead to a run on the banks. Spain would then find itself in a massive credit crunch, further\ndamaging the economy. But recapitalization isn’t easy. The Spanish government faces high\nborrowing costs because investors worry that Spain could go the way of Greece. So it’s difficult\nto raise the funds for recapitalization.\nIt’s a chicken-and-egg problem. If the government can make a convincing case that it\nwill do what’s necessary to back the banking system while meeting its own debt obligations,\nthings can work out. But, if doubts arise, then the government’s borrowing costs could\nskyrocket, making it impossible to meet its goals. Without a viable backstop from its European\npartners, the fear of such an outcome could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n7\n\nAs we learned from the financial crisis of 2007–09, events can spin out of control once\npanic takes over. A development that on its own might not be disastrous, such as another Greek\ndefault or even its abandonment of the euro, could set off contagion that would undermine\nconfidence in other countries. The effects could overwhelm private credit markets in Europe,\ncausing a financial meltdown comparable to what we saw here during the financial crisis.\nNeedless to say, if that were to happen, the U.S. economy would be harmed on a number of\nlevels. Our trade with Europe would suffer greatly. And our financial markets would be\nseverely strained.\nOn that somber note, let me turn to monetary policy. I’ll start by citing the dual mandate\nCongress has assigned the Fed: achieving maximum employment and price stability.5 In terms\nof maximum employment, it’s safe to say that most people would view the current 8.2 percent\nunemployment rate as far too high. I completely agree. But, is 7 percent too high? What about\n6 percent? Why shouldn’t we aim for 0 percent?\nEconomists have given this question a great deal of thought. By maximum employment,\nwe mean the highest level that can be sustained without pushing inflation up. So, how far are we\nnow from that holy grail of maximum employment? This is where things get complicated.\nMaximum employment is not a fixed number. It’s a moving target, depending on how efficient\nthe labor market is at matching workers with jobs. For example, if people have to move or learn\nnew skills because of structural shifts in the economy, they may not be ready for the jobs that are\nout there. We may need lots of nurses, but not many construction workers now.\nAt the Fed, we use the unemployment rate as an important yardstick for determining how\nfar we are from maximum employment. Here I want to introduce the concept of the natural rate\n5 The Federal Reserve Act also calls for moderate long-term interest rates. See Williams (2012a) for a discussion of\nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.\n8\n\nof unemployment. Essentially, it’s a way of expressing this concept of maximum employment in\nterms of the unemployment rate. In other words, the natural rate of unemployment is the\nequilibrium rate that pushes inflation neither up nor down.\nThe labor market disruptions I just mentioned have made the market less efficient, which\nraises the natural, noninflationary rate of unemployment. I estimate that this natural rate was\nabout 5 percent before the recession, but is currently around 6¼ percent.6 In May, the\nunemployment rate was 8.2 percent, about 2 percentage points above my estimate of the natural\nrate. So, by this measure, we are very far from our maximum employment mandate. And, as I\nmentioned earlier, I expect the unemployment rate to be above 7 percent until late 2014. I don’t\nexpect we’ll be at maximum employment until 2016.\nThe second part of the Fed’s dual mandate is price stability. Earlier this year, the Fed’s\npolicymaking committee, the FOMC, stated that a 2 percent inflation rate was most consistent\nwith maximum employment and price stability, and we set that rate as our target. Over the past\nyear, prices rose 1.8 percent, according to the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. I expect\ninflation to come in below the 2 percent target both this year and in 2013. The main reason is a\nweak job market, which has kept labor compensation costs contained. We’ve also seen\nsubstantial declines in oil and other commodity prices recently as concerns about global\neconomic growth have intensified.\nIn sum, I see the Fed falling short on both our maximum employment and inflation\nmandates for some time. And the turmoil in Europe and government fiscal retrenchment in the\nUnited States raise the danger that the economy could perform worse than I expect. For these\nreasons, it’s crucial that we maintain our current highly stimulatory monetary policy stance. As\n6 See Daly et al. (2011) and Williams (2012b).\n9\n\npart of this, we’ve stated our intention to keep our benchmark short-term interest rate at\nexceptionally low levels at least through late 2014.\nWe must also stand ready to do even more if needed to best achieve our statutory goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. The April FOMC statement indicated that the\n“Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is\nprepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a\ncontext of price stability.”\nIf the outlook for growth worsens to the point that we no longer expect to make sustained\nprogress on bringing the unemployment rate down to levels consistent with our dual mandate, or\nif the medium-term outlook for inflation falls significantly below our 2 percent target, then\nadditional monetary accommodation would be warranted. In such circumstances, an effective\ntool would be further purchases of longer-maturity securities, potentially including agency\nmortgage-backed securities. Past purchases have succeeded in lowering borrowing costs and\nimproving financial conditions, thereby supporting economic recovery.\nAs I’ve tried to make clear, these are highly uncertain times, and our crystal balls are\nmuch cloudier than usual. At the Fed, we must be vigilant, and ready to adjust monetary policy\nas circumstances warrant. Thank you very much.\n10\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Jonathan Davis, and Luojia Hu. 2012. “Explaining the Decline in the U.S. Labor Force\nParticipation Rate.” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago Fed Letter 296 (March).\nhttp://chicagofed.org/digital assets/publications/chicago fed letter/2012/cflmarch2012 296.pdf\nDaly, Mary C., Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert Valletta. 2011. “A Rising Natural Rate of\nUnemployment: Transitory or Permanent?” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper\n2011-05. http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2011/wp11-05bk.pdf\nHale, Galina B., Elliot Marks, and Fernanda Nechio. 2012. “Are U.S. Corporate Bonds Exposed to\nEurope?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2012-17 (June 4).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-17.html\nWilliams, John C. 2012a. “The Federal Reserve and the Economic Recovery.” Presentation to The\nColumbian’s 2012 Economic Forecast Breakfast, Vancouver, WA, January 10.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/news/speeches/2012/john-williams-0110.html\nWilliams, John C. 2012b. “Update of ‘What Is the New Normal Unemployment Rate?’” May 8 update to\nFRBSF Economic Letter 2011-05. http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-\n05-update.pdf\n11",

    "text": "Presentation to the University of San Francisco\nCenter for the Pacific Rim\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 14, 2012\nThe Role of Monetary Policy in Bolstering Economic Growth1\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be at the University of San Francisco. It’s fitting that my\ntalk here is sponsored by the Center for the Pacific Rim. The San Francisco Federal Reserve\nBank is the westernmost of the 12 Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System. All five U.S.\nstates on the Pacific Ocean are in our District. And our Economic Research Department, through\nour Center for Pacific Basin Studies, takes a special interest in the economies and financial\nsystems of Asia. Every year, I travel to Asia as a representative of the Federal Reserve to meet\ngovernment officials and economic experts, and learn in depth about the economic and financial\nissues facing the countries of the region. Later this month, I’m going to India, which is an\nincreasingly important and absolutely fascinating player in the global economy.\nLet me start by briefly describing what the Federal Reserve is. We are the nation’s\ncentral bank, consisting of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., and 12 Reserve\nBanks around the country. I am the President and CEO of one of those 12 banks, the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco. Now, we are not the kind of bank where you can open a\nchecking account. Rather, we perform the specialized functions of a central bank, including\nregulating and supervising commercial banks and the financial system. One of our most\nimportant functions is setting monetary policy. That involves influencing interest rates and\n1 I want to thank John Fernald and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nbroader financial conditions. Our decisions about monetary policy influence how fast the\neconomy grows and the rate of price inflation.\nHence, the condition of and outlook for the economy is our constant concern. This\nevening, I will talk about the U.S. economy, noting some of the welcome improvements we’ve\nseen lately, as well as some threats to the recovery. In order to understand the economic\nlandscape, it’s essential to examine some specific issues. In that regard, I’ll have a few words to\nsay about global developments, including the ongoing European financial crisis and slowing\ngrowth in China. I’ll also talk briefly about budgetary challenges here at home. And I’ll present\nmy forecast for the economy.\nI’ll end my remarks by discussing the steps the Federal Reserve has taken to bolster\neconomic growth and move our economy towards our congressionally mandated goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. In particular, I want to explain the moves our policy\ncommittee made in September to step up our purchases of longer-term securities and extend the\ntime frame for low short-term interest rates. I hope to make it clear that, even as we focus on\nsolidifying the economic recovery, our commitment to keeping inflation low hasn’t wavered. I\nshould emphasize that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nWe are now in the fourth year of the economic recovery. That in itself is a significant\naccomplishment, given how close our financial system came to collapsing in late 2008. The\nrecession then already under way worsened, turning into the longest and deepest downturn since\nthe Great Depression. The economy shrank more than 4½ percent and the unemployment rate\neventually peaked at 10 percent.\n2\n\nThanks in part to emergency first aid by the Fed, financial conditions stabilized and\nbegan to improve. By mid-2009, the economy was growing again. However, progress overall\nhas been stubbornly slow. Production of goods and services didn’t return to its pre-recession\npeak until a year ago. Private-sector payrolls have risen for over 2½ years now, adding nearly 5\nmillion jobs.2 But, despite these gains, the unemployment rate remains a very high 7.9 percent.\nPerhaps the most encouraging signs of a turnaround have been the improvements in two\nkey sectors of the economy: autos and housing. Car sales have bounced back almost 60 percent\nfrom their recession lows, thanks to pent-up demand and fabulous rates on auto loans. And\nhousing has finally started to come back. Fewer homes are going into foreclosure. Credit is still\ntight for many potential homebuyers, but the market has firmed and home sales are off their\nlows. With a limited stock of homes to choose from, house prices are rising in many parts of the\ncountry. This is setting the stage for more homebuilding. Housing starts are up sharply from\nwhere they were a year ago.\nAs welcome as this progress is, the recovery has lacked the spark of past rebounds.\nThat’s not surprising when you consider what we went through in 2007 and 2008. Families are\nburied in debt accumulated during the housing boom, and many now find their homes are worth\nless than what they paid for them. Millions of homeowners are behind on their mortgages or\nhave already lost their homes. And lenders, burned from their past mistakes, are tightfisted with\ncredit. All these factors help explain the gradual pace of economic recovery.\n2 These reported employment gains since the recession are likely to be revised up, according to a preliminary\nannouncement by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, the BLS estimates that their upcoming benchmark\nrevisions will add 453,000 private-sector jobs as of March 2012. The revisions will be implemented with the release\nof the January 2013 employment report. See BLS (2012).\n3\n\nWhen I look at the economic landscape ahead, I see several additional factors continuing\nto hold us back: a global economic slowdown stemming in large part from the European\nfinancial crisis, budget challenges here at home, and widespread uncertainty about where the\neconomy is going. These factors are legacies of the financial crisis and recession of a few years\nback, which devastated public-sector budgets at home and abroad, and fueled economic anxiety.\nLet’s consider the international situation first, starting with Europe. The global financial\ncrisis exposed weaknesses in the housing markets, financial systems, and public-sector finances\nof several countries that use the euro as their currency. By 2010, private investors were fleeing\nthe riskier countries, such as Greece, driving government borrowing costs through the roof. The\nsituation has snowballed into a much broader financial and debt crisis, and a persistent European\nrecession. And that hurts countries around the world, including the United States. U.S. exports\nto Europe have begun to tail off after a period when manufacturing in our country was making\nreal forward strides.\nAnother place where Europe’s woes are being felt is China. Keep in mind that China\ncame through the global recession of 2008–09 with flying colors. When that downturn hit,\nChinese exports to the developed world fell. To offset that, Chinese authorities made credit\neasier to get and ramped up spending on projects such as roads, airports, and power facilities.\nThe result was that China’s economy continued to grow strongly through the global recession.\nFrom 2007 through 2011, China’s economy expanded at a remarkable pace of more than 9\npercent, driven by a surge in domestic investment. Here in the United States, China’s growth\nwas a real boon at a time when we desperately needed it. U.S. exports to China rose by about 90\n4\n\npercent from the end of 2008 to the end of 2011, and were a factor in the revival of\nmanufacturing here.\nThis time though China has not been able to entirely dodge Europe’s problems. Europe is\na critical market for Chinese products, and exports to Europe have been sinking this year. That’s\na reason why the International Monetary Fund forecasts that China’s growth will fall to 7.8\npercent in 2012 and 8.2 percent in 2013. And slowing growth in China has meant weaker growth\nin U.S. exports to that country this year.\nA second factor weighing on the economy is the budget picture here in the United States.\nIn 2009, in the depths of the recession, fiscal stimulus in the form of federal tax cuts and\nspending programs was enacted to offset, at least in part, the collapse of private-sector demand.\nAll this federal fiscal expansion cushioned the blow of the downturn.\nBut the stimulus measures put in place a few years ago have been rolling off. Now we’re\nshifting to austerity in fiscal policy. And the economic drag from the public sector will get even\nworse at the beginning of 2013. Under current legislation, we face what’s come to be called the\n“fiscal cliff.” That refers to the huge federal tax hikes and spending cuts that under current law\nwill take place automatically at the beginning of next year. I expect that Congress and the White\nHouse may come to terms on extending some tax reductions and deferring some spending\ncutbacks. All the same, at least some reductions in federal spending and increases in taxes are\nlikely to go through, deepening the drag on the economy.\nThis brings me to a third factor holding back the recovery—uncertainty. We don’t know\nwhat’s going to happen in Europe and Asia. And we don’t know what’s going to happen with the\nfederal budget. These are not trivial matters. They’ll have a tremendous effect on the economic\n5\n\nand business climate in the months and years ahead. That makes it hard for businesses and\nhouseholds to plan for the future. Add to that the general sense of unease that stems from the\nrocky course of the economy over the past five years. It’s no wonder people are skittish. Just\nabout every businessperson I meet tells me that economic uncertainty and fears about the future\nmake them hesitant to break ground on new projects or boost their payrolls.\nSo what are we at the Fed doing in these circumstances? Let’s start by considering the\ngoals Congress has assigned us: maximum employment and price stability. What exactly do\nthese concepts mean? Let’s start with maximum employment. Now, maximum employment\ndoes not mean a situation in which everybody is working. Instead, economists think of it as the\nlevel of employment that the economy can sustain over time without inflation rising too high.\nEconomists fiercely debate what the unemployment rate would be under maximum employment.\nTypical estimates are between 5 and 6 percent. Thus, by almost any credible measure, the\ncurrent 7.9 percent rate is much higher than we would get at maximum employment.3\nWhat about price stability then? Fed policymakers have specified that a 2 percent\ninflation rate is most consistent with healthy economic growth and our mandate from Congress.4\nSo where are we? Inflation has averaged only 1.7 percent over the past year, below this 2\npercent target.\nThis means we’re falling short of both of our goals, especially the maximum employment\nmandate. What’s more, the recovery faces serious threats. Some of these come from abroad.\nThe European crisis could flare up, deepening the recession there and increasing strains in the\n3 See Daly et al. (2012), Lazear and Spletzer (2012), and Williams (2012b).\n4 For more information, see the statement of longer-term goals and policy strategy released by the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) in January (Board of Governors 2012a).\n6\n\nglobal financial system. In addition, China’s slowdown could worsen. If that were to happen,\nU.S. exports to China would fall even further.\nThen, of course, there is the fiscal cliff. I said earlier that I expect some agreement to be\nreached that will keep us from falling off the cliff in its entirety. But there is a danger that\nWashington will not take action. In that case, the cliff’s austerity measures will hit with full\nforce, which could take us perilously close to recession.\nAs it stands then, unemployment is well above our mandate, inflation is below our target,\nand the recovery faces serious menaces. In this situation, the Fed must take action to keep our\neconomy on track towards maximum employment and price stability. So let’s look at our\noptions. Our usual method of stimulating the economy is to reduce short-term interest rates. But\nwe pushed those rates down close to zero almost four years ago. That route simply isn’t\navailable to us.\nInstead, we have had to find other ways to stimulate the economy. One form of monetary\nstimulus we’ve turned to is known as large-scale asset purchases. In late 2008 and 2009, the Fed\npurchased over $1.7 trillion of longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, a\nprogram often referred to as QE1, for quantitative easing. Then, in November 2010, our policy\ncommittee, the Federal Open Market Committee, announced an additional $600 billion in longer-\nterm Treasury securities purchases—QE2. A little over a year ago, we launched a third asset\npurchase program, sometimes called Operation Twist. In Operation Twist, which is scheduled to\nend in December, we haven’t increased the overall size of our securities holdings as we did with\nQE1 and 2. Rather, we’ve changed the composition of our securities holdings by selling $45\n7\n\nbillion in short-term Treasury securities each month and buying an equal amount of longer-term\nTreasury securities.\nThese asset purchase programs work by raising demand for longer-term Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities. As demand goes up, the prices of those securities rise and yields\ncome down. The effects extend to other longer-term securities, pushing down longer-term\ninterest rates across the board.5 Of course, lower interest rates make it easier for consumers to\nbuy things like homes and cars, and for businesses to finance new projects, all of which spurs\neconomic activity.\nA second form of monetary stimulus we’ve used has been to issue public statements\nabout the likely future path of the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the short-term\nbenchmark interest rate we lowered close to zero in 2008. In central banking language, such\npublic statements are known as forward guidance. Starting in August of last year, we have\nindicated in our monetary policy statements that we expect to hold the federal funds rate at very\nlow levels at least through a specified date. This guidance regarding future policy actions lets the\npublic know that short-term rates are likely to stay low for years to come. That puts downward\npressure on longer-term interest rates. The evidence suggests that forward guidance has\neffectively influenced financial conditions this way.6\nAt our meeting in September, the FOMC took two new actions aimed at strengthening the\nrecovery.7 First, we announced a new large-scale asset purchase program to buy $40 billion in\nmortgage-backed securities each month. This purchase program is intended to be flexible and\n5 See Williams (2011, 2012a).\n6 See Swanson and Williams (2012).\n7 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n8\n\nadjust to changing circumstances. Unlike our past asset purchase programs, this one doesn’t\nhave a preset expiration date. Instead, its duration and the total amount that we purchase will\ndepend on what happens with the economy. Specifically, we said we’ll continue buying\nmortgage-backed securities until the job market shows substantial improvement. But, if we find\nthat our policies aren’t doing what they’re supposed to do or are causing significant economic\nproblems, we’ll adjust or end them.\nThe second step we took was to announce that we expect to keep the federal funds rate\nexceptionally low at least through mid-2015. That announcement extended out in time the\nforward guidance we had previously given on how long we expected to keep our benchmark\nexceptionally low. We also said we’d maintain low rates “for a considerable time after the\neconomic recovery strengthens.” In other words, we intend to keep short-term rates low even as\nthe economy improves to make sure this recovery takes hold.\nOur policy measures are having the desired effects. Take mortgage interest rates. Our\npurchases of mortgage-backed and Treasury securities have helped push conventional 30-year\nmortgage rates to historically low levels under 3½ percent.8 And low mortgage rates are a great\nway to pep up the economy. They make owning a home more affordable, which increases\ndemand for housing. Higher demand puts upward pressure on house prices, making it easier for\nexisting homeowners to refinance or sell their homes. The happy result is a virtuous circle of\ngrowing confidence and improving fundamentals in the housing market. And, over the next few\nyears, a homebuilding rebound should be a key driver of economic growth, creating more jobs\nfor construction workers, furniture salespeople, real estate agents, and the like.\n8 Hancock and Passmore (2011) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) find significant effects of\nmortgage-backed securities purchases on mortgage rates. See Stroebel and Taylor (2012) for a contrary view.\n9\n\nThanks in part to the policy actions I’ve described, I anticipate the economy will gain\nmomentum over the next few years. I expect real gross domestic product, that is, the nation’s\ntotal output of goods and services, to expand at a modest pace of about 2 percent this year, but\nimprove to about 2½ percent next year and about 3½ percent in 2014. I see the unemployment\nrate remaining above 7 percent through at least the end of 2014. I expect inflation to remain\nslightly below 2 percent for the next few years as labor costs and import prices remain subdued.\nAs you can see from this outlook, I expect it will be some time until the job market\nmakes substantial progress towards our congressionally mandated maximum employment goal.\nTherefore, I anticipate that we will need to continue our purchases of mortgage-backed securities\nand longer-term Treasury securities past the end of this year and likely well into the second half\nof next year in order to best achieve our mandated goals. As I noted, the ending date for these\nprograms will hinge on the performance of the economy.\nOf course, with our latest policy measures, we find ourselves in waters that haven’t been\nextensively charted. That raises questions about unintended consequences. The concern I hear\nmost often is that our securities purchases might ignite a bout of inflation. In my view, that\nworry isn’t warranted. The fact is, the economy isn’t operating at full speed. We have lots of\nspare economic capacity and an abnormally high number of workers who can’t find jobs. That\nkeeps inflation in check by making it hard for businesses to raise prices or for workers to press\nfor higher pay. Inflation has been tame, averaging 1¾ percent since the recession started in late\n2007. That’s happened despite the fact that our holdings of mortgage-backed and Treasury\nsecurities have climbed by over 200 percent, to about $2½ trillion. In short, we have substantial\n10\n\nscope to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy without creating too much upward\npressure on prices.\nI want to emphasize that we certainly don’t take this view on inflation for granted. We\nwatch how prices are behaving with the utmost attention. In addition, we always keep an eye on\nthe public’s expectations of inflation in the future. Specifically, we closely follow inflation\nexpectations measured in surveys of households and professional forecasters. We also monitor\nfinancial market indicators of inflation expectations. I’ve been reassured to see that our stimulus\nmeasures have not caused an undesirable increase in longer-term inflation expectations.\nIn closing, I’d like to make a point about the Fed’s dual mandate. We are unusual among\ncentral banks in that, since the 1970s, we’ve been charged with both employment and inflation\ngoals. Both aspects of the mandate are important. But which is the most pressing concern has\nchanged over time. From the late 1960s through the early 1990s, inflation was consistently\nrunning well above 2 percent. Naturally, during that period, much of the discussion about\nmonetary policy centered on inflation and how to bring it down.\nToday the situation is very different. Since the early 1990s, inflation has been\nconsistently low, averaging right around 2 percent, and, most recently, even less than that. At the\nsame time, the unemployment rate has remained far above the maximum employment level for\nover four years straight. Thus, unemployment is—and should be—a central focus of monetary\npolicy right now. This concentration on getting unemployment down in no way represents a\nlessening of the importance of price stability. Quite the opposite. Consider that, if the recovery\nloses steam, inflation could fall too low—further below our 2 percent goal.\n11\n\nThe steps the Fed has taken to boost the economy won’t quickly return our economy to\nfull strength. I know that. But they can help speed the recovery and make it more secure. I’m\nconvinced they represent the best course to move us toward maximum employment and price\nstability. Thank you very much.\n12\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012a. “Press Release.” January 25. http://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012b. “Press Release.” September 13. http://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\nBureau of Labor Statistics. 2012. “Current Employment Statistics: CES Preliminary Benchmark\nAnnouncement.” September 27. http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesprelbmk.htm\nDaly, Mary C., Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert Valletta. 2012. “A Search and Matching Approach\nto Labor Markets: Did the Natural Rate of Unemployment Rise?” Journal of Economic\nPerspectives 26(3, Summer), pp. 3–26. http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.26.3.3\nHancock, Diana, and Wayne Passmore. 2011. “Did the Federal Reserve’s MBS Purchase Program Lower\nMortgage Rates?” Journal of Monetary Economics 58(5, July), pp. 498–514.\nKrishnamurthy, Arvind, and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen. 2011. “The Effects of Quantitative Easing on\nInterest Rates: Channels and Implications for Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity\n43(2, Fall), pp. 215–287. http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/Programs/ES/BPEA/\n2011_fall_bpea_papers/2011_fall_bpea_conference_krishnamurthy.pdf\nLazear, Edward P., and James R.

    "text": "Interest Rates and the “New Normal”\nJohn C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOctober 5, 2017\nIntroduction\nGood morning everyone. Today I’m going to talk about interest rates… in a lot of\ndetail… so I hope you all got yourselves an extra large cup of coffee before you\nfound your seats this morning.\nWhy am I talking about interest rates? First, as President of the San Francisco Fed\nit’s a favorite subject of mine! Second, there are a lot of misperceptions out there\nabout what’s going to happen to interest rates, when they’ll rise and by how\nmuch. As bankers, interest rates play a pivotal role in your lives, so I thought that\nyou might appreciate a deeper dive into the current thinking.\nI frequently hear people say, “as things return to normal, and rates rise, we’ll be\nable to do A, B, or C.” It’s true that, post-financial crisis, things are returning to\nPage 1 of 14\n\nnormal. But normal may look and feel quite a bit different from what\nyou’re used to, so I want to talk about this “new normal”.\nSince it’s clear I’m going to be talking about interest rates, now is the perfect time\nto insert the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nFirst, the good news: The economy is growing at a moderate pace. In fact, we’re\nnow in the ninth year of the expansion. As a result of the progress we’ve made\ngetting our economy back on track, we’re in the process of slowly moving interest\nrates back up to more normal levels. But what does “normal” mean?\nI know that for many in finance the word normal conjures memories of the ’90s,\nwhen interest rates were often above 4 percent. But like the pager, the Walkman,\nand the Macarena, we’re unlikely to see such rates return. Bottom line: In the\nnew world of moderate economic growth, banks need to plan for lower rates.\nWhy is this? To explain why, I’m going to talk a bit about something called r-star,\nwhich is shorthand for normal interest rates. Then I’m going to talk a bit about\ngrowth, a bit about inflation, and discuss some interesting factors behind why\nPage 2 of 14\n\ninflation’s remained stubbornly low (despite strong employment).\nFinally, I’m going to switch tacks and talk about the Fed balance sheet and what it\nmeans for longer-term rates.\nPlease pay attention, because I’m looking forward to a lively discussion\nafterwards about the new normal and what that means for community banking.\nR-star\nWith that road map in mind, let’s dive into r-star. R-star is what economists call\nthe natural rate of interest; it’s the rate expected to prevail when the economy is\nat full strength, and it’s a helpful way to understand the new normal both in the\nshort and longer term. While a central bank like the Fed sets short-term interest\nrates, r-star is a result of structural economic factors beyond the influence of\ncentral banks and monetary policy.\nMy own view is that r-star today is around 0.5 percent. Assuming inflation is\nrunning at our goal of 2 percent in the future, the typical, or normal short-term\ninterest rate would be 2.5 percent. That’s a full 2 percentage points below what a\nPage 3 of 14\n\nnormal interest rate looked like 20 years ago.1 We’ve seen this trend\nacross other major economies: Average r-star across Canada, the euro area,\nJapan, and the United Kingdom is a bit below 0.5 percent.2\nA variety of factors have pushed r-star to this low level, and they appear poised to\nstay that way.3 The major one is that the sustainable growth rate of the economy\nhas slowed dramatically from prior decades.4 I put that growth rate at 1.5 percent\nfor inflation-adjusted GDP, the slowest pace we’ve seen in our lifetimes. This\nslowdown reflects a one-two punch of a sharp decline in labor force growth and\nslower productivity growth.5\nWhat’s caused the decline in labor force growth? Two main things: First, the baby\nboomers are retiring in droves. Second, the fertility rate in the United States has\nbeen declining and recently reached an unusually low level.6 Monetary policy can\nonly go so far, and it’s beyond my job description to encourage people to have\nmore babies!\n1 For comparison, the median longer-run value of the federal funds rate in the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC) most recent economic projections is 2.75 percent (Board of Governors 2017b).\n2 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Fujiwara et al. (2016).\n3 Williams (2017).\n4 Population aging and longer lifespans also have contributed; see Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017).\n5 Fernald (2016).\n6 Hamilton et al. (2017).\nPage 4 of 14\n\nThe same thing is true about productivity growth, which has also\nslowed in contrast with earlier decades. In the 1990s and early 2000s, annual\nproductivity gains averaged 2 to 3 percent. Productivity gains since the recession\nhave generally hovered below 1 percent.\nProductivity growth is influenced by technological innovation, investments in\neducation, research and development. I know that productivity in San Francisco\nwould rise by leaps and bounds if there were fewer hipster coffee shops. But this,\nlike policy decisions on education, are beyond the scope of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThis very low r-star rate has two implications: For bankers, a new normal of\nmoderate growth and lower interest rates will have a significant bearing on\nlending growth and profitability.\nStepping back, the broader implication is that conventional monetary policy has\nless room to stimulate the economy during an economic downturn. Looking\nthrough this lens, we will need to lean more heavily on unconventional tools, like\nPage 5 of 14\n\ncentral bank balance sheets, keeping interest rates very low for a\nlong time, and potentially even negative policy rates.7\nThank you for indulging my foray into r-star and what it means for rates. Of\ncourse, I can’t talk about interest rates without discussing its bedfellows: growth,\ninflation, and employment.\nGrowth, inflation, and employment\nDespite the terrible human tragedy caused by recent hurricanes, the economic\nexpansion appears to remain on track. I see the economy over the next few years\ncontinuing on the same moderate path.\nThat may seem disappointing, but as I’ve already said, changes in demographics\nand slow gains in productivity mean the economy’s growth potential is moderate\ntoo. Given the current conditions, if growth were to increase too much, it could\nlead to an asset price bubble or other problems like high inflation. This is exactly\nwhat we want to avoid in order to keep the economy on an even footing and\nreduce the likelihood of another deep recession.\n7 Reifschneider (2016).\nPage 6 of 14\n\nTurning to inflation, I feel the agony of Sisyphus, as core inflation\nrolled back down the hill after being so near to our 2 percent goal earlier in the\nyear. This low inflation, against a background of steady growth and strong\nemployment, has been attracting a lot of attention from Fed commentators in\nrecent months.\nFor context, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation has been running a little\nunder 1.5 percent, below our longer-term goal of 2 percent. In July, the Financial\nTimes described the Fed as being “baffled” by low inflation numbers.8\nI assure you that Fed economists are rarely baffled, but when they do see\nsomething that doesn’t make sense, they work hard to find out why it’s\nhappening.\nMy own staff at the San Francisco Fed recently took a closer look at what’s been\nholding inflation down. They distinguished between prices of goods and services\nthat tend to move up and down with the overall economy and those that mostly\nmove in response to factors unique to their industry or sector.\n8 Martin (2017).\nPage 7 of 14\n\nThey found that inflation rates for prices that tend to be sensitive to\nthe state of the economy have moved back up to around pre-recession levels as\nthe economy has recovered. So, no mystery there.\nBut, they also found that inflation rates for other categories that tend to be less\nsensitive to the economy had fallen a lot and have remained very low. Some of\nthis is the result of outsize drops in prices for pharmaceuticals, airline tickets,\ncellular phone services, and education. In the past, such sharp price movements\nin these industries have proven to have a temporary effect on inflation, and I\ndon’t expect them to last this time either.\nAn even bigger contribution to low inflation has been coming from the health-\ncare sector. Mandated cuts to Medicare payment growth, which also tend to be\nincorporated into payments for nongovernment health services, have kept\ninflation in overall health-care services unusually low for several years.9 These\nlegislated changes have been a key factor holding inflation below the Fed’s 2\npercent target, despite a strengthening economy.\n9 Clemens, Gottlieb, and Shapiro (2016).\nPage 8 of 14\n\nAs these effects wane and the strong economy pushes inflation\nhigher for prices that tend to be sensitive to the economy, I am optimistic that\ninflation will move up to our 2 percent goal over the next couple of years. As\ninflation rises and the economic expansion continues, we will be able to move\ninterest rates up to their new normal level.\nWhich brings me to employment – Congress has given the Federal Reserve two\nkey monetary policy goals: maximum employment and price stability. When it\ncomes to our employment goal, I think of this in terms of the unemployment rate\nrelative to the natural or “normal” rate of unemployment – you might be shocked\nto hear that this is what economists call u-star, but I’ll save that topic for another\nday. We can’t know precisely what the normal rate of unemployment is, but I put\nit at about 4¾ percent.10\nThe unemployment rate is 4.4 percent – meaning that we’ve not only reached the\nfull employment mark, we’ve exceeded it. Given the strong job growth we’ve\nbeen seeing in the United States, I expect the unemployment rate to decline over\nthe next year, ultimately falling a bit below 4 percent. We’ve only experienced\n10 For comparison, the Congressional Budget Office (2017) puts the natural rate at 4.7 percent, the median value\nfrom the Survey of Professional Forecasters (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 2017) is 4.5 percent, and the\nmedian projection from the FOMC (Board of Governors 2017b) is 4.6 percent.\nPage 9 of 14\n\nsuch a low unemployment rate a few times during my lifetime, at the\nend of the 1960s and the end of the 1990s.\nThese favorable employment numbers, combined with the findings on inflation\nand the steady pace of growth, are all behind my confidence that rates will need\nto rise to their new normal levels.\nLong-term interest rates and the Fed balance sheet\nWe’ve discussed the new normal of short-term rates, so as promised I’m now\ngoing to turn to longer-term rates and the Fed balance sheet.\nIn response to the recession and slow recovery, the Fed purchased trillions of\ndollars of long-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. The goal was to\nlower long-term interest rates and give the economy an extra boost. In the\npursuit of getting interest rates back to new normal levels, we’re now starting the\nprocess of gradually reducing these holdings.11 This will tend to push long-term\nrates back up gradually over the next few years.\n11 Board of Governors (2017a)\nPage 10 of 14\n\nWith short-term interest rates likely to average around 2.5 percent in\nthe future, what does all this mean for long-term rates? Historically, the yield on\nthe benchmark 10-year Treasury note averaged about 1.5 percentage points\nabove the federal funds rate.\nThis spread between long-term and short-term yields is an important source of\nbanks’ profitability, and it narrowed during the period of very low interest rates.\nThe question is whether it will return to the old normal level or if there is a new\nnormal spread as well.\nTo answer that question, you need to take account of two major factors that\naffect the spread between short and long-term rates. The first is the Fed’s\nexpanded balance sheet. One estimate is that the Fed’s holdings are currently\npushing down long-term rates by a little less than 1 percentage point.12 As the Fed\nunwinds its balance sheet, this should put increasing upward pressure on longer-\nterm yields.\nSecond, there are reasons to believe that the spread between short and long-\nterm rates will not return to levels we saw in the past. For one, these large\n12 Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei (2017).\nPage 11 of 14\n\nspreads occurred during an extended period when interest rates\nwere falling. This downward trend may have artificially widened spreads.\nI don’t claim to have a crystal ball, but a reasonable educated guess for the future\nnormal spread between a 10-year Treasury note and the federal funds rate is\nsomewhere close to 1 percentage point. In fact, this is the figure implied by the\nlong-run Blue Chip forecast.\nConclusion\nLadies and gentlemen, the Fed is moving towards more normal monetary policy,\nand that means rising interest rates. But r-star, a slower sustainable pace of\ngrowth, and inflation all point to a new normal where interest rates are lower\nthan the heady days of the 1990s and early 2000s. For those of you still listening\nto a Walkman, it may be time to get a smartphone.

    "text": "Expecting the Expected: Staying\nCalm when the Data Meet the\nForecasts\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo the\nFinancial Women of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 2, 2018\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nIntroduction\nThank you for the kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here in such beautiful\nsurroundings. When I speak to an audience that spends their professional lives\nPage 1 of 9\n\nthinking about finance, business, and the economy, I always look forward to the\nquestions, so I’ll keep my prepared remarks relatively brief.\nThis is one of my first public speaking engagements of 2018, and I’m very happy to\nbe able to kick off with positive news about the economy. The expansion is now in its\nninth year, the stock market is at record levels, and all the key economic indicators are\nheaded in the right direction.\nSan Francisco is a leading example of the growth we’re seeing across the country.\nMany of the things that drive us crazy about this city—bad traffic, sky-high rents, and\nsidewalks blocked by construction—are signs of a strong economy. Of course, I\nblame the gridlock on 101 on all the techies flooding the Bay Area. But it’s not just\ntech that’s powering the American economy—far from it.\nThe really good news about this expansion is that it’s taking place nationwide and\nacross the full range of sectors. Consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and\nconstruction are all showing strong numbers. And it’s part of a global trend of\nstronger-than-expected growth. Both Europe and Japan have seen a significant\nacceleration in GDP growth. The International Monetary Fund expects global growth\nin 2017 will register an impressive 3.7 percent when the final numbers are in.1\nWith so much momentum, you’d think people would be happy. But no, instead I’m\ncoming across a lot of anxiety about how the Fed’s going to respond to such\nbuoyancy. There’s a concern that we’re either behind the curve or going to have a\nknee-jerk reaction to all this positivity when it comes to monetary policy.\n1 International Monetary Fund (2018).\nPage 2 of 9\n\nI was amused to see that, in a Bloomberg article titled “5 Things to Fear in a Strong\nGlobal Economy,” the most terrifying thing was the possibility of a Fed overreaction!2\nSo today I’m going to look at the key economic indicators: growth, employment, and\nthe enigma that is low inflation. I’m going to discuss the evidence, show what’s\ndriving the numbers, and assess whether the economy really has shifted into a higher\ngear. Finally, I’m going to talk about my own view on appropriate monetary policy.\nI think now is the perfect time to give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I\nexpress are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nGrowth\nI’ve already talked a bit about growth, but there are two questions I want to address\nnow: First, with all the positivity, is the economy taking off far more than expected?\nAnd second, given that we’re in the third-longest (soon to be the second-longest)\nexpansion in history, are we at risk of recession? Will the expansion die of old age?\nThe answers to both these questions lie in the data. Growth in 2017 came in at 2.5\npercent. This is a solid performance. Indeed, it’s above the trend growth rate, which I\npeg at about 1¾ percent. The trend growth rate is the rate of growth that can be\nsustained over the long term, and it’s determined by economic fundamentals like\ndemographics and productivity growth.\n2 Moss (2018).\nPage 3 of 9\n\nI expect the same this year, with growth again coming in at 2.5 percent. Strong\nfinancial conditions, better-than-expected global growth, and the tax cuts have all\ncreated tailwinds that can account for the healthy pace of growth. Because of these\ntailwinds I have boosted my growth forecasts for this year, but I don’t see an\neconomy that’s fundamentally shifted gear.\nTurning to the second question: Will the expansion die of old age? The short answer\nis no. Recessions don’t happen because a timer goes off.3 Recessions generally happen\nbecause of unanticipated shocks: The global financial crisis of 2008 was caused by the\nsubprime mortgage crisis, the recession of the early 2000s was caused by the dot-com\nbubble, and the recession of the early 1990s was triggered by the sharp rise in oil\nprices.\nThese kinds of shocks are notoriously hard to predict, but they happen for a reason,\nnot because the business cycle has a time limit on it. Given that the pace of growth is\nsomewhat above trend, my view is that we need to continue on the path of raising\ninterest rates. This will keep the economy on an even footing and reduce the risk of us\ngetting to a point where things could overheat.\nObviously, growth figures are the ones the media are most focused on. But as\nPresident of the San Francisco Fed and a voting member on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), I’m judged on what happens to employment and inflation. The\nFederal Reserve has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, so\nmy day job is about understanding what’s going on with those figures and then\nmaking appropriate monetary policy recommendations.\n3 Rudebusch (2016).\nPage 4 of 9\n\nEmployment\nWhen it comes to the Federal Reserve’s report card on employment, I think it’s more\nthan fair that we give ourselves an A grade. We added over two million jobs in 2017,\nabout twice the number needed to keep pace with normal labor force growth.4 During\nthe final three months of 2017, unemployment was an unusually low 4.1 percent.5 The\nlast time we saw unemployment this low was in the year 2000. These low\nunemployment numbers have many people asking why we’re not seeing greater wage\ngrowth, but that number actually has been slowly ratcheting up.\nThis is consistent with the reports I’ve been hearing from business leaders for a while.\nAs talent becomes increasingly scarce, they’re offering higher wages in a bid to\ncompete for employees. I expect this to intensify as the labor market heats up further.\nInflation\nSuch economic optimism, coupled with low unemployment, normally would be\nassociated with rising inflation. But I’m afraid our report card here is not so glowing.\nThe Fed has set itself a goal of 2 percent inflation, a target we have missed more often\nthan not. I spent much of 2017 talking about the enigma of low inflation, why it’s\noccurred, and my expectations for the future. Of course most normal people are very\npleased with a strong economy, plentiful jobs, and stable prices. But economists are\nnot so easily satisfied!\n4 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016).\n5 The text of this speech was finalized before the February 2 release of updated unemployment and employment\nnumbers.\nPage 5 of 9\n\nOne of the fundamentals of economics is the Phillips curve, which describes the\nrelationship between unemployment and inflation. If the Phillips curve is right, when\nunemployment falls, inflation should rise. Because when unemployment falls, wages\ngo up, which pushes up business costs and should increase consumer demand and, in\nturn, raise prices. Last year’s paltry inflation figures have led many economic\ncommentators to pose the question: Is the Phillips curve dead?\nBased on the research of my colleagues at the Fed, the Phillips curve still holds true.6\nI have two main reasons for my confidence. First, last year we saw a number of\ntransitory factors holding down inflation. These included price drops for\npharmaceuticals, airline tickets, and cell phone services. An even bigger contribution\nto low inflation came from the health-care sector, where mandated cuts to Medicare\npayment growth muted price rises for health-care services. These factors are slowly\ndisappearing from the data. Second, it always takes a while for the effects of low\nunemployment and a strong economy to translate into higher inflation, with a\ncommon delay of about 12 months.\nThe recent price data have been encouraging in this regard, and I expect that we’ll\ncontinue to see inflation pick up this year and the next. Fear not, the Phillips curve is\nalive and will soon be kicking!\n6 See, for example, Mahedy and Shapiro (2017) and Cúrdia (2018).\nPage 6 of 9\n\nMonetary policy\nI began by describing a very positive economic outlook of strong growth, low\nunemployment, and inflation that looks like it’s finally headed in the direction Fed\neconomists have been hoping for. But despite all this optimism, there’s anxiety about\nhow the Federal Reserve is going to react. Will we raise rates too rapidly? Or will we\nraise rates too slowly because we fail to spot a financial bubble? Both scenarios could\nknock the expansion off track, and that’s the last thing I want to see happen.\nI am optimistic about the economy, but I expect continued moderate growth, with no\nHerculean leap forward. So given that the economy’s performing almost exactly as\nexpected, you can expect policymakers to do the same.\nAnd how should you know what to expect? In the aftermath of the financial crisis the\nFOMC started issuing clearer guidance about future policy, indicating how\npolicymakers plan to manage interest rates based on the latest data and projections.\nLast year the Committee signaled the likelihood of further gradual rate increases in\n2018, and, as I said earlier, my own view is we should stick to that plan.7 It will keep\nthe expansion on track, prevent the economy from exceeding its potential by too\nmuch, and get interest rates back up closer to more normal levels.\nPolicymaking is, by its very nature, a long game. The full effects of a change the\nFOMC makes today are unlikely to be felt for two years: A knee-jerk reaction would\nhave far-reaching consequences, and my FOMC colleagues and I are well aware of\nthat. My approach is to always follow the data very carefully and then adjust my\nrecommendations accordingly.\n7 Board of Governors (2017a, b).\nPage 7 of 9\n\nAnd of course, this is where I give a caveat for everything I’ve said so far by\nunderlining my focus on the data. If actual growth is paltry, or if there are signs of an\neconomy that’s growing at an unsustainable rate, or if inflationary pressures are\nbuilding too fast, then I’ll reevaluate my position and advocate for adjusting the path\nof rates accordingly. But at the moment, while I’m buoyed by the optimism, I don’t\nsee an economy at risk of shifting into overdrive.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the outlook is positive: The expansion is proceeding at a good pace,\nunemployment is low, and inflation is finally headed in the right direction again. Even\nif most people don’t want higher prices, it’s a great relief to me that the Phillips curve\nisn’t broken.\nBut while the outlook is positive, it’s not so strong that it’s driving a sea change in my\nposition. For the moment, I don’t see signs of an economy going into overdrive or a\nbubble about to burst, so I have not adjusted my views of appropriate monetary\npolicy. So my message to those concerned about a knee-jerk reaction from the Fed is\nthat, as always, we’ll keep our focus on the dual mandate and let the data guide our\ndecisions.\nThank you for listening. I’m looking forward to your questions.\nPage 8 of 9\n\nReferences\nBidder, Rhys, Tim Mahedy, and Rob Valletta. 2016. “Trend Job Growth: Where’s\nNormal?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2016-32 (October 24).\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2016/october/trend-job-growth-where-is-normal/\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017a. “FOMC Projections\nmaterials, accessible version.” September 20.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20170920.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017b. “FOMC Projections\nmaterials, accessible version.” December 13.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20171213.htm\nCúrdia, Vasco. 2018. “FedViews.” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, January 11.\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/fedviews/2018/january/january-11-2018/\nInternational Monetary Fund. 2018. “World Economic Outlook Update: Brighter\nProspects, Optimistic Markets, Challenges Ahead.” January.\nhttp://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2018/01/11/world-\neconomic-outlook-update-january-2018\nMahedy, Tim, and Adam Shapiro. 2017. “What’s Down with Inflation?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2017-35 (November 27). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/economic-letter/2017/november/contribution-to-low-pce-\ninflation-from-healthcare/\nMoss, Daniel. 2018. “5 Things to Fear in a Strong Global Economy.” Bloomberg View,\nJanuary 2. https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-02/5-things-to-\nfear-in-a-strong-global-economy\nRudebusch, Glenn D. 2016. “Will the Economic Recovery Die of Old Age?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2016-03 (February 4). https://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/economic-letter/2016/february/will-economic-recovery-\ndie-of-old-age/\nPage 9 of 9",

    "text": "Presentation to the LendIt USA 2016 conference, San Francisco, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 12, 2016\nFintech: The Power of the Possible and Potential Pitfalls\nGood afternoon, it’s a pleasure to be here. This is an exciting time for all things fintech,\nand as you’re aware, it’s getting increasing attention from regulatory agencies like the Federal\nReserve, the OCC, state regulators, and others.1 It’s critically important to have an open and\nactive dialogue among everyone involved, in order to better understand one another’s goals and\nconcerns. In an attempt to do just that, I’ll keep my remarks brief and leave plenty of time for\nQ&A.\nMy talk today perfectly encompasses the sometimes dueling aspects of my profession.\nOn the one hand, I’m president of the Fed District that is not just home to the technological hub\nof the United States, but is arguably the center of the tech universe. On the other hand, they don’t\ncall economics “the dismal science” for nothing, and I’m compelled to consider what potholes\nmay be dotting the road ahead.\nI’ll begin by outlining what the financial system should provide for our economy and\nsociety, and by acknowledging where it has tended to come up short in the past. In a nutshell, the\ncore purposes of the financial system are to facilitate payments between buyers and sellers, and\nto direct households’ and businesses’ savings to their most productive uses, such as building\n1 See, for example, the recent report issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2016).\nhttp://www.occ.gov/publications/publications-by-type/other-publications-reports/pub-responsible-innovation-\nbanking-system-occ-perspective.pdf\n1\n\nhomes, expanding businesses, getting an education, or developing infrastructure. That’s a tall\norder, and certain aspects have proven particularly difficult to achieve, including ensuring that\nthe financial system is efficient and resilient, and that it benefits everyone in society.\nFintech holds great promise for tackling these long-standing challenges. This is why I’m\nexcited by the innovation I’m seeing in financial technology—much of it from people here\ntoday. But it’s also why I’m going to raise some potential risks. Let me be clear: People from\nregulatory agencies don’t highlight potential downsides because we’re dour, unfun pessimists—\nor at least not only because we’re dour, unfun pessimists. We do it because we have to look not\njust at what’s possible in the sense of wonder and limitless options, but at what’s possible in the\nsense of the economist’s greatest concern: the unintended consequence.\nBefore I go any further, I should make two disclaimers. First is the standard one, that the\nviews expressed here today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System. Second is that, as president of the San Francisco Fed, I am not directly\ninvolved with writing rules or regulations. So I will not be talking about specific regulations and\ntheir application to fintech. Instead, my aim is to lay out issues and questions that should be part\nof the ongoing conversation about how fintech can make our financial system—and ultimately\nour economy—more successful at achieving its fundamental goals.\nSo, back to the duality. The laws of innovation often mirror the laws of physics: For\nevery great stride, there is an equal and opposite risk. So it’s not that regulators are here to call\n2\n\nthe cops on the party; we’re here to make sure no one jumps off the roof. And while we see the\npotential in innovation, we’re also looking at the other side of the coin.\nAs I said, technology offers creative opportunities to improve the performance of the\nfinancial sector, and to remedy some of its shortcomings. Fintech’s opus spans products that\naddress all parts of the so-called consumer wallet: planning, spending, saving, and borrowing.\nThe products are generally less complex, making them more understandable and easier for\ncustomers to use. They’re delivered via platforms that widen the overall customer base, allowing\nmore people access to credit and the first rung of the financial ladder.\nOne of the most obvious and potentially most game-changing benefits is the ability to\nreach historically underserved and economically disadvantaged communities. This is the case in\nmature economies, like the United States, where inequality and access to financial services are\nperennial issues. It’s also true for emerging economies, where large portions of the world’s\npopulation are making the transition from subsistence-level living to a more sustainable\neconomic existence. That is incredibly powerful.\nFintech can lower costs and improve services, particularly for lower-income families and\nsmall businesses. Meaning fintech can help more people get access to credit at reasonable terms,\nbetter manage their finances, and keep more money in their pockets. Or, in the case of the many\nworkers in the U.S. who send funds to families in other countries, put more money in the pockets\nof their children, parents, or communities. Fintech can help revitalize impoverished\n3\n\nneighborhoods by allowing small businesses that have been shut out of the formal financial\nsector to take root and grow.\nGlobally, we’re seeing the emergence of payment systems via mobile phones in places\nwhere the vast majority of people are unbanked or underbanked, but have cell phones. Instead of\npaying huge fees for bank-like services, it’s all done through text or the touch of a few buttons.\nThis has made its mark in some areas, is starting to gain a foothold in others, and even has\npotential here.\nSo what could go wrong? The flip side concern is that those exact people could wind up\nbecoming even more marginalized. I think back to exclusionary practices in lending like\nredlining, where portions of the population were denied services based on where they lived. Even\nwhen outright discrimination was banned, lending metrics translated into disenfranchisement of\nracial and ethnic groups. It would be a travesty if, despite the best intentions in the world, new\ntechnologies designed to improve the availability of credit instead ended up reintroducing that\nkind of exclusion, by, say, basing decisions on zip codes or other demographic metrics.\nA similar juxtaposition of potential and risk arises with the proliferation of options for\nsaving and borrowing that fintech promises. These novel approaches to intermediating savings\nand investments could lower costs and broaden access to people who are currently unbanked or\nunderserved. At the same time—as we know all too well from historical precedent—the\nunscrupulous will prey on the vulnerable, be it through predatory lending, irresponsible payday\n4\n\nloans, outright fraud, and more; sadly, the list goes on and on. I don’t want to see fintech’s\npositive potential hijacked to become a source of new, more powerful platforms to prey on\nconsumers on a massive scale.\nAnother area for the great and the possible is leveraging big data and data analytics to\nimprove operational efficiency, risk management, and decision making. For example,\nsophisticated algorithms can help overcome many of the hurdles to defeating money laundering\nand the funding of terrorist and criminal organizations. “Know your customer” laws across the\nworld require banks and financial institutions to verify that their customers are the people they\nclaim to be, which is a costly and heretofore imperfect undertaking. Advanced data analytics\ncould provide powerful tools to increase both the efficiency and efficacy of these efforts.\nThe other side of that coin, of course, is that, left unbridled, the ease and anonymity of\nsome types of fintech, such as digital currencies, have the potential to make criminal and terrorist\nactivity even easier. And while fintech could have significant benefits for the ability to assess\nand manage risk, any time we’re talking about big data, we need to be at least cognizant, and at\nmost vigilant, about the protection and privacy of those consumers whose data are being used.\nWhile fintech can also improve not just the accessibility but the quality of service—\nsomething that consumers are demanding—we also need to look out for the resilience of the\nfinancial system as a whole. As the fintech industry continues to grow, both as nonbank\ninstitutions and via partnerships with banks, potential risks to the financial system and economy\n5\n\nexpand in proportion. Moreover, for our financial system to be efficient, it’s important that we\nhave a level playing field, regardless of how institutions prefer to describe themselves or what\nkind of charter they hold. As a matter of principle, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck,\nit should be regulated like a duck.\nIn raising these concerns, I’m not suggesting that the spirit of innovation is in any way\nnefarious, nor do I claim that people haven’t considered risk of their own volition. But as I said\nearlier, this is about unintended consequences. In summary, there’s no question that fintech is\ngoing to change the face of financial services on a global scale. I am excited for the changes to\ncome, and I see the potency of the possible. But for fintech’s potential to be met, we need to\nmake sure we don’t reinvent or exacerbate shortcomings that have plagued our financial system\nthus far. In that regard, well-designed regulation that protects consumers, fosters inclusionary\nrather than exclusionary practices, and enhances the fairness and resilience of the financial\nsystem should help rather than hinder fintech’s contribution to creating a better financial system\nand economy.\nThank you.\n6",

    "text": "Presentation to Bank Indonesia–BIS Conference on “Expanding the Boundaries of Monetary\nPolicy in Asia and the Pacific,” Jakarta, Indonesia\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on August 20, 2015\nMeasuring the Effects of Monetary Policy on House Prices and the Economy\nIt’s a pleasure to participate in this excellent conference dealing with important and\ntimely issues. This is my first visit to Indonesia and my second trip to Southeast Asia this year.\nThis is a truly fascinating part of the world—in many ways distinct from neighboring regions but\nalso very much connected to the global economy—and I look forward to learning a great deal\nduring my time here. Before I go any further, I should note that, as always, the views I express\nhere are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, let me get to the topic of my talk.\nThe great unresolved question in central banking today is: Should monetary policy be\nused to foster financial stability, even at the expense of achieving other macroeconomic goals\nsuch as inflation and employment? Rivers of ink have already been spilled on this question and\nno doubt much more will be in coming years. In my talk today, however, I will take a step back\nfrom the “big picture” policy questions, such as the pros and cons of “lean” vs. “clean” and the\nappropriate roles of fiscal, regulatory, and monetary policies in addressing risks to financial\nstability. Instead, I will put on my researcher’s hat and focus narrowly on one particular issue\nthat is central to thinking about the role of monetary policy in supporting financial stability—the\neffects of monetary policy on house prices and the overall economy.\n1\n\nMonetary policy, housing, and financial stability\nWhy focus on house prices? Although monetary policy’s influence on house prices\nrepresents only one channel by which it affects financial stability, it is an important one for a\nnumber of reasons. First, the global financial crisis provides an all-too-real example of the\ndevastating effects of a debt-fueled housing boom and crash. And real estate finance has grown\nenormously in many countries1 and is therefore likely to remain a key source of risk to financial\nstability. Second, standard economic theory tells us that monetary policy should affect house\nprices and housing finance more generally.2 All else equal, higher interest rates increase the cost\nof owning a house, which implies a lower asset value. Hence, there is a prima facie case for\nconsidering a role for monetary policy in tempering housing booms in support of financial\nstability. Third, there is a wealth of data and research on this issue that provides a rich\nopportunity for analysis and testing of various hypotheses. Of course, this last argument exposes\nme to the criticism that I am foolishly looking under a lamppost because the light is better there,\nbut so be it.\nOf course, the effect of monetary policy on house prices is only half of the story: When\nconsidering the potential benefits of monetary policy for combatting the risk of a housing boom\nand ultimately for financial stability, it’s equally important to gauge the effects on other\nmacroeconomic variables of interest, such as inflation and economic activity.3 In many\ncircumstances, macroeconomic and financial stability goals may be well aligned. For example, if\nthe housing sector and the overall economy are both booming, then tighter monetary policy may\nserve to both reduce the risks to the financial system and keep economic activity from exceeding\ndesired levels. But, in other circumstances, macroeconomic and financial stability goals may\n1 Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2014). See also Mian and Sufi (2014).\n2 Kuttner (2012).\n3 Yellen (2014).\n2\n\nconflict, and policymakers face a tradeoff between the two. As a case in point, Lars Svensson has\nargued that in Sweden, the costs of higher interest rates in terms of higher unemployment exceed\nthe benefits in terms of reducing financial stability risks.4 Therefore, it is important to\nquantitatively gauge the costs and benefits of using monetary policy to influence house prices\nwhen macroeconomic and financial stability goals do not coincide.\nMeasuring the effects of monetary policy\nThe question remains: How does one best estimate the effects of monetary policy on\nhouse prices and other economic variables of interest? Economists typically take one of two\napproaches. The first is to use economic theory to describe the relationship between variables,\nsay interest rates and house prices. The model can then be used to evaluate the “counterfactual”\nexperiment of a rise in interest rates and compute the simulated effect on house prices or other\nvariables.5 The main strength of this model-based approach is that it gives a clear theoretically\ngrounded answer to the question. The potential shortcoming is that the answer is only as good as\nthe model is at providing a reasonably accurate description of the relationships that occur in the\nreal world. Specifically, standard textbook theories may provide an inadequate description of the\ndetermination of house prices.6 This suggests looking to a more evidence-based approach.\nThe second approach focuses more squarely on the empirical evidence and relies less\ndirectly on economic theory. In a nutshell, the empirical approach looks at what has typically\nhappened to other variables when interest rates go up (or down). The strengths and weaknesses\nof this approach are the mirror image of those of the model-based approach. The main strength is\nthat one does not rely so much on having an accurate model. The weakness is that it’s hard to\n4 Svensson (2014).\n5 Dokko (2009). See also Svensson (2014) and Ungerer (2015).\n6 Kuttner (2012).\n3\n\ndistinguish between statistical correlation and economic causation. Interest rates go up and down\nin response to economic conditions and also tend to be highly correlated with other variables.\nHowever, to answer the question about the effects of a policy decision to change interest rates, it\nis crucial for one to properly identify times when policy changes are not a response to economic\ndevelopments, but rather the driver of them.\nRecent research provides an ingenious way to identify monetary policy actions that are\narguably exogenous to domestic economic conditions. It examines the effects of changes in\ninterest rates in countries that have given up their ability to freely adjust interest rates on their\nown because they fixed their exchange rate to a foreign currency.7 In such circumstances,\nchanges in domestic interest rates are tied to developments in a foreign country, such as the\nUnited States, and not to domestic conditions. Thus, one can simply look at the responses of\ndomestic economic variables to changes in interest rates to trace out the effects of monetary\npolicy.\nFindings\nApplying this method to a sample of 17 countries over the past 140 years indicates that\nmonetary policy has significant and persistent effects on real house prices and output. Figure 1\nshows the responses of short-term interest rates, real house prices, real GDP per capita, and the\ninflation rate following a shock to monetary policy. These results are based on a slightly\nmodified version of recent research by Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan Taylor.8 The\nsample covers 1870–2013 (except for the interwar period of 1914–45 and the oil crisis years of\n1973–80). The estimated responses have been scaled so that the initial rise in short-term interest\n7 Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015a, b).\n8 Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015a).\n4\n\nrates is 1 percentage point. The shaded regions show the 90 percent confidence regions of the\nestimated effects.\nTwo years after a 1 percentage point increase in the short-term interest rate, real house\nprices are estimated to decline by over 6 percent, while real GDP per capita declines by nearly 2\npercent. This implies a ratio of 3.3 in terms of the decline in house prices for a 1 percent decline\nin the level of output after two years. Looking at a longer time horizon of three or four years (not\nshown in the figure), the ratio rises to about 3½.\nAlthough imprecisely estimated, inflation also responds negatively to a monetary policy\nshock after a two-year lag. One caveat in interpreting this result is that by construction the\nsample only includes countries with fixed exchange rates. Many countries today have adopted\ninflation targeting or similar regimes with explicit mandates for low inflation, which likely alters\nthe inflation responses to monetary policy shocks relative to a fixed exchange rate regime.\nRobustness of findings\nThese findings are based on the average response of house prices and other variables to\nchanges in monetary policy. But, do they depend on specific circumstances? In particular, is\nmonetary policy more or less powerful during housing or real estate debt booms that are\nfrequently precursors to financial crises? To assess this possibility, I examined estimated\nresponses to monetary policy during periods when house prices or mortgage debt are high (or\nlow) relative to their underlying trends. In neither case are the estimated effects of monetary\npolicy meaningfully different from the estimates shown in Figure 1.\nOne potential concern with using such a long time sample is that structural change has\nfundamentally altered the effects of monetary policy on the economy. To assess that possibility,\n5\n\nthe same analysis is conducted using only data from the period after the Second World War. For\nthis shorter sample, the estimated effect on house prices is somewhat larger and the effect on\noutput is smaller. This results in a larger estimated ratio of 5.7 for the decline in house prices\nrelative to that in output, compared with the full-sample estimates.\nThe main result that monetary policy affects house prices and output is consistent with\nother estimates reported in the literature. Table 1 provides a summary of findings from numerous\nresearch papers using different samples and methodologies. For comparison, the first line of the\ntable reports the results using the full-sample “baseline” estimates described above and shown in\nFigure 1; the second line reports the results using just the postwar sample. The remainder of the\ntable reports results from other studies. In particular, these studies use different methods to\nidentify exogenous movements in monetary policy than the approach I described earlier. The\ntable reports the percent change in house prices and a measure of economic activity (typically\nreal GDP) two years after a monetary policy shock. The results have been scaled so that the\ninitial movement in the short-term interest rate is 1 percentage point. In cases where I could not\nget the precise estimates from the author, the numbers reported in the table are estimates based\non a visual inspection of the charts included in the papers.\nAlthough the individual estimates differ, the estimated ratios of the effect on house prices\nrelative to that on real GDP after two years tend to be clustered between 3 and 6, with a median\nestimate of about 4. It is worth noting that one of the outliers likely in part reflects the specific\nmeasure of economic activity used: Ungerer (2015) reports industrial production, which tends to\nbe more cyclically sensitive than GDP. Overall, the results on the ratio of the effects on house\nprices relative to GDP appear to be robust, especially for studies that include a large set of\ncountries.\n6\n\nTo put this in perspective, consider the magnitude of the run-up in house prices in the\nUnited States over 2000–06. Figure 2 shows the U.S. house price-to-rent ratio over the past 40\nyears. In the five years running up to the peak in the spring of 2006, the house price-to-rent ratio\nincreased over 50 percent. Based on the empirical estimates described above, to offset this\nincrease using monetary policy would require a decline in real GDP per capita of over 12\npercent. That is far larger than the 5½ percent peak-to-trough decline in real GDP per capita the\nUnited States actually experienced in the Great Recession. Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor conduct\na similar analysis using a different measure of house price overvaluation, and reach the same\noverall conclusion.9\nNot all of these research papers report effects on inflation; however, consistent with the\nfindings reported above, those that do also find that inflation moves in the same direction as\nhouse prices.10 As noted above, the effects on inflation likely depend on the monetary policy\nregime, and this issue needs further study. Nonetheless, these findings add to the potential\nmacroeconomic costs of directing monetary policy at house prices or other financial stability\ngoals.11\nConclusion\nIn summary, I draw two main conclusions from a large volume of research on the effects\nof monetary policy on house prices. Both are robust across countries, samples, methodologies,\nand other factors. First, monetary policy actions have sizable and significant effects on house\n9 Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2015b).\n10 Assenmacher-Wesche and Gerlach (2008).

That is, an increase in interest rates tends to lower real (inflation-\nadjusted) house prices. Second, this reduction in house prices comes at significant costs in terms\nof reductions in real gross domestic product and inflation. A typical estimate is that a 1 percent\nloss in GDP is associated with a 4 percent reduction in house prices. This implies a very costly\ntradeoff of using monetary policy to affect house prices when macroeconomic and financial\nstability goals are in conflict.\n8\n\nFigure 1: Estimated Effects of Monetary Policy Shock\nNote: Pooled estimates across 17 countries, based on data update to Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor\n(2015a).

    "text": "Presentation to the AEA National Conference on Teaching Economics and Research in\nEconomic Education\nSan Francisco, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on June 1, 2011, 7:30 PM Pacific\nEconomics Instruction and the Brave New World of Monetary Policy1\nGood evening and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It’s a special\npleasure to have you with us. As Chairman Bernanke has noted, economics education is “a\ncritical component of the Federal Reserve’s mission.”2 You are the ones who teach this often\nconfounding subject—not only to those who will follow careers in finance and economics, but\nalso to future engineers, artists, and elementary school teachers.\nFor our part, we at the Fed have an enormous stake in economics education. The Fed has\noften appeared to be clouded in mystery. People often misunderstand our mission and what we\ndo. That’s been especially true these past few years. In response to the financial crisis and\nrecession, we deployed an array of new monetary policy and lending tools that were not part of\nour standard playbook and not found in any textbook. That’s one of the reasons why we\nrecognize the importance of good communication and transparency, through initiatives such as\nthe Chairman’s periodic press conferences. It is essential that the public have a solid base of\nknowledge about economics and monetary policy that will allow people to make informed\njudgments about the Federal Reserve. We depend on educators like you to explain how the Fed\nworks and how our policies affect the economy. We all benefit when the public understands\nwhat we do and why, so we are very grateful for the work you do.\n1 I want to thank John Fernald, Eric Swanson, and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 Bernanke (2006).\n1\n\nThis evening I will talk about some of the profound changes that have taken place in\ncentral banking and monetary policy over the past half century and what that means for teaching\nabout the Federal Reserve at the collegiate level. I should say here that my comments represent\nmy own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nAs I know from personal experience, teaching about monetary policy today can be\nespecially challenging when actual events overtake textbooks and lesson plans. In early 2008, I\ntaught macroeconomics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. At the time, the Fed was\ncreating new programs and new tools to deal with the burgeoning financial crisis. The textbook\ndescriptions of the traditional monetary policy tools of reserve requirements, open market\noperations, and the discount window missed much of what was happening in the real world. I\ntook away an appreciation of how difficult it was to keep my lectures up to date with rapidly\nevolving events. Let me give you an idea of how much things have changed. Today the Board\nof Governors web site lists 12 monetary policy tools. Nine of them didn’t exist four years ago.\nThe good news is that six of those tools are no longer in existence, reflecting the improvement in\nfinancial conditions.\nTo take a notable example of a monetary policy tool that wasn’t in the textbooks, the Fed\nhas enormously bulked up its balance sheet in response to the recent financial crisis and\nrecession. We’ve bought large quantities of Treasury, mortgage-backed, and agency securities,\nand paid for them by creating bank reserves. Standard textbook treatments of monetary policy\nimply that such money creation should be highly inflationary. But, as I will explain, the world\nhas changed in ways that undermine the reasoning behind such a conclusion.\nWhen I was an undergraduate at Berkeley in the early 1980s, much of the monetary\neconomics that I learned was based on theories from the 1950s or even earlier. These included\n2\n\nthe quantity theory of money, Keynes’s LM curve, Milton Friedman’s monetarism, and the\nBaumol-Tobin theory of money demand, to name a few examples. Now, there’s no question that\nKeynes, Friedman, and Tobin were among the greatest monetary theorists of all time. Their\ntheories are elegant statements of fundamental economic principles. As such, they deserve to be\ntaught for a long time to come. But viewing them as definitive in today’s world is like thinking\nthat rock and roll stopped with Elvis Presley. The evolution of money and banking since the\n1950s is at least as dramatic as what’s happened with popular music—not that I want to compare\nthe Fed with Lady Gaga. The theories of that era need to be adapted to the brave new world in\nwhich we now live.\nTechnology and changes in the concept of money\nThe first major difference between monetary policy today and policy of a generation or\nso ago is that our decisions have had less and less to do with monetary aggregates, such as M1.\nThis reflects the fact that payments technology has changed so dramatically over the past 50\nyears. In the 1950s, when June Cleaver went to buy groceries, she probably paid with cash or\nperhaps a check. If her purse was empty, she had to get to the bank before it closed at three\no’clock, wait in line for the next available teller, and then withdraw enough cash to last until her\nnext bank visit. These simple facts of life determined the monetary theories of that day. They\neven shaped the definition of M1, which has a nostalgic 1950s simplicity about it.\nFor example, M1, the most liquid measure of money, is defined as cash and coin,\ntraveler’s checks, demand deposits, and similar bank balances. These include the measures of\nmoney that June Cleaver used for her transactions every day. In terms of understanding how\nmuch cash June wanted to hold, the Baumol-Tobin theory of money demand might apply. In\nthat theory, households calculate how many times to go to the bank to withdraw cash and how\n3\n\nmuch cash to take out based on two things: the inconvenience cost of each trip to the bank and\nthe household’s typical monthly shopping needs.\nLet’s now fast-forward 50 years. Instead of driving to the bank and waiting in line, many\nof us do most of our banking online or at ATMs. And purchases today can be made using a\ndizzying array of payment options, including credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, and PayPal, to\nname just a few. Debit cards and PayPal have many similarities to traditional checking accounts\nand can be fitted into traditional monetary theories. But credit cards present a much greater\nchallenge. Credit card balances are nowhere to be found in the monetary aggregates, even\nthough they make up a large fraction of total U.S. transactions. If you or I drained our bank\naccounts, we could still shop until we dropped by running up our credit card balances.\nHow do 1950s theories of cash and checks apply in a world in which you and I can\ninstantly take out a loan of several thousand dollars with the swipe of a card at the cash register?\nWhen Milton Friedman first advocated slow and stable growth of the money supply, he didn’t\nwrite a word about credit cards, checkable brokerage accounts, or checkable home-equity loan\naccounts. In the 1950s, these innovations hadn’t been invented or existed only in the most\nrudimentary form.\nLet’s take a closer look at the classic quantity theory of money: MV = PY. It becomes\nvery tenuous when traditional measures of M make up a smaller and smaller fraction of the value\nof transactions. For example, the velocity of M1 was around three or four in the 1950s. Now it\nis about eight—and that’s down from a peak of about 10½ a few years ago. Today’s economy\nuses cash and checking accounts much more efficiently.3\nThere have been a number of attempts to find a broader measure of “money” that has a\nstable relationship with nominal spending—that is, a constant velocity. These include M2 and\n3 See Goldfeld (1976).\n4\n\nvariants of M2 that incorporate the latest financial innovations.4 But, despite repeated efforts,\nlike the mythical city of El Dorado, this ideal measure of money has proven elusive. It is\nprecisely because of the volatility of velocity (V) that the Fed has moved away from targeting the\nmonetary aggregates in conducting monetary policy. Instead, for the past few decades, the Fed\nhas targeted short-term interest rates, in particular the federal funds rate and the interest rate on\nbank reserves. By targeting these rates directly, the Fed bypasses the uncertain and\nunpredictable link between money and the economy. Other major central banks target short-term\ninterest rates as well.\nThe money multiplier during the crisis and recession\nThe breakdown of the standard money multiplier has been especially pronounced during\nthe crisis and recession. Banks typically have a very large incentive to put excess reserves to\nwork by lending them out. Thus, our traditional textbook theories predict that banks will hold\nreserves only to the extent that they have to do so to satisfy regulatory requirements and\ntransactions needs. If a bank were suddenly to find itself with a million dollars in excess\nreserves in its account, it would quickly try to find a creditworthy borrower and earn a return on\nthat one million dollars. If the banking system as a whole found itself with excess reserves, then\nit would try to lend the money out. That would increase the availability of credit in the economy,\ndrive private-sector borrowing rates lower, and spur economic activity. Precisely this reasoning\nlies behind the classical monetary theories of multiple deposit creation and the money multiplier.\nBut, this hasn’t happened—not at all. The Federal Reserve has added $1.5 trillion to the\nquantity of reserves in the banking system since December 2007. Despite a 200 percent increase\nin the monetary base—that is, reserves plus currency—measures of the money supply have\n4 See Small and Porter (1989) and Duca (1995).\n5\n\ngrown only moderately. Over this period, M1 increased 38 percent, while M2 increased merely\n19 percent. In other words, the money multiplier has declined dramatically. Indeed, despite all\nthe headlines proclaiming that the Fed is printing huge amounts of money, since the end of 2007\nM2 has grown at a 5½ percent annual rate on average. That’s only slightly above the 5 percent\ngrowth rate of the preceding 20 years.\nWhy has the money multiplier broken down? Well, one reason is that banks would rather\nhold reserves safely at the Fed instead of lending them out in the still struggling and risky\neconomy. But, once the economy improves sufficiently, won’t banks start lending more actively\nin order to earn greater profits on their funds? And won’t that get the money multiplier going\nagain? And can’t the resulting huge increase in the money supply overheat the economy, leading\nto higher inflation? The answer is no, and the reason for this is a profound, but largely\nunappreciated change in the inner workings of monetary policy.\nInterest on bank reserves\nI’m referring to the 2008 legislation that allowed the Fed to pay interest on bank reserves.\nThese reserves consist almost entirely of bank balances held electronically at the Fed. Until just\na few years ago, bank reserves and cash were the same in many respects. Both were part of the\nmonetary base. Both earned no interest. And both could be used to satisfy reserve requirements\nand settle payments between banks.\nBut now banks earn interest on their reserves at the Fed and the Fed can periodically\nchange that interest rate. This fundamental change in the nature of reserves is not yet addressed\nin our textbook models of money supply and the money multiplier. Let’s think this through. At\nzero interest, bankers feel considerable pressure to lend out excess reserves. But, if the interest\nrate paid on bank reserves is high enough, then banks no longer feel such a pressing need to “put\n6\n\nthose reserves to work.” In fact, banks could be happy to hold those reserves as a risk-free\ninterest-bearing asset, essentially a perfect substitute for holding a Treasury security. If banks\nare happy to hold excess reserves as an interest-bearing asset, then the marginal money\nmultiplier on those reserves can be close to zero.\nIn other words, in a world where the Fed pays interest on bank reserves, traditional\ntheories that tell of a mechanical link between reserves, money supply, and ultimately inflation\nno longer hold.5 In particular, the world changes if the Fed is willing to pay a high enough\ninterest rate on reserves. In that case, the quantity of reserves held by U.S. banks could be\nextremely large and have only small effects on, say, M1, M2, or bank lending. So what about\nexcess reserves and inflation? Classical monetary theory would take it as given that the\nenormous growth of excess reserves of the past few years would spur inflation. But if all those\nreserves aren’t lent out, and all they do is sit at the Fed gathering interest, then the classical\nconclusion no longer holds water.\nUnderstanding the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase programs\nThis raises another question: If those reserves aren’t circulating, why has the Fed boosted\nthem so dramatically in the first place? The most important reason has been a deliberate move to\nsupport financial markets and stimulate the economy. By mid-December 2008, the Fed had\nlowered the federal funds rate essentially to zero. Yet the economy was still contracting very\nrapidly. Standard rules of thumb and a range of model simulations recommended setting the fed\nfunds rate below zero starting in late 2008 or early 2009, an obvious impossibility.6\n5 Martin et al. (2011).\n6 See Chung et al. (2011a) and Rudebusch (2010).\n7\n\nInstead, the Fed provided additional stimulus by purchasing longer-term securities,\nanother policy tool absent from standard textbooks. From late 2008 through March 2010, the\nFed bought $1.7 trillion in such instruments. Then, in November 2010, we announced we would\npurchase an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the end of June 2011.\nWe created bank reserves to pay for the securities. These purchases increased the demand for\nlonger-term Treasuries and similar securities, which pushed up the prices of these assets, and\nthereby reduced longer-term interest rates. Lower interest rates, in turn, have improved financial\nconditions and helped stimulate real economic activity. Based on econometric analysis and\nmodel simulations, I estimate that these longer-term securities purchase programs will raise the\nlevel of GDP by about 3 percent and add about 3 million jobs by the second half of 2012. This\nstimulus also probably prevented the U.S. economy from falling into deflation.7\nThe important point is that the additional stimulus to the economy from our asset\npurchases is primarily a result of lower interest rates, rather than through a textbook process of\nreserve creation leading to an increased money supply. It is through its effects on interest rates\nand other financial conditions that monetary policy affects the economy. Of course, once the\neconomy improves sufficiently, the Fed will need to raise interest rates to keep the economy\nfrom overheating and excessive inflation from emerging. It can do this in two ways: by raising\nthe interest rate paid on reserves along with the target federal funds rate; and by reducing its\nholdings of these securities, which will reverse the effects of the asset purchase programs on\ninterest rates.\nLender of last resort\n7 See Chung et al. (2011a, b).\n8\n\nFinally, the Fed is not only the nation’s monetary authority. It is also the lender of last\nresort. This too is a function that has undergone momentous changes in recent decades.\nTraditionally, during bank panics or times of financial distress, the Fed would use the discount\nwindow to lend cash to banks against illiquid collateral. These emergency loans kept sound\nbanks from falling victim to a lack of liquidity during bank runs.\nIn the most recent financial crisis, liquidity all but vanished across an unprecedented\nspectrum of assets and markets. In response, the Fed carried out a slew of unconventional\nmeasures to try to prevent fundamentally sound institutions from failing and economically\nimportant asset classes from disappearing. To accomplish this, the Fed extended the discount\nwindow to nonbank institutions. And it lent cash against an extremely wide variety of\nfundamentally sound but illiquid assets.\nThe novelty here is not so much in the loans that the Fed made, but rather in the universe\nof borrowers. The extension of discount window-type loans to investment banks and even an\ninsurance company was a major departure from past practices and it wasn’t always popular.\nHere again though is a case of perception not catching up with the reality of the new financial\norder. When the Fed was assigned the role of lender of last resort, the financial system was far\nsimpler. Securitized mortgages didn’t exist. Commercial paper was a tiny fraction of corporate\nfinance, while today it is one of the most important ways corporations finance their short-term\nneeds for cash. In addition, the walls between traditional banking and other financial market\nactivities have crumbled. More of what we traditionally regarded as commercial banking\nactivity is now carried out in the shadow banking system than in the world of regulated banks\n9\n\nand thrifts.8 The explosive growth of the shadow banking system has meant that we have had to\nthink about the lender-of-last-resort function in new ways.\nConclusion\nI’ve tried to highlight some of the challenges faced by traditional monetary theory in light\nof the dramatic changes in the economy and monetary policy. I said at the beginning of my talk\nthat those changes represent a challenge for economics instructors. When you read the\ncommentary in blogs and the news media, you sometimes find confusion and misinformation\nabout what the Fed is doing. There is no question that, at the Fed, we have to do a better job\nexplaining the theoretical and practical bases for our policies. At the same time, we depend on\nyou to educate citizens who can make sense of the world as it is today. Thank you very much.\nReferences\n8 See Pozsar et al.

    "text": "Monetary Policy’s Role in Fostering\nSustainable Growth\nRemarks by\nJOHN C. WILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nAt the\nEconomic Club of Las Vegas\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nAugust 2, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nThank you, Keith, for the kind introduction and your years of service as a member\nand Chair of our Los Angeles Branch Board. It’s great to be with all of you today.\nThis is a critical juncture for the American economy. After years of hardship and\nstruggle, we’ve managed to recover from the devastating effects of the housing crash,\nthe foreclosure crisis, and the ensuing financial crisis and Great Recession. As the\neconomy has transitioned from recovery to ongoing expansion, the role of monetary\npolicy has shifted from getting America back to work to sustaining the expansion for\nas long as possible. That means gradually ratcheting back on monetary policy stimulus\nand trying to keep the economy on an even keel.\nBut, even as we see daylight in today’s economy, we find ourselves in the shadow of\ndaunting longer-term challenges to economic growth and shared prosperity. These\ninclude a sea change in demographic factors like slowing population and labor force\ngrowth and a downshift in productivity growth.\n1\n\nThe theme of my talk is that monetary policy is reaching its limit as to what it can do\nto generate economic growth. Other actors—in both the private and public sectors—\nneed to step up and take the lead in making the investments and enacting policies\nneeded to improve the longer-term prospects of our economy and society. The\noutstanding question is whether we as a nation will rise to these challenges and define\nour economic future, or will we instead allow our economic future to define us.\nAfter that bold introduction, now is a good time to insert the usual Fed disclaimer\nthat the views expressed are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE’S GOALS: A SCORECARD\nThe Congress has mandated that our job is to keep the economy stable and on track,\nwith a focus on two big goals: maximum employment and price stability. That means\nwe want everyone who wants a job to be able to find one and for inflation to average\n2 percent per year over the long run.\nToday, the U.S. economy is about as close to these goals as we’ve ever been. Among\nother things, we’ve fully recovered from the recession.\nWhen it comes to our employment goal, this is typically viewed in terms of the\nunemployment rate relative to the natural rate of unemployment—by this I mean the\nlevel consistent with an economy that is running neither too hot nor too cold. We\ncan’t know precisely where this magic number is, but I put it at about 4¾ percent.\nToday, the U.S. unemployment rate is 4.4 percent—meaning that we’ve not only\nreached the full employment mark, we’ve exceeded it. Given the strong job growth\nwe’ve been seeing in the United States, I expect the unemployment rate to edge down\na bit further this year and then remain a little above 4 percent through next year.\nOf course, the unemployment rate is only one metric of labor market health. The\ngood news is that we have seen broad-based improvement in the labor market across\na broad swath of indicators.\nTo help provide a broader measure of underemployment, economists at the Federal\nReserve have developed a useful summary measure of labor market slack called the\nNon-Employment Index, or NEI.1 Instead of debating whether or not to include one\ngroup or another as part of the “labor force,” they let the data do the talking. The\n1 Hornstein, Kudlyak, and Lange (2014) and Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (2017).\n2\n\nNEI includes all members of the non-working population based on their likelihood of\ntaking a job. It’s currently at the same level as the peak in the labor market back in\n2006, providing another clear signal that we have reached a full-employment\neconomy.\nWhile we’ve reached our employment goal, we still have a ways to go in terms of\ninflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation has been running below our\nlonger-term goal of 2 percent for quite a while now. In the past, this low rate of\ninflation was the product of a number of factors—the recession and falling prices of\nimported goods and services being the two main ones.\nIn recent months, some special transitory factors—like sharp declines in prescription\ndrug prices, airfares, and especially wireless service fees—have been pulling inflation\ndown. To cut through the noise, it’s helpful to look at measures that strip out prices\nthat fluctuate wildly. My favorite such measure is the trimmed-mean PCE inflation\nrate reported by the Dallas Fed. Over the past year through May, this measure is at 1.7\npercent.2 As these transitory factors wane and with the economy doing well, I expect\nthat we’ll reach our 2 percent goal in the next year or two.\nTRANSITIONING FROM RECOVERY TO SUSTAINED EXPANSION\nWith the economy having reached full employment, the Fed’s job is to keep it there.\nThat means managing the risk that the economy will get too hot and out of balance\nagainst the risk that the expansion will stall.3\nDuring the recession and recovery, jump-starting and speeding the recovery required\nhistorically low interest rates. But today, with the recovery already complete, interest\nrates in the United States are still low.\nTo keep the economy on a sustainable path of growth, we need to gradually reduce\nthe monetary stimulus put in place during the recession and recovery. If we delay too\nlong, the economy will eventually overheat, causing inflation or other imbalances to\nemerge. At some point, that would put us in the position of having to quickly reverse\ncourse to slow the economy. That risks stalling the expansion and setting us back into\nrecession.\nAs I said, my goal is to keep the economic expansion on a sound footing that can be\nsustained for as long as possible. The last thing any of us want is to undermine the\n2 Speech text prepared prior to release of the June PCE inflation numbers.\n3 Williams (2017b).\n3\n\nhard-won gains we’ve made since the dark days of the recession, when it seemed like\nthe U.S. and world economies were on the verge of collapse.\nTherefore, we’re in the process of monetary policy normalization. For starters, over\nthe past two years, we’ve moved interest rates up slowly in line with the improvement\nin the economy and the economic outlook. Even with those increases, rates remain\nlow. So we’ve indicated that we expect that economic conditions will warrant further\ngradual increases in the future.4\nSHRINKING THE FED’S BALANCE SHEET\nI’ve been talking about what’s known as conventional monetary policy—that is,\nchanges in short-term interest rates. We also made use of so-called unconventional\npolicy actions over the past decade that we need to normalize as well.\nIn response to the recession and slow recovery, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars\nof long-term Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). By reducing long-\nterm interest rates and stabilizing financial markets during the crisis, the Fed helped\nthe U.S. economy achieve the relatively healthy state that it’s in today.5\nAfter making these purchases, we significantly increased the size of the Fed’s\nholdings. Right now, the Fed’s balance sheet is $4.5 trillion. We are currently keeping\nit at that level by reinvesting the principal payments we receive.\nNow that the U.S. economy has fully recovered, the Federal Open Market Committee\nhas said that it intends to gradually reduce these holdings by cutting back on the\namount we reinvest every month.6 My own view is that it will be appropriate to start\nthis process this fall.\nAt the outset, we’ll start nice and easy, letting our holdings of Treasury securities\ndecline by $6 billion a month, and those of MBS by $4 billion per month. Thereafter,\nwe’ll increase these caps by $6 billion and $4 billion, respectively, every three months,\nuntil they reach $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for\nMBS. From then on, we’ll leave these caps in place, and our securities holdings will\ncontinue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner.7\n4 Board of Governors (2017a).\n5 Williams (2014) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).\n6 Board of Governors (2017b).\n7 Board of Governors (2017b).\n4\n\nWe’ll continue this process of letting the balance sheet gradually shrink until we get to\nthe point that we’re holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary\npolicy efficiently and effectively. It should take about four years to get the balance\nsheet down to a reasonable size.8 While we haven’t settled on what that exact number\nwill be, it will be quite a bit lower than today.\nImportantly, this process of shrinking our balance sheet will take place in the\nbackground. We will continue to use conventional monetary policy tools—raising or\nlowering interest rates—as the primary lever we operate to keep the economy from\nrunning too hot or too cold. 9\nSEA CHANGE IN SUSTAINABLE GROWTH\nSo far I’ve focused on what’s going well. I’ll now shift gears and turn to some of the\nbig challenges that are ahead of us even with the economy at full employment. The\nbig dichotomy of our times is that the economic news is at once both encouraging and\ndiscouraging: encouraging that the economy is expanding; discouraging that growth is\ndisappointing, at least by historical standards.\nIn fact, growth of gross domestic product (GDP) has been almost as unimpressive as\ngrowth in employment has been impressive. In the eight years since the recession\nended, real GDP growth has averaged only about 2 percent, well below former trends,\nwhile we’ve added an impressive 15½ million jobs. How can both be true?\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, a sea change in sustainable growth is\nunder way, driven by fundamental shifts in demographics and productivity growth.\nSpecifically, due to declining birth rates, the retirement of the baby boom generation,\nand other factors, the labor force is expected to grow only about ½ percent per year\nover the next decade.10 That’s less than one-third the pace of the 1980s.\nAnd productivity growth has slowed markedly from the surge in the mid-1990s and\nearly 2000s. It has averaged only a little over 1 percent per year since 2005. This\nslowdown isn’t because of some failure of economic statistics to capture the latest\nbreakthroughs in technology.11 Nor are there signs of a resurgence as the economy\nhas recovered.\n8 Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2017).\n9 Board of Governors (2017b).\n10 Congressional Budget Office (2017).\n11 Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).\n5\n\nAssuming that these trends continue, and I do, the growth rate of our economy’s\npotential is likely to be around 1.5 percent for the foreseeable future, the slowest pace\nin our lifetimes.12 The consequences of slow growth will be felt by monetary, fiscal,\nand other public policymakers.13 Unless these trend lines improve, they will likely find\nthat they are repeatedly being asked to do more with less—in some cases much less—\nthan they planned for. Those who fail to act today will find their challenges getting\neven more severe tomorrow.\nIF NOT MONETARY POLICY, THEN WHAT?\nThis begs the question, what does said action look like? As a monetary policymaker, I\nwish I could tell you that it’s within the purview of central banks to solve all this, that\nthe answer lies in raising or lowering interest rates. Reality, unfortunately, dictates\notherwise.\nOur long-term challenges are going to require the sorts of long-term investments that\nfiscal policymakers—and private investors—have within their own toolkits. We know\nthat there is a range of things we currently underinvest in that have very high returns\non investment, both for individuals and for nations as a whole. These include early\nchildhood education and health, secondary and higher education, job training,\ninfrastructure, basic research and development … all the things that propel an\neconomy and prosperity over the longer term.14\nWith the sea change already under way, we no longer have the luxury of taking a wait-\nand-see approach. These policies and actions may be difficult and costly to\nimplement, but our nation has successfully met such challenges in the past, and I am\nconfident we can again.\nCONCLUSION\nTo sum up, it’s been a long, hard road, but we have finally attained a recovery from\nthe financial crisis and the Great Recession. Because no good deed goes unpunished,\nmonetary policymakers who worked very hard to help our economy recover are now\nfaced with the challenges of protecting what we’ve gained. Our goal, therefore, is to\nfoster sustainable growth. This requires bringing both conventional and\nunconventional monetary policy gradually back to normal.\n12 Fernald (2016).\n13 See Williams (2016b, 2017a,c) for a discussion of the implications for monetary and fiscal policy.\n14 Williams (2016a,b), Fischer (2017).\n6\n\nAs I have emphasized, though, there is only so much that monetary policy can do. We\nface significant longer-term challenges that interest rates alone can’t solve. The\nchoices are clear; what remains to be seen is whether the critical investments in our\nfuture will be made. These decisions have ramifications that extend beyond the next\nfew months or years—they will define the economic landscape for the next decade\nand beyond. In a broader sense, they’re also about the next generation and what sort\nof future we choose to create together.\nThank you very much.\n7\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017a. “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement.” Press release, July 26.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170726a.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017b. “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans.” Press release, June 14.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm\nByrne, David M., John G.

    "text": "Inflation Targeting and the Global Financial Crisis:\nSuccesses and Challenges\nJohn C. Williams\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nPrepared for the South African Reserve Bank\n“Conference on Fourteen Years of Inflation Targeting in South Africa and the\nChallenge of a Changing Mandate”\nOctober 30–31, 2014\nAbstract\nInflation targeting has become the predominant monetary approach across the globe. In a very\nreal sense, “we are all inflation targeters now.” Before, during, and after the financial crisis,\nnearly all central banks following an inflation-targeting approach—whether explicit or implicit—\nhave been highly successful at achieving price stability and anchoring inflation expectations.\nRecent events, however, highlighted two critical issues for inflation targeting going forward: the\nconstraint of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and the appropriate role of monetary\npolicy in supporting financial stability. This has led to the development of alternative approaches\nto inflation targeting that offer, in theory, potential advantages with respect to the zero lower\nbound and financial stability.\n Ben Pyle supplied excellent research assistance. The views expressed in this paper are the author’s and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEmail contact information: John.C.Williams@sf.frb.org\n1\n\nTwenty-five years ago the Reserve Bank of New Zealand bravely embarked on a new\nframework for monetary policy: Inflation Targeting. Today, some 20 central banks—\nrepresenting economies from small to large, emerging markets to advanced—practice some\nversion of inflation targeting.1 Approaches differ in the details, but it is striking how similar\ninflation-targeting practice is across a diverse set of countries with distinct economic and\ninstitutional landscapes. Although the central banks of the three largest advanced economies—\nthe Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve—don’t explicitly\nidentify themselves as practicing inflation targeting, all three have enunciated numerical longer-\nterm inflation goals, a cornerstone principle of inflation targeting. To paraphrase Milton\nFriedman, “we are all inflation targeters now.”2\nThis essay assesses the macroeconomic performance of inflation targeting and other\ncentral bank monetary policies during and after the global financial crisis and discusses two\ncritical challenges for central banks in the future. Spoiler alert: My main conclusion is that\ninflation targeting and related approaches to monetary policy have been remarkably successful at\nproviding a nominal anchor and keeping inflation low and relatively stable during a period of\nsevere turbulence. Nonetheless, recent events have revealed some chinks in the armor of\ninflation targeting related to the zero lower bound on interest rates and financial instability—\nissues I will also address. I will conclude by outlining some alternative, as yet untested\napproaches that have the potential to improve inflation targeting, options for Inflation Targeting\n2.0, if you will.\n1 See Kuttner (2004) for a concise summary of the history of inflation targeting and its spread across the globe.\n2 Milton Friedman is widely credited with coining the phrase “we are all Keynesians now” back in the mid-1960s.\n2\n\nBefore turning to these issues, it is worthwhile to ask two basic questions: what is\ninflation targeting, and why has it become so widespread? At its core, inflation targeting is an\nanswer to the oldest and thorniest problem of monetary policy: providing a nominal anchor for\nthe economy. Past regimes—including the gold standard, pegged exchange rates, and targeting\nmonetary aggregates—all sought to do so, but proved to be fatally flawed when it came to\nproviding the flexibility to deal with economic cycles and crises. In a nutshell, inflation targeting\nis designed to anchor inflation expectations, enabling central banks to achieve greater\nmacroeconomic stability in the short run, while ensuring price stability in the long run.\nAlthough the implementation of inflation targeting differs across countries, three\nelements are central to the framework.3 First and foremost is the announcement of an explicit\nquantitative inflation target coupled with the central bank’s assuming responsibility for\ndelivering price stability. Second is clear communication of the central bank’s policy strategy\nand the rationale for its decisions, which enhance the predictability of the central bank’s actions\nand its accountability to the public. Third is a forward-looking policy orientation, with a\nparticular focus on inflation expectations. Together, these elements provide a focal point for\ninflation, facilitate the formation of inflation expectations, and provide a transparent framework\nfor actions fostering price stability. It is important to note that, although inflation is front and\ncenter in each of these elements, inflation-targeting central banks also recognize a role for\nstabilizing economic activity—what is often referred to in the economics literature as “flexible\ninflation targeting.”\n3 Numerous treatises have been written on inflation targeting. See, for example, Leiderman and Svensson (1995),\nBernanke and Mishkin (1997), Bernanke et al. (1999), and citations therein.\n3\n\nSuccess at taming inflation has fueled wide adoption of inflation targeting (both explicit\nand implicit) over the past 25 years. Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods international\nmonetary system in the early 1970s, most countries have faced bouts of high and volatile\ninflation as they sought a suitable nominal anchor. Some chose to explicitly adopt an inflation-\ntargeting framework with all the bells and whistles, while others did not. However, in the\nfollowing, I do not distinguish between countries that have explicitly adopted inflation targeting\nand others, like the United States, whose behavior is in many ways similar to inflation targeting\nbut which have not made such specific commitment.\nSince the adoption of inflation targeting and similar approaches, inflation in these\ncountries has been relatively quiescent. The first column of Table 1 shows the average rates of\ninflation in a number of countries in the decade before the global financial crisis (1998–2007).\nCompared to double-digit inflation rates in prior periods, nearly all of these countries\nexperienced relatively low inflation rates in the run-up to the crisis. Inflation tended to be\nrelatively stable as well, as shown in column 3 of the table, which reports the standard deviations\nof inflation rates in each country during this period.\nAlthough the stabilization of inflation in so many countries was a great accomplishment,\nthe real test for inflation targeting was yet to come. The global financial crisis and the resulting\nrecessions presented a massive challenge for monetary policy. As has been widely remarked,\ninflation-targeting central banks generally did not foresee or forestall the ballooning risks to\nfinancial systems that eventually exploded. Moreover, central banks were not able to fully\nmitigate the spillovers to economic activity, and the resulting economic costs of the crisis proved\nenormous. These are subjects that I will return to later.\n4\n\nHowever, when gauged by the behavior of inflation since the crisis, inflation targeting\ndelivered on its promise. Columns 2 and 4 of Table 1 report the average inflation rates and their\nassociated standard deviations, respectively, since the beginning of 2008. Inflation rates stayed\nremarkably low and stable during this otherwise turbulent period. The crisis and economic\ndownturns left virtually no traces in terms of the ability of central banks to maintain price\nstability. This is an important achievement in and of itself, but also because the stability of\ninflation provided many central banks with room to take aggressive actions to foster economic\nrecovery.\nWhat explains this impressive performance with regard to price stability? The key is the\nanchoring of inflation expectations before the crisis and the actions taken to maintain price\nstability, and thereby hold the anchor in place, during and after the crisis. Figure 1 shows the net\nchange in survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations from the start of the crisis until\ntoday for a number of countries. In most cases, the anchor held firmly (to put these numbers in\nperspective, the inflation targets are typically between 2 and 3 percent). In a few cases, such as\nJapan and New Zealand, the observed shift represented a desirable move back toward the\nannounced target. In only two other cases, Norway and the United Kingdom, do we see a\nnontrivial shift in inflation expectations. I will return to the case of Norway later.\nWith inflation expectations firmly anchored and the public apparently confident that\ncentral banks would hold the line on price stability, the transmission of economic turmoil to\ninflation was muted. Inflation (and, on the downside, deflation) proved to be the dog that didn’t\nbite.\n5\n\nTwo critical challenges\nDespite inflation-targeting central banks’ noteworthy successes in maintaining low\ninflation and anchoring inflation expectations during and after the crisis, inflation targeting faces\ntwo critical challenges. The first is the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, which has\nconstrained conventional policy actions for most major central banks during the past six years.\nThe second is the appropriate role of monetary policy in maintaining financial stability.\nThe zero lower bound\nThe zero lower bound (ZLB) has been a significant constraint for many central banks\nacross the globe. Figure 2 shows the policy rates for four major advanced economies since 1990.\nCombatting persistent deflation and a stagnant economy, the Bank of Japan moved its policy rate\nclose to zero in the 1990s. Then, following the financial crisis, the Bank of England, the Bank of\nJapan, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve all brought their policy rates to their\nrespective effective lower bounds in late 2008 or early 2009. In addition, central banks in many\nother economies—including Canada, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland—cut policy rates to\nnear zero in the aftermath of the crisis, as seen in Figure 3.\nIn countries where the ZLB has been a major constraint, achieving inflation goals has\nbeen especially challenging. In response to shocks that lower inflation below the target, the\nability to lower short-term rates and stimulate the economy and thereby inflation is curtailed at\nthe zero lower bound. This has been an ongoing problem for Japan, contributing to an\nextraordinarily long period of deflation. Central banks have turned to unconventional policies to\nmitigate the constraint of the ZLB, but even with these interventions, inflation has been\npersistently running below target levels in several countries in the aftermath of the crisis.\n6\n\nAlthough most central banks in emerging market economies and advanced economies\nrich in natural resources did not hit the ZLB during the recent episode, they did see interest rates\nreach very low levels in many cases. Historically, emerging market economies have typically\nexperienced relatively high nominal interest rates, reflecting higher inflation and higher real rates\nthan in advanced economies. All else equal, this elevated level of average interest rates reduces\nthe chance of hitting the ZLB. Figure 4 shows policy rates for Australia, Chile, Mexico, Norway,\nand South Korea. In the cases of Chile and Norway, short-term rates did fall below 2 percent for\na time.\nSo, how important an issue is the ZLB likely to be in the future? Are the events of the\npast decade a harbinger of regular future bouts with the ZLB or an outlier that won’t be\nrepeated? The answer to that question may be best found by looking further into the past rather\nthan focusing on recent history.\nIn considering the likelihood of another bout with the ZLB, one important factor is the\nprobability of another severe recession of the kind the United States and many other countries\nrecently experienced.4 If one tries to answer this question by looking at postwar U.S. data before\nthe financial crisis, one would conclude that such an outcome is highly unlikely. For example, in\nthe 50 years before the crisis, there was no year in which U.S. per capita real GDP fell by as\nmuch as it did in 2009, the worst year of the recession. A statistical analysis of the U.S. data over\nthe 50 years prior to the crisis would lead one to expect a downturn of this magnitude or larger\nonce every 430 years.5 The data would show an even greater sense of complacency if one based\nthis calculation solely on the 25 years leading up to the crisis—the so-called Great Moderation\n4 This discussion is based on Williams (2014).\n5 This calculation is taken from Williams (2014). It assumes the variance of the growth rate is set equal to that\nobserved in the U.S. data over 1958–2007 and that the distribution of outcomes is normally and independently\ndistributed.\n7\n\nperiod. In that case, such a drop in output would be expected to occur only once every 33,000\nyears! This extremely optimistic prediction reflects the unusually tranquil quarter-century before\nthe global financial crisis.\nA very different conclusion is reached when one considers a broader view of historical\nexperience. If, instead of concentrating on the U.S. postwar experience, one includes the history\nof numerous countries over more than a century, then deep recessions are not that rare.6\nSpecifically, analysis of data from 17 advanced countries over the past 140 years (1871–2012)\nshows a decline in per capita real GDP of the magnitude experienced in the United States in\n2009 occurs, on average, about once every 20 years. Using this metric, the recent U.S. recession\nis far from unprecedented or an outlier. A broad view of history teaches us that very large\ndownturns are not only possible, they are common.\nThe point of this example is that the assessment of tail risks—and thereby the incidence\nof the ZLB—depends on the breadth of economic experiences that one considers relevant.\nLooking at broad international experience over a protracted period is likely to mute the\noverconfidence garnered by a more limited set of data points. It rejects the “this time is different”\nview that downplays distant events, and instead treats a wide range of historical experience as\npotentially informative in describing the types of risks the future may hold.\nA second factor influencing the incidence of ZLB episodes is the level of the normal or\n“natural” real rate of interest expected to prevail over the foreseeable future. This is because the\nlower the natural rate of interest, the thinner the available cushion to lower rates when needed. A\n6 Following Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011), the data are taken from Barro and Ursúa (2010), and updated for\n2007–2012 using data from the World Bank. For the United States, data for 1930–2012 are the current national\nincome and product accounts data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The countries in the sample are Australia,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.\n8\n\nnumber of factors—including persistent changes in productivity growth, demographics, pricing\nof risk, and fiscal policy—potentially affect the natural rate of interest. In my research with\nThomas Laubach, we developed a statistical model that provides estimates of the natural rate of\ninterest for the United States.7 Figure 5 shows these estimates, compared with the medium-term\nforecasts of the real federal funds rate from the 2014 Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey.\nBoth the model-based and survey-based estimates of the medium-term natural rate of\ninterest show significant declines since the onset of the global financial crisis. It is too early to\njudge whether this downward shift in the natural rate will endure. However, if it does, then it\nraises the specter of the ZLB being a more frequent problem than in past decades when the\nnatural rate of interest was higher.\nIn summary, based on the broader historical experience and potential for a lower level of\nthe natural rate of interest, the ZLB is likely to be a recurring issue for central banks that target\nlow levels of inflation. This analysis has focused on advanced economies, particularly the United\nStates. Although most emerging market economies have not yet been constrained by the ZLB,\nthis situation may change. Looking to the future, circumstances may be different—commodity\nprices may not be booming as they did during the global financial crisis, and global growth\ntrends and real interest rates may be lower—with the result that the ZLB may become a more\npalpable constraint on monetary policy, even in emerging market economies.\nA monetary policy mandate for financial stability?\nThe second challenge concerns the appropriate role for monetary policy in sustaining a\nstable financial system. From the beginning, the inflation-targeting approach has focused on a\nsingle outcome: price stability. As I have argued, according to this measure, inflation targeting\n7 Laubach and Williams (2003).\n9\n\nhas been an unmitigated success. But the global financial crisis has called into question whether\na singular focus on price stability suffices, and some have argued that monetary policy should be\ndirected at minimizing risks to financial stability as well.\nIn this regard, it is important to recall that the near single-mindedness regarding the\nnominal anchor was originally seen as a virtue, not a vice. Muddying the waters by adding\nconcern for financial stability was typically viewed as a potentially dangerous distraction, risking\npolicymakers’ attention to, and credibility in, maintaining price stability. Indeed, this attitude\nwas codified in numerous central bank charters, which in some cases dictated consequences if\nthe inflation goal was not met.\nTo be sure, the elevation of financial stability concerns at central banks and other\nregulatory agencies is a natural and appropriate reaction to the events of the global financial\ncrisis, when the near meltdown of the financial systems in many countries almost toppled the\nglobal economy. Even with the dramatic—and in many cases, unprecedented—actions of\ngovernments and central banks, the fallout from the financial crisis has been greater and longer-\nlasting than had been experienced in generations. In fact, this renewed concern for financial\nstability represents more a return to the roots of central banking than new-age thinking. After all,\nthe Federal Reserve was created from the ashes of the panics and resulting depressions that\ntormented the U.S. economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nIt has become a mantra in central banking that robust micro- and macro-prudential\nregulatory and supervisory policies should provide the first and second lines of defense for\nfinancial stability. Still, some are concerned that is not enough and call for including a financial\nstability goal in the monetary policy mandate as well. Doing so, however, raises the important\n10\n\nissue of how one commits to taking financial stability into account while simultaneously\npreserving the nominal anchor. If financial stability and price stability goals are in conflict, there\nis a risk that price stability will be subordinated to the financial stability goal, with serious long-\nrun consequences for economic performance.\nThis issue of the appropriate role of monetary policy in fostering financial stability at the\npotential cost to inflation goals has been playing out in policy debates and decision in two\nScandinavian countries: Norway and Sweden. In discussing these examples, let me be absolutely\nclear that I am not judging the wisdom of these decisions. Rather, they provide useful case\nstudies of the possible tradeoffs between financial stability and inflation goals that we can and\nshould learn from.\nTake the case of Sweden. As background, Sweden’s economy has experienced inflation\npersistently below target, while at the same time, household debt and house prices have grown\nenormously. In response to the growing level of debt and the potential risks to financial stability\nit entailed, the Sveriges Riksbank undertook a somewhat tighter stance of monetary policy than it\nwould otherwise have, were it based purely on macroeconomic conditions. The predicted result\nwas a more gradual return to inflation and unemployment goals (Sveriges Riksbank 2014a, p.\n17). Similarly, in Norway, the Norges Bank framed a recent policy decision as follows: “Both\nthe objective of keeping consumer price inflation close to 2.5% and the objective of sustaining\ncapacity utilization in the years ahead could in isolation imply a somewhat lower key policy rate\nforecast.… On the other hand, a lower key policy rate may increase the risk of a further buildup\nof financial imbalances” (Norges Bank 2014, p. 16).\n11\n\nThese examples illustrate the tradeoff between price and macroeconomic goals on one\nhand, and financial stability goals on the other, when using monetary policy to mitigate risks to\nfinancial stability. For example, Lars Svensson (2013, and references therein) uses model\nsimulations to show that the monetary policy actions of the Riksbank, based on a concern for\nfinancial stability, have induced a significantly higher rate of unemployment and a sustained\nshortfall of inflation relative to its target. He goes on to argue that the policy, by reducing\nincome, has actually increased the already high household debt-to-income ratio, potentially\nexacerbating financial stability risks.\nThese calculations focus on the short-run costs of these policies; the more significant\nissue is whether concern for financial stability undermines the nominal anchor. If the central\nbank actions aimed at addressing financial stability risks are large and persistent, the inflation\nrate will likely deviate from target for many years. The protracted failure to deliver on the\ninflation objective could undermine the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to its\ninflation target and unmoor inflation expectations.\nIn this regard, it is instructive to examine the behavior of inflation expectations in\nNorway and Sweden. Figure 6, based on Levin (2014), shows survey data on longer-run\nmeasures of inflation expectations for the United States, the euro area, Norway, and Sweden.\nLonger-run inflation expectations have remained very stable in the United States and euro area,\ndespite the tumult of the global financial and euro crises and the subsequent aggressive monetary\npolicy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. In contrast, Norway\nand Sweden saw some slippage in long-run inflation expectations below target levels, based on\n12\n\nthis survey.8 This follows a long period of realized inflation averaging below-target levels and\ncentral bank communication that financial stability concerns have been affecting policy\ndecisions. Interestingly, the Riksbank cut the policy rate in July 2014, arguing that “expansionary\nmonetary policy can also contribute to inflation expectations remaining anchored around 2 per\ncent by sending a clear signal that monetary policy will ensure that inflation approaches the\ninflation target within the reasonably near future” (Sveriges Riksbank 2014b). Subsequently,\nlonger-run inflation expectations bounced back, as seen in the chart.\nSo far, it’s unclear how durable a slippage in inflation expectations resulting from a focus\non financial stability concerns will prove to be. Nonetheless, it is an apt reminder of the potential\nlong-run costs of losing sight of the price stability mandate. The steadfastness of the nominal\nanchor in most advanced economies has been, and continues to be, a key factor in many central\nbanks’ ability to maintain low and stable inflation during and after the global financial crisis. It\nwas forged over many years of consistent commitment to price stability and successfully taming\nthe inflation dragon. If the anchor were to slip, it would wreak lasting damage to a central bank’s\ncontrol over both inflation and economic activity, at considerable cost to the economy. This\napplies equally to deviations above and below the target.\nInflation Targeting 2.0\nThe two challenges that I have highlighted—the ZLB and the role of monetary policy in\nsupport of financial stability—are not entirely new, but the events of the past seven years have\nhighlighted their importance for central banks. Much of the research and discussion has been\ncentered on how to adapt the existing monetary policy framework to account for and mitigate the\n8 I should note that other surveys show smaller downward movements in long-run inflation expectations. See Norges\nBank (2014) and Sveriges Riksbank (2014a).\n13\n\nnegative effects of these issues. For example, real-world experience with the ZLB has led to the\ndevelopment and use of various unconventional policy approaches such as forward policy\nguidance and variations on using the central bank’s balance sheet to affect financial conditions.9\nSimilarly, recognizing the need for a more resilient financial system has led to the introduction of\nstronger and more comprehensive micro- and macro-prudential regulations and supervision.\nBeyond adapting inflation targeting to these realities, there remains the question of\nwhether the inflation-targeting framework itself should be modified or replaced by a new regime\nbetter suited to deal with the ZLB and financial stability concerns. Given the limitations and\ncosts of using unconventional policies and the residual risks to the financial system even with\nstronger regulation, is there an alternative approach to monetary policy that may engender more\nfavorable tradeoffs? In other words, after 25 years of inflation targeting, is it time for a reboot to\nInflation Targeting 2.0? In the following, I am not advocating any particular position, rather I am\nhighlighting some research on alternative approaches to inflation targeting that may have\nadvantages with respect to the ZLB and financial stability.\nTwo closely related alternatives to inflation targeting have been proposed: price-level\ntargeting and nominal income targeting. Under price-level targeting, the central bank aims to\nkeep the price level on a predetermined growing path. It differs from inflation targeting in that\npast deviations from the target rate of inflation must be made up by offsetting deviations in the\nother direction. Nominal income targeting is similar, but posits a deterministic growing path of\nnominal GDP that the central bank aims to achieve. In the following, I first consider the merits of\nprice-level targeting and then turn to nominal income targeting.\n9 See Williams (2013) for a discussion.\n14\n\nIn theory, price-level and inflation targeting are close cousins, with relatively little to\ndistinguish them in terms of macroeconomic outcomes in “normal” times (Williams 2003). Both\napproaches aim for a low average rate of inflation and put price stability front and center as a\ngoal of monetary policy. However, price-level targeting possesses some potential advantages\nover inflation targeting in mitigating both the economic repercussions of the ZLB and risks to\nfinancial stability.\nThe difference between price-level and inflation targeting really shows up in situations of\nnegative shocks to the economy when inflation falls well below the targeted level. With inflation\ntargeting, monetary policy acts to bring inflation back to the target level, with past misses below\ntarget ignored: that is, bygones are bygones. In contrast, price-level targeting requires more\naggressive monetary policy action that promises future above-target inflation needed to bring the\nprice level back up to its desired path. This promise of sustained future monetary stimulus\nprovides a powerful pull on an economy experiencing disinflationary pressures, even in the\npresence of the zero lower bound. Indeed, according to model-based research, a price-level\ntargeting central bank can, in theory, successfully target a very low trend inflation rate with very\nlittle cost in terms of macroeconomic stabilization resulting from the ZLB (Reifschneider and\nWilliams 2000, Svensson 2001, Eggertsson and Woodford 2003, Williams 2006).\nPrice-level targeting also has potential positive attributes related to financial stability.\nBecause debt contracts are typically written in nominal terms, a period of unexpectedly low\ninflation or even deflation causes the real value of debt to rise relative to expectations when the\ncontract was signed. This can contribute to weakening of households’, businesses’, and banks’\nbalance sheets, resulting in a decline in economic activity and greater stress in the financial\n15\n\nsystem. Under inflation targeting, the increase in the real value of debt is not reversed. In\ncontrast, if the central bank acts to keep overall prices on a steady growth path, then episodes of\nexcessively low inflation or deflation are eventually reversed, mitigating this type of debt\ndeflation problem and the deadweight losses and disruptive effects associated with foreclosure\nand bankruptcy. In this way, price-level targeting has the potential to reduce the risks to the\nfinancial system and spillovers to the economy from debt-fueled booms.\nNominal income targeting takes these arguments a step further. Instead of a price path\nthat sets the goal for policy, it’s a path for nominal GDP. In terms of the ZLB, nominal GDP\ntargeting shares the advantage of price-level targeting: Specifically, it promises higher inflation\nin the future following a period of low inflation that helps dampen deflationary pressures. On the\nfinancial stability front, it may be an even more powerful deterrent to debt-fueled crashes. If\naggregate nominal income is kept close to a steady growth path, then on the aggregate, incomes\nwon’t fall as much during a downturn, allowing people to continue to repay their loans and avoid\ndefault and bankruptcy (Koenig 2013 and Sheedy 2014).\nThese potential benefits of price-level and nominal income targeting are worthy of further\ncareful study and discussion. It is too early to judge whether one approach or the other would\nprovide a better framework than inflation targeting. In contemplating a shift away from inflation\ntargeting, it is crucial to consider what unintended negative consequences these approaches\nmight entail. For example, nominal income targeting could generate persistent deviations of\ninflation from target, which may interfere with the credible communication of the price stability\nobjective. There are also practical considerations in the communication of policy decisions and\ngoals that need to be fully analyzed. In weighing all the potential advantages, disadvantages, and\n16\n\nrisks of these and other alternative approaches, it is absolutely essential that any modification of\napproach not undermine the hard-fought achievement of price stability and well-anchored\ninflation expectations that have been of great benefit, especially during the recent challenging\neconomic times.\n17\n\nReferences\nBarro, Robert J., and José F.

    "text": "Presentation to the Center for Economics and Public Policy\nUC Irvine\nIrvine, California\nBy John C. Williams, president and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 5, 2012 at 5:00pm Pacific, 8:00pm Eastern\nThe Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Policies1\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be here today and to have this opportunity to speak at UC\nIrvine. I would like to thank the Center for Economics and Public Policy for inviting me. The\nsubject of my talk is the unconventional monetary policies pursued by the Federal Reserve over\nthe past four years. In my time today, I’ll cover three big questions. First, why has the Fed\nturned to unconventional monetary policies? Second, what effects are these policies having on\nthe economy? And, third, what potential risks do they pose? I should stress that my remarks\nrepresent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Limits of Conventional Monetary Policy\nLet me start with the first question, why unconventional monetary policy? Back in late\n2008, our country was facing the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.\nReal gross domestic product, the broadest measure of how much we produce as a nation,\nplummeted at an annual rate of 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. The economy was in\nfree fall and the unemployment rate was soaring. In response, in December 2008, the Fed’s\nmonetary policy body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, cut the target federal\nfunds rate—our conventional instrument of monetary policy—essentially to zero.\n1 I want to thank Eric Swanson and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nThe federal funds rate is the short-term interest rate that is normally the FOMC’s primary\nlever used to influence the economy and inflation. When we want to stimulate the economy, we\nlower the target fed funds rate. This causes other interest rates—like rates on car loans and\nmortgages—to decline. And it boosts the value of the stock market as investors equalize risk-\nadjusted returns across their portfolios. In response to lower borrowing costs and the resulting\nimprovement in financial conditions, households and businesses are more willing to spend,\ncreating greater demand for goods and services. This increase in demand in turn causes\nbusinesses to increase production and hire more workers. When we want to slow the economy\nso it doesn’t overheat and create inflationary pressures, we raise the fed funds rate and\neverything works in the opposite direction. That’s conventional monetary policy in a nutshell.\nGiven the economy’s dire straits during the recession, standard rules of thumb for\nmonetary policy suggested that the funds rate should be cut to well below zero.2 But that was\nimpossible. Why can’t interest rates be pushed well below zero? Well, one simple reason is that\ncurrency—the cash in your wallet—pays no interest. Think about it. If bank accounts paid\nnegative interest—that is, if people were charged to keep their money in a bank—then depositors\ncould take money out of their accounts and keep it as hard cash. That would save them the\ninterest expense. Economists refer to this floor on interest rates as the zero lower bound.3\nMeanwhile, the economic outlook was grim. So, given the inability to cut interest rates\nwell below zero, we began to explore alternative ways to ease credit conditions and thereby\nstimulate the economy. We also had an eye on inflation, which was heading lower, thereby\ncreating a situation in which deflation might be a threat. I will focus specifically on two types of\nunconventional monetary policies that the Fed and other central banks put in place around that\n2 See Rudebusch (2009) and Chung et al. (2012).\n3 Actually, it is possible for interest rates to go slightly below zero because it is more convenient and safer to hold\nmoney in a bank account rather than in physical currency. For example, during the European crisis, some interest\nrates in Denmark and Germany have fallen below zero. Nonetheless, there is arguably still a floor on interest rates\nbelow which people would empty their accounts and accept the inconvenience of holding cash.\n2\n\ntime. The first is what we at the Fed call forward policy guidance. The second is what we call\nlarge-scale asset purchases, but which are popularly known as quantitative easing, or QE.4\nForward Policy Guidance\nThe first type of unconventional monetary policy that I will discuss is forward policy\nguidance. Let me start with some background. After each monetary policy meeting, the FOMC\nreleases a statement describing the state of the economy and the reasons for our policy decision\nabout our target for the federal funds rate.5 In addition, the statement often contains language\ndiscussing economic risks and where the FOMC thinks monetary policy may be headed.6 It’s\ninteresting to note that the statement language typically has bigger effects on financial conditions\nthan the federal funds rate decision itself.7 That’s not that surprising. After all, the current level\nof the federal funds rate only tells what the overnight interest rate is right now. But the FOMC’s\nstatement language hints at where those short-term rates are likely to be in the future. That’s\nmuch more relevant information for households, businesses, and investors. They are typically\nborrowing for expenditures such as cars, homes, or business capital spending, which are\ngenerally financed over a longer term.\nAlthough the FOMC has used versions of forward guidance at various times in the past,\nthe use of the policy statement to provide more explicit information about future policy took a\nquantum leap forward in the summer of 2011. With the fed funds rate stuck near zero, forward\nguidance provided a tool to influence longer-term interest rates and financial market conditions.\nForward guidance achieves its effects by influencing market expectations for the future path of\n4 Another unconventional monetary policy analyzed by Svensson (2001) is large-scale foreign currency purchases.\nThe Swiss National Bank’s exchange rate interventions aimed at capping the value of the Swiss franc vis-à-vis the\neuro can be thought of as an unconventional monetary policy action in this respect. However, there is still relatively\nlittle empirical research on the effectiveness of this approach and so I do not discuss it further.\n5 See Williams (2012b) for a description of the evolution of FOMC policy statements over the past two decades.\n6 See Rudebusch and Williams (2008) for a discussion of FOMC policy guidance before the financial crisis.\n7 See Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005).\n3\n\ninterest rates. Let me give a concrete example. Around the middle of 2011, private-sector\neconomists expected that the FOMC would start raising the fed funds rate in about nine months\nto a year, according to surveys of professional forecasters and financial market indicators.8\nThe introduction of forward guidance in the August 2011 FOMC statement succeeded in\nshifting market expectations regarding the future path of the federal funds rate. Specifically, the\nFOMC stated that it “anticipates that economic conditions…are likely to warrant exceptionally\nlow levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.” That statement communicated\nthat the FOMC would probably keep the fed funds rate near zero for at least two more years,\nlonger than many private-sector economists had been thinking. As a result of this shift in\nexpectations, yields on Treasury securities fell by between one- and two-tenths of a percentage\npoint. This may not sound like a big change. But in terms of the effects of monetary policy,\nthose were actually big drops. In fact, this was about as big a fall in interest rates as would\nnormally come from cutting the federal funds rate by three-quarters or even a full percentage\npoint.9 And, the ripple effect through financial markets lowered the cost of credit for all kinds of\nborrowers, not just the U.S. Treasury.\nThe use of forward policy guidance has now become a key monetary policy tool. Since\nAugust 2011, the FOMC has extended forward guidance twice. In January 2012, the FOMC said\nit would keep the fed funds rate exceptionally low “at least through late 2014.” Just this\nSeptember, it extended its guidance further, “at least through mid-2015.” The FOMC also said it\nwould maintain low rates “for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.” In\nother words, it indicated it intends to keep short-term rates low even as the economy improves to\n8 See Swanson and Williams (2012).\n9 See Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) and Chung et al. (2012).\n4\n\nmake sure this recovery takes hold. I should note that the Fed is not alone in using forward\nguidance. Other central banks provide forward policy guidance in a variety of ways.10\nAlthough forward policy guidance has proven to be a very useful policy tool, it’s not a\nperfect substitute for the kind of monetary stimulus that comes from lower interest rates. One\nissue is that, for the forward guidance policy to work as desired, the public has to believe that the\nFOMC will really carry out the policy as it says it will. But, the Fed doesn’t have the ability to\ntie its hands that way. This point was made by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott in the late\n1970s. Let me explain. For forward policy guidance to have its maximum effect, the Fed must\ncommit to keeping the short-term policy rate lower than it otherwise would to compensate for the\nfact that the short-term interest rate cannot be lowered today. But when the time comes to carry\nout the commitment made in its forward guidance, it may no longer want to do so. For instance,\nit might be hard to resist raising rates earlier than promised to head off an increase in inflation.11\nSo, even when central bankers say they will keep rates unusually low for a set time, the public\nmay worry that the central bank will raise rates earlier to fight budding inflation pressures.12\nAnother challenge for forward guidance is that the public may have different expectations\nabout the future of the economy and monetary policy than the central bank. Expectations are\ncrucial for forward guidance to be effective. If the public doesn’t understand the central bank’s\nintended policy path, then forward guidance may not work so well.13 Therefore, clear\ncommunication of policy to the public is a key challenge. This isn’t always easy. The public\nand the media tend to gloss over the nuances of policy and take away simple sound bites.\n10 The central banks of New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden publish policymaker projections of monetary policy\nrates. Other central banks offer short statements on the direction and timing of future policy actions. In addition,\nthe Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan have provided guidance on the timing of and conditions for rate\nincreases.\n11 Adam and Billi (2007) show that the economic effects of the zero lower bound are much larger when the central\nbank cannot commit to future policy actions.\n12 Evans (2010) is an exception. See Walsh (2009) for a discussion of this issue.\n13 See Reifschneider and Roberts (2006) and Williams (2006).\n5\n\nLarge-Scale Asset Purchases\nLet me now turn to the second form of unconventional monetary policy, large-scale asset\npurchases. The goal of large-scale asset purchases, or LSAPs, is the same as for conventional\npolicy actions and forward guidance: to drive down longer-term interest rates, and thereby boost\neconomic growth. How do LSAPs work? First, let me tell you when they wouldn’t work. In a\nhypothetical world of perfect financial markets, LSAPs would have essentially no effect on asset\nprices or the economy. In such a world, the price of an asset depends solely on its expected\nfuture returns, adjusted for risk. If the price of a specific asset deviated from this level,\narbitrageurs would swoop in to take advantage of the discrepancy, knowing that the price would\ninevitably return to its proper level. Suppose the Fed were to step in and buy large amounts of an\nasset class, say, for example, Treasury securities. In that case, other investors would freely sell\ntheir holdings and rebalance their portfolios accordingly. But, asset prices would not change at\nall. And there would be no impact on the broader economy.\nThe reason LSAPs work is that financial markets are not perfect. Decades ago, James\nTobin and Franco Modigliani pointed out that markets are to a certain degree segmented. Some\ninvestors, such as pension funds, have “preferred habitats” for their investments. For example, a\npension fund might prefer longer-term securities to hedge its longer-term liabilities. Thus, the\nsupply and demand of assets in these habitats can affect prices because that pension fund is not\ngoing to start buying short-term securities just because the prices of longer-term securities rise.\nNow, if the Fed buys significant quantities of longer-term Treasury securities or\nmortgage-backed securities, then the supply of those securities available to the public falls. As\nsupply falls, the prices of those securities rise and their yields decline. The effects extend to\nother longer-term securities. Mortgage rates and corporate bond yields fall as investors who sold\nsecurities to the Fed invest that money elsewhere. Hence, LSAPs drive down a broad range of\n6\n\nlonger-term borrowing rates. And lower rates get households and businesses to spend more than\nthey otherwise would, boosting economic activity.\nLSAPs can also affect interest rates by signaling that the central bank is determined to\nease monetary conditions.14 Effectively, the central bank is putting its money where its mouth is.\nThus, LSAPs reinforce forward guidance. For this reason, I view these two types of\nunconventional monetary policy as complementary.\nThe use of LSAPs goes back to a 1961 initiative with the catchy name of Operation\nTwist, an effort by the Fed and the Kennedy Administration to drive down longer-term interest\nrates. More recently, in late 2008 and 2009, the Fed purchased over $1.7 trillion of longer-term\nTreasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, a program often referred to as QE1. In\nNovember 2010, the FOMC announced an additional $600 billion of longer-term bond\npurchases—QE2. And, two months ago, we got QE3 when the FOMC announced that the Fed\nwould buy an additional $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities every month until the outlook\nfor the job market improves substantially.\nOther central banks have also carried out large-scale asset purchase programs. The Bank\nof Japan began a large-scale asset purchase program in 2001. In its most recent program,\nlaunched in 2010, it has bought roughly $1.1 trillion in Japanese government bonds and other\nassets. In March 2009, the Bank of England announced an LSAP program that was later raised\nto the equivalent of roughly $600 billion in purchases mostly of British government bonds. Both\nof these central banks have continued and expanded their asset purchase programs in the past\nyear.\n14 See Bauer and Rudebusch (2012), Christensen and Rudebusch (2012), and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen\n(2011) for discussion and evidence of this signaling channel for LSAPs.\n7\n\nThe Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy on the Economy\nA great deal of research has analyzed the effects of forward policy guidance and large-\nscale asset purchases on financial conditions and the economy. As I mentioned before, forward\npolicy guidance has proven to be effective at lowering expectations of future interest rates.15\nSimilarly, the evidence shows that LSAPs have been effective at improving financial conditions\nas well.\nTo be precise, the estimated impact of a $600 billion LSAP program, such as QE2, is to\nlower the 10-year Treasury yield by between 0.15 and 0.20 percentage point.16 It is around the\nsame magnitude as the effects of forward policy guidance, and about how much the yield on 10-\nyear Treasury securities typically responds to a cut in the fed funds rate of three-quarters to one\npercentage point.17 So, by that metric, LSAPs have big effects on longer-term Treasury yields.\nBy pushing down longer-term Treasury yields, forward guidance and LSAPs have rippled\nthrough to other interest rates and boosted other asset prices, lifting spending and the economy.\nFor example, mortgage rates have fallen below 3½ percent, apparently the lowest level since at\nleast the 1930s. Thanks in part to those rock-bottom rates, we’re at long last seeing signs of life\nin the housing market. Likewise, cheap auto financing rates have spurred car sales. And\nhistorically low corporate bond rates encourage businesses to start new projects and hire more\nworkers.\nIn addition, low interest rates help to support asset prices, such as the value of people’s\nhomes and their retirement funds. All else equal, households are more likely to consume if their\nwealth is growing rather than falling. Stronger asset prices support consumption because they\nmake people feel wealthier and more confident. And that in turn helps boost the economy.\n15 See Swanson and Williams (2012) and Woodford (2012) for a fuller discussion of the theory and evidence related\nto forward guidance.\n16 See, for example, Williams (2011), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012),\nSwanson (2011), Gagnon et al. (2011), and Chen, Curdia, and Ferrero (2012).\n17 See Chung et al. (2012) and Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005, Table 5).\n8\n\nFinally, although it’s not our main intention, these unconventional policies have also had\nan effect on the dollar versus foreign currencies. When interest rates in the United States fall\nrelative to rates in other countries, the dollar tends to decline as money flows to foreign markets\nwith higher returns. One estimate is that a $600 billion program like QE2 causes the dollar to\nfall by roughly 3 or 4 percent.18 That helps stimulate the U.S. economy by making American\ngoods more competitive at home and abroad.\nI’ve argued that forward guidance and LSAPs invigorate the economy by lowering\ninterest rates and improving financial conditions more generally. But just how big are these\neffects? That’s not easy to answer. Financial markets react instantly to FOMC announcements,\nso it’s relatively easy to gauge the financial impact of any policy move. By contrast, monetary\npolicy actions affect economic growth, employment, and inflation gradually over time. Thus, the\nbroad economic effects of monetary policy are not immediately obvious. Moreover, data on\nunemployment and gross domestic product are only collected monthly or quarterly. Many\nfactors besides monetary policy affect these variables. In any particular data release, it’s\ndevilishly hard to separate the contribution of monetary policy from other factors.\nTo control for these other factors, a researcher must use a macroeconomic model. In\nsome of my own research with staff at the Federal Reserve Board, we used the Board’s large-\nscale macroeconomic model, which has hundreds of economic relationships built in, for this\npurpose.19 We estimated that the Fed’s $600 billion QE2 program lowered the unemployment\nrate by about 0.3 percentage point compared with what it would have been without the program.\nWe also estimated that the program raised GDP by a little over half a percentage point and\ninflation by 0.2 percentage point. When we considered the combined effects of QE1 and QE2,\nwe found that these programs had a peak effect of reducing the unemployment rate by 1½\n18 See Neely (2011).\n19 See Chung et al. (2012).\n9\n\npercentage points. In addition, we found that these programs probably prevented the U.S.\neconomy from falling into deflation.\nOther researchers using different macroeconomic models have found roughly similar\neffects, although there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding these estimates.20 Part of the\nuncertainty stems from the fact that changes in longer-term interest rates due to LSAPs may be\natypical. That is, they may affect the economy differently than do changes in longer-term\ninterest rates in normal times. That would make the past relationship between longer-term\ninterest rates and the economy less informative for estimating the effects of unconventional\nmonetary policy.\nRisks and Uncertainty\nAlthough the evidence shows that the Fed’s unconventional policy actions have been\neffective at lowering interest rates and stimulating economic growth, it’s also clear that there\nremains a great deal of uncertainty about the effects of these policies. After decades of using the\nfed funds rate as the main tool of monetary policy, Fed policymakers have plenty of confidence\nin this instrument. We know it works and we’re pretty good at estimating how much it works.\nBy contrast, with unconventional monetary policies, we’re in waters that have not been\nextensively charted. We don’t know all the consequences. There is uncertainty about the\nmagnitude of the effects on the economy, as I’ve already discussed. In addition, there is a\nconcern that these policies carry with them risks of unintended negative consequences. Let me\ngo over a few of those concerns.\n20 See Chen, Curdia, and Ferrero (2012), Kiley (2012), Fuhrer and Olivei (2011), Baumeister and Benati (2010), and\nCurdia and Ferrero (2011).\n10\n\nOne concern is that the Fed’s very low rate policies may be building up inflationary\npressures that we can’t yet see.21 Of course, this risk is not peculiar to unconventional policies.\nIt exists whenever monetary policy is very expansionary. Although this is a risk, it’s important\nto note in the current context that inflation has been very low during this period of\nunconventional policies, and it remains so. Moreover, the public’s inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored. So, we are not seeing signs of rising inflation on the horizon. Japan’s experience\nwith unconventional policies is informative as well. Japan has had undesirably low inflation\nsince the 1990s despite the Bank of Japan’s very large quantitative easing programs.\nNonetheless, whenever a stimulatory monetary policy is in place, there is always a risk of\ninflation rising too high. Let me emphasize that the Fed has the tools to combat such a threat if it\nwere to materialize. We can raise interest rates, slowing economic growth. And we can reverse\nthe asset purchase programs, selling assets back into the market if needed.\nA second concern is that these policies may be contributing to excessive risk-taking in\nfinancial markets as investors seek higher yields in the low-rate environment. I take this concern\nseriously. We monitor indicators of financial market conditions very closely, looking for signs\nof imbalances or excesses. In addition, in our role as bank supervisors, we carefully watch for\nsigns of inappropriate risk-taking. We are always on the lookout for indications that the low-rate\nenvironment is creating dangers for the banking system. That said, as of today, most indications\nstill point to an environment of heightened risk aversion rather than reckless risk-taking in our\nfinancial system. Memories of 2008 are simply too close for most financial market participants\nto go out on a limb. If that situation were to change significantly, we could modify our\nunconventional policies to mitigate undesired effects on risk-taking.\nI’ve highlighted the uncertain effects of unconventional policies and some concerns about\nundesired consequences of these policies. But, the presence of uncertainty does not mean that\n21 For further discussion of this topic, see Williams (2012a).\n11\n\nwe shouldn’t be using these tools. That is the point that William Brainard analyzed 45 years ago\nin his classic paper on optimal policy under uncertainty.22 The answer Brainard found was that a\npolicy tool with uncertain effects should not be discarded. However, it should be employed\nmore cautiously than policy tools that have more certain effects. This insight applies to the\ncurrent situation. The Fed has been deliberate in using its unconventional policies over the past\nfew years. We’ve carefully weighed the benefits of these policies on improving economic\ngrowth against potential risks and uncertainties.\nConclusion\nLet me offer some final thoughts. Unconventional monetary policies such as forward\nguidance and large-scale asset purchases give central banks effective instruments when the\ntraditional policy interest rate is near zero. The Fed and other central banks have been actively\nusing these policies. In the United States, these policies have had meaningful effects on longer-\nterm interest rates and other financial conditions. The precise impact on unemployment, GDP,\nand inflation is harder to determine. But the available evidence suggests they have been\neffective in stimulating growth without creating an undesirable rise in inflation. Conducting\nmonetary policy always involves striking the right balance between the benefits and risks of a\npolicy action. As the FOMC statement makes clear: “In determining the size, pace, and\ncomposition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of\nthe likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”\nThank you very much.\n22 See Brainard (1967).\n12\n\nReferences\nAdam, Klaus, and Robert M.

    "text": "RISK, RESILIENCE &\nSUSTAINABLE GROWTH:\nU.S. Monetary Policy in a Post-Recovery Era\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo\nTHE SYMPOSIUM ON ASIAN BANKING AND FINANCE\nHosted by:\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco &\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore\nSingapore\nMay 29, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nPREFACE: TRIBUTE TO TERESA CURRAN\nThank you, Ravi [Menon] … I’m delighted to have this opportunity to return to\nSingapore for this year’s Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance.\nFor those of us who have been involved with this symposium over the years, this is a\nbittersweet occasion. Many in this room had the privilege of knowing Teresa Curran,\nwhose steady hand guided this series for years. Teresa, who was the leader of the bank\nsupervision division at the San Francisco Fed, had a special passion for and interest in\nthis region of the world. The success and vibrancy of this symposium is one of her\ngreat legacies.\nTeresa passed away late last year, and I’d like to dedicate my remarks and participation\nin this conference to her.\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the past decade, this symposium has become a forum for active and substantive\ndialogue on cooperation and collaboration across the region and the Pacific. The size\nof this audience and the palpable energy in this room are a testament to its success.\nThis event and its vibrancy are also a testament to the close friendship and\ncollaboration between the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore, our co-hosts for this event.\nThe philosopher William James wrote that “our lives are like islands in the sea, or like trees\nin the forest.” He explained that while they appear separate on the surface, they are in\nfact commingled beneath the soil and through the ocean floor.1\nA century later, these words ring as true as ever before. What happens in Singapore or\nSan Francisco, or for that matter Seoul or Shanghai, is not contained by national\nborders. Rather, the impacts frequently breach the metaphorical gates that once\ndivided East from West. In an increasingly interconnected global society and\neconomy, what happens to one of us impacts all of us.\nWith that said, our economic fates are not necessarily the same. While the U.S.\neconomy, for example, is affected by what happens around the world, it is also very\ndependent on domestic developments, whether monetary, fiscal, regulatory, or from\nanother area of policy. And this is not a uniquely American phenomenon.\nBecause we are at once both independent and interdependent, dialogues such as this\nsymposium are so valuable.\nThe theme of this year’s conference is “risk and resilience” in global finance. Risk and\nresilience are also very timely topics in U.S. monetary policy.\nIn the United States, we are making monetary policy decisions against the backdrop of\nshifting economic realities. Ever since the financial crisis took hold, our focus had\nbeen on the question of “how to attain a sustainable recovery?” Today, after a long, hard\nroad, we’re finally able to ask ourselves “how do we sustain the recovery that we’ve worked so\nhard to attain?”\n1 “Perception and Reality,” in William James Essays and Lectures, ed. Richard Kamber. New York: Routledge, pp.\n155-156.\n2\n\nRecognizing that the decisions we make will have global ramifications, I thought I’d\nfocus the balance of my remarks today on the approaches we’re taking in the U.S. as\nwe make monetary policy decisions in this new “post-recovery” era.\nBefore I go any further, I should mention that the views expressed today are mine\nalone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nTHE U.S. ECONOMY HAS RECOVERED\nAs President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, I lead the\nlargest of 12 regional banks, which covers about one-fifth of our nation’s population\nand economy. Among my responsibilities, I bring the perspectives of my region to\nthe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC – the Federal Reserve’s monetary\npolicy committee.\nThe Fed has what we call a “dual mandate” – two big, overarching goals. These goals\nare maximum employment and price stability. We want everyone who wants a job to\nbe able to find one and for inflation to average 2 percent per year.\nI once had a T-shirt printed up that reminded folks that the decisions we make at the\nFed are “data-driven.” Although we live in a hyper-political era, the Fed is strictly a-\npolitical. Our independence from short-term political influence is, in fact, the most\nimportant feature of our design.2\nWhen you look at how the data relate to those two big goals I mentioned – maximum\nemployment and price stability – they paint a very clear picture: The U.S. economy\nhas fully recovered from the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession. In fact,\nthe U.S. economy is about as close to the Fed’s dual mandate goals as we’ve ever\nbeen.\nWhen it comes to employment, economists generally view the natural rate of\nunemployment in the U.S. – by this I mean the level consistent with an economy that\nis running neither too hot nor too cold – as somewhere in between 4¾ percent and 5\npercent.\nToday, the U.S. unemployment rate is 4.4 percent -- meaning that we’ve reached and\neven exceeded the full employment mark.\n2 Williams (2017).\n3\n\nMeanwhile, although inflation has been running somewhat below the Fed’s goal of 2\npercent, with the economy doing well and some of the factors that have held inflation\ndown waning, I expect we’ll reach that goal by next year.\nRISK\nNow, I’d love to be able to tell you that the news is all rosy and that our work here is\ndone. Unfortunately, they don't call economics \"the dismal science\" for nothing. I'm\ncompelled to consider what potholes may be dotting the road ahead.\nFor starters, movement below the natural rate of unemployment carries with it the\nrisk of the economy overheating, which could undermine the sustainability of the\nexpansion.\nWhen you’re docking a boat, you don’t run it in fast towards shore and hope you can\nreverse the engine hard later on. That looks cool in a James Bond movie, but in the\nreal world it relies on everything going perfectly and can easily run afoul. Instead, the\ncardinal rule of docking is: Never approach a dock any faster than you’re willing to hit\nit. Similarly, in achieving sustainable growth, it is better to close in on the target\ncarefully and avoid substantial overshooting.\nRESILIENCY\nWith the attainment of our dual mandate goals close at hand, it’s more important than\never for monetary policy to work toward what I like to call a “Goldilocks economy” –\nan economy that doesn’t run too hot or too cold.3 We want the porridge to be just\nright.\nOur aim is to keep the economic expansion on a sound footing that can be sustained\nfor as long as possible. The last thing any of us want is to undermine the hard-won\ngains we’ve made since the dark days of the recession.\nAs it stands today, interest rates remain near historical lows, and I’m sometimes asked\nwhy we don’t just keep things there. After all, if things are going well, why change?\nThe answer is that gradually raising interest rates to bring monetary policy back to\nnormal prevents our economy from overheating and thereby reduces the risk of a\nfuture economic correction.\n3 Williams (2017).\n4\n\nNow, I know there has been some general concern that as we normalize our monetary\npolicy in the U.S. it could cause market turbulence internationally. I’m familiar with\nthe adage that when the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold.\nWhile my own primary focus as a U.S. policymaker is on what’s best for our domestic\neconomy, I want to reassure you that we are cognizant of the fact that our domestic\nactions have a global impact.\nIf you remember nothing else I’ve shared with you today, I hope you’ll remember this:\nThe last thing we want to do is to fuel unnecessary or avoidable volatility or\ndisruption – whether we’re talking about domestic markets or international markets.\nThat’s why we’re taking a gradual approach to normalization and why we’re being\nvery clear, transparent, and open about how we’re making decisions. In fact, this is\nthe most telegraphed monetary policy of our lifetimes.\nI’d also argue that in an interconnected global economy, when one country takes\naction to make its economy more sustainable and resilient, that adds to the\nsustainability and resilience of the global economy in turn.\nUNWINDING THE BALANCE SHEET\nMy focus to this point has been on conventional monetary policy, and I want to close\nby saying a few words about how we plan to unwind the unconventional strategies we\nadopted during the recession and recovery. If our approach on this front sounds\nfamiliar, it’s by design. That’s because a gradual, predictable, and clearly\ncommunicated strategy is the right way to operate, whether we’re talking about\nnormalizing interest rates or our balance sheet.\nFor those who might not be as familiar with the unconventional strategies we adopted\nduring the recession, let me offer some very, very brief background: In ordinary times,\nthe Fed focuses on affecting interest rates by setting the federal funds rate. Yet, the\nperiod since the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007 through 2009 has been\nextraordinary … and that’s an understatement.\nTo save the U.S. economy from deeper recession and accelerate the economic\nrecovery, we purchased trillions of dollars of long-term Treasury and mortgage-\nbacked securities. These actions helped the economy achieve the relatively healthy\nstate that it’s in today.4 After making these purchases, we significantly increased the\n4 Williams (2014) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).\n5\n\nsize of the Fed’s holdings. Right now the Fed’s balance sheet is around $4.5 trillion\nand we are currently keeping it at that level.\nAs I alluded to a moment ago, we’re committed to slowly shrinking the balance sheet\nwith the same sort of widely telegraphed, gradual, and – frankly – boring modus\noperandi that we’ve adopted for normalizing conventional monetary policy. This will\noccur “organically” over time, as securities mature or are paid off. The more public\nunderstanding there is, the lesser the risk of market disruption and volatility.\nThe process will begin when we’re further along the path of normalizing the level of\nthe federal funds rate.5 Based on my forecast, this will occur sometime later this year.6\nOf course, none of us have a crystal ball. If there were to be some sort of\ndeteriorating of the economic outlook, or another unforeseen circumstance, this\ntimetable would, of course, have to be altered.\nIt’s worth noting that I view balance sheet management as something that will be\ntaking place in the background – by that I mean that we will continue to use\nconventional monetary policy tools – raising and/or lowering interest rates – as the\nlever we operate to keep the economy from overheating or running too cold.\nCONCLUSION\nAt the end of the day, the success of all these strategies depends on public\nunderstanding.\nThat’s why dialogues such as the ones we’re having at this symposium are so\nimportant – whether our focus is monetary policy, financial regulation, or fintech.\nUltimately, while the specific conditions in each of our countries may be different, the\ndecisions we make on either side of the Pacific do not stop at our shores.\nSo thank you all for being a part of these discussions. I look forward to hearing from\nyou throughout the symposium.\n5 Board of Governors (2017).\n6 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2017) for discussion of normalization of the balance sheet\nunder different scenarios.\n6\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017. “Minutes of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, March 14–15, 2017.”\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20170315.htm\nEngen, Eric M., Thomas T.

    "text": "Presentation to Community Leaders, Portland, OR\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on December 2, 2015\nDancing Days Are Here Again: The Long Road Back to Maximum Employment\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nIt’s that time of year again, a time when all Americans, regardless of faith or origin,\nparticipate in a holiday ritual. I’m talking, of course, about the year in review. So in the spirit of\nthe season, I’d like to take a look back over the past year for the economy and monetary policy,\nto where we find ourselves today, and where I see us headed.\nAs usual, I’ll add the disclaimer that my remarks today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe economic snapshot\nThe headline is that we’re now in the seventh year of the expansion and the economy still\nhas a good head of steam. Consumer spending continues to increase at a solid pace, auto sales\nshould come in at their highest since the early 2000s, and strong fundamentals point to continued\nstrength going forward.\nThere are some upside risks to the outlook, specifically an even stronger and faster\nrebound in housing. And there are, of course, downside risks: the threat of slowdowns and\nspillovers from abroad, or the dollar appreciating further.\nAnd then there are the big issues. The Fed is charged with maximum employment and\nprice stability. Looking over our dual mandate, how have we fared?\nEmployment\nOn the employment side, things are going very well.\n1\n\nWe’re on pace to add about 2½ million jobs this year, and we’ve met one marker on the\nunemployment rate. Because unemployment will never be zero—in any healthy economy, there\nwill be turnover, with people leaving jobs and new people entering the workforce—economists\nuse something called the “natural rate” of unemployment. Broadly, it’s the optimal rate in a fully\nfunctioning economy. I put the natural rate at 5 percent, and we’ve already reached that\nthreshold. I expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down, falling below 5 percent\neither this year or next and stay there until 2017.\nOf course, the unemployment rate alone doesn’t tell the whole story. There are other\nfactors and measures that reflect the complexities of the American workforce and how people\nhave fared in the aftermath of the recession.\nMost discussed—and for many, the most worrisome—is the labor force participation rate,\nwhich is still significantly lower than it has been in the past. On the surface, this can appear\nalarming. But digging deeper it is, by and large, explicable and relatively benign.\nAs a primer: The “labor force” is made up of people who are either employed or\nunemployed but actively looking for work. The labor force participation rate divides that group\nby the total working-age population—that is, everyone over the age of 16. It’s a very basic ratio\nthat’s affected by myriad factors. In the ’60s and ’70s, for instance, women entered the\nworkforce in greater numbers and the labor force participation rate shot up.\nSince the start of the recession, the participation rate has come down substantially. Some\npeople are concerned that this is indicative of a portion of society that was hit hard by the\nrecession and sidelined in the recovery—people who want to work but have given up looking,\neither out of pessimism over the job market or fear that an extended time out of work has\nrendered them fundamentally unemployable.\n2\n\nBut much of the decline in the labor force participation rate can be explained not by\ndisheartened workers, but by demographic and social shifts.1\nFirst is the aging of the population. The baby boomers are entering retirement and people\nare living longer. Remember, the participation rate counts everyone over 16, so my happily\nretired parents count as “out of the labor force,” even though, in their 80s, few people would still\nbe working. Second is that younger people aren’t working as much as they used to. But this is\npartly because many have extended their education or gone back to school, and fewer are\nworking when they’re there. Third is an increase in people deciding they’d rather have single-\nincome families.2 For whatever reason, they’ve traded a second paycheck for spending more\ntime at home, whether it’s for child care, leisure, or simply that it’s a better lifestyle fit. Each of\nthese groups is made up of people who are not working, but doing so for personal or\ndemographic reasons. As their numbers swell, it will, obviously, push the participation rate\ndown.\nAs for the area of concern, we’re emerging from the deepest, longest recession since the\nGreat Depression. And it’s true that a lot of people did give up looking for work. A key indicator\nis the somewhat unfairly named “prime-age males” cohort, who are 25–54. This group has\nhistorically been a constant in the American workforce, but in the wake of the recession, its\nparticipation fell sharply. However, as the labor market has improved, that number has largely\nstabilized over the past two years, as has the overall participation rate.\nThe last factor to consider is whether there are people who will reenter the labor force\nand pull the participation rate back up. The “marginally attached” for instance, a group made up\nof people who are ready and able to work and who’ve searched for jobs in the past year but who\n1 See, for example, Fujita (2014).\n2 See the Bureau of Labor Statistics news releases, “Employment Characteristics of Families” (archived at\nhttp://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/all_nr.htm#FAMEE).\n3\n\naren’t currently looking. The assumption would reasonably be that this group is poised to return\nto the labor force. First off, these numbers have come down a lot, falling by over 12 percent in\nthe past year alone. In addition, my staff has found that, over the past few years, their reentry rate\nback into the labor force has actually fallen. When you combine this with the aging workforce, it\nlooks unlikely that participation will rise. This is supported by other research from both within\nand outside the Fed System.3 Overall, the evidence suggests that, even with a quite strong\neconomy, we won’t see a significant number of people come back into the fold.\nI know this has been a tough journey for a lot of people, and many are still struggling.\nBut putting the recovery in perspective, we’ve come a very long way and we should be heartened\nby the progress. Since the dark days of late 2009, we’ve added 13 million jobs. More than 3\nmillion of those came last year, and most of those were full time.\nLooking forward, I see a labor market that’s growing ever stronger and will reach\nmaximum employment on a broad set of measures later this year or early next year.\nInflation\nThe inflation side of the equation is where the winds are blowing colder than I’d like. For\nthose of us who lived through the ’70s and ’80s, the need for higher inflation seems anathema to\na healthy economy, but that’s where we are right now. Inflation is like wine—a little bit is\nactually good for you. And right now our glass isn’t full enough. The Fed’s target rate is 2\npercent, and inflation has been obstinately below that for 3½ years now. Over the past year, it’s\nbeen stuck at a little above zero.\nThere are reasons for the depressed level of inflation, in particular the rise in the dollar\nand the fall in oil prices. Those effects should peter out, but they’ve had a downward influence\non inflation at a time we’ve needed it to rise. Another special factor is that health-care prices\n3 See Krueger (2015) and Stephanie Aaronson et al. (2014).\n4\n\nhave been rising much more slowly than we’re used to and that’s pushing down the inflation rate\nas well. This is in part due to legislation that holds down payments to hospitals and other\nproviders. These effects may prove to be transitory as well.\nI know that people don’t always feel the reality of inflation being too low. The average\nperson in a supermarket checkout line probably doesn’t. People often ask if Fed officials eat or\ndrive, because we favor inflation measures that strip out food and energy. For the average\nhousehold, those are obviously important. But for formulating monetary policy and analyzing\ndata, policymakers need to look at underlying trends. That’s why I look at measures that remove\nthe volatile components, like the trimmed mean rate that the Dallas Fed came up with.4 By that\nmeasure, we’re not as far from our goal as it first appears. The trimmed mean puts the underlying\ninflation rate for the past year at 1.7 percent—still below our 2 percent target, but not by much.\nLooking ahead, as the effects of the dollar and oil prices ebb, and as the economy\nstrengthens further, I see inflation moving back up to our 2 percent target within the next two\nyears.\nMonetary policy normalization\nWith real progress on our goals, the conversation has turned to normalizing policy. That\nis, raising interest rates. There are a number of opinions out there, many of which wind up in my\ninbox…. From my perspective, the song remains the same: We’ve made remarkable progress\nand the economy is on the cusp of full health. The first step in bringing policy closer to normal\nwas when we ended QE. The next appropriate step is to raise rates. My preference is sooner\nrather than later for a few reasons.\n4 See http://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce/.\n5\n\nFirst, Milton Friedman famously taught us that monetary policy has long and variable\nlags.5 Research shows it takes at least a year or two for it to have its full effect.6 So the decisions\nwe make today must take aim at where we’re going, not where we are. The economy is a moving\ntarget, and waiting until we see the whites of inflation’s eyes risks overshooting the mark.\nSecond, experience shows that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate\nimbalances, ultimately leading to either excessive inflation or an economic correction and\nrecession. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was runaway inflation. In the late 1990s, the expansion\nbecame increasingly fueled by euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. And in the first half of the 2000s, irrational\nexuberance over housing sent prices spiraling far beyond fundamentals and led to massive\noverbuilding. If we wait too long to remove monetary accommodation, we hazard allowing these\nimbalances to grow, at great cost to our economy.\nFinally, an earlier start to raising rates would allow a smoother, more gradual process of\nnormalization. This gives us space to fine-tune our responses to any surprise changes in\neconomic conditions. If we wait too long to raise rates, the need to play catch-up wouldn’t leave\nmuch room for maneuver. Not to mention, it could roil financial markets and slow the economy\nin unintended ways.\nMy preference for a more gradual process also reflects that the economy, for all its\nprogress, still needs some accommodation. We don’t need the extraordinarily accommodative\npolicy that has characterized the past several years, but the headwinds we’re facing—the risks\nfrom abroad, for instance, and their impact on the dollar—call for a continued push. Not with a\nbulldozer, but a steady nudge.\n5 Friedman (1961).\n6 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n6\n\nThat brings me to another point. Monetary policy has played a crucial role in getting us\nback on track.7 We’re heading towards an economy that’s near full strength—we’re not quite\nacross the finish line, but it’s definitely in sight. As we head towards it, it’s important to\nrecognize what monetary policy can and can’t do—not to mention what it should and shouldn’t.\nThe job of monetary policy is to get the economy to full strength with 2 percent inflation\nand keep it there, using the tools available to us. That’s a relatively limited kit and is restricted\nlargely to money in the system and the rates at which it is lent. How the economy develops and\nperforms in the long run depends on a host of other factors that are outside our purview.\nWhat comes next is addressing long-run trends in productivity and the quality of the labor\nforce, and those are determined by the investments we make in technology and education, by tax\npolicies and long-term fiscal decisions.8 That’s what’s going to shape the economy over the next\ndecade, and that conversation extends far beyond the Federal Open Market Committee meeting\nroom.\nNew normal\nAs that decade begins to unfold, we should be aware of what economic strength will look\nlike. Some might ask, if accommodative policy helps the economy so much, why don’t we just\nkeep rates low forever? The answer is that it’s not economically healthy and it’s not sustainable.\nThe Fed can’t deliver, say, 4 percent growth for the next 10 years just because of easy monetary\npolicy. We have to operate within the established economic environment and foster growth\nwithin those parameters.\nIt’s not surprising that the pace of employment growth and the decline in the\nunemployment rate have slowed a bit this year relative to last. When unemployment was at its 10\n7 Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n8 See Fernald and Jones (2015) regarding technology and education.\n7\n\npercent peak, and as it struggled to come down during the recovery, we needed rapid declines to\nget the economy back on track. Now that we’re getting closer, the pace has to start slowing. In\nfact, once the economy is operating at full strength, we’re only going to need between 60,000\nand 100,000 new jobs a month to keep up with the growing labor force.9 And as the next year\nunfolds, we want to see a steady pace of economic growth at around 2 percent. Commentators\nmay call this disappointing, and it was when we were climbing out of the hole the recession left.\nBut in a healthy economy, it’s what strong, steady growth looks like. As I said, running too hot\nfor too long has serious risks.\nConclusion\nAll in all, things are looking good. We’ve come a long way since the worst of the\nrecession and made significant progress this year. Going forward, I expect things to continue on\nthis positive trajectory.\nThis is my last public speech of the year, and I’m very pleased to be doing it in Portland\nwith you all. So I’d like to extend my thanks to you; I’m much obliged for such a pleasant stay.\n9 Daniel Aaronson et al.

    "text": "Presentation to the Sacramento Economic Forum, Sacramento, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 13, 2016\nNow That Winter Is Over, Springtime Is on My Mind\nIt’s a special pleasure to be back home in Sacramento. I grew up here and my family has\ndeep Sacramento roots. It’s also great to be here this time of year when the weather is just right; I\nwon’t lie, I don’t miss the hottest days of July and August.\nToday I’ll give an overview of the economy, about where we are and where we’re\nheaded, and address some of the issues that have been getting a lot of attention lately, namely the\nweak reading of GDP growth in the first quarter and very low productivity growth. Before I go\nany further, I should pause to note, as always, that the views I express here today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nEmployment\nWith that out of the way, I’ll turn first to our employment mandate. And here, a lot of\npeople do share my view that the labor market is looking very good. There are a multitude of\nindicators I look at, and pretty much all of them say we’re at or very near full strength.\nUnemployment has reached what I see as its natural rate—that’s the optimal rate we should\nexpect in a healthy economy—at 5 percent. I see it dipping even further below that benchmark as\nthe year unfolds. Job openings is another data point, as is the rate at which people are quitting.\nThat may seem odd as an indicator, but the willingness of workers to leave their jobs is actually a\ngood way to gauge people’s perceptions of the job market. Another is the difficulty companies\nare facing in hiring—with a strong labor market, there are more jobs available, and businesses\nhave to compete for talent. Even one area that has caused some concern, the declining labor force\n1\n\nparticipation rate, is now close to its longer-term trend.1\nInflation\nTurning to the other side of our mandate, inflation has been persistently below the Fed’s\n2 percent target over the past several years. Recently, that’s been due to transitory forces, for\ninstance, the strengthening dollar and falling energy prices. But those effects have been\ndissipating. To cut through some of the noise, it’s useful to look at measures of inflation that\nstrip out volatile prices and provide a clearer view of the underlying trend. One such measure is\ncore PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. It rose 1.6 percent over the past 12\nmonths. Another such measure is the trimmed mean, which rose 1.8 percent over the past year.\nEither way you look at it, inflation has been moving back up to our goal. With the economy\ncontinuing to improve and special factors holding inflation down diminishing, I see inflation\nrising to meet our 2 percent goal in the next two years.\nGDP and seasonality\nAs for gross domestic product, or GDP, I expect growth to be 2 percent this year. This is\nthe time of year when we look back at first-quarter growth and get worried about how low it was.\nIt’s also the time of year that economists start talking about “residual seasonality”—that is, they\npoint out the recurring pattern of slow GDP growth in the first quarter over the past several years\nand reassess the reasons for this anomaly. The takeaway from this analysis is that first-quarter\nGDP data tend to paint an overly negative picture and aren’t the best way to assess the\neconomy’s underlying momentum.2\nAlthough the published data should account for usual seasonal patterns, for myriad\nwonky reasons that would take too much time—and too much of your patience—to explain, they\n1 Aaronson et al. (2014).\n2 Rudebusch, Wilson, and Mahedy (2015) and Rudebusch, Wilson, and Pyle (2015).\n2\n\ndon’t. To correct for this problem, my staff has added a second round of adjustment to get a more\naccurate number. Adjusted in this way, real GDP actually grew over 2 percent in the first quarter.\nThis makes more sense when we look at the rest of the economy—such as the labor market—and\nis in line with what I’m hearing from the business community, that they didn’t see significant\ndrop-offs at the beginning of the year.\nProductivity\nTurning to an issue that’s been getting a lot of attention: Productivity growth has been\nexceptionally weak over the past five years, which has caused some concern and some\nconfusion. We’re seeing an otherwise healthy economic expansion that makes the U.S. virtually\nunique among advanced economies, and we’re running a labor market that’s flashing green on\njust about every measure. So why is productivity growth so low?\nProductivity is a notoriously tricky thing to measure, so one oft-repeated question is\nwhether all areas of the economy are being accurately assessed—for instance, the tech world.\nAre we using outdated models to try to assess the next-generation engine of growth? The short\nanswer is “no.” A recent study shows that mismeasurement of innovation does not account for\nthe slowdown in productivity growth in any meaningful way.3\nIn that case, what is going on? Productivity is the simple measure of output per unit of\ninput. That is, how much work did it take to produce a unit of a particular good or service? In the\npast, great spurts of productivity have resulted from game-changing innovation like the steam\nengine, electricity, or the advent of the modern production line. The last instance was the first\ntech boom, which ushered in a decade of strong productivity growth starting in the mid-1990s.4 I\nknow the recent productivity slowdown seems confusing when we’re sitting near the “Tech\n3 Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).\n4 See Gordon (2016) for historical discussion of U.S. productivity growth.\n3\n\nCoast”; in Silicon Valley, it feels like the possibilities are endless and the world is changing at an\never-faster rate.\nSo why aren’t we seeing another productivity boom? The difference between now and\nthe last tech boom is that, in the mid-1990s, businesses throughout the economy used those new\ntechnologies to change how and what they produced. They became much more efficient and\nspread their reach. In the more recent tech boom, a lot of the innovation and new products are\ndirected at our leisure time, which may enrich our lives, but doesn’t have the same\ngroundbreaking effect on how businesses operate.\nOf course, there may be a revolutionary invention or technology just around the corner.\nHistory has shown that we fail spectacularly to predict when we’ll next turn it up to 11. But in\nthe meantime, it’s more likely than not that slow growth is both real and here to stay. And while\nthe days of 2½ to 3 percent growth are behind us, at least for the foreseeable future, it isn’t the\nend of the world. We can still run a strong economy. GDP grew at 2 percent last year, we added\n2¾ million jobs, and I forecast a 2016 that looks a lot like 2015, with continued employment\ngains, steady GDP growth, and progress on our inflation goal.\nMonetary policy\nSo what does all this mean for monetary policy?\nThe Fed’s monetary policy committee, the FOMC, has indicated that we expect to raise\nrates gradually, and we have made that abundantly clear in our communications. We took the\nfirst small step with a modest rate hike in December, and the future pace will be, as we’ve said\nrepeatedly, gradual and data dependent. We don’t want to be the guests who stayed too long, but\nwe don’t want to jump off a cliff either.\n4\n\nOne other issue that has been getting some attention is what we’re planning on doing\nwith our sizable balance sheet, which swelled to some $4 trillion after three rounds of\nquantitative easing. We have a ways to go before we start to unwind it, and it won’t happen until\nnormalization of the funds rate is well under way. After that, our plan is to shrink the balance\nsheet “organically,” if you will, through the maturation of the assets. It’s going to take at least six\nyears to get the balance sheet back to normal, which is in keeping with the overall approach of\nremoving accommodation gradually.5\nWhat’s important about this, and what’s music to the ears, is that this is essentially the\nmove back to normal. Monetary policy is going back to the boring basics.\nSources of growth\nThat brings me to a central point, which is to recognize what monetary policy can and\ncan’t do. Our job is to keep the economy on track, and meet our employment and inflation goals.\nAnd we have a limited tool kit to do that. People shouldn’t confuse monetary with fiscal or other\npolicy.\nThere are ways to spark growth and innovation. But it will require investments in\neducation, training, safer neighborhoods, infrastructure—the things we need to build human\ncapital. We can’t do this using monetary policy. They are issues that must be met at the local,\nstate, and federal level, and are fundamentally in the legislative realm.\nWhile all the labor market indicators look good on a macro level, I know it’s not the same\nfor everyone. The euphoria in San Francisco generally exits the freeway before it makes it out to\nHighway 99 in the Central Valley. Some places continue to struggle, because there are structural\nor long-term problems that can’t be fixed by interest rates. They were there before the recession\n5 Carpenter et al. (2015).\n5\n\nand they’re still there today.\nLikewise, if productivity is waiting for the next great invention, we need to invest in the\neducation of the next generation of innovators. If we want a population that continues to see its\nprospects and paychecks rise, we need to be sure they have access to high quality schooling.\nI can’t speak for legislators, and I harbor a fantasy that if I don’t tell elected officials how\nto do their jobs they won’t weigh in on mine. But I do know the data, and they say that investing\nin early childhood and going to college have very high returns.\nResearch shows a direct correlation between the quality of a child’s neighborhood and\nincome later in life.6 And if you remember just one number, make it this: 300,000. That’s how\nmuch more a kid who’s moved from public housing into a lower-poverty area can expect to\nmake in a lifetime.7\nAs for the benefits of getting a college degree, we know that there’s an average annual\nincome gap of about $58,000 between households with two college-educated earners and those\nwith two high school educated earners.8 A college education has returns more than twice that of\nstocks and about five times more than bonds.9 And while it is a long-term investment, the\naverage breakeven period is around 10 years.10\nCollege has a direct link to economic mobility. If you’re in the lower 80 percent of the\nearnings distribution, a college degree gives you about a 30 to 40 percent chance of reaching the\ntop 20 percent. But without one…. The bottom quintile on the earnings scale has less than a 5\npercent chance of winding up in the top quintile without a college degree.11\n6 Chetty and Hendren (2015).\n7 Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2016).\n8 Autor (2014).\n9 Abel and Deitz (2014).\n10 Daly and Cao (2015).\n11 Daly and Cao (2015).\n6\n\nLike I said, I’m not an elected official, just a guy who likes data. But the data are\nconvincing.\nConclusion\nIn any event, from the perspective of a monetary policymaker, we’ve been on a long road\nback from the recession. There are always uncertainties and numerous challenges before us, but\noverall, things are definitely looking good.

    "text": "Monetary Policy and the Economic\nOutlook: A Fine Balancing Act\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nAt the\n54th Annual Economic Forecast Luncheon\nPhoenix, Arizona\nNovember 29, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nLadies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed your lunch. It’s my pleasure to speak at the\n54th Annual Economic Forecast Luncheon. This is my third visit to Phoenix this year\nand it’s a huge relief to be back outside of the summer months! I’m also particularly\npleased that you’ve asked me to speak about the U.S. economy at a time when it’s in\nsuch good shape. We’re in the midst of a lengthy economic expansion, the stock\nmarket is at record levels, and confidence is soaring.\nPage 1 of 7\n\nToday I’m going to talk about current conditions in relation to growth and\nemployment, and I’m going to shed some light on the number one topic of the day\nfor U.S. monetary policy: the fact that inflation remains stubbornly low despite a\nstrong economy. I’m then going to give my perspective as a policymaker and explain\nwhat that means for how I approach my work at the Federal Reserve Bank in San\nFrancisco and at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.\nWhen people think about the Fed, they tend to think about us as getting up in the\nmorning and setting interest rates. But what many people don’t realize is we do that\nwithin a specific framework and we’re guided by a long-term strategy.1\nThe Federal Reserve System has two goals, both set by Congress: maximum\nemployment and price stability. We lay out our strategy for achieving these goals in\nregular statements. At the moment, we’re in particularly interesting times because\nthere’s a certain tension between our two primary objectives: It’s a balancing act\nmanaging a growing economy with very low inflation.\nAnd that’s something I’m going to go into detail on: How policymakers deal with the\npleasant challenge of a strong economy and minimal inflation.\nBefore I go any further, I think it’s wise I give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views\nI express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nSo, what is the current state of the economy? I’m going to take growth, employment,\nand inflation each in turn.\nDespite the terrible human tragedy caused by recent hurricanes in the Southeast and\nthe wildfires in my home state of California, the economic expansion remains on\ntrack. I see the economy continuing on a moderate growth path over the next few\nyears. Our overall measure of the economy, gross domestic product or GDP for\nshort, grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, and I forecast growth\n1 Board of Governors (2017).\nPage 2 of 7\n\nwill average 2.5 percent for 2017, before slowing back down toward its trend pace\nover the next few years.2\nMy role as a policymaker is to keep this expansion going for as long as possible, and\nthat means maintaining a sustainable pace of growth consistent with labor force and\nproductivity growth.\nIf you weren’t overly impressed with my GDP figures, you should be blown away\nwith the unemployment rate, which stands a touch above 4 percent. We’ve not only\nachieved our maximum employment goal, we’ve exceeded it. It may sound strange to\nsay that we can exceed full employment when four out of every hundred potential\nworkers is unemployed. But the way economists think about unemployment is that,\neven in a very strong economy, there will always be a certain number of people who\nare either between jobs or who have recently joined the labor market. Although we’ll\nnever reach an unemployment rate of zero, a rate in the 4 percent range is clearly a\nsign of a very strong labor market.\nWe’re on track to add 2 million jobs to the economy this year and with continued\nstrong momentum in the labor market, I expect the unemployment rate to continue\nto drift downward, bottoming out at around 3¾ percent next year.\nAs I said earlier, one of the Fed’s two monetary policy goals is maximum\nemployment, so our report card’s looking very good on that front.\nThe other goal is price stability, and this is where we’ve faced some challenges. The\ninflation goal we’ve set for ourselves is 2 percent, but over the past few years it’s\nremained stubbornly below that and currently stands at 1.6 percent. Now, let’s be\nhonest: Most Americans are very happy with the status quo. They have no desire to\nsee prices rise rapidly and neither do I.\nIn fact, there’s something called the misery index, which is a combination of inflation\nand unemployment. The higher that number, the more miserable people tend to be.\nThe misery index has been running at 6½ percent so far this year. For context, in\n2011 when we were dealing with the fallout of the crisis it was around double that\nfigure and in 1980, if you can remember those dark days, it reached an all-time peak of\n2 Third quarter growth is based on the initial estimate. The text of this speech was finalized prior to the release of the\nrevised estimate on November 29.\nPage 3 of 7\n\nover 20 percent. The average American should be far from “miserable” about the\ncurrent state of the economy.\nBut for policy wonks and economists, low inflation against a backdrop of such strong\nemployment numbers seems a bit surprising. The newspapers would have you believe\nthat it’s a mystery of Sherlock Holmes proportions. However, at the Fed in San\nFrancisco we’ve done some good old-fashioned detective work and we’re fairly sure\nwe have a handle on why it’s so low.3\nMy staff found that inflation rates for prices that tend to move up and down with the\neconomy have recovered. But inflation for things that tend to be less sensitive to the\neconomy have fallen or remained low. This includes price drops for pharmaceuticals,\nairline tickets, cell phones, and education. For example, Verizon and AT&T were in a\nprice war for much of the early part of this year, which pushed down the cost of your\nphone bill.\nAn even bigger contribution to low inflation has come from the health-care sector,\nwhere mandated cuts to Medicare payment growth have muted price rises in overall\nhealth-care services.\nOn top of the lack of price rises in these categories, there tends to be a delay in the\neffect of a strong labor market on prices. It typically takes about 12 months for a shift\nin the economy to have its full effect on inflation. With the economy doing so well\nthis year and based on the historical pattern, I expect to see a rise in inflation in 2018.\nIn this regard, it’s important to remember that things like salaries and contracts tend\nto be negotiated on an annual basis, so it often takes a while for wages and prices to\nrespond to the tightening labor market.\nSo, the next time you see a headline about stubbornly low inflation, you can smile to\nyourself, knowing that the mystery isn’t all that mysterious after all.\nMonetary policy\nNow that I’ve given you a deep dive into growth, employment, and inflation, I’m\n3 Mahedy and Shapiro (2017).\nPage 4 of 7\n\ngoing to discuss what that means for how I think about monetary policy and interest\nrates.\nThe challenge for policymakers is that at present our two goals, maximum\nemployment and price stability, are somewhat in conflict with one another. As I’ve\nexplained, with such strong employment numbers we would normally expect to start\nseeing inflationary pressures building. But the unusually low prices of certain goods\nand services, combined with the lagged effects of the economy on inflation, means we\nhave this unexpected situation where we’re acing one goal, while struggling with the\nother.\nThe usual remedy for undesirably low inflation is to keep interest rates low. But to\nadd to the complexity of the situation, the Federal Reserve is in the process of what\nwe call “normalizing” monetary policy.\nIn practice this means slowly stepping back from the extraordinary support the Fed\nprovided for the economy during the recession and thereafter. We are in the process\nof gradually raising interest rates and reducing the holdings of long-term assets on our\nbalance sheet. Sometimes I get asked why we even need to normalize policy, when\nmonetary stimulus had such a positive effect. Why not keep interest rates low, in the\nhopes of giving the economy a further boost?\nBut the reality is that, if we don’t move interest rates back up to more normal levels,\nwe risk undermining the sustainability of the expansion and creating conditions that\ncould lead to a recession down the road.\nAs long as the data continue to show steady growth and we see the uptick in inflation\nthat we’re expecting, my own view is that we should continue to raise interest rates\nslowly over the coming year.\nI started talking about the framework and goals for the Fed and the FOMC. That our\ntwo main goals are in conflict with one another means these are challenging times for\npolicymakers. But I want to emphasize that these are the kinds of challenges we like\nto be faced with.\nIn the same way that there’s a lag between a falling unemployment rate and its effect\non inflation, the effects of the decisions taken by the FOMC next year may not be\nrealized until 2019 or even 2020. So, at the Fed we use data to guide us and help us\nPage 5 of 7\n\nwalk the tightrope between keeping the economy on an even keel and normalizing\ninterest rates. Monetary policy is both a balancing act and a long game.\nConclusion\nLadies and gentlemen, the economy is in a very good place. Unemployment is low and\nconfidence is high. While low inflation remains a challenge for someone in my\nposition, I imagine most of you aren’t overly concerned about a 1.6 percent inflation\nrate!\nAs we wrap up 2017 and look ahead to 2018, the problems we face are good ones:\nHow to keep the economic expansion going, how to bring inflation up to its 2 percent\ntarget, and how we use this period to normalize monetary policy in general and\ninterest rates in particular.\nThe years ahead will be about taking a balanced approach, and my guiding principle\nwill always be to follow the data.\nI’d like to wish you a very happy holiday season, and a healthy and prosperous new\nyear.\nPage 6 of 7\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017. “Statement on Longer-Run\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy.” Amended January 31.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.\npdf\nMahedy, Tim, and Adam Shapiro. 2017. “What’s Down with Inflation?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2017-35 (November 27). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/economic-letter/2017/november/contribution-to-low-pce-\ninflation-from-healthcare/\nPage 7 of 7",

    "text": "Presentation to UC San Diego Economic Roundtable\nSan Diego, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 3, 2013\nWill Unconventional Monetary Policy Be the New Normal?1\nThank you. It’s a real pleasure to be here in San Diego and I would like to thank the\nEconomic Roundtable for inviting me. The subject of my talk today is the unconventional\nmonetary policies pursued by the Federal Reserve over the past several years and how I see our\nresulting experiences shaping what will likely be the new normal for monetary policy in the\nfuture. I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and do not necessarily reflect\nthe views of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhy Unconventional Policy?\nI’ll begin by describing why the Federal Reserve turned to so-called unconventional\npolicies in the first place. As you will remember all too well, in late 2008 our country was facing\nthe worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression. Congress has tasked the\nFederal Reserve with maintaining maximum employment and price stability. Therefore, in\nresponse to the sharp decline in employment and inflation, the Federal Reserve’s monetary\npolicy body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, cut the federal funds rate close to\nzero. The federal funds rate is the short-term interest rate that is our main conventional monetary\npolicy tool.\nGiven the severity of the downturn, the FOMC would have liked to cut rates even further\nto provide support for the economy and avoid a damaging sustained period of price deflation.\n1 I would like to thank Eric Swanson for his assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nHowever, cutting rates further wasn’t feasible. That’s because nominal interest rates cannot fall\nmuch below zero. After all, people can hold cash, which of course pays no interest, rather than\nlend money out at a negative rate of return. Because of this zero lower bound on the federal\nfunds rate, the Federal Reserve introduced alternative ways to ease financial conditions and\nthereby stimulate economic growth and job creation. In my talk, I’ll focus specifically on two\ntypes of unconventional monetary policy that the Fed and other central banks put in place in\nrecent years. The first is large-scale asset purchases, referred to by most people outside the\nFederal Reserve as quantitative easing, or QE. The second is forward policy guidance; that is,\ncommunicating likely future Fed policy actions.\nLarge-Scale Asset Purchases\nI’ll start by talking about our large-scale asset purchases, or what we at the Fed\naffectionately call LSAPs. The Federal Reserve has bought large quantities of longer-term\nTreasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by the\ngovernment. Currently, the Fed is buying $45 billion of Treasury securities and $40 billion of\nagency mortgage-backed securities each month. The Federal Reserve now owns an astounding\n$3.5 trillion of these assets in total (Figure 1).\nWhat do these asset purchases accomplish? Well, no surprise here, theoretical\neconomists are of two minds on this issue. In a textbook world of perfect-functioning financial\nmarkets, LSAPs would have essentially no effect, positive or negative. According to this theory,\nthe price of an asset depends solely on its expected future returns, adjusted for risk. Investors bid\nprices up and down so that risk-adjusted returns of different kinds of assets are equal. If the\nprice of a specific asset deviated from this level, arbitrageurs would swoop in to take advantage\nof the discrepancy, knowing that the price would inevitably return to its proper level. So, under\n2\n\nthese assumptions, since asset purchases by the Fed don’t fundamentally change the risk-\nadjusted returns to assets, they wouldn’t do anything to asset prices or the economy more\nbroadly.\nIn reality, financial markets don’t work nearly so seamlessly, which creates a potential\nrole for asset purchases to have meaningful effects on the economy. Long ago, future Nobel\nlaureates James Tobin and Franco Modigliani argued that certain financial markets are\nsegmented. Some investors, such as pension funds, have strong preferences or even legal\nrestrictions on where they put their money. Such “preferred habitats” for certain types of\ninvestments can interfere with the equalization of risk-adjusted returns to different assets. For\nexample, a pension fund might prefer to hold longer-term fixed income securities like bonds to\nhedge its longer-term liabilities, even if other investments offer better risk-adjusted returns. The\nsupply and demand of assets in these habitats can affect prices because that pension fund is not\ngoing to start buying short-term securities just because the prices of longer-term securities rise.\nNow, if the Fed buys significant quantities of longer-term Treasury or mortgage-backed\nsecurities, then the supply of those securities available to the public declines. As supply falls, the\nprices of those securities rise, and the yields on these assets decline. The effects extend to yields\non other longer-term securities. Mortgage rates and corporate bond yields fall as investors who\nsold securities to the Fed invest that money elsewhere. Hence, our asset purchases drive down a\nbroad range of longer-term borrowing rates. And those lower long-term interest rates stimulate\nthe auto market, the housing market, business investment, and other types of economic activity.\nBefore the Federal Reserve introduced our first asset purchase program back at the end of\n2008, it was hard to know which theory was right and what the effects of these purchases would\nbe. We had no first-hand experience with such policies, and the evidence we did have was based\non foreign experiences or case studies of changes in the demand or supply of Treasury\n3\n\nsecurities.2 That void was filled once we and other central banks introduced asset purchase\nprograms and economists were able to carefully study their effects.\nThe evidence to date provides support for the view that financial markets are segmented\nand that asset purchase programs affect interest rates and other asset prices. There have been\nnumerous studies of the effects of our asset purchases on longer-term interest rates.3 This\nanalysis suggests that each $100 billion of asset purchases lowers the yield on 10-year Treasury\nnotes by around 3 to 4 basis points, that is between 0.03 to 0.04 percentage point. That might not\nsound like much. But consider the Fed’s so-called QE2 program in 2010-11 that totaled $600\nbillion of purchases. According to estimates, that program lowered 10-year yields by about 20\nbasis points. That’s about the same amount that the 10-year Treasury yield typically falls in\nresponse to a cut in the federal funds rate of ¾ to 1 percentage point, which is a big change.4\nApplying the same logic to the current, much larger, asset purchase program, the implied\nreduction in longer-term interest rates is roughly 40 to 50 basis points.\nWe just saw a case study of how changes in expectations of the Fed’s asset purchases\naffect longer-term interest rates and financial conditions more broadly. The FOMC’s\nannouncement on September 18 that it would not change the pace of asset purchases appeared to\ncause financial market participants to expect that the Fed would purchase more assets in the\nfuture than they had previously believed. As a result, in the minutes following the\nannouncement, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell by 18 basis points. The effects didn’t\nstop there. The stock market rose about 1¼ percent and the value of the dollar against the euro\nfell by around 1 percent.\n2 Bernanke, Reinhart, and Sack (2004).\n3 See, e.g., Williams (2011), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Swanson\n(2011), Gagnon et al. (2011), Li and Wei (2013), and Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2011).\n4 See Chung et al (2012), Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005, Table 5).\n4\n\nEstimating the effects of LSAPs on the economy—as opposed to financial markets—is\ninherently harder to do and subject to greater uncertainty. The effects of lower interest rates take\nplace over the course of many months and even years, and over those longer horizons it’s hard to\nknow how much of the change in economic activity was due to the effects of monetary policy or\nother factors. In some of my own research with colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board, we\nused the Board’s large-scale macroeconomic model to try to separate the effects of LSAPs from\nother factors.5 We estimated that the Fed’s $600 billion QE2 program lowered the\nunemployment rate by about ¼ percentage point compared with what it would have been without\nthe program.\nWe also found that, for asset purchases to have such sizable effects, it’s critical that short-\nterm interest rates remain low for a significant period of time.6 That is, asset purchases are most\neffective at stimulating the economy when they work in concert with expectations of sustained\neasy conventional monetary policy. This brings me to the topic of forward guidance.\nForward Policy Guidance\nThe second main way the Fed has affected longer-term interest rates and the economy is\nthrough forward policy guidance. With the federal funds rate close to zero, we can’t ease policy\nby moving the funds rate lower. Instead, we have looked for ways to communicate our\nexpectation that interest rates will remain low for quite some time, through our policy statements,\nmeeting minutes, FOMC forecasts, press conferences, and speeches.\nAfter each monetary policy meeting, the FOMC releases a statement describing the\ncurrent state of the economy, monetary policy, and the outlook for both. By varying the\nforward-looking language in this statement, the FOMC can alter business and investor views\n5 See Chung et al. (2012).\n6 See Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012), and Chung et al. (2012).\n5\n\nabout where monetary policy, and in particular, the federal funds rate, is likely headed. This in\nturn affects longer-term interest rates, as investors adjust their views of what they will earn on\nshort-term securities in the future. Thus, the Federal Reserve’s forward policy guidance can\naffect longer-term interest rates by changing people’s expectations about the future path of\nmonetary policy.\nHere’s a real-world example that illustrates the power of forward guidance. In the\nsummer of 2011, many private-sector economists thought that the FOMC would start raising the\nfederal funds rate in the next year. The FOMC, however, viewed liftoff from zero as likely to\noccur further in the future. The Fed was able to shift expectations of future policy and bring it in\ncloser alignment with its own views by changing the forward-looking language in its August\n2011 statement. Specifically, the FOMC said that economic conditions were “likely to warrant\nexceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.” The statement\ncommunicated that the FOMC would probably keep the federal funds rate near zero for at least\ntwo more years, much longer than many had been expecting. As a result, longer-term interest\nrates fell by 10 to 20 basis points, similar in size to the response to the QE2 program I mentioned\nearlier.7\nSince August 2011, the FOMC has extended and modified its forward guidance a number\nof times. Last December, we introduced a new form of forward guidance that explicitly tied our\nfuture policy decisions to specific economic events. That is, instead of describing our forward\nguidance in terms of dates on the calendar, we began to describe the future path of monetary\npolicy in terms of economic variables such as the unemployment rate. Specifically, the FOMC\nsaid that it “currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will\nbe appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent…”\n7 See Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) and Chung et al. (2012).\n6\n\nNote that this 6½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate is not an automatic trigger.\nThe FOMC statement says “at least as long as” the unemployment rate remains above 6½\npercent. Once unemployment falls below that threshold, we will evaluate how the recovery is\nprogressing and decide on the appropriate course for the federal funds rate then. In my own\nprojection, even though I expect the unemployment rate to fall below 6½ percent early in 2015, I\ndon’t currently expect that it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate until well after\nthat, sometime in the second half of 2015.\nA second form of forward guidance is the FOMC’s projections of the federal funds rate\nfor the next few years. Four times a year, the FOMC participants submit their views on the\nappropriate future path for the federal funds rate, along with the associated projections for\neconomic growth, unemployment, and inflation. The FOMC projections for the federal funds\nrate from our September meeting are shown in Figure 2. A large majority of FOMC\nparticipants—14 out of 17—expect the first federal funds rate hike to take place in 2015 or later.\nAnd after the first rate hike, most FOMC participants expect the funds rate to increase only\ngradually, with the median projection showing it rising to just 2 percent by the end of 2016.\nThe FOMC policy projections help the public see what the Fed is thinking in concrete\nnumbers. This serves two purposes. First, it can help the public better understand and predict\nthe Fed’s policy intentions and plans. In the parlance of economics, it can help the public\nunderstand the Fed’s reaction function; that is, how policy changes as economic conditions\nevolve.8 This can reduce uncertainty and confusion from public misperceptions of Federal\nReserve monetary policy. Second, the fact that there is a range of projections illustrates the fact\nthat the future path of policy is uncertain and depends on how the economy progresses. In other\nwords, policy is not locked on a pre-set course.\n8 Rudebusch and Williams (2008).\n7\n\nAlthough I see many benefits to greater transparency and the use of forward guidance, it\nis important to recognize both the limitations and some potential drawbacks of forward policy\nguidance. First, for it to be effective, it must be viewed as credible. In severe downturns such as\nwe have just experienced, appropriate forward guidance may stretch years into the future. The\npublic may not give much credence to statements about distant events, especially when the\ndecision-makers may be different than today. Second, clearly communicating monetary policy\nand the associated data dependence is simply hard to do well. Swings in asset prices in response\nto Fed communications over the past several months demonstrate how hard it is to convey the\nFOMC’s policy plans in an evolving economic environment. Just as good communication can\nreduce confusion and enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, poor communication can do\nthe opposite. Relatedly, there is the danger that Fed communication takes on too great a role in\nthe public’s thinking about monetary policy. We want to avoid people spending too much time\ntrying to divine Fed utterances and not enough thinking for themselves.\nThe Future of Unconventional Monetary Policy\nSo far, I’ve talked about the types of unconventional policies the Fed has followed since\nthe federal funds rate was brought close to zero and presented evidence that shows how those\npolicies have helped ease financial conditions and supported the economic recovery. Let me\nnow turn to what I see as the lessons we’ve learned that can inform the use of unconventional\npolicies in the future.\nBut before I do that, it’s important to emphasize that unconventional policies will\ncontinue to play an important role in providing needed stimulus to the economy for the next few\nyears. The U.S. economy has been gradually improving for over four years now. The\nunemployment rate, which hit a high of 10 percent back in 2009, has fallen to 7.3 percent. This\n8\n\nis considerable progress, but still significantly above the long-term natural rate of\nunemployment, which I estimate to be about 5½ percent. Thus, despite the improvement in the\neconomy these past four years, we are still falling short of our mandate for maximum\nemployment. In addition, the rate of inflation has been running well below the Fed’s preferred 2\npercent goal for some time.\nWe are therefore in a situation where U.S. unemployment is still too high and inflation is\ntoo low. The appropriate stance of monetary policy is very accommodative and that will\ncontinue to be the case for quite some time. As the U.S. economy continues to improve, it will\nbe appropriate for the Fed to start trimming its asset purchases and eventually stop them\naltogether. And as the economy further strengthens, and unemployment and inflation get closer\nto levels in line with the Fed’s mandate, the stance of monetary policy will need to be\nnormalized. When this eventually happens, what will become of our unconventional monetary\npolicies? Are asset purchases and forward guidance here to stay? Or were these policies only\nappropriate in the exceptional circumstances that ran us up against the zero lower bound?\nLooking to what will constitute the new normal for future monetary policy, one must\nweigh the costs and benefits of conventional and unconventional policy tools in different\ncircumstances. The experience of the past several years has taught us that unconventional\npolicies can play a vital role in complementing conventional monetary policy, especially when\nshort-term interest rates are near zero. But it has also revealed some limitations and drawbacks.\nOne important consideration in choosing the appropriate mix of policy tools in the future is the\ndegree of uncertainty associated with their effects on the economy.\nA basic principle of optimal policy articulated by William Brainard over 40 years ago is:\nthe more uncertain you are about the effects of a policy tool, the more cautiously you should use\n9\n\nit, relying more on other instruments in which you have greater confidence.9 We have decades\nof experience using the short-term interest rate as the main conventional tool of monetary policy\nand have a reasonably good understanding of how it affects the economy. Given this\nunderstanding and the predictability of the effects of conventional policy actions, the short-term\ninterest rate remains the best primary tool for future monetary policy.\nI also see a continuing role for some aspects of forward guidance. The FOMC policy\nprojections that I discussed earlier represent a shift toward greater transparency by the Fed about\nthe likely future path of the federal funds rate. This should in turn reduce households’ and\nbusinesses’ uncertainty about where the economy and monetary policy are heading. More clarity\nshould help households and firms make better borrowing and investment decisions and help\nmake monetary policy more effective.\nThe FOMC’s emphasis on providing an economic basis for forward guidance can also\nimprove transparency. It can help the public understand what we’re doing and why. It’s\nimportant for the public to recognize that monetary policy is not set on some fixed schedule, but\nrather is data-dependent. If the unemployment rate or the outlook for the labor market evolve in\na certain way, then monetary policy should respond appropriately. Helping the public to\nunderstand this should help make monetary policy more transparent and effective.\nThat said, I expect that the explicit link between future policy actions and specific\nnumerical thresholds, as in the recent FOMC statements, will not be a regular aspect of forward\nguidance, at least when the federal funds rate is not constrained by the zero lower bound. This\nguidance has proven to be a powerful tool in current circumstances, when conventional policy\nstimulus has been limited by the zero lower bound. But such communication is difficult to get\nright and comes with the risk of oversimplifying and confusing rather than adding clarity.\nTherefore, in normal times, a more nuanced approach to policy communication will likely be\n9 See Brainard (1967).\n10\n\nwarranted. I see forward guidance typically being of a more qualitative nature, highlighting the\nkey economic factors that affect future policy actions. Of course, if we again find ourselves in a\nsituation where conventional policy has been fully utilized, then we will have the ability to return\nto more explicit forward policy guidance to provide additional monetary stimulus.\nWe should, however, only resort to asset purchases as a policy tool in special\ncircumstances, such as when the federal funds rate is near zero and we have fully utilized\nforward policy guidance. Despite all that we’ve learned, the effects of asset purchases are much\nless well understood and are much more uncertain and harder to predict than for conventional\nmonetary policy. Indeed, the recent outsize movements in bond rates in response to Fed\ncommunications about our current asset purchase program illustrate the difficulty in gauging the\neffects of asset purchases. Moreover, given our limited experience, we can’t be sure of all their\nconsequences, which may play out over many years. When the federal funds rate was at zero\nand we were still facing a severe recession, it was the right call to turn to asset purchases. But,\nonce the federal funds rate is back to a more normal level, we should relegate asset purchases to\na backup role, employing it only when conventional policy and forward guidance fall short.\nConclusion\nLet me offer a final thought. Before the financial crisis and recession, unconventional\nmonetary policies were still mostly theoretical concepts on the drawing board, untested on the\nbattlefield. In practice, they have given central banks such as the Federal Reserve much-needed\ntools when the traditional policy interest rate is near zero. We have learned a great deal over the\npast few years about their effectiveness, but also about some of their limitations. As I have\ndiscussed, in normal times, certain types of unconventional policies are best mothballed and kept\nin reserve in case needed. But, more importantly, the experience with these policies means that\n11\n\nif another situation arises where we need to call on these tools, we are ready and prepared to do\nso.\nThank you very much.\n12\n\nFigure 1\nFederal Reserve Assets\n$billions\n4000\n9/25/13\n3500\n3000\nShort-term\nliquidity\n2500\nprograms\nGSE securities 2000\nOther assets\n1500\n1000\nTreasury securities 500\n0\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nSource: Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\nFigure 2\nFOMC Interest Rate Projections\nAppropriate pace of policy firming Percent\nTarget federal funds rate at year-end\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2013 2014 2015 2016 Longer run\nSource: Federal Reserve Board of Governors (2013).\n13\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., Vincent R.

    "text": "Presentation to Chapman University, Orange, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 1, 2015\nMonetary Policy and the Independence Dilemma\nRecently there has been a great deal of commentary arguing that the Federal Reserve\nneeds more oversight and greater transparency. This has culminated in a number of legislative\nproposals designed to constrain the Fed’s freedom of action in monetary policy and other\nspheres. One prominent example is the bill proposed in the House of Representatives entitled the\nFederal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, or the FRAT Act for short.\nMuch of the debate surrounds the Federal Reserve’s policy actions during and following the\nglobal financial crisis and recession. But the deeper issue of oversight and independence of\ncentral banks in democratic societies is not new; on the contrary, it has been a contentious one\nfor the past century. In the broader historical context, recent proposals are not unique to the\ncurrent situation but instead represent the latest chapter in a long-running debate in the United\nStates and around the globe.\nIn this talk, I will delve into the question of central bank oversight and independence,\nexamine some of the solutions that have been tried in the past but ultimately failed, and then turn\nto approaches that have proven more successful. I’ll conclude by considering how the lessons\nfrom the past apply to the current debate about how to enhance the oversight and transparency of\nthe Federal Reserve. Throughout I will focus on monetary policy and not address payments\nsystems, regulation of financial institutions, or other activities of central banks. At this point, I\nshould emphasize that the views expressed here today are entirely my own, and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nThe independence dilemma\nWhy has central bank oversight and transparency been so contentious? The\nindependence dilemma stems from the enormous power central banks have to create money\nessentially out of thin air. Wielded judiciously, this power can foster economic prosperity and\nstability. However, it can also be misused as a short-term fix for governments to meet financing\nneeds by printing money or to stimulate the economy before an election. Such misuse can\nundermine economic stability and fuel runaway inflation. The resulting longer-run damage may\nonly be felt years or decades in the future, well outside usual political time frames.\nTo avoid the temptation of opportunistic money creation, modern governments have\ngenerally delegated the day-to-day operation of monetary policy to an independent central bank.\nThis independence means that policymakers are free to focus on the technical aspects of their\ntask, removed from direct political influence. This arrangement, however, creates a new\nproblem: Who tells the central bank what to do, if not the government? Thus, the dilemma:\nSuccessful monetary policy necessitates both an arm’s-length relationship to the political process\nand oversight by elected officials. The search for balance at the horns of this predicament has\nbeen at the heart of central bank debates and reforms over the past century.\nTwo broad approaches have been taken to solve the quandary. In both cases, the\noverarching goal is the same: economic prosperity and stability. The difference is in the degree\nof operational latitude afforded the central bank. The first, more restrictive, approach is to\ndelegate an operational mandate stipulating that the central bank achieve a specific intermediate\ngoal. A legislated target for the growth rate of the money supply is one example of an\noperational mandate. The second approach is to delegate an overall economic goal, such as low\n2\n\ninflation, and let the central bank determine how to best achieve its goal with the tools at its\ndisposal.\nOperational mandates\nIn the past, central banks were typically given an operational mandate. This choice\nreflected a strong desire to limit the discretionary power of central banks and to provide a\nnominal anchor, that is, a stable value of money. Operational mandates were thought to be\nhighly predictable, accountable, and transparent, and able to provide the basis for longer-term\neconomic stability, at the cost of short-term flexibility and discretion. However, as I will discuss\nin more detail, operational mandates have been beset by a string of failures rooted in this very\nlack of flexibility to deal with changing economic conditions and crises. After each failure, a\nnew operational mandate framework has been introduced that, while an improvement over the\nprior one, still proved prone to breakdown under economic and political stress.\nThe classic example of an operational mandate is the gold standard. Under the gold\nstandard, monetary policy is completely subordinate to the fixed price of gold at a legislated\nlevel. Many countries followed the gold standard before World War I and in the period between\nthe wars. The gold standard represents the most extreme form of oversight and transparency.\nThe central bank has little freedom of action or decision and is therefore unable to take\npotentially harmful actions on its own—or, for that matter, any actions on its own.\nHistory has shown that this inflexibility and the subservience of monetary policy to\nfluctuations in gold supply and demand contributed to economic crises and depressions. The\ngold standard’s inability to cope with economic stress is reflected by its frequent curtailment\nduring times of war and crisis. In fact, so often was it suspended that deviations from the gold\n3\n\nstandard routinely became the norm, rather than the exception. The inherent lack of flexibility in\nthe money supply was blamed for contributing to the depth of the downturns experienced by\nmany countries during the 1930s.1 Moreover, although the gold standard system was transparent\nin terms of the operational mandate, its execution was far from transparent in practice, as\naccounts of central bank dealings during the gold standard period illustrate.2\nThe failure of the gold standard led to a new type of operational mandate, the fixed\nexchange rate regime. Under this system, the central bank is required to maintain the value of\nthe domestic currency in relation to that of a foreign currency. As with the gold standard,\npredictability, accountability, and transparency were considered paramount virtues. The most\nfamous example was the Bretton Woods system, in which foreign currencies were pegged to the\nU.S. dollar. A fixed exchange rate system is somewhat less rigid than a gold standard and is far\nless subject to the particularities of gold supply and demand. Nonetheless, it puts a straitjacket\non a central bank’s ability to set monetary policy attuned to domestic economic conditions, since\npolicy is beholden to the exchange-rate peg. As a result, monetary policy is less able to counter\ncyclical swings in the economy.\nOnce again, history has shown that fixed exchange rate systems perform very poorly and\nare often abandoned during periods of severe economic stress or crisis. Although some smaller\neconomies, such as Denmark and Hong Kong, have successfully operated with exchange-rate\npegs, other regimes have not stood the test of time. The Bretton Woods system collapsed in the\nearly 1970s and the European Exchange Rate Mechanism faltered in the early 1990s.\n1 Eichengreen 1992.\n2 Ahamed 2009.\n4\n\nThe string of failures associated with the gold standard and fixed exchange rates led to\nother proposed operational mandates, including monetary targets. Monetary targeting is most\noften associated with Milton Friedman’s proposal to have the money stock grow at a constant\nrate irrespective of economic conditions.3 In theory, monetary targeting has the benefit of being\npredictable, accountable, and transparent while providing a stronger automatic stabilizer for the\neconomy than earlier, more rigid regimes. For example, if the economy heats up, demand for\nmoney balances rises, driving interest rates up, which slows the economy and reduces inflation\npressures.\nHowever, in practice, monetary targeting has proved an unreliable and overly restrictive\nframework. In particular, changes in the financial system have caused the relationship between\nmoney demand and the economy to shift in unexpected ways. As a result, a fixed growth rate of\nthe money stock can have unpredictable implications for economic growth and inflation.\nFollowing on the theoretical insight of William Poole, in a world where money demand is hard\nto predict, it is preferable to use the interest rate as the primary policy instrument rather than\nmoney supply.4 This is what central banks around the world have done, leaving monetary\ntargeting by the wayside.\nGoal mandates\nIn light of the string of past failures of various forms of operational mandates, many\ncountries have settled on a very different approach to deal with the issues of oversight and\nindependence. Instead of stipulating an operational target, they set high-level economic goals\nand delegate to the central bank the authority to decide how to best achieve them. Under such a\n3 Friedman 1960.\n4 Poole 1970.\n5\n\ngoal mandate, the central bank is held responsible for achieving its objectives and is typically\nrequired to regularly report on its progress and the steps it is taking. This framework stresses the\npredictability, accountability, and transparency of the main economic goals of policy, rather than\noperational actions.\nAn early entry in this category is the mandate under which the Federal Reserve has\noperated for the past 38 years. The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 states: “The Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall\nmaintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the\neconomy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Somewhat\nconfusingly, this sentence combines elements of both operational and goal mandates. The\noperational mandate aspect is captured by the reference to long run growth of monetary and\ncredit aggregates, hearkening to a monetary targeting regime. The goal mandate is specified as\nthe ultimate objective of monetary policy. Later in this paragraph, the tension between the two\napproaches is resolved clearly in favor of the goal mandate: “Nothing in this Act shall be\ninterpreted to require that such ranges of growth or diminution be achieved if the Board of\nGovernors and the Federal Open Market Committee determine that they cannot or should not be\nachieved because of changing conditions.” Although the description of the goals is left\nsomewhat vague, the Federal Reserve filled in this gap by issuing a statement describing the\nlonger-run goals and policy strategy in greater detail.5\nThe Act of 1977 also demanded a greater level of oversight and transparency regarding\nmonetary policy. It stipulated that the Fed would consult with congressional committees at\n5 Board of Governors 2015.\n6\n\nsemiannual meetings concerning “objectives and plans with respect to the ranges of growth or\ndiminution of monetary and credit aggregates for the upcoming twelve months, taking account of\npast and prospective developments in production, employment, and prices.”6 The Full\nEmployment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 added a requirement that the Fed issue\nsemiannual reports to Congress in conjunction with these meetings. The semiannual meetings\nand reports continue to this day.\nOther countries have taken the goal mandate framework considerably further. Some 25\nyears ago the Reserve Bank of New Zealand introduced a new goal mandate framework called\ninflation targeting.7 Since then, dozens of countries have adopted some form of inflation\ntargeting. The cornerstone of this approach is that the central bank—often in consultation and in\nformal agreement with the government—assumes responsibility for inflation being, on average,\nnear a numerical target. It is important to note that, although the inflation goal is front and\ncenter, inflation-targeting central banks also recognize a role for stabilizing economic activity—\nwhat is often referred to as “flexible inflation targeting.”\nThe inflation-targeting framework also features clear communication of the central\nbank’s policy strategy and the rationale for its decisions, with the goal of enhancing the\npredictability of the central bank’s actions and its accountability to the public. This is generally\ndone in regular public reports with detailed analysis of the economic outlook and policy strategy\nand decisions.8 Indeed, some governments require the head of the central bank to issue a public\n6 Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.\n7 Leiderman and Svensson 1995, Bernanke and Mishkin 1997, Bernanke et al. 1999, Kuttner 2004.\n8 See, for example, Norges Bank 2014.\n7\n\nletter when the inflation goal is missed, explaining why the target was not achieved and what is\nbeing done to rectify the situation.9\nAlthough the legal and institutional structures of inflation-targeting frameworks differ\nacross countries in their particulars, they share the following: a clear delegation of goals to the\ncentral bank, regular formal reporting on the attainment of these goals to the public, and a\nrequirement to explain what the central bank is doing to best achieve its goals. As a testament to\nthe effectiveness of this framework, countries with inflation goal mandates have generally kept\ninflation low and stable over the past few decades, even in the aftermath of the global financial\ncrisis.10\nBack to the future: Monetary policy rules as an operational mandate?\nAlthough many countries have found that a goal mandate coupled with strong oversight\nand transparency works much better than past operational mandates, some commentators argue\nthat the problem has not been with the notion of an operational mandate per se, but with how it\nhas been implemented. They accept that the gold standard, fixed exchange rate, and monetary\ntargeting are flawed, and argue that a more sophisticated operational mandate is needed—one\nthat is more flexible at dealing with changing economic conditions but still puts a meaningful\nconstraint on the central bank.\nThe latest proposed operational mandate is that the central bank should, under most\ncircumstances, follow a fixed mechanical monetary policy rule such as the Taylor rule.11 This is\nthe basic idea underlying the FRAT Act. According to many standard monetary policy rules, the\n9 See, for example, Bank of England 2015.\n10 Williams 2014a.\n11 Taylor 1993.\n8\n\nreal (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate depends on a few macroeconomic variables:\nspecifically, the utilization gap—the difference between the level of economic activity and its\nnormal, full-employment level; the inflation gap—the difference between the inflation rate and\nits target level; and the normal, or “natural,” rate of interest. Like other operational mandates,\nthis proposal places a high value on predictability, accountability, and transparency and aims to\nlimit the discretionary decision making of the central bank.\nThis approach has several advantages over previous operational mandate frameworks in\nterms of macroeconomic performance. First, a monetary policy rule makes clear the central\nbank’s longer-term inflation goal, which is an integral part of the rule itself. This clarifies the\ncommunication of policy goals and actions. Second, a properly specified policy rule\nincorporates the fundamental principle (“Taylor principle”) of monetary policy that the nominal\ninterest rate needs to rise more than one-for-one with an increase in inflation as a necessary\ncondition to achieve the desired level of inflation in the long run. Third, a policy rule\nincorporates systematic and predictable counter-cyclical responses to economic conditions\nconsistent with economic theory and a wide range of economic models.12\nResearch has shown that a policy rule is likely to be superior to other operational\nmandates like the gold standard, fixed exchange rates, and monetary targeting.13 In model\nsimulations of typical economic fluctuations, an optimally designed monetary policy rule can\ncome very close to the first-best achievable outcomes.14 As a result, central banks around the\nworld consult monetary policy rules in preparing forecasts, analyzing risk scenarios, and\n12 Taylor and Williams 2011.\n13 Bryant, Hooper, and Mann 1993.\n14 Levin, Wieland, and Williams 1999, 2003; Levin et al. 2006.\n9\n\nstudying alternative policy strategies. At the Federal Reserve, monetary policy rules have been a\nregular feature of monetary policy analysis, briefings, and discussions for the past two decades.15\nThere is no question that monetary policy rules provide an invaluable tool for research\nand practical policy considerations at central banks. Nonetheless, before one rushes to institute a\npolicy rule operational mandate, there are substantive issues and open questions that need to be\naddressed. Three are particularly relevant: the treatment of unobserved variables such as the\nnatural rates of economic activity and interest, the zero lower bound on interest rates, and the\nspecification of the rule itself.\nAn important element of most monetary policy rules is the dependence on unobservable\nmeasures of the normal, or “natural,” levels of economic activity—such as real gross domestic\nproduct or the unemployment rate—and interest rates. In principle, these natural rates change\nover time in unpredictable ways and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty.16 Under a\npolicy rule mandate, would the estimates of the natural rates be set by statute or by the central\nbank? Would they change over time as economic circumstances change or would they be fixed?\nThese are not purely academic questions. Following the most recent recession, estimates of both\nthe natural rate of output and interest have been subject to dramatic shifts, which would have\nsizable effects on the appropriate setting of policy according to standard monetary policy rules.17\nIf the mandated policy rule uses outdated or inappropriate measures of natural rates, economic\nperformance will suffer. On the other hand, allowing the central bank to freely choose natural\nrate measures would significantly loosen the constraint on policymaking. In the extreme, any\ndeviation from the mandated rule could be defined away by a shift in the estimated natural rate.\n15 Williams 2014c.\n16 Orphanides and Williams 2002, Laubach and Williams 2003.\n17 Williams 2014b, 2015.\n10\n\nA second issue is the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates that limits the ability to\nlower interest rates during periods of economic downturn or very low inflation relative to the\nprescription of a monetary policy rule. During the recent U.S. recession, standard monetary\npolicy rules prescribed negative nominal interest rates, but this was unattainable.18 In the end,\nthe Federal Reserve and other central banks turned to unconventional means to provide the\nmissing monetary stimulus. These measures, including asset purchases and explicit forward\npolicy guidance, are outside the realm of standard monetary policy rules. In such circumstances,\nwhich are very likely to occur again in the future, a policy rule mandate will be silent.\nMoreover, research shows that the very presence of the zero lower bound argues for deviating\nfrom a standard policy rule around times when the constraint binds, as the central bank aims to\nmake up for lost monetary stimulus.19\nThird, although there has been a great deal of research about the properties of well-\nperforming monetary policy rules, there is, as yet, no consensus about the best specification of\nsuch a rule. Different models imply different best rules. In addition, in the presence of the zero\nlower bound or uncertainty about natural rates, the best performing rules can be very different\nfrom those designed absent these features.20 In those circumstances, mechanically following one\ntype of standard policy rule designed to work well under one set of assumptions can yield very\npoor economic outcomes when those assumptions are violated.\nWhere do we go from here?\nI have argued that the independence dilemma has been with us for a very long time.\nDespite the best intentions, attempts to solve it through an operational mandate have proven\n18 Board of Governors 2009, Rudebusch 2009, Williams 2009.\n19 Reifschneider and Williams 2000.\n20 Orphanides and Williams 2002, 2006; Reifschneider and Williams 2000.\n11\n\nfruitless in the past. Although a policy rule operational mandate is unquestionably superior to\npast operational mandates, such an approach is subject to a number of issues and questions. First\nand foremost, what rule should the central bank follow? One lesson from the history of\noperational mandates is that what looks good in theory often fails to deliver when circumstances\nchange in unpredictable ways. Particularly in situations of economic stress or crisis, operational\nmandates have proven to be ineffective and have often been abandoned.\nGiven the challenges for an operational mandate to succeed, a potentially more promising\napproach to address the independence dilemma may be to look to the experiences of inflation-\ntargeting countries, where the principle of enhancing accountability and transparency within a\ngoal mandate framework has proven to be very successful.\nThank you.\n12\n\nReferences\nAhamed, Liaquat. 2009.

    "text": "Presentation to California Bankers Association, Santa Barbara, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 8, 2016\nAfter the First Rate Hike\nGood morning. This is my first outlook speech of the year, and I am pleased to be able to\ngive it in beautiful Santa Barbara.\nToday I’d like to give my view of the economic outlook and discuss more extensively\nsome of the issues that are probably on your mind: Interest rates, the path they’re on, and what\nwe can expect when we reach full economic health. As always, the views expressed here today\nare mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe economic snapshot\nThe headline is that we’ve made the first rate hike. This was the right move because the\neconomic outlook is good: We’re now well into the seventh year of the expansion, we’re very\nclose to full employment, and the economy still has a good head of steam. Consumer spending\ncontinues to increase at a solid pace, auto sales have matched their highs of the early 2000s, and\nstrong fundamentals point to continued strength going forward.\nThere are some upside risks, specifically an even stronger and faster rebound in housing.\nAnd there are, of course, some downside risks: the threat of slowdowns and spillovers from\nabroad or the dollar appreciating further.\nEmployment\nOn the employment side, things are going very well. Job growth has averaged over\n200,000 a month for most of the past two years, and the 12th District has been at the head of the\npack, with seven of our nine states ranked in the top ten for job growth over the past 12 months.\n1\n\nWhat’s particularly heartening is that some of the states that were hardest hit by the housing bust\nand financial crisis are among them, in particular, California, Nevada, and Arizona.\nNationwide, based on data through November, we’re on track to see about 2½ million\njobs added in 2015, and we met one marker on the unemployment rate. Because unemployment\nwill never be zero—in any healthy economy, there will be turnover, with people leaving jobs and\nnew people entering the workforce—economists use something called the “natural rate” of\nunemployment. Broadly, it’s the optimal rate in a fully functioning economy. I put the natural\nrate at 5 percent, and we’ve reached that threshold. I expect the unemployment rate to continue\nto edge down below the natural rate, to about 4.5 percent, by midyear or so.\nOf course, the unemployment rate alone doesn’t tell the whole story. There are other\nfactors and measures that reflect the complexities of the American workforce and how people\nhave fared in the aftermath of the recession.\nMost discussed—and for many, the most worrisome—is the labor force participation rate,\nwhich is still significantly lower than it has been in the past. On the surface, this can appear\nalarming. But digging deeper it is, by and large, explicable and relatively benign.\nAs a reminder: The “labor force” is made up of people who are either employed or\nunemployed but actively looking for work. The labor force participation rate divides that group\nby the total working-age population—that is, everyone over the age of 16. It’s a very basic ratio\nthat’s affected by myriad factors. In the ’60s and ’70s, for instance, women entered the\nworkforce in greater numbers and the labor force participation rate shot up.\nSince the start of the recession, the participation rate has come down substantially. Some\npeople are concerned that this is indicative of a portion of society that was hit hard by the\nrecession and sidelined in the recovery—people who want to work but have given up looking,\n2\n\neither out of pessimism over the job market or fear that an extended time out of work has\nrendered them fundamentally unemployable.\nBut much of the decline in the labor force participation rate can be explained not by\ndisheartened workers, but by demographic and social shifts.1\nFirst is the aging of the population. The baby boomers are entering retirement and people\nare living longer. Remember, the participation rate counts everyone over 16, so my happily\nretired parents count as “out of the labor force,” even though, in their 80s, few people at that age\nwould still be working. Second is that younger people aren’t working as much as they used to.\nThis is partly because many have extended their education or gone back to school, and fewer are\nworking when they’re there. Third is an increase in people deciding they’d rather have single-\nincome families.2 For whatever reason, they’ve traded a second paycheck for spending more\ntime at home, whether it’s for child care, leisure, or simply that it’s a better lifestyle fit. Each of\nthese groups is made up of people who are not working, but doing so for personal or\ndemographic reasons. As their numbers swell, it will, obviously, push the participation rate\ndown.\nThis brings me to the question of whether there are a large number of people who will\nreenter the labor force and pull the participation rate back up. The “marginally attached” for\ninstance, a group made up of people who are ready and able to work and who’ve searched for\njobs in the past year but who aren’t currently looking. The assumption would reasonably be that\nthis group is poised to return to the labor force. However, there are reasons to doubt that we’ll\nsee much of a pickup in overall labor force participation. First off, the numbers of marginally\nattached people have come down a lot, falling by nearly 20 percent in the past year alone. In\n1 See, for example, Fujita (2014).\n2 See the Bureau of Labor Statistics news releases, “Employment Characteristics of Families” (archived at\nhttp://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/all_nr.htm#FAMEE).\n3\n\naddition, my staff has found that, over the past few years, their reentry rate back into the labor\nforce has actually fallen. When you combine this with the aging workforce, it looks unlikely that\nparticipation will rise. This is supported by other research from both within and outside the Fed\nSystem.3 Overall, the evidence suggests that, even with a quite strong economy, we aren’t likely\nto see a significant number of people come back into the fold.\nI know this has been a tough journey for a lot of people, and many are still struggling.\nBut putting the recovery in perspective, we’ve come a very long way and we should be heartened\nby the progress. Since the dark days of late 2009, we’ve added over 13 million jobs, virtually all\nof them full-time.\nLooking forward, I see a labor market that’s growing ever stronger and will reach\nmaximum employment on a broad set of measures very soon.\nFive small words: Inflation is still too low\nThe inflation side of the equation is the dark end of the street. For those of us who lived\nthrough the ’70s and ’80s, the idea that we need higher inflation may seem strange, but that’s\nwhere we are right now. Inflation is like wine—a little bit is actually good for you. And right\nnow our glass isn’t full enough. The Fed’s target rate is 2 percent, and inflation has been\nobstinately below that for 3½ years now. Over the past year, it’s been only about ½ percent.\nThere are reasons for the low level of inflation, in particular the rise in the dollar and the\nfall in oil prices. Those effects should peter out, but they’ve had a downward influence on\ninflation at a time we’ve needed it to rise. Another special factor is that health-care prices have\nbeen rising much more slowly than we’re used to, and that’s pushing down the inflation rate as\nwell. This is in part due to legislation that holds down payments to hospitals and other providers.\nThese effects may prove to be transitory as well.\n3 See Krueger (2015) and Aaronson et al. (2014).\n4\n\nFor formulating monetary policy and analyzing data, policymakers need to look at\nunderlying trends. That’s why I look at measures that remove the volatile components, like the\ntrimmed mean rate that the Dallas Fed came up with.4 By that measure, we’re not as far from our\ngoal as it first appears. The trimmed mean puts the underlying inflation rate for the past year at\n1.7 percent—still below our 2 percent target, but not by much.\nLooking ahead, as the effects of the dollar and oil prices ebb, and as the economy\nstrengthens further, I see inflation moving back up and expect that we’ll be at or near our 2\npercent target by the end of next year.\nIt’s time: Economic progress and the first rate hike\nWith real progress on our goals, the conversation turned to normalizing policy. Before\nthe first hike, that was the mystery dance: When are you raising rates? Now everyone wants to\nknow when the second one is coming, and the third, and so on.\nFrom my perspective, we’ve made remarkable progress and the economy is on the cusp\nof full health. The first step in bringing policy closer to normal was when we ended QE. The next\nwas the first rise in rates, which was the right move for a few reasons.\nFirst, Milton Friedman famously taught us that monetary policy has long and variable\nlags.5 Research shows it takes at least a year or two for it to have its full effect.6 So the decisions\nwe make today must take aim at where we’re going, not where we are. The economy is a moving\ntarget, and waiting to see the whites of inflation’s eyes risked overshooting the mark.\nSecond, experience shows that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate\nimbalances, ultimately leading to either excessive inflation or an economic correction and\nrecession. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was runaway inflation. In the late 1990s, the expansion\n4 See http://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce/.\n5 Friedman (1961).\n6 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n5\n\nbecame increasingly fueled by euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. And in the first half of the 2000s, irrational\nexuberance over housing sent prices spiraling far beyond fundamentals and led to massive\noverbuilding. Waiting too long to remove monetary accommodation hazards allowing these\nimbalances to grow, at great cost to our economy.\nFinally, starting to raise rates allows a smoother, more gradual process of normalization.\nThis gives us space to adjust our actions to any changes in economic conditions and avoid\nplaying catch-up with little room for maneuver.\nThe great unknown: What should we expect from interest rates?\nIn thinking about the future path of monetary policy, it’s important to keep in mind that\nthe economy, for all its progress, still needs support from an accommodative stance. We don’t\nneed the extraordinarily accommodative policy that has characterized the past several years, but\nthe headwinds we’re facing—weakness abroad, for instance, and its impact on the dollar, or the\ncontinued slow recovery in housing construction—call for a continued push. Not with a\nbulldozer, but a steady nudge.\nThis view of a gradual reduction in monetary accommodation is seen in the Federal Open\nMarket Committee’s own projections of interest rates. The median projection of FOMC\nparticipants from our December meeting indicates four hikes being appropriate in 2016 and\n2017. This path is generally consistent with forecasts from the private sector, such as the Blue\nChip survey. That’s about half the pace of the last tightening cycle, 2004–06. Of course, it’s not\na black-and-white world, so actual decisions will depend on real-time economic developments as\nwell as any changes in the outlook. But if my aim is true and things evolve as expected, the path\nwill look more like an airplane’s gentle ascension than a rocket shooting straight up: At that pace\n6\n\nit will take nearly three years before the funds rate reaches a stable level. But even then, our\ncruising altitude, as it were, likely won’t be as high as in the past.\nAs we make our way back to normal, we should consider what “normal” will look like\nfor interest rates. After the financial crisis and the global recession that followed, short-term\ninterest rates around the world were pushed close to the zero mark—in some cases, less than\nzero—in an effort by central banks to revive their economies. But in that time, we may have seen\na longer-run shift in the level of interest rates themselves. What can we expect from interest rates\nonce the global economy is fully healed? Are expectations that a post-recession world will return\nto the exact size and shape of the go-go years that led up to it? Or is the future unlikely to repeat\nthe past?\nThe evidence is building that the new normal for interest rates is quite a bit lower than\nanyone in this room is accustomed to.7\nEconomists view this via the concept of the “neutral” funds rate—that is, the federal\nfunds rate that balances monetary policy so that it’s neither accommodative nor contractionary.\nHence the “neutral.” I find it useful to focus on the longer-run value of the neutral rate, called r*\n(r-star). R-star is essentially what inflation-adjusted interest rates will be once the economy’s\nback to full strength; we can align the funds rate with it, but we can’t control its underlying level.\nI think of it as a benchmark we can expect once we’ve recovered from the recession in all\naspects, not just in the United States, but in Europe and other mature economies as they come\nback to full health.\nGlobal supply and demand has made real interest rates very low and they appear poised\nto stay that way.8 The particulars are myriad and fairly wonky aspects of the supply and demand\n7 Laubach and Williams (2015) and Williams (2015).\n8 Council of Economic Advisers (2015) and International Monetary Fund (2014).\n7\n\nof funds and the resulting global savings glut, but the basics are familiar to the banking world.\nThese include emerging market economies’ desire to have large reserves of safe assets to help\nprotect them in the event of an economic crisis, slower trend global growth, and shifting\ndemographics. There are other factors as well, on both the supply and demand sides, but the\nupshot is, the indication from global economic trends is that interest rates are going to stay lower\nthan we’ve come to expect in the past.\nThat doesn’t mean they’ll be zero, but compared with the pre-recession “normal” funds\nrate of, say, between 4 and 4.5 percent, we may now see the underlying r-star guiding us towards\na fed funds rate of around 3–3½ percent instead. In fact, some estimates, including those based\non my own research with Thomas Laubach, indicate it could even be below 3 percent.\nSo banks may see it as something of a poisoned rose: The Fed has started the process of\nraising interest rates, but the path to normal will be gradual and rates are likely to be low by\nhistorical standards. Along the way, QE, both in the U.S. and abroad, has also put downward\npressure on long-term interest rates, which will, in turn, help flatten the yield curve as well.9\nThat brings me to the related question of the plans for our over $4 trillion balance sheet.\nWe have made clear in our communication—and let me reiterate—that we still have a ways to go\nbefore we start to unwind it. For the time being, we’re maintaining its size through reinvestment,\nso that the first steps in removing monetary accommodation occur slowly and gradually, via the\nfunds rate only. This will continue until normalization of the funds rate is well under way. After\nthat, our plan is to shrink the balance sheet “organically,” if you will, through the maturation of\nthe assets. It’s likely going to take at least six years to get the balance sheet back to normal,\nwhich is in keeping with the overall approach to removing accommodation gradually.10\n9 Williams (2014) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).\n10 Carpenter et al. (2015).\n8\n\nConclusion\nUltimately, economic forces like r-star are going to affect the way monetary policy is\nconducted. The other end of the telescope shows an environment that will be, in the medium\nterm, different from what bankers and everyone else are used to.\nWhich means that, all in all, things are looking good. It’s been a tough climb back up\nafter the economic fall, but we’ve made tremendous progress and we’re getting ever closer to our\ngoals.\n9\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher. 2014. “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects.” Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197–255.\nhttp://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/fall-2014/fall2014bpea_aaronson_et_al.pdf\nCarpenter, Seth, Jane Ihrig, Elizabeth Klee, Daniel Quinn, and Alexander Boote. 2015. “The Federal\nReserve’s Balance Sheet and Earnings: A Primer and Projections.” International Journal of Central\nBanking 11(2, March), pp. 237–283. http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb15q2a7.htm\nCouncil of Economic Advisers. 2015. “Long-Term Interest Rates: A Survey.” Report, July.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/interest_rate_report_final_v2.pdf\nEngen, Eric M., Thomas T.

    "text": "THE GLOBAL GROWTH SLUMP:\nCAUSES & CONSEQUENCES\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nA Public Lecture Hosted By\nMACQUARIE UNIVERSITY\nSydney, Australia\nJune 27, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nIt is a pleasure to have the opportunity to join you here today. We in the San\nFrancisco Bay Area feel a special kinship to the people of Sydney. Our cities are two\nof the world’s great metropolises, known for their sweeping waterfronts, iconic\nbridges, and unique architecture. Also, both our cities are chilly in June and July –\nonly you have the excuse at least that it’s winter here.\nAmong our other commonalities is a mutual stake in the economic well-being of the\nother, and in the well-being of the broader community of nations in an increasingly\ninterconnected world. In this regard, an important new trend is emerging. Even as\ncountries make strides in recovering from the global financial crisis, growth remains\nlackluster.\nMore specifically, as attention has been focused on combatting crises and economic\ndownturns, shifting supply-side realities have been developing that are holding back\ngrowth across the globe. Demographic factors like slowing population and labor\nforce growth and a global productivity slowdown are fundamentally redefining what is\nachievable and creating a new set of economic challenges.\n1\n\nThese challenges have ramifications that extend beyond the next few months or years\n– they will define the economic landscape for the next decade and beyond. In a\nbroader sense, they’re also about the next generation, and what sort of future we\nchoose to create together. The focus of my remarks today will be on the causes and\nconsequences of this global growth slump.\nSpoiler alert: When you look at the underlying demographic and productivity-related\nshifts, it becomes clear that a sea change is taking shape. What’s less clear is how\nglobal policymakers will respond to these shifts … whether they will make the\nnecessary long-term investments in priorities like education, job training, science, and\ninfrastructure that can break this slump … or whether they will allow this slump to\nbreak them.\nBefore I go even one word further, it should be noted that the views expressed are\nmine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nCRISIS & RECOVERY\nThe narrative of the past decade has been one of crisis and recovery.\nToday, many nations are still coping with the aftermath of the global financial crisis,\nthe euro area crisis, and other events. Central banks remain engaged in the\nextraordinary policy actions they undertook to stabilize their economies and to\nsupport economic recovery.\nThere are encouraging signs that we are approaching a turning point; a transition from\nrecovery to ongoing economic expansion. The United States is a case in point.\nThe U.S. economy has regained, and even surpassed, full employment benchmarks.\nAlthough our inflation rate is still somewhat below our 2 percent medium-term target,\nI and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee expect us to reach that\ngoal in the next year or so.1 As a result, we at the Federal Reserve are now in the\nprocess of gradually withdrawing the massive monetary stimulus put in place during\nthe past decade.\nAnd we’re not alone in this improving outlook. When you look at the economic news\ncoming out of Europe and Japan, for instance, you see economic indicators moving in\nthe right direction.\n1 Board of Governors (2017); see the median inflation projection.\n2\n\nBut wait a second, isn’t this supposed to be a speech about the global growth slump?\nThe big dichotomy of our times is that in country after country, the economic news is\nat once both encouraging and discouraging: encouraging that economies are\nexpanding; discouraging that growth is disappointing, at least by historical standards.\nIn the United States this dichotomy is profound. U.S. GDP growth has been almost\nas unimpressive as employment has been impressive. In the nearly eight years since\nthe recession ended, real GDP growth has averaged only about 2 percent, well below\nformer trends, while we’ve added an impressive 15 million jobs. How can both be\ntrue?\nSHIFTING WINDS\nAs I said at the beginning of my remarks, a sea change in sustainable growth is under\nway, driven by fundamental shifts in demographics and productivity growth.\nI’ll start with demographics. Two powerful trends are evident: We are generally living\nlonger but birth rates are declining.\nThe good news is that people are living longer on average. Overall life expectancy in\nmember countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD) has increased from about 60 years in the 1950s to nearly 80 years today\n(Figure 1).2 And it is expected to grow even higher, eventually exceeding 90 years\nlater this century.\nDespite this increase in longevity, population growth is slowing to a standstill owing\nto falling birth rates. Among the so-called advanced economies that belong to the\nOECD – which includes Australia – population growth averaged over 1 percent back\nin the 1950s and 1960s, but is now running under ½ percent per year, as shown in\nFigure 1.3 United Nations projections show population growth in this group of\ncountries actually turning negative some 20 years from now.\nWhen it comes to productivity, the changes that are occurring in advanced economies\nacross the world are no less dramatic. In the United States, the catchphrase is\n“productivity slowdown.” Labor productivity – the amount produced per worker\n2 This is not true for all population groups; Case and Deaton (2017) document declining life expectancy for middle-\naged, less-educated non-Hispanic whites in the United States since the year 2000.\n3 United Nations (2015).\n3\n\nhour – in the United States has been growing a little over 1 percent per year over the\npast decade, well below half the rate of the prior decade (Figure 2).\nThe recent pattern of subdued productivity growth is a throwback to that seen from\nthe mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. And a major factor driving the slowdown in\nthe two periods is the same: very slow growth in what economists call “total factor\nproductivity,” or TFP for short (Figure 2). TFP is the measure of productivity that\nremains after one accounts for changes in the quality of the workforce and the\namount of capital investment in the economy, and is often thought to be a measure of\ninnovation and technology.\nSome commentators blame the apparent productivity slowdown on failures of\neconomic statistics to keep up with changing times, pointing to the widespread\nadoption of mobile technology, social media, the gig economy, and so on. Careful\nstudy of this issue, however, reveals that these developments present no greater\ndifficulties in measuring productivity than those from the past: that is, the productivity\nslowdown is real.4\nThe recent productivity slowdown is not confined to the United States, but rather is a\nglobal phenomenon. Averaging over 17 advanced economies—again, including\nAustralia—productivity growth has fallen to below 1 percent per year over the past\ndecade, less than half the pace seen over the prior 30 years (Figure 3).5 As in the\nUnited States, a key culprit in the slowdown is a sharp decline in TFP growth.\nSLUMPING GROWTH\nSo what do these trend shifts in demographics and productivity mean for future\neconomic growth? For that question, some math comes in handy. Over the medium\nterm, the sustainable growth rate of the economy equals the sum of productivity\ngrowth and the growth rate of labor supply. Therefore, the slowdown in productivity\ngrowth translates one-for-one into a slowdown in sustainable GDP growth.\nDemographics are also holding back rather than boosting economic growth. The\ndecline in population growth eventually implies slower labor force growth. In\naddition, longer life expectancy combined with more time in school means that\npeople are spending a decreasing share of their lifetimes in the labor force. These two\ndemographic waves are driving labor force growth toward zero, or even below that, in\ncountries like Japan. Even the United States, which historically has enjoyed high rates\n4 Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).\n5 Bergeaud, Cette, and Lecat (2016). Data available at:\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/roiw.12185/suppinfo\n4\n\nof labor force growth, is expected to see labor force growth of only ½ percent per\nyear over the next decade, a significant drop from the past.6\nThese global shifts in demographics and productivity tell us that the growth we have\nbeen seeing in recent years, and thinking of as “disappointing,” “anemic,” and “tepid”\nwhen compared to years past, is a harbinger of the future. Research by Kathryn\nHolston, Thomas Laubach, and myself aims to quantify the new normal for growth.\nThe estimated trend growth rate for GDP for four economies—Canada, the euro\narea, the United Kingdom, and the United States—now stands at about 1½ percent,\nless than half what it was 30 years ago (Figure 4). The corresponding estimate for the\nUnited States alone is about 1½ percent, broadly consistent with other estimates.7\nPOLICY IMPLICATIONS\nSo these are some of the causes of sluggish growth … what are some of the\nconsequences?\nFor starters, the demographic waves and slower growth have driven down the longer-\nterm normal or “natural” real rate of interest – or r-star – to historic lows in country\nafter country.\nSlower trend growth reduces the demand for investment, while longer life expectancy\ntends to increase household saving.8 This combination of lower demand and higher\nsupply for savings, along with other factors, has pushed down the “price” of savings,\nor r-star. With open capital markets, global developments affect r-star in every\ncountry, irrespective of local economic conditions.\nThere is mounting evidence of a sizable decline in r-star across economies. Estimates\nfor the United States indicate that r-star has fallen to between 0 and 1 percent.9 The\nweighted average of estimates for Canada, the euro area, the United Kingdom, and\nthe United States has declined to less than ½ percent. That’s 2 percentage points\nbelow the average natural rate that prevailed in the two decades before the financial\ncrisis (Figure 4). Estimates for Japan are also near zero.10 These r-star estimates differ\nby economy, but in all cases the most recent estimates are among the lowest over the\npast 30 years.11\n6 Congressional Budget Office (2017).\n7 Fernald (2016).\n8 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016), Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016), and Eggertsson, Mehrotra,\nand Robbins (2017).\n9 Williams (2017b).\n10 Fujiwara et al. (2016).\n11 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n5\n\nA striking aspect of these estimates is that they show no signs of moving back to\npreviously normal levels. Looking ahead, given the demographic waves and sustained\nproductivity growth slowdown around the world, I do not expect r-star to revert to\nhigher levels anytime soon.\nThe dramatic decline in r-star presents significant challenges for monetary policy and\nfinancial stability. In particular, the global nature of the decline in r-star implies that\ncentral banks will face daunting challenges in stabilizing their economies in response\nto negative shocks when interest rates are not far above their lower bound.12\nIn a low r-star world, what were once called “extraordinary” policies – like zero or\nnegative interest rates, forward guidance, and balance sheet policies – are likely to\nbecome the norm as central banks strive to achieve their macroeconomic goals.\nTherefore, policymakers around the globe need to prepare for the challenges of\nsuccessfully navigating new realities.13 In the best of all worlds, fiscal and other\npolicies would be put in place that propel long-run economic prosperity and boost r-\nstar on a sustained basis. More on this in a moment. Absent such actions, monetary\npolicy will be severely challenged to achieve stable prices, well-anchored inflation\nexpectations, and strong macroeconomic performance in a low r-star world.\nTherefore, monetary policymakers will need to prepare for the next storm by taking\nappropriate actions in advance to design and commit to a more resilient monetary\npolicy framework that is robust to a low r-star world. It’s imperative to study and\ndebate these issues now rather than wait until the next storm hits.\nAnother set of consequences of the global slump will be felt by fiscal and other public\npolicymakers worldwide. Unless the trend lines improve, they will likely find that they\nare repeatedly being asked to do more with less; in some cases much less. Many will\nface dramatic increases in unfunded liabilities such as pensions and safety net\nprograms.\nCountries that fail to act today will find their challenges getting even more severe\ntomorrow. With the sea change underway, we no longer have the luxury of taking a\nwait-and-see approach.\nThis begs the question, what does said action look like?\n12 Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2016) and Eggertsson et al. (2016).\n13 Williams (2016, 2017a).\n6\n\nAs a monetary policymaker, I wish I could tell you that it’s within the purview of\ncentral banks to solve all this; that the answer lies in raising or lowering interest rates.\nReality, unfortunately, dictates otherwise.\nOur long-term challenges are going to require the sort of long-term investments that\nfiscal policymakers – and private investors – have within their own toolkits:\nInvestments in education, job training, infrastructure, research and development … all\nthe things that propel an economy and prosperity over the longer term.\nCONCLUSION\nMy perspective is that of a statistician and economist rather than a politician or\ncolumnist: The data and the analysis tell the same story of a fundamental sea change\nin the global economy.\nWhile the causes of the global growth slump are well defined, the consequences are\nyet to be written – and they will ultimately be shaped by choices that policymakers are\ngrappling with across the globe. And, ultimately, the choices made by any one of our\nnations will impact all of our nations.\nThank you.\n7\n\nReferences\nBergeaud, Antonin, Gilbert Cette, and Rémy Lecat. 2016. “Productivity Trends in\nAdvanced Countries between 1890 and 2012.” Review of Income and Wealth 62(3), pp.\n420–444.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2017. “FOMC Projections\nMaterials.” June 14.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20170614.htm\nByrne, David M., John G.

W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nAt the\n2017 Asia Economic Policy Conference: Monetary Challenges in a Changing Global\nEnvironment\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNovember 16, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nGood afternoon everyone. The more astute among you will have already noticed that\nI’m not Stan Fischer. As you undoubtedly know, Stan stepped down as Vice Chair of\nthe Federal Reserve Board earlier this year. When I found out he was unable to attend\nthis conference, I thought the natural thing to do was to invite myself to speak in his\nplace, so here I am.\nPage 1 of 11\n\nI’ve chosen a cheery topic for today. I’m going to talk about the next recession and\nwhat we should do to prepare for it. The timing of this topic may seem strange at\nfirst. After all, we’re finally seeing the sustained rebound in global growth that we’ve\nlong been hoping for.\nBut, history teaches us that a recession will come at some point, and prudence\ndemands that we use this time of relative economic calm to plan for the storms ahead.\nEconomic realities for the world’s developed economies have fundamentally changed\nand dealing with the challenges of the future is going to be much harder than it was in\nthe past. Today I want to discuss how the world we live in has transformed. The\nglobal economy and the policy challenges that we face will be defined by slow trend\ngrowth, a very low natural rate of interest, and the lower bound on interest rates.\nBefitting this conference, I’m going to frame this in an international context. The\nchallenges ahead of us aren’t unique to the United States. They’re shared by many\neconomies around the world. And a global challenge requires a global perspective\nthat recognizes the interdependence of our economies and financial systems.\nAustrian diplomat, Klemens von Metternich is credited with saying when France\nsneezes, Europe catches a cold. The same can be said about the United States and the\nglobal economy. We are painfully aware that a recession in the United States can have\nserious consequences for the rest of the world: When the U.S. economy contracted\ndouble pneumonia in 2008, the world’s financial system stood on the edge of a\nprecipice.\nPage 2 of 11\n\nGiven the new global realities, how can we all be better prepared for the next\nrecession?\nBefore I ponder this question further, I think it would be wise to give the usual Fed\ndisclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those\nof anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. In fact, it would probably have been\neven wiser to have said that five minutes ago!\nA world of low r-star\nTo answer the question of how best to respond to future challenges, we first need to\nunderstand the ways in which economic fundamentals have altered the economic and\npolicy landscape.\nMost of the attention right now is on policy normalization. Central banks are pivoting\ntowards unwinding monetary stimulus. From a monetary policy perspective, the world\nis starting to look more “normal.” But what we’re looking at is actually a “new\nnormal,” characterized by trend growth and interest rates much lower than we’re used\nto.\nWhy is this? This is largely due to low r-star, the natural rate of interest, which is being\nheld down by a number of structural issues largely beyond the control of central\nbanks and monetary policy.\nSeveral factors appear to be at play in driving down r-star around the globe. One is a\nlower sustainable growth rate, reflecting slower productivity and labor force growth.\nPage 3 of 11\n\nA second is demographics: People are living longer and that is pushing up the supply\nof savings and depressing their returns.1 Third, global demand for safe assets remains\nelevated, pushing down yields on central bank policy rates.2 These trends predate the\nrecession and are unlikely to turn on a dime. So what does that mean for r-star going\nforward?\nAveraging across various estimates, r-star in the United States appears to be about 0.5\npercent in real terms, and that’s my view as well. Assuming inflation is running at our\ngoal of 2 percent in the future, the typical, or normal short-term interest rate would be\n2.5 percent. That’s a full 2 percentage points below what a normal interest rate looked\nlike 20 years ago.3\nVery low r-star is not confined to the U.S. economy. We’ve seen it across other major\ndeveloped countries: Demographics, slow productivity growth, and other influences\nhave driven the average r-star across Canada, the euro area, Japan, and the United\nKingdom below 0.5 percent.4\nFor many central banks, the near-term focus is still on the process of policy\nnormalization. But the fundamental changes taking place in developed economies\nmean it’s important we use this time to look at what’s on the horizon and build\nresiliency for the future.\n1 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017), Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016), and Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and\nRobbins (2017).\n2 Del Negro et al. (2017).\n3 For comparison, the median longer-run value of the federal funds rate in the Federal Open Market Committee’s most\nrecent economic projections is 2.75 percent (Board of Governors 2017).\n4 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017), Fujiwara et al. (2016).\nPage 4 of 11\n\nMonetary policy and the zero lower bound\nIf interest rates are only around 2 to 3 percent when the next recession hits,\nconventional monetary policy will have lost much of its punch. We won’t be able to\ncut interest rates by the typical 5 percentage points to stimulate the economy because\nwe’ll quickly hit the zero lower bound. The Fed, alongside other central banks, will\nagain have to consider unconventional monetary policy to stimulate the economy:\nwhether forward guidance, negative interest rates, and quantitative easing, to get the\neconomy back on track.5\nIn the United States, we managed to avoid using negative interest rates, but plenty of\nothers have used this unconventional tool to manage the crisis. Denmark, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, and Japan have all pushed interest rates below zero. Of course, there are\nlimits to how low you can go before people start stuffing their mattresses with cash.\nGiven the persistent challenge of the lower bound created by this world of low r-star,\nwhat are the options for monetary policy to tackle the next recession?\nA brief history of monetary policy\nBefore getting to the options, it’s important to understand the current framework for\nmonetary policy and how we arrived at it.\n5 Williams (2014, 2016).\nPage 5 of 11\n\nI recognize that it’s now fashionable to communicate in 140 characters or fewer. I\ncan’t give you a 150 year history of international monetary policy frameworks in 140\ncharacters, but I can do it in just seven sentences.\nDuring the late 19th century, most economies were on the gold standard, the first\nmonetary policy framework where currency was valued at a fixed amount of gold.\nFollowing the First World War and the Great Depression, countries started to move\noff the gold standard, and policymakers started to think about what might replace it.\nOut of that came the Bretton Woods system in 1944, which also tied the currencies of\ndeveloped economies to the price of gold. But the cost of the Vietnam War and\ninflation that followed led to the collapse of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s.\nOnce again policymakers looked around for a solution, and in 1989, the small country\nof New Zealand announced the main objective of its monetary policy was to target\nthe inflation rate. In the subsequent quarter century, nearly all central banks in major\neconomies coalesced around this approach of aiming for a low inflation rate, and,\nindeed, inflation targeting is the monetary policy framework du jour. But even New\nZealand has admitted this framework was more “by default than by high design,” and\none must ask if it’s the right approach for the future we have before us.6\n6 Archer (2000). See also Williams (2015) for a longer version of this history of monetary policy.\nPage 6 of 11\n\nAn international approach\nI quoted Metternich earlier by saying, “When France sneezes, Europe catches a cold.”\nOne of the major challenges of the interconnectedness of the global economy is that,\nwhen one major player gets a virus, the rest of us tend to catch it too, and central\nbanks need to react rapidly to reduce the seriousness of the contagion.\nWhile it may not be an epidemic, most major economies are grappling with the\nconsequences of a lower natural rate of interest. So a reexamination of the monetary\npolicy framework needs to happen in that context, rather than each central bank\nconsidering its problem in isolation. Policies that may work if only one country is at\nthe lower bound may not succeed if all are. To take one example, not all countries can\ndepreciate their currencies at the same time.\nWe will all be better able to contain the next economic recession if we develop\napproaches that succeed even when many countries are simultaneously constrained by\nthe lower bound. And that means taking into account the nature of monetary policy\nspillovers.\nLet me be clear: This is not about creating a formal agreement, because as you learned\nfrom my rapid history of monetary policy in seven sentences, these don’t tend to be\nvery successful. This is more about recognizing the global nature of today’s economy\nand developing a framework and strategies that work well together, rather than at\ncross-purposes.\nPage 7 of 11\n\nSo, what are the options? In the best of all worlds, fiscal and other policies would be\nput in place that propel long-run economic prosperity and boost r-star on a sustained\nbasis.7 But I fear that those changes may not arrive soon enough, if at all, and we need\nto prepare for a world of low r-star for the foreseeable future.\nAbsent such a reversal in r-star, there are a number of potential alternative strategies\nto cope with a low natural rate of interest. One approach is to plan on relying on\nunconventional policy tools, that is, follow the same playbook as during this past\ndecade and hope that suffices.8 A second is to find ways to make the lower bound\nmore negative, giving conventional monetary policy more room to maneuver.9 A third\nis to raise the inflation target.10 And fourth is to modify inflation targeting by moving\nto a price level or nominal income target.11\nEach of these alternatives has significant advantages and disadvantages, which need\nfurther careful study and discussion. I’m talking about these choices today not\nbecause I advocate an abrupt about-face in policy, but to advance a conversation\nabout what a different international framework might look like.12 Of course the major\nproblem with some of these approaches such as price level targeting is that no one’s\ntried it yet! And experiments where the safety of the world’s financial system is at\nstake are high risk, to say the very least.\n7 Williams (2016).\n8 Reifschneider (2016).\n9 Bernanke (2016).\n10 Williams (2009), Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2010), and Ball (2014).\n11 Williams (2017), Bernanke (2017).\n12 See additional discussion in Williams (2016).\nPage 8 of 11\n\nThat said, I am encouraged by the willingness of leading experts and policymakers to\nseriously discuss and develop these ideas in the context of low r-star in the United\nStates. I and others have discussed the merits of price level targeting. Ben Bernanke\nrecently built on this work by suggesting a temporary price level target, to apply only\nwhen short-term interest rates are at or very near the zero lower bound.13 These are\nthe kinds of conversations we need to be having to put us in the best position\npossible to tackle the next recession. But these discussions need to happen across all\ncountries to ensure that the next recession causes only coughs and colds rather than\nwidespread pneumonia.\nConclusion\nLadies and gentlemen, I am by nature an optimist. But even for a glass half-full kind\nof guy, it would be downright naïve to assume we won’t face another economic\ndownturn. So it’s prudent to spend this period examining our monetary policy\nframework and considering how to make ourselves more resilient. No one’s yet come\nup with a cure for the common cold, but we do know that good hand-washing,\nvitamin C, and rest can reduce symptoms and prevent it from spreading. Now is the\ntime to stock up on tissues and make sure we’re as well prepared as we can be for the\nnext recession.\n13 Bernanke (2017).\nPage 9 of 11\n\nReferences\nArcher, David J. 2000. “A Presentation to a Seminar on Inflation Targeting.” International Monetary\nFund, March. https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000/targets/archer.htm\nBall, Laurence. 2014. “The Case for a Long-Run Inflation Target of Four Percent.” IMF Working\nPaper 14/92, June. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/The-Case-\nfor-a-Long-Run-Inflation-Target-of-Four-Percent-41625\nBernanke Ben S. 2016. “What Tools Does the Fed Have Left?

    "text": "Presentation to Portland Community Leaders\nPortland, OR\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on July 12, 2012\nPresident Williams presented similar remarks to the joint convention of the Idaho, Nevada, and\nOregon Bankers Associations, Coeur d'Alene, ID, on July 9, 2012.\nThe Economic Outlook and Challenges to Monetary Policy1\nGood afternoon. I’m delighted to be with you in the City of Roses, which is at its most\nbeautiful this time of year. Unfortunately, my schedule is keeping me indoors most of the time,\nso most of my views of Mt. Hood have been through office windows.\nOf course, you didn’t come to hear me praise Portland’s scenic wonders. My subject\ntoday is the economy. In my talk, I’ll outline how it is doing and where it appears to be heading.\nI’ll explain some of the factors holding us back. And I’ll discuss some of the major risks that\nthreaten even my subdued outlook—especially the ongoing crisis in Europe. I’ll also speak\nabout what this challenging environment means for Federal Reserve policy, given our mandate to\npursue maximum employment and price stability. As always, my remarks represent my own\nviews and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe backdrop is that we are still recovering from the most severe financial crisis and the\ndeepest recession since the 1930s. Following the housing boom of the first half of the 2000s,\nhome prices crashed, wiping out almost $6.5 trillion in household wealth. Rising mortgage\ndelinquencies and plunging asset values pushed many financial institutions to the brink of\ninsolvency, and some failed. Businesses of all sorts slashed employment. The recession ended\n1 I want to thank John Fernald, Reuven Glick, and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nthree years ago, but the recovery has lacked the vigor of typical cyclical rebounds. Indeed, to\nmany Americans, it seems very much like we’re still in a recession.\nNow, this is by no means the first financial crisis, and, around the world, it turns out that\na subpar economic recovery is pretty typical following such an episode.2 In this occasion,\nlenders, households, and businesses came out of the recession in a defensive crouch, which left a\nlegacy of tight credit and uncertainty.3\nStill, it’s important to stress that the economy continues to improve. By that, I mean that\neconomic output has been expanding and private employers have added jobs every month for\nover two years. The unemployment rate has fallen from a cyclical high of 10 percent to its June\nreading of 8.2 percent. However, that rate is still much too high, and economic growth is far\nshort of what’s needed to keep bringing it down quickly. What’s more, the economy has lost\nsome momentum in recent months as gains in consumer and business spending have slowed. In\naddition, financial markets are once more under strain in response to the flare-up of the European\ncrisis.\nFortunately, these developments have not brought our forward motion to a halt. Credit\nconditions overall are much improved from a few years ago. For many borrowers, interest rates\nremain at or near historic lows. Consumer and business demand pent up during the recession is\nstill reviving, although at a slower pace than earlier in the year. For example, car sales collapsed\nduring the downturn. Now, with auto financing rates at rock bottom, motor vehicle sales are\nclimbing, up nearly 14 percent in the first six months of 2012 from the year-earlier period and\n2 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011).\n3 See Williams (2012a) for a discussion of the financial roots of the crisis and how they have affected the pace of\nrecovery.\n2\n\nmore than 50 percent from their recession lows. Similarly, business investment in equipment\nand software rose over 8 percent during the past year, adjusted for inflation.\nAn encouraging sign is that housing has started to show signs of life. Although housing\nis still deeply depressed and recovery hopes have been dashed before, a number of indicators hint\nwe may be turning a corner. Homebuilding is beginning to tick up. Sales are rising and\ninventories of unsold homes are coming down. The huge backlog of foreclosed properties is\nbeginning to get worked off. Nationally, home prices no longer appear to be falling and, in some\nareas, they are increasing.\nOf course, a healthy economy requires vibrant financial institutions. These days, the\ncondition of the U.S. banking system is mixed, reflecting the economic picture I’ve described.\nConditions have improved notably since the depths of the recession, but there’s still a\nconsiderable way to go. I was encouraged by the stress tests of the nation’s largest banking\norganizations completed earlier this year. They showed that capital levels at most of these banks\nwould still be adequate, even if the economy fell into an extreme, and highly unlikely, downturn.\nSmaller banks are in better shape too. Here, in the western United States, many community\nbanks have strengthened asset quality, liquidity, and capital levels.\nMeanwhile, as the economy has improved, loan demand has begun to revive. Although\nmany businesses remain cautious about taking on big capital projects, the volume of new\ncommercial and industrial loans has been rising. That’s a good sign for bank earnings.\nAt the Fed, of course, we want banks to make soundly underwritten loans. In the 12th\nDistrict, financially healthy banks with solid balance sheets are generally extending credit in a\nway that’s good for the economy. During the 12 months ending in March 2012, loans grew over\n6 percent among the District’s strongest banks—those with a regulatory rating of 1 or 2 on the 5-\n3\n\npoint CAMELS scale. By contrast, weaker banks with financial problems left over from the\ncrisis can’t readily expand lending.\nClearly, the financial system must continue to heal in order to support stronger economic\ngrowth. The reverse is true as well. The recovering economy has helped strengthen the banking\nindustry, and a prolonged economic slowdown would be a setback.\nAs I mentioned, the pace of growth has been frustratingly slow, and we’ve seen some\nloss of momentum in recent months. In part, this reflects two major developments weighing on\nthe economy. The first is the budget squeeze at all levels of government. The federal\ngovernment cut taxes and increased spending during the recession and the early stages of\nrecovery. This was due partly to automatic increases in programs such as unemployment\ninsurance, and partly to specific stimulus measures aimed at supporting the economy. Those\nprograms gave the economy a badly needed boost, but they have been unwinding over the past\nyear and a half. Meanwhile, state and local governments have been slashing employment and\nspending in the past few years as they struggle to balance budgets in the face of lower tax\nrevenue. Overall, combined federal, state, and local government payrolls have dropped by more\nthan 600,000 workers in the past three years. From stimulus early in the recovery, the\ngovernment sector has turned into a significant drag on growth.4\nAnd there is no relief in sight. Two major federal programs are set to expire at the end of\nthe year: the temporary payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits. In addition, caps\non discretionary government spending will go into effect then. All this is something I’ve taken\ninto account in my forecast. But there’s a risk that federal cutbacks could be more dramatic than\nI expect. Unless Congress acts, a number of other large tax increases and spending cuts will start\nup automatically at the beginning of next year. A recent Congressional Budget Office report\n4 See Lucking and Wilson (2012).\n4\n\nsuggested these additional measures could knock about 1½ percentage points off economic\ngrowth in 2013, which would mean that the economy would barely expand next year. This\nprospect has been dubbed a “fiscal cliff.”\nI hope and expect an agreement will be reached to prevent such a damaging fall off the\nfiscal cliff. Nevertheless, federal budgetary policy is moving toward greater belt tightening, and\nthis austerity will dampen growth next year. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding the federal\nbudget is affecting decisions right now. Some government contractors tell me they are already\ntrimming employment and production because they don’t want to get stuck with excess workers\nand inventory next year. More generally, my contacts say that concerns about the looming\nbudget deadline make businesses reluctant to take on new projects.\nThe second development restraining the U.S. economy is the European sovereign debt\ncrisis, which has led to renewed stresses in global financial markets. I won’t go into detail about\nthe origins of this dire situation. What’s important to understand is that Greece’s deep recession\nand large fiscal deficit has spiraled into a wider emergency that threatens economies and\nfinancial systems throughout the euro area—and even the very existence of a broad monetary\nunion in Europe.\nThe current approach, based mainly on fiscal austerity, can’t alone solve the problems\nplaguing Europe. The European rescue package for Greece demands thoroughgoing economic\nreforms and severe austerity. Many other countries are doing the same. Although fundamental\neconomic and budgetary reforms are needed to ensure the long-run health of these economies,\nfiscal retrenchment has choked off economic growth. That makes it even harder to reduce\ngovernment deficits in the next few years.\n5\n\nMeanwhile, the crisis keeps spreading. Most recently, Spain has found itself in the\ncrosshairs. Spain’s problems didn’t originate with a fiscal crisis. Instead, like us, they went\nthrough an enormous housing boom and bust. That loaded the nation’s banks with bad loans,\nrequiring massive recapitalization. The Spanish government found itself facing an enormous bill\nto rescue its banks, and its borrowing costs soared to unsustainable levels. Recent\nannouncements from Europe have been encouraging on this front. Spain’s euro-area partners\nhave agreed to use European rescue funds to recapitalize Spain’s ailing banks. This is an\nimportant step in the right direction. That said, the terms have yet to be worked out. And the\ndanger remains that uncertainty and fear will once again outrun the slow-motion responses of\nEuropean governments.\nOver and over again, European authorities have struggled to get a grip on the crisis. One\nbasic problem is that they’ve taken a piecemeal approach by providing rescue packages to\nindividual countries. These steps calm markets temporarily, but don’t yield a credible,\ncomprehensive solution to the underlying problems that Europe faces. Until such a solution is in\nplace, I am afraid that Europe will remain vulnerable to new shocks.\nWe are tied to Europe on many levels, and we are already feeling Europe’s pain. One\ntransmission channel is trade. About a fifth of our exports go to countries in the European\nUnion. Many countries in the region are already in recession, and that has slowed our export\ngrowth. A second, more important link is through financial markets. Global investors are\nfleeing to the safety of U.S. Treasury securities. This has supported extraordinarily low interest\nrates for high-quality U.S. borrowers. But, here in the United States, most of the financial effects\nof the European crisis work against growth. For example, the capital flowing into our markets\nhas boosted the value of the dollar. That makes our goods and services less competitive\n6\n\noverseas. And investors have become more wary of taking on risk, which pushed down the\nprices of all kinds of risky assets, including U.S. stocks and some corporate bonds.\nSo where does the economy’s good news, bad news story leave us? On balance, it makes\nfor frustratingly slow growth. The slowdown in domestic demand and global strains in financial\nmarkets have led me to trim my forecast for growth somewhat. I now expect real gross domestic\nproduct to expand by a little less than 2 percent this year and about 2¼ percent next year.\nOver the past year, the economy has added about 150,000 jobs per month, and the\nunemployment rate has fallen nearly a percentage point. The trend in job growth is probably\nlower now. I still anticipate gains above what we’ve seen recently, probably between 100,000\nand 150,000 jobs per month. But such a pace of job gains is just a bit above the projected growth\nof the labor force. So I expect that the unemployment rate will remain at or above 8 percent until\nthe second half of 2013. What that means is that progress on bringing down the unemployment\nrate has probably slowed to a snail’s pace and perhaps even stalled.\nTurning to inflation, I expect the inflation rate to come in below the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget both this year and next. This forecast reflects several factors. A sluggish labor market is\nkeeping a lid on compensation costs. A stronger dollar is holding down import prices. And the\nglobal growth slowdown has pushed down the prices of crude oil and other commodities.\nMy forecast is based on what I consider the most likely scenario. However, I am much\nmore uncertain than usual about this forecast. I’ve mentioned the threat of automatic large tax\nincreases and spending cuts at the start of 2013. But the most important wild card for the U.S.\neconomy is Europe.\nMy forecast assumes that Europe’s distressed pattern of the past two years will continue,\nbut that the situation won’t spin out of control. However, it is impossible to predict with any\n7\n\ncertainty how these circumstances will play out. Europe’s crisis could escalate much more than I\nexpect. A development that might not be disastrous on its own, such as a Greek decision to\nabandon the euro, could touch off a panic. European credit markets could freeze up as ours did\nin 2008. If that were to happen, the U.S. economy could be severely damaged. Our exports to\nEurope would fall sharply. Although U.S. financial institutions have been paring their exposure\nto Europe, our financial markets would probably still be severely disrupted. For example,\nresearch at the San Francisco Fed finds that over the past few years, when European corporate\ndebt spreads have widened, U.S. debt spreads have responded roughly two-thirds as much—a\nsizeable reaction that would affect economic growth here.5\nIf the spillover from Europe were severe enough, much of the progress made in our own\nfinancial system could be undone. We might find ourselves in a renewed credit crunch, which\nwould take a terrible toll on the economy.\nSo far in my talk, I’ve described the economic and financial environments, presented my\noutlook, and outlined two serious risks we face. For the Federal Reserve, this is a sobering set of\ncircumstances. Congress assigned the Fed a dual mandate to guide us in setting monetary policy:\nachieving maximum employment and price stability. Let me describe where we stand on these\nobjectives.\nMaximum employment is a moving target that depends on how efficient the labor market\nis at matching workers with jobs. It’s not a number you can measure directly. Economists\nfiercely debate what it might be. Expressed in terms of the unemployment rate, I estimate that\nmaximum employment is currently around 6¼ percent.6 The current unemployment rate is far\nabove that level, which means we are far short of maximum employment by any reasonable\n5 Hale, Marks, and Nechio (2012).\n6 See Daly et al. (2011) and Williams (2012b).\n8\n\nmeasure. What’s more, with the economy’s recent loss of momentum, job creation will barely\nkeep up with labor force growth. As a result, I expect little progress toward maximum\nemployment over the next year or more.\nThe second part of the Fed’s mandate is price stability. As I’ve noted, our policy body,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee, has specified that a 2 percent inflation rate is most\nconsistent with maximum employment and price stability. Over the past year, prices rose 1.5\npercent, according to the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. Falling commodity prices, a\nrising dollar, and subdued labor costs suggest that inflation will fall to around 1¼ percent this\nyear and then rebound somewhat to about 1¾ percent next year.\nWhat does this mean for the Fed? We are falling short on both our employment and price\nstability mandates, and I expect that we will make only very limited progress toward these goals\nover the next year. Moreover, strains in global financial markets raise the prospect that\neconomic growth and progress on employment will be even slower than I anticipate. In these\ncircumstances, it is essential that we provide sufficient monetary accommodation to keep our\neconomy moving towards our employment and price stability mandates.\nAt our June FOMC meeting, we reiterated our intention to hold our benchmark short-\nterm interest rate at exceptionally low levels at least through late 2014. In addition, we\nannounced an extension of one of our unconventional monetary policy initiatives, a program\nthat’s been dubbed “Operation Twist.” This is a program to increase our holdings of longer-term\nU.S. Treasury securities and decrease our holdings of shorter-term Treasuries by the same\namount. The continuation of this program through the end of this year will put further\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates, easing broader financial conditions. In truth\nthough, the extension of this program will probably have a relatively modest impact on the\n9\n\neconomy. Therefore, the FOMC noted that it “is prepared to take further action as appropriate to\npromote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in\na context of price stability.”7\nIf further action is called for, the most effective tool would be additional purchases of\nlonger-maturity securities, including agency mortgage-backed securities.

    "text": "Presentation to NBER East Asia Seminar on Economics, San Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on June 19, 2015\nData Is the New Black: Monetary Policy by the Numbers\nGood morning and welcome. It’s a pleasure to have everyone at the San Francisco Fed.\nSeeing as this is a conference on East Asia, and as I recently returned from a trip to the\nregion, I thought I’d say a few words about that visit. Then I’ll give a brief U.S. economic\noutlook, after which I’ll tell you the exact date we will be raising rates. Before anyone calls their\nbroker, that was a joke.\nAs always, my views are mine and mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nChina\nAs I said, I recently returned from a trip that included Singapore, Hong Kong, and China.\nThe full debrief would be too lengthy to recount here, so I’ll keep my remarks to the subject\nmost on people’s minds: China.\nIt’s fair to say that many current discussions of China on this side of the world have\nturned from a once awed envy of its extraordinary rise to a pessimistic prognostication of an\nimminent hard landing. People point to slower growth, the unsustainability of the current export-\ndriven model, concern about debt buildup, and the risk of falling investment. This translates into\nworry about the repercussions both regionally and around the globe.\nThis is a subject I heard in every meeting and every conversation. I have to say that after\nhaving firsthand discussions with officials, analysts, and policymakers in the region, I walked\naway a lot less concerned about China’s near-term economic outlook than when I walked in.\n1\n\nThe main issue is that the Chinese government is facing a trade-off between their short-\nrun growth goal and their longer-term reform agenda. For instance, late last year they instituted a\nnumber of reform initiatives that clamped down on local government borrowing. This was\nintended to rationalize credit allocation, but it was also having a negative effect on growth, in no\nsmall part because it impacted infrastructure investment, a key engine of growth for China these\ndays.\nThis is where response clearly indicates intent. In this case, the government eased up and\npostponed those reforms to maintain solid economic growth. This has happened in a number of\ninstances; when the Chinese authorities see growth slowing, or other negative economic impacts,\nthey take steps to keep growth near their target level. Many of the issues that overseas\ncommentators are worried about can be addressed with fiscal and other policies, and China has\nproven again and again to have both the will and the leeway to take the necessary policy actions.\nI’m confident that they will do so again if needed.\nThey are also realistic about what that target growth level should be. The days of double-\ndigit growth are behind China. Most economists and officials there understand that the number is\nlikely to move even lower than the current 7 percent target, due to myriad factors including\ndemographics and the simple fact that years of prosperity and success have moved China into a\nbracket in which there’s a lot less road to make up and therefore less growth required to power to\nthe top. In fact, you hear the phrase “new normal” just as much in China as you do here. For us,\nit’s the possibility of changing norms in a post-recession economy. For them, it’s an\nacknowledgment that they can’t look to meet some outdated growth target.\nThe cost of taking this measured approach may be extending the horizon for some of\ntheir reforms. Nonetheless, it’s clear that they’ve continued to make strong progress on the\n2\n\nreform agenda, including financial market liberalization, movements towards internationalization\nof the renminbi, and a move to a more market-oriented economy.\nOf course, nothing is certain, and China still faces daunting challenges as it makes its\nway down the reform-agenda road. But all in all, I came back from Asia with a firm sense of two\nthings: First that, to paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of China’s economic death are greatly\nexaggerated, and second, Singapore is way too hot to wear a suit and tie.\nReading the tea leaves of first-quarter growth\nTurning to our side of the globe, the official reading of first-quarter real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth was admittedly very poor. However, on closer inspection, the numbers\nweren’t nearly as bad as they appeared. Research at the San Francisco Fed and elsewhere has\nhighlighted unusual seasonal patterns in the GDP numbers, with first-quarter growth tending to\ncome in well below that in other quarters.1\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis uses a bottom-up method to calculate seasonal\nadjustments at a narrow level to arrive at its overall numbers. They do this for a number of\nreasons that are appropriate for their purposes.\nBut for monetary policy, it’s better to have the most accurate reflection of the broad\neconomy. To get a measure that avoids seasonal patterns, SF Fed economists ran a second round\nof seasonal adjustment, not just on GDP, but on gross domestic income (GDI) and something\ncalled GDP Plus, a new measure of economy-wide activity that combines GDP and GDI and\nstrips out the extraneous noise.2\n1 Rudebusch, Wilson and Mahedy (2015). See also Gilbert et al. (2015), Groen and Russo (2015), Liesman (2015),\nand Stark (2015).\n2 For more information on GDP Plus, see Aruoba et al. (2013) and http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/real-time-center/gdpplus/.\n3\n\nAfter correcting for recurring seasonal patterns in this way, the data show GDP actually\ngrew about 1½ percent in the first quarter. GDI and GDP Plus growth were about 3 and 2¾\npercent, respectively. Based on these corrected numbers and relative to trend growth of about 2\npercent, growth appears to have been roughly on track in the first quarter. More recent data on\nspending have been encouraging, indicating the economy is still on a solid trajectory with a good\ndeal of forward momentum. Looking forward, I expect growth to average about 2¾ percent for\nthe next several quarters, then slow to a more sustainable pace next year.\nEmployment\nDespite the mixed signals we’re getting on spending growth in the first quarter, the signs\nfrom the labor market have been consistent, marked by continued, solid improvement. Not only\nhas there been strong job growth, but the data show most of those new jobs are full-time and\nhigher paying. A wide set of other measures of labor market conditions have continued to trend\nupward as well.\nThis is all welcome news, but it does provoke the question: When will we have reached\nour employment goal? The simple answer is when we hit the natural rate of unemployment,\nwhich in my estimation is 5.2 percent. The data convince me that we’ll be there before the end of\nthe year. But there are other measures of labor market underutilization that suggest there’s\nadditional labor market slack out there. As I said, we’re making good progress across most\nmeasures of the labor market. One is unemployed people who’ve dropped out of the labor force\nbut still want to work, for instance. The good news is that that figure has come way down and is\nnow just where you’d expect it to be given the modest amount of overall slack in the labor\nmarket.\n4\n\nOne remaining puzzle is the still large number of people working part-time who want to\nbe full time. So-called involuntary part-time work soared during the recession and has remained\nunusually high during the recovery. The question here is, how much of that is due to an economy\nstill not at full strength and how much is due to other, more persistent influences? Recent\nresearch by SF Fed staff shows that most of the rise in involuntary part-time work was, in fact,\nrelated to the economic downturn. But there is an outside component—largely reflecting changes\nin industry employment shares and demographics—that may account for much, if not all, of the\nhigh rate of involuntary part-time work.3 We aren’t yet sure about the life span of these factors;\nthey could dissipate over time, or they could reflect a permanent shift—another “new normal” of\nthe post-recession world.4 But they suggest that the current rate of involuntary part-time\nemployment does not indicate a level of slack that is out of proportion with other indicators.\nAnother positive sign regarding the labor market is the increases we are seeing in wages.\nFor some time, there was concern that this was an area seemingly immune to the recovery. In\nactuality, the stagnation in wage growth wasn’t particularly surprising, because history and\nexperience show us that wage growth doesn’t really start to pick up until the economy nears full\nemployment. Now that wage growth is starting to take off across multiple measures, it further\nconfirms that the labor market is nearly healed. While businesses aren’t always thrilled about the\nprospect of paying workers more, a pickup in wages is a sign of a healthy economy. It’s good for\nthe labor market, good for household income, good for consumer spending, and therefore good\nfor business. In fact, what’s really been missing in this recovery is wage growth that’s around 3\nor 3½ percent. That’s the rate I’d expect in a fully functioning economy with a 2 percent\ninflation rate. Now we’re starting to see that come to fruition, and it’s a good sign.\n3 Daly and Hobijn (2014, 2015).\n4 Valletta and Van der List (2015). See also Cajner et al. (2014).\n5\n\nTaken together, all signs point to a labor market that has made huge progress over the last\nfew years and is zeroing in on full employment. We may not have far to go to close the\nremaining gap, though there is still some work to be done. As I mentioned, I see us reaching full\nemployment by later this year.\nAs we make our way to an economy that’s fully back on track, it’s important to consider\nwhat we should expect along the way. The pace of both growth and the decline in the\nunemployment rate have slowed recently, and that’s to be expected. When unemployment was at\nits 10 percent peak during the height of the Great Recession, and as it struggled to come down\nduring the recovery, we needed a fast pace of decline. With the goal in sight, however, the\nurgency is not the same. Then, we needed to create lots of jobs to get the economy back on track;\nnow, we’re near the end zone, and there are fewer yards to go. Looking towards next year, what\nwe really want to see is an economy that’s growing at a steady pace of around 2 percent. If jobs\nand growth kept the same pace as last year, we would seriously overshoot our mark and the\neconomy would overheat. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and it’s\nactually desirable, that the pace is slowing.\nInflation\nOf course, nothing is perfect. Even with the positive signs I’ve mentioned, inflation is\nstill well below our 2 percent goal. In fact, it has remained stubbornly below 2 percent for over\nthree years now. The low rate of inflation today is in part due to transitory factors like the recent\nfall in energy prices and the strength of the dollar.5 Now we’re seeing oil edging higher and the\ndollar edging lower, so the downward pressure from those factors will recede. In addition, with\nthe economy nearing full strength, we should start seeing signs that underlying inflation trends\nare coming back up. But, so far, that’s a forecast, not a reality. In that regard, recent inflation\n5 Williams (2015).\n6\n\nreadings are okay—“okay” being a technical economic term—but I have yet to see convincing\nsigns that the underlying trend in inflation has bottomed out and is poised to move back to 2\npercent. So the inflation data haven’t been discouraging, but they haven’t been as encouraging as\nI would like either.\nNonetheless, I still expect inflation to move back up to our target over the next couple of\nyears. With a strengthening economy, special factors dissipating, wages on the rise, inflation\nexpectations stable at 2 percent, and, importantly, full employment in sight, I see all the factors\nin place to meet our inflation goal by the end of next year.6 But the point of being data dependent\nis that information drives your decisions; and while my forecast looks great, I am wary of acting\nbefore gathering more evidence that inflation’s trajectory is on the desired path.\nImplications for monetary policy\nWhich leads to the part people really care about: What does this mean for interest rates?\nAs I say without fail, policy is data dependent. And the difficulty of being data dependent is that\ndata can be all over the place, as my discussion of first-quarter growth attests. Until I have more\nconfidence that inflation will be moving back to 2 percent, I’ll continue to be in wait-and-see\nmode regarding raising interest rates. That doesn’t mean I’m changing my forecast; it means\neconomic forecasting and the data-based assessments required to make enormously impactful\npolicy decisions are two different things. I’ll be looking at the evidence, and every FOMC\nmeeting is on the table.\nI still believe this will be the year for liftoff, and I still believe that waiting too long to\nraise rates poses its own risks. I know not everyone agrees and there are those who believe we\nshould wait until we’re nipping at the heels of 2 percent. My reasons for advocating a rise before\nthat happens remain the same. Monetary policy has long and variable lags, as Milton Friedman\n6 See Nechio (2015) regarding inflation expectations.\n7\n\nfamously taught us.7 Specifically, research shows it takes at least a year or two to have its full\neffect.8 We’re therefore dealing with my favorite analogy: The car speeding towards a red light.\nIf you don’t ease up on the gas, you’ll have to slam on the brakes, possibly even skidding into\nthe intersection. Waiting until we’re close enough to dance with 2 percent means the very real\nrisk of having to dramatically raise rates to reverse course, which could destabilize markets and\npotentially derail the recovery. I see a safer course in starting sooner and proceeding more\ngradually.\nIt’s also important to remember that when we do raise rates, we will not be instituting\ntight policy; we’ll be easing back on extremely accommodative policy, and those are two very\ndifferent things. Policy will continue to be accommodative, and the Fed’s $4 trillion-plus balance\nsheet will continue to provide substantial stimulus. There’s no need to worry that we’re cutting\nthe legs out from underneath the economy.\nConclusion\nAll in all, things are looking good, despite some mixed signals from the data from earlier\nin the year. I see growth on a good trajectory, full employment in sight, wages on the rise, and\ninflation gradually moving back up to meet our goal. I can’t tell you the date of liftoff…but I\ncouldn’t anyway. I can say that it’s going to be an interesting rest of the year for monetary\npolicy, and the Fed in general. Thank you.\nReferences\nAruoba, S. Borağan, Francis X.

    "text": "Presentation to the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and U.S. Embassy Speaker Series\nSingapore, Singapore\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on March 29, 2016\nTrick of the Light?\nThe U.S. Economy, Global Growth, and International Risks in Perspective\nGood evening. This is my second trip to Singapore, and I’m very pleased to be back—the\npeople, the pace, and especially the food are wonderful. It’s been an amazing journey.\nAs I’m sure you all know, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is maximum employment\nand price stability. In its simplest terms, we want everyone who wants a job to be able to find\none and for inflation to average 2 percent per year.\nI mention it only because when we talk about U.S. monetary policy—particularly when\nso much recent attention has focused on global turbulence—the discussion can sometimes\noverlook that these two fundamental goals are central to the decisions we make. It’s important to\nremember that, as a Fed policymaker, I’m always going to view our decisions through the lens of\nthose objectives.\nNow is probably a good time to inject the standard disclaimer that the views expressed\ntoday are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nSo having set that baseline, I’d like to talk to you this evening about where we are on\neach of those goals, where I see the U.S. and global economy headed, and how that informs my\nviews on monetary policy. Importantly, I want to address some of the more prominent concerns\nthat have made headlines lately—the spoiler alert is that it’s not as bad as everyone thinks.\nEmployment\n1\n\nTurning first to U.S. employment, things are looking very good. There are a variety of\nmeasures to gauge the health of the labor market, but the most widely discussed, and most\nfrequently used, is the unemployment rate. Unemployment will never be zero, because in any\nwell-functioning economy, people leave jobs and new people enter the workforce. Economists\nuse the term “natural rate of unemployment” to describe the optimal rate for an economy at full\nhealth. It’s hard to know what the exact number is, but I put the natural rate at about 5 percent.\nWe’ve dipped just below that mark, to 4.9 percent, and I expect the unemployment rate to\ncontinue to edge down, reaching the mid-4s by late this year. This is a reflection of steady\nimprovement in a labor market that has fully recovered from the recession and its aftermath,\nwhen we saw a peak of 10 percent.\nOf course, there are other indicators, which have been the focus of much debate and\nconcern—workers who are part-time for economic reasons and the labor force participation rate\nhave received particular attention. There is some worry that these represent a workforce in more\ntrouble than the unemployment rate alone would indicate. But looking more closely at the data,\nwe’ve actually come quite far on both. In fact, while part-time employment for economic reasons\nlooks like it’s still somewhat elevated relative to historical norms, the labor force participation\nrate now appears to be consistent with its longer-term trend—or what we might more simply call\n“normal.”1\nA further sign of labor market health is that more people are quitting their jobs. People\nhave greater confidence that they’ll find work, and they’re probably right: Job vacancies are\nhovering around the highest levels since they started collecting the data back in 2000, and we\nadded 2¾ million jobs in 2015. To sum up, we have either reached or are close to maximum\nemployment across a broad range of markers.\n1 Valletta, Bengali, and van der List (2015) and Aaronson et al. (2014).\n2\n\nU.S. inflation\nOn the inflation side, we’re not quite where I’d like us to be, but recent developments\nhave been very encouraging and add to my confidence that we’re on course to reach our goal.\nThe Fed sets a target of 2 percent average inflation. I want to emphasize the word\n“average.” We don’t need inflation to be exactly 2 percent all the time, and small movements in\neither direction shouldn’t lead to alarm. We’re looking—on average, in the medium term—for\ninflation to be about 2 percent. Worry should only set in if it’s persistently above or below that\nnumber.\nI’d also like to stress the “above or below” part. Many people think that Fed\npolicymakers’ concern lies disproportionately with inflation that’s too high. They think we view\ninflation lower than 2 percent as sort of “not great,” but see inflation above 2 percent as\ncatastrophic. That’s not the case. In my view, inflation somewhat above 2 percent is just as bad\nas the same amount below. And here’s the one place I actually am speaking for others in the\nFederal Reserve System—the January Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement\nexplicitly addressed this issue.2\nFor the past few years, inflation has been persistently too low, but we’re starting to see\nsome upward movement. Over the past year, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index, stands at 1 percentage point. Measures of underlying\ninflation like core inflation—which strips out volatile components like food and energy—or the\ntrimmed mean, are running about 1¾ percent over the past year. Fed officials do understand that\ngas and groceries are important parts of household budgets. It’s just that for making policy, we\nneed to look at the underlying trends that give us a better picture of where inflation is likely\nheaded.\n2 Board of Governors (2016).\n3\n\nAll in all, the recent data reinforce my expectation that inflation is on track to move back\nto 2 percent over the next two years.\nThe tug-of-war and mixed signals\nCurrent U.S. inflation pressures represent a tug-of-war that is playing out in the overall\neconomy. On one side, falling prices for energy and most imported goods have pulled inflation\ndown, reflecting the strong U.S. dollar and other international developments. On the other, rising\nprices for domestic services are mostly trying to yank us back to the 2 percent line. When you\nlook at the parts of the American economy that are not traded globally, like housing rents, we’re\nseeing prices increase in a way that reflects a stronger, tightening economy. And in services\nmore generally, inflation is running a touch above 2 percent.\nWhen we look at the U.S. domestic market in isolation, it shows strong growth. We’re\njust contending with outside forces. When the price of oil plummeted by some 70 percent and the\nvalue of the dollar increased by over 20 percent, it naturally influenced near-term inflation. But,\nwith oil prices recouping some of their losses and the dollar stabilizing, the effects of these past\nmovements should peter out. That’s another reason I’m confident that we’re on track to reach our\ninflation goal.\nMixed signals can also be seen in the way certain sectors are slowing down while the\noverall economy keeps chugging ahead. Some sectors have underperformed lately, specifically\nthose that are directly affected by the strong dollar, weak foreign demand, and falling energy and\ncommodity prices. But the hardest-hit ones—manufacturing, drilling and mining, and\nagriculture—account for a relatively small share of employment and GDP. By contrast, the large\ndomestic services sector—including restaurants, health care, and business services—is doing\n4\n\nquite well, and makes up the huge majority of American jobs. In last year’s impressive jobs\ngrowth, 93 percent were in services, including government.\nThe forecast\nDespite recent financial market volatility, my overall outlook for both the U.S. and the\nglobal economy remains largely unchanged over the past few months. I’m not claiming that I can\nsee for miles, but since autumn of last year, I’ve expected GDP growth to be a bit above 2\npercent this year and the unemployment rate to fall to roughly 4½ percent by the end of the year.\nSome other economists’ growth forecasts have been revised down, like the Blue Chip\nconsensus.3 But those numbers are actually now largely in line with what I’m predicting for\n2016, which is far from grim.\nOne reason my U.S. outlook has held steady is that the outlook for the rest of the world\nhasn’t changed much either. That may seem surprising, given the attention paid to financial\nvolatility and melancholia about global growth over the past several months. But despite what\nmight be implied by the public discussion, forecasts of world growth haven’t changed that much.\nFor example, the latest forecast for global GDP growth in 2016 from the International Monetary\nFund is about 3½ percent, down only one-half percentage point from a year ago and still better\nthan the most recent estimate of 3 percent growth in 2015.4\nRisks, concerns, and the global economy\nSo let’s talk about the obvious risks and areas of economic concern that endless column\ninches have been dedicated to chronicling. I’m certainly not dismissing them, and our most\nrecent FOMC statement was pretty clear that our glasses aren’t tinted by the rosy hue of U.S.\ndomestic growth.\n3 Blue Chip Economic Indicators (2016).\n4 International Monetary Fund (2015, 2016).\n5\n\nIn the popular discussion, market volatility and global economic developments have\ntaken center stage. I understand the concern, and I’m carefully monitoring how things unfold.\nBut I want to be clear what that means, and to clarify each in turn.\nWhile financial volatility and the accompanying fears have diminished somewhat since\nthe beginning of the year, it’s still helpful to address the discussion, because it’s a recurring\ntheme. It’s often said that the economy isn’t the stock market and the stock market isn’t the\neconomy, which is very true. Short-term fluctuations or even daily dives aren’t accurate\nreflections of the state of the vast, multilayered U.S. economy.\nWatching a stock ticker isn’t the way to gauge America’s economic health. As Paul\nSamuelson famously said, the stock market has predicted nine out of the last five recessions. My\nconcern isn’t as simple as whether markets are up or down; what’s important is how it impacts\nour monetary policy objectives.\nThe same holds true for international developments. We live in a global economy and\nwhat happens in China or Europe or Brazil isn’t contained by national borders; the rest of us\nnecessarily feel the effects. But others’ economic fates do not spell our own. The U.S. is affected\nby what happens around the world, but it is also powered by domestic demand and we make our\nown monetary policy, which has supported growth and strengthened our economy. The same\nholds true for other countries. Part of the reason the global economic forecast hasn’t changed that\ndramatically is that countries and central banks have taken policy steps to shore up growth, from\nEurope to Japan to China.\nThere are factors slowing global growth, and they’re very real. But to some extent, the\nattention has distorted their size and scope, and it’s important to separate the facts from the\nchatter. The data don’t show that the song is over. Europe may be under something of a gray\n6\n\ncloud, but the death of European growth, to paraphrase Mark Twain, is greatly exaggerated. I\ndon’t want to evince a stereotypical American overoptimism—and as a native Californian, I will\nadmit to being an optimist in general—but I don’t see a looming global crisis. Growth\nexpectations may be slightly tempered, but that’s a far cry from the triage bay we were in eight\nyears ago. My view is essentially, let’s just stay on track. Let’s not get sidelined by the noise and\ndistraction commentary can sometimes cause.\nA case in point is China. Yes, growth has slowed, but this largely reflects a pivot from a\nmanufacturing-based economy to one driven by domestic consumption and services—the exact\nengines that are currently powering U.S. growth.5 Something that puts my assessment of China\nin perspective is that, again, my outlook hasn’t really changed. When I look back over my\nspeeches from the past few years, I could easily recycle the passages on China for a talk today.\nI mention these shifts in forecast—or lack thereof—because they’re significant.\nEconomists are driven by data and we are perfectly happy to revise our estimates as new\ninformation comes in or events unfold. We don’t even see it as saying we were wrong, we see it\nas having amended our view based on the data. This is marvelously helpful in everyday life, by\nthe way: Try telling friends or family that you weren’t wrong, you’ve just amended your view\nbased on data.\nIn any event, China’s official decision to lower its growth goal to 6.5–7 percent has been\ntreated by many as a harbinger of economic doom, foreshadowing an unexpected slowdown. But\nif you look at statements by the government, it’s completely consistent with the narrative of the\npast few years. Growth is going to slow somewhat, but it’s not a surprise, and it’s not a mark of\nan impending economic hard landing.\n5 Williams (2015).\n7\n\nOf course, the effects of China’s economy do reverberate globally, and each country and\nregion is affected differently by its neighbors and trading partners. I don’t want to sound like I’m\npreaching from my chair and the comfortable vantage of the U.S. For Asia-Pacific, China’s shift\nwill clearly have an effect. Commodity-exporting nations, for example, are going to feel the\nchange. Countries in the region can be, to some extent, a helpless dancer following China’s lead;\nas China pivots, the region is swept along by its steps.\nThe path for monetary policy\nThe interconnectedness of economics means other countries are considering how they’ll\nbe affected by the U.S. as it continues its policy normalization. I made a point at the beginning of\nmy remarks to highlight that I am a U.S. policymaker, and that my focus is on what’s correct for\nour domestic economy. But I’m not oblivious to the international effects of the decisions we\nmake. I’m familiar with the adage that when the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold.\nThe general concern is that normalization in the U.S. will cause market turbulence\ninternationally. People often point to the “taper tantrum” of a few years ago as evidence of the\nfar-reaching effects of Fed decisions.\nThere are two main issues: first, raising interest rates; second, the balance sheet, which\ncurrently stands at some $4 trillion.\nThe Fed has indicated that we expect to raise rates gradually, and we have made that\nabundantly clear in our communications. We took the first small step with a modest rate hike in\nDecember, and the future pace will be, as we’ve said repeatedly, gradual and thoughtful. As for\nthe balance sheet, there’s a ways to go before we start to unwind it, and it won’t happen until\nnormalization of the funds rate is well under way. After that, our plan is to shrink the balance\nsheet “organically,” through the maturation of the assets. It’s going to take at least six years to\n8\n\nget the balance sheet back to normal, which is in keeping with the overall approach to removing\naccommodation gradually.6\nOne of the lessons from the taper tantrum is that it’s not the policy that causes disruption,\nit’s the uncertainty. The actual tapering did not cause a negative market reaction. Our plans for\nboth rate hikes and the balance sheet are steady and consistently communicated. It’s frankly the\nmost telegraphed monetary policy of our lifetimes.\nWhat’s important about this, and what’s very good news, is that this is essentially the\nmove back to normal. The conversation in the U.S. isn’t about another quantitative easing\nprogram, or about the need for new forms of policy accommodation. And a well-communicated\ngradual pace is the essence of boring; it’s not a surprise and shouldn’t roil markets. The turmoil\nwe’re seeing right now is a response to events—concerns about China are about China and\nconcerns about Europe are about Europe. They’re not about marginally higher interest rates in\nthe U.S.\nI have every faith that those concerns will abate as world growth remains on track, and\nthat policy in the U.S. will not only fail to roil markets, but will be a net positive for everyone—\nafter all, a strong U.S. economy is good for the global economy.\nConclusion\nAll in all, my outlook is positive. I see continued growth in the U.S., and I don’t see the\nglobal situation as dire. The ability of governments and central banks to respond to their own\nneeds while navigating global conditions may not be a miracle cure, but it offers stability.\n6 Carpenter et al.

    "text": "Presentation to Pacific Community Ventures, San Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 4, 2015\nImpact Investing, Impacting Neighborhoods\nThank you, Julius, and good afternoon everyone. It’s a pleasure to be here.\nWhile I was preparing to speak to you all today, I sat down with some of my staff to talk\nabout what I should say, the points we should emphasize, the usual—I’m an economist, so I’m\nalways over-prepared and fixated on data. The headline, obviously, was: PCV is a great\norganization because they directly invest, they advise on both the investor and investee side of\nthe equation, and they’re a thought-leader in the sector. But I wanted to dig deeper into the\neconomic impact. And as we talked—about the economic benefit of PCV’s work, how it\ncompares to other options in these neighborhoods, looking at the data—we kept coming back to\nsomething: Not everything PCV does is quantifiable in hard numbers. Don’t get me wrong, there\nare data—which satisfies my need to see a spreadsheet and a cost-benefit-analysis, something\nI’m sure many of the bankers here can relate to. But you can’t really put a number on what truly\ndefines this work. Which is a good thing…as uncomfortable as it makes a numbers geek like me.\nPCV helps small businesses succeed, creates jobs where they’re most needed, and ultimately\nhelps make communities stronger, and the impact of that is multifold.\nAn uneven recovery\n1\n\nPCV’s work is particularly important in the context of the last several years. I’ve been in\nthis job for just over four years now, and they have not exactly been the best of economic times.\nNow we’re finally coming into the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. Nowhere is that more\nevident than San Francisco—if you look out the window at our offices on Market Street, you see\nbuildings going up on all sides.\nBut if San Francisco is a showcase of the best of the recovery—the epicenter of the tech\nsector, the boom in property—it’s also the center of the debate about the people who aren’t\nbouncing back. This economic recovery hasn’t been the same for everyone. There are people\nwho were left behind. There are people who were, frankly, left behind even in the best of times.\nWhich is why we need these targeted investments, so that everyone can benefit from the\nrecovery. And since we’re in San Francisco today, there’s a certain poetic symmetry to PCV\nusing Silicon Valley knowhow and investing acumen to focus on social problems and to develop\nneighborhoods. It’s a sort of nexus of San Francisco life.\nSustainability and staying power\nAs we talked in my office, one of the points I kept coming back to was the advice part of\nPCV’s work. After I graduated from college, I spent a couple years managing a small business\ncalled Blondie’s pizza. While I was there, I met and talked with small business owners.\nSomething I found fascinating was that many of them had gone to community college and that’s\nwhere they learned how to open and operate their stores. It was surprising to me at the time,\n2\n\nthough now it’s obvious, that the community college system is basically our incubator for mom-\nand-pop shops. I remember thinking that this is something incredibly valuable that the\ncommunity college system provides: a handbook for how to start a business.\nBut starting a business and sustaining a business are two different things. Particularly in\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods, people just don’t have the networks that other small business\nleaders do—people who’ve been through the myriad frustrations and stages of establishment and\ngrowth. People they can talk to and learn from.\nIt’s true in any job that the connections you make and the networks you establish are\nimportant to your success. I’m sure most of you have worked in organizations that have\nmentoring and career development programs, because the company understands that it’s\nimportant for someone to show you the ropes. Or you’ve worked in an area that depended on\nbringing in outside business, which is a whole lot easier if you’ve got people to make\nintroductions. So that richer advice and counsel PCV provides is truly invaluable.\nStarting a business is hard enough, but doing it in an underserved area, without the\nbenefit of peer-to-peer advice, mentoring, networks…it’s a herculean task. Add to that the\ndifficulties of starting a business in the aftermath of the Great Recession: Loans were extremely\ndifficult to get, and because personal assets are an important source of funding for these types of\nbusinesses, the drop in housing values hit the sector hard. So for that, hats off to everyone in this\nroom who’s made that terrifying leap, and a word of thanks to everyone who’s supported them.\n3\n\nStrengthening neighborhoods\nSpeaking of the people who’ve offered financial support, I know a lot of potential\ninvestors may wonder: Why should I do this? What’s the return on investment? We know that\nmost of these businesses aren’t going to go from four to 40,000 employees.\nAnd that’s a fair point. But they will go from four to 14, and then to 40, some may even\nmake it all the way to 400. The important thing is that when they’re a success, they lay the\ngroundwork for others in the area to enter the market and push up jobs, wages, and productivity.\nThere is an economic effect that, say, a newly opened family-run grocery store has on a\nlow-income neighborhood. That’s increased if you add a bakery, a nail salon, and a hardware\nstore on the same block, all locally owned and operated. The obvious benefit is the increase in\nlocal wages. But the real impact is how it can change a community. It’s helping to establish a\ncommercial corridor, creating an economic foundation that creates jobs, raises local incomes,\nand makes underserved areas more prosperous, safer, and self-sustaining. It’s giving the\ncommunity an anchor. And that’s an exponential return.\nConclusion\nSomeone once said that you should always finish speaking before your audience has\nfinished listening. And since my instinct when I’m up on stage is to go into an economics\nlecture, I’ll spare you all.\n4\n\nI just want to wrap up by really commending the ingenuity and leadership of PCV, the\nbravery and fortitude of their clients, and the generosity and open-mindedness of their investors.\nAlso their money.\nThanks again to everyone.\n5",

    "text": "Presentation to the Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century: An agenda\nfor China and the United States\nArmonk, NY\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 19, 2015\nChina, Rates, and the Outlook: May the (Economic) Force Be with You\nGood afternoon, and thank you.\nThere are few certainties in life, but I was pretty sure that people were going to want to\nhear something about U.S. monetary policy today. It used to be that at cocktail parties, saying\nyou worked for the Fed was the small-talk kiss of death. This is one of the few times in history\npeople actually move towards Fed economists in social situations.\nSince this is a conference on China, I will, of course, address that topic as well. But I’ve\nlearned that if you bury the lede, it doesn’t make people hang on your every word until you\narrive at the good part—it just makes people fidget until you get there. So I’ll start at home, with\nmy views on the economic outlook and monetary policy, and then work my way to the other side\nof the globe.\nNow is a good time to emphasize that the views expressed here today are mine alone and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nThe big headline is that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to hold off on\nraising interest rates this week. It was a close call in my mind, in part reflecting the conflicting\nsignals we’re getting. The U.S. economy continues to strengthen while global developments pose\ndownside risks to fully achieving our goals.\nLet me start with the unequivocally good news. Over the past five years, real GDP\ngrowth has averaged a little over 2 percent and the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly a\n1\n\npercentage point per year. I expect that pace of recovery to continue, despite strong global\nheadwinds. The unemployment rate is at or very near its longer-term normal, or natural rate,\nwe’re on pace to add 2.5 million jobs this year, and job vacancies are the highest they’ve been\nsince they started collecting the data back in 2000. Given the progress we’ve made and the\nmomentum we’re seeing, we should reach full employment on a broad set of measures by the\nend of this year or early next year.\nHowever, inflation is still lower than I’d like. Based on my favorite measure—the\ntrimmed mean—the underlying rate is stable at just over 1½ percent. To understand why\ninflation has remained low despite an economy nearing full employment, we have to look\nbeyond our shores. The rise of the dollar and the fall in oil prices over the past year have lowered\nimport prices and pushed the inflation rate down. Based on past experience, these effects should\nprove transitory. As they dissipate, I see inflation moving back up to our 2 percent inflation goal\nin the next two years.\nThere are some upside risks to my forecast, specifically an even stronger and faster\nrebound in housing and a spending boom from lower energy prices. So far, lower oil prices\nhaven’t caused much of a surge in consumption, but as people get used to paying less, that could\nchange. And there are, of course, the downside risks: The dollar could appreciate further and\nthere’s the threat of slowdowns and spillovers from abroad.\nOn raising rates\nRegarding monetary policy, we’re balancing a number of considerations, some of which\nargue for greater patience in raising rates and others that argue for acting sooner rather than later.\nOur decisions reflect a careful judgment about the relative risks and merits of those factors.\n2\n\nI’ll start with the arguments for continued patience in removing monetary\naccommodation. First, we are constrained by the zero lower bound in monetary policy and this\ncreates an asymmetry in our ability to respond to changing circumstances. That is, we can’t\nmove rates much below zero if the economy slows or inflation declines even further. By contrast,\nif we delay, and growth or inflation pick up quickly, we can easily raise rates in response.1\nThis concern is exemplified by downside risks from abroad. One such risk is the financial\nturmoil and economic slowdown in China, which I’ll get to shortly. More generally, economic\nconditions and policy overseas, from China to Europe to Brazil, have contributed to a substantial\nincrease in the dollar’s value, which has held back U.S. growth and inflation over the past year.2\nFurther bad news from abroad could add to these effects.\nThat brings me to inflation, which has been under our target for over three years. This is\nnot unique to the United States—inflation is very low in most of the world. Although we can\nultimately control our own inflation rate, there’s no question that globally low inflation, and the\npolicy responses this has provoked, have contributed to put downward pressure on inflation in\nthe U.S. Although my forecast is that inflation will bounce back, this is only a forecast and there\nremains the danger that it could take longer than I expect.\nThose are arguments on the side of the ledger arguing for more patience. On the other\nside is the insight of Milton Friedman, who famously taught us that monetary policy has long\nand variable lags.3 I use a car analogy to illustrate it. If you’re headed towards a red light, you\ntake your foot off the gas so you can get ready to stop. If you don’t, you’re going to wind up\nslamming on the brakes and very possibly skidding into the intersection.\n1 Evans et al. (2015).\n2 See, for example, Amiti and Bodine-Smith (2015).\n3 Friedman (1961).\n3\n\nIn addition, an earlier start to raising rates would allow us to engineer a smoother, more\ngradual process of policy normalization. That would give us space to fine-tune our responses to\nreact to economic conditions; raising rates too late would force us into the position of a steep and\nabrupt hike, which doesn’t leave much room for maneuver. Not to mention, it could roil financial\nmarkets and slow the economy.\nIn considering the monetary policy choices, it’s important to remember that we’re in a\nvery different place now than when we first instituted extremely accommodative policy. The\neconomy has come a long way since the dark days of late 2009, when unemployment hit its 10\npercent peak. Now we’re down to 5.1 percent and we’ve added over 12 million jobs, more than\nthree million of them last year. Even better, most of those were full-time. It’s been a tough\njourney back, and monetary policy has played a crucial role in healing a once-ailing economy.4\nIn the past, I have found the arguments for greater patience to clearly outweigh those for\nraising rates. The labor market was still far from full strength and the risk to the recovery’s\nmomentum was very real. As the economy closed in on full employment, the other side of the\nledger started gaining greater weight and the arguments have moved into closer balance.\nLooking forward, I expect that we’ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the\nnear future and inflation will gradually move back to our 2 percent goal. In that context, it will\nmake sense to gradually move away from the extraordinary stimulus that got us here. We already\ntook a step in that direction when we ended QE3. And given the progress we’ve made and\ncontinue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates,\nmost likely starting sometime later this year. Of course, that view is not immutable and will\nrespond to economic developments over time.\nChina\n4 See Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n4\n\nWhich brings me, in a roundabout way, to the subject of China. You always want to\navoid pontificating to a roomful of experts, so let me be clear that my view of China is through\nthe lens of a U.S. policymaker.\nChina has garnered almost as much editorial ink in the past month as U.S. presidential\ncandidates—which may or may not be a complimentary comparison. I don’t want to sound\npejorative by calling some of the commentary “hand-wringing”—though to be fair, some of it\nhas been downright apocalyptic—but I don’t see the situation as dire. I’ve said publicly over the\npast few months that after going to China, and after talking to academics and officials there, I\ncame away a lot less concerned than when I arrived. And I have to say that recent events have\nnot changed my thinking to any serious extent.\nThis is where I’ll reuse one of the more helpful quotes for forecasting: “It’s difficult to\nmake predictions, especially about the future.” With the dangers of prognostication\nacknowledged, I’ll tread into that territory anyway.\nThe China story is remarkable, and its growth over the past 30 years has been\nunprecedented.5 But now China’s at something of a crossroads, facing tradeoffs in their goals,\ndealing with a new normal for growth expectations, and pivoting to a new source of economic\nmomentum.\nIt’s important to see the situation not through the filters of our own paradigms, but from\nthe perspective of China’s unique position. China is not the U.S. Or the U.K. Or Japan. Its goals,\nstructure, government, and place on its growth trajectory are very different, and looking to\nimpose foreign expectations on China’s markets or actions can lead one astray.\nGrowth versus reform\n5 See Zhu (2012).\n5\n\nIn a nutshell, China is facing a tradeoff between its short-term growth goals and its\nlonger-term reform agenda.\nChina’s government has made it abundantly clear that it is willing to intervene when\nnecessary, ensuring that growth stays on its target path, even if that means extending the timeline\non reform. That willingness to do “whatever it takes” to keep growth on target is what made me\nless worried about a hard landing for China.\nOf course, that very disposition for intervention is the source of much hue and cry on this\nside of the globe. China has made important incremental steps on the road to liberalization, and\nfrom the perspective of a fully open, free-market, Western-oriented paradigm or advocacy, the\nrecent stock market interventions seem anathema to that goal. But that’s a view through a narrow\nlens that may obscure the bigger picture.\nFor all its moves towards liberalization, China’s markets are not the same as ours. Yes,\nthey have a reform agenda, but it’s a mistake to think that in the foreseeable future China will\nhave fully open capital and financial markets in the way that we in the U.S. and other countries\nthink about them. They are relaxing their grip on the exchange rate—allowing the renminbi to\nrespond to economic news, letting its value be more market-determined—and as a policy\napproach, this is a positive; it’s something we as economists wanted to see happen. But it’s very\nclear that China is not going to let its exchange rate float completely freely. They’ll continue to\nhave buffers to ensure that, should some dramatic event unfold, they can step in again and stop\nthat interfering with their other goals. To some extent, we can see these moves as something akin\nto beta-testing liberalization. It is happening, which is a remarkable shift. But completely free,\nopen markets are not in the cards, and the government has made clear that those are not their\nintention.\n6\n\nThis, incidentally, is why talk about the renminbi replacing the dollar as an international\nreserve currency is unrealistic. The role of a reserve currency is to be a harbor during a storm;\nit’s where people flock when the unexpected happens. As we saw in the financial crisis, as we’ve\nseen in other crises, the market’s instinct is, when in doubt, go to the dollar. As long as China has\ncontrols in place to mediate the free flow of money, the dollar will be the refuge, not the\nrenminbi.\nIn the context of China’s dual—oftentimes conflicting—goals, the recent stock market\nintervention by the government should be seen as what I believe it was: A move to keep growth\non pace. It’s a pattern we’ve seen before. When the Chinese authorities see growth struggling, or\nother economic warning lights, they take steps, including reversing or postponing reforms, to\nkeep growth at pace. Fiscal and economic policymakers can pull a number of levers and the\nChinese government has proved again and again its willingness to do just that.\nChina’s growth rate\nIn balancing these objectives, the Chinese government has realistically moderated its\nexpectations for growth. For decades we all marveled at China’s double-digit growth, and there\nwas, perhaps, some expectation that it would persist in perpetuity. But growth like that is\nunsustainable. If you look at the progression of Japan, for instance, from the 1960s to the 1980s,\nor South Korea from the 1980s to the 2000s, you see the pattern China will likely follow.6 At low\nincome levels, growth can be rapid, because low domestic wages make exports very competitive\nand there is so much untapped potential in moving workers to more productive pursuits.\nBut as income or GDP per capita rise, these advantages begin to ebb, and growth\nnaturally slows. The pattern is clear, with a rapid decline in the growth rate and eventual leveling\nout as domestic income and wages rise. This is the natural progression of economies moving into\n6 Liu (2015)\n7\n\nmaturity. The further they have to go, the faster they can grow; but once they’ve come to a place\nlike Japan or Korea—that is, around 80 or 90 percent of U.S. per capita GDP—their growth\nexpectations will be lower because they’re closer to the finish line. China obviously isn’t close\nyet, but it’s a good indicator of how much further it can go. What China’s accomplished has been\namazing—but we also called Japan a growth miracle and Korea’s success was remarkable as\nwell. There were challenges along the way for both countries, but ultimately, what slowed\ngrowth was entering the middle-income bracket and the inevitability of slower growth for\nwealthier countries.\nThe officials and economists I spoke to in China know that not only are the days of 10\npercent growth behind them, but that it will move below the current 7 percent target. Seven will\nlikely become 6, which will become 5, and so on as their economy moves into a middle-income\neconomy and progresses to a high-income one.\nShift in focus\nOf course, China faces challenges in continuing that advance. One is a refocus of its\neconomic engine. Given the global environment, how do they successfully pivot their economy\nto more domestic consumption, moving the emphasis more toward services and away from\nmanufacturing? That’s clearly a challenge, but also a central objective of the government.\nFor people who have concerns about China, one of the red flags they point to is that\nindustrial production has slowed a lot, more so than the economy overall. I fall on the side of\ncommentators who’ve pointed out that this isn’t surprising.7 China’s been talking for years about\nswitching from industry to services. They’re moving from making steel and concrete to making\nconsumer goods. One of the interesting things I heard this summer was the plan to build more\ntourism in China for China. That’s something that’s virtually nonexistent at the moment. They\n7 See, for example, Lardy (2015).\n8\n\ndon’t have the abundance of recreational resources we do; in California alone, you can go skiing\nor surfing, to wine country or Disneyland. As high- or low-brow as you want it, we as Americans\nhave become incredibly used to spending our leisure dollars domestically. That’s something\nChina’s looking to do for itself.\nWhen you look at where China’s priorities lie—in switching to services, in expanding\ntourism—it makes absolute sense that industrial production is slowing.\nLiberalization and the impact of risks from abroad\nI’ve mentioned that China is seen by some as a risk; but conversely, what effect does\nU.S. policy have on them? Right now, China is more susceptible to the shifts in U.S. monetary\npolicy. But as they liberalize their exchange rate, it will automatically adjust to changes in\nsituations around the world. This is a huge advantage and an automatic stabilizer. When China\npegs to the dollar, they’re too linked to U.S. policy, so that when the U.S. tightens or loosens,\nthey effectively follow suit. By allowing market-based influence, China will have a buffer when\nthe U.S. economy is moving in a different direction than theirs. And that’s going to make it\neasier in the end for China to manage its economy.\nAn outside observer might ask why they haven’t done this already. I think that China was\nwary that unpegging would’ve interrupted the double-digit growth. When a country’s exchange\nrate and capital flows suddenly start shifting around dramatically, it can interfere with the ability\nto deliver on growth targets. As China’s growth targets have come down, and as they begin to\nshift away from an export-reliant economy, instead fueling itself via domestic consumption, they\ncan start allowing their exchange rate to move—though again, it won’t be the free floating\nexchange rate that we have.\nConclusion\n9\n\nThis is all just one economist’s take. As I said, it’s difficult to make predictions. And to\nuse another famous quote, “I’m not young enough to know everything.” But I will say this: The\nU.S. economy is on solid footing and trajectory. Global developments definitely present\nsignificant challenges and risks, but overall I am quite positive about the outlook for the U.S.\neconomy.\nThank you.\n10\n\nReferences\nAmiti, Mary, and Tyler Bodine-Smith. 2015. “The Effect of the Strong Dollar on U.S. Growth.” Liberty\nStreet Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

    "text": "Presentation to the Portland Business Journal CFO of the Year Awards Luncheon\nPortland, Oregon\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 16, 2013\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy: Moving in the Right Direction1\nThank you. It’s great to be in Portland. If I can find time, I like nothing better than to\nsavor a cup of the excellent coffee Portland is famous for and then head over to Powell’s to dig\nthrough the stacks.\nToday I’m going to talk about how the economy is doing and where I see it heading. I’ll\nhighlight areas of strength, such as housing, and also some areas that have been holding us back,\nsuch as fiscal policy. I’ll offer my forecasts for economic growth, the job market, and inflation.\nAnd I’ll explain what the Federal Reserve is doing to keep the recovery on track and move\ntoward the goals Congress has set for us, namely maximum employment and price stability. I\nshould note that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nSince there are a lot of CFOs here, let me go straight to the bottom line: The economy has\nbeen improving for nearly four years now. I expect this improvement to continue and to\ngradually gain momentum. This outlook reflects a mixture of healthy growth by households and\nbusinesses, and the dampening effects of public-sector restraint. Overall, if we were in a car, you\nmight say we’re motoring along, but well under the speed limit. The fact that we’re cruising at a\nmoderate speed instead of still stuck in the ditch is due in part to the Federal Reserve’s\nunprecedented efforts to keep interest rates low. We may not be getting there as fast as we’d\nlike, but we’re definitely moving in the right direction.\n1 I want to thank Bharat Trehan and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\nThere is indeed little doubt that the economy is on the mend. The clearest evidence can\nbe found in housing, by far the sector hit hardest during the recession. Mortgage rates have\nfallen to levels rarely, if ever, seen before. Typical fixed-rate mortgages are around 3.5 percent,\nputting them in reach of millions of households. Affordable mortgages fuel demand for homes,\nand that pushes up sales and prices. Year-over-year, house prices are rising at around a double-\ndigit rate.\nThe recovery in home prices has all sorts of beneficial effects. Increasing numbers of\nunderwater homeowners are finding themselves on dry land again. Their properties are now\nworth more than their mortgages, making them less likely to default. Meanwhile, other\nhomeowners find their mortgages have dropped below the critical 80-percent-of-home-value\nbarrier. That makes it easier to refinance at today’s low rates, freeing money to spend on other\nthings.\nHomebuilders are responding to rising sales and prices. New housing construction starts\nhave risen by more than 45 percent over the past year. As one of my business contacts put it,\nanything related to housing is doing well—furniture, appliances, even the pickup trucks workers\ndrive to construction sites. That’s quite a turnaround from the past few years.\nIf you own a home, you’re probably feeling a little better about things, even if you don’t\nrefinance. The rising value of your property—and perhaps your 401(k) as well—may be making\nyou feel wealthier. Many people have responded to their improved finances by spending more\non a range of goods and services. When we put it together, housing-related demand, improved\naccess to credit, and the effects of increased wealth all have spurred consumer spending. The\nlatest data show that, on a per-person basis, consumer spending has fully rebounded from its\nsteep decline during the recession.\n2\n\nMeanwhile, businesses are hiring and increasing production. Manufacturing of durable\ngoods such as motor vehicles and appliances has regained its previous level after plunging more\nthan 25 percent during the recession. The recovery in durable goods also reflects the effects of\nlower interest rates. Of course, many businesses are still cautious. But investment in plant and\nequipment continues to grow moderately and is on track for further gains.\nIn sum, conditions in the private-sector part of the economy have improved quite a bit\nand continue to get better. So why then is the economy as a whole poking along instead of\nspeeding ahead? To understand that, we need to look at what’s happening in the public sector.\nWhen the recession hit, state and local government tax revenue tumbled. Those\ngovernments responded by cutting spending and employment, which have still not recovered.\nHere’s one way to see the effect those cutbacks have had on the U.S. economy: On a per-person\nbasis, production of goods and services is about 1 percent below its pre-recession peak. But if\nstate and local government purchases today were what they were then, output per person would\nbe roughly where it was before the recession.\nThe federal government is a different story. In response to the recession, the federal\ngovernment cut taxes and boosted spending substantially, and that was a big plus for the\neconomy when it was reeling. The $800 billion tax and spending package passed in 2009 was\nextraordinarily expansionary, and fiscal policy overall was more stimulatory than at any time\nsince the Great Depression.2 But that stimulus has been phasing out in recent years, leading to a\nsubstantial swing in the effects of federal fiscal policy. More recently, higher taxes have come\ninto the picture. Income tax rates were raised on upper-income Americans, and the Social\nSecurity payroll tax cut was allowed to expire. Now, on top of that, we have sequestration. In\n2 See Lucking and Wilson (2012).\n3\n\nthe period ahead, as the federal deficit shrinks, fiscal policy is likely to weigh on the economy\neven more. The federal deficit will decline by a substantial amount, on average approximately\n1½ percent of gross domestic product every year for the three years ending in 2015, according to\nthe Congressional Budget Office.\nThe United States is not the only country going through a period of budgetary restraint.\nIn Europe, government spending has grown much slower than in other recent recoveries.3\nAmong countries that use the euro, recessions have caused tax revenue to tank, which widens\nbudget deficits. In the face of those enormous deficits, governments have slammed the brakes on\nspending. But several of these economies are still contracting. Many analysts—and some\npolicymakers as well—have begun to wonder if policies aimed at cutting deficits should be\nbalanced with policies aimed at spurring growth.\nFor the United States, Europe’s struggles are a real crimp on growth. That’s because\nEurope is one of our major trading partners. Europeans are buying fewer American products\nthan they would otherwise, which damps demand at a time we need it.\nHowever, not all the news from overseas is bad. In Japan, the central bank has adopted a\nmuch more aggressive policy to promote growth. Specifically, the Bank of Japan has officially\nraised the level of inflation it is targeting from 1 to 2 percent, with a view to getting the country\nout of a prolonged deflationary spiral. That move may not seem like much. But in central\nbanking circles, it’s stop-the-presses news. If the Bank of Japan succeeds in jump-starting\ngrowth, that should offset some of the economic drag coming from Europe.\nI’ve gone over some of the pluses and minuses influencing the U.S. economy so you can\nget a sense of what’s driving our moderate growth. What does this mean for the job market?\n3 See Kose, Loungani, and Terrones (2013).\n4\n\nWell, things have been getting better there as well. Since the low point for employment\nfollowing the recession, the economy has added over 6 million jobs. During the past six months\nalone, we’ve added 1¼ million jobs. The unemployment rate of 7.5 percent is down 2½\npercentage points from its recession peak, with nearly half a percentage point of that decline\noccurring in the past six months.\nOne reason the jobless rate has been dropping so much is that a large number of people\nare leaving the labor force. Many of them are reaching retirement age or going back to school.\nBut part of this exodus appears to be people who are giving up looking for work. It’s hard to say\nhow long these discouraged workers will stay out of the labor force. I expect many of them will\nreturn as jobs become more plentiful.\nUnder these circumstances, I expect the unemployment rate to decline gradually over the\nnext few years. My forecast is that it will be just below 7½ percent at the end of this year, and a\nshade below 7 percent at the end of 2014. I don’t see it falling below 6½ percent until mid-2015.\nThis forecast of a gradual downward trend in the unemployment rate reflects the combined\neffects of expected solid job gains and a return of discouraged workers to the labor force.\nI also see a gradual pickup in overall economic growth. Growth of gross domestic\nproduct, which is the nation’s total output of goods and services, is likely to be relatively\nsluggish in the second and third quarters as sequestration begins to bite. But I expect the\neconomy to gain momentum after that. I project that inflation-adjusted GDP will grow almost\n2½ percent this year and 3¼ percent next year.\nFor its part, inflation is quite low, with the Fed’s preferred measure of prices rising only 1\npercent over the past year. Wages are increasing slowly and the labor market still has\nconsiderable slack, which should restrain future wage increases. In addition, increases in the\n5\n\nprices of imported goods and services have been subdued. And the public continues to expect\nlow inflation. I expect that the decline in inflation will prove to be temporary, and that inflation\nwill climb slowly, but stay below the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run target over the next few years.\nEarlier I noted that the economy’s improved performance stemmed in part from Federal\nReserve policies. Let me describe what we’ve done and then shift to what we might do in the\nfuture. During the recession, the Fed acted quickly and aggressively. We pushed our benchmark\nshort-term interest rate close to zero at the end of 2008. But that move was not nearly enough to\noffset the damage caused by the financial crisis and the housing collapse. We couldn’t push\nshort-term interest rates any lower. So we had to devise new, unconventional ways to stimulate\nthe economy.\nBroadly, our unconventional policies have fallen into two categories: The first involves\nwhat we say, the second, what we do. As far as what we say is concerned, our approach is\ncentered on what is known as forward guidance. Under forward guidance, the Fed’s policy\ncommittee releases public statements about the likely stance of policy in the future. The aim is\nto reduce public confusion and uncertainty about future Fed policy, and thereby help us achieve\nour policy goals. For example, let’s take the federal funds rate, our benchmark short-term\ninterest rate. If the Fed’s policy committee states that it expects the federal funds rate to remain\nexceptionally low for an extended period, that will also drive down longer-term interest rates\nright away. And those longer-term rates have a lot to do with whether a young family buys a\nhouse or a car, or a business builds a new factory.\nThe Federal Reserve’s policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC,\nhas issued forward guidance that spells out specific economic conditions that serve as thresholds\nfor considering increases in the federal funds rate. In particular, the Committee’s policy\n6\n\nstatements have specified that we expect to keep the federal funds rate exceptionally low at least\nas long as, one, “the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent”; two, “inflation between one\nand two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the\nCommittee’s 2 percent longer-run goal”; and three, longer-term inflation expectations remain in\ncheck.4\nWith this forward guidance in place, members of the public can adjust their expectations\nfor future Fed policy as new information on the economy becomes available. They don’t need to\nwait for the Fed to issue a new statement. For example, a slowdown in economic growth might\ncause the public to think that the prospect of reaching a 6½ percent unemployment rate was\nfalling further back in time. They would then expect the Fed to wait longer to raise the federal\nfunds rate, which would prompt them to push long-term interest rates down. And those lower\nlong-term rates would help us achieve our monetary policy goals.\nThe second major unconventional policy category involves what we do. Here I am\nspeaking of our program to buy a total of $85 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and\nlonger-term Treasury securities each month, often referred to in the financial press as QE3.\nUnder the current and earlier asset purchase programs, we’ve bought more than $3 trillion in\nlonger-term Treasury and mortgage-related securities. Fed purchases boost demand for these\nsecurities, bidding up their prices and lowering their yields. Lower Treasury and mortgage\nyields spill over into other markets, lowering longer-term rates across the board.5\nThe lower rates that stem in part from forward guidance and quantitative easing have big\nbenefits for the economy. Take a homeowner with a $250,000 mortgage. With the decline in\n4 See Board of Governors (2012).\n5 See Williams (2011, 2012).\n7\n\nlonger-term interest rates since 2009, that homeowner might be paying around $3,000 less on a\nmortgage each year, if he or she is able to refinance.\nSimilar to our forward guidance on the federal funds rate, the FOMC has linked our asset\npurchases to the outlook for the economy. Specifically, we’ve said we expect to continue buying\nlonger-term Treasury and mortgage securities until the outlook for the job market improves\nsubstantially, provided inflation remains contained. In the statement issued by the FOMC after\nour meeting two weeks ago, we said we would adjust our securities purchases to ensure that\nmonetary stimulus is at a level appropriate for economic conditions. That has been a principle of\nour ongoing open-ended securities purchase program since we started it in September. It means\nwe will alter the size, pace, and composition of our purchases as necessary as the economy\nevolves.\nSo, do economic conditions suggest we need to change the $85 billion in monthly\nsecurities purchases we’re currently making? To answer that, it’s useful to look at what\nconditions were when we launched the program last September. At that time, the economy was\nflashing warning signals. As Figure 1 shows, the pace of improvement in the labor market had\nslowed, with payroll growth declining. Moreover, the unemployment rate appeared to be stalled\nat about 8 percent, and we at the San Francisco Fed did not see the rate falling below that level\ntill the final quarter of 2013, as shown in Figure 2.\nSince then, the labor market has improved considerably. The pace of job growth has\npicked up, averaging over 200,000 jobs per month over the past six months. And the\nunemployment rate has come down. Figure 3 shows that, in the seven months since our latest\nsecurities purchase program began, the unemployment rate has fallen faster than we had\nexpected.\n8\n\nIt’s clear that the labor market has improved since September. But have we yet seen\nconvincing evidence of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, our standard\nfor discontinuing our securities purchases? In considering this question, I look not only at the\nunemployment rate, but also a wide range of economic indicators that signal the direction the\nlabor market is likely to take.\nEconomists at the San Francisco Fed have identified a very good set of indicators for this\npurpose that tell us what labor market conditions are likely to be six months in the future. They\ninclude well-known labor market measures, such as private payroll employment growth and\ninitial unemployment insurance claims. But they also include measures that are not as well\nknown, such as growth in temporary help employment and survey data on the share of\nhouseholds that find jobs hard to get.\nConsistent with the payroll and unemployment data I mentioned earlier, most of these\nindicators look healthier than they did in September. What’s more, nearly all of them are\nsignaling that the labor market will continue to improve over the next six months. This is good\nnews. But it will take further gains to convince me that the “substantial improvement” test for\nending our asset purchases has been met. However, assuming my economic forecast holds true\nand various labor market indicators continue to register appreciable improvement in coming\nmonths, we could reduce somewhat the pace of our securities purchases, perhaps as early as this\nsummer. Then, if all goes as hoped, we could end the purchase program sometime late this year.\nOf course, my forecast could be wrong, and we will adjust our purchases as appropriate\ndepending on how the economy performs.\nIt’s important to stress that even if we slow the pace of our purchases, it does not mean\nwe would be tightening monetary policy or stepping back from our commitment to provide\n9\n\nstrong monetary support as the economy recovers. The stance of monetary policy would still be\nextremely stimulatory. In terms of our asset purchases, the evidence shows that the stimulus we\nare providing depends on the size of our balance sheet, not the rate at which we’re buying assets.\nSo even when we reduce or halt new purchases, we’ll still have trillions of dollars of longer-term\nsecurities on our balance sheet exerting downward pressure on interest rates.\nOf course, eventually we will adjust our policy stance back toward normal levels. When\nwe do, it will be because changing circumstances have made an adjustment the best way to lead\nus toward our mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. We recognize that\nmuch is uncertain when it comes to the economy, and we’ve thought a great deal about how best\nto manage our exit from these unconventional policies. I am confident that we will succeed in\ndoing so. Thank you.\n10\n\nFigure 1\nJob creation has picked up since September\nNonfarm Payroll Employment\nSeasonallyadjusted, monthly change Thousands\n250\n6-Month Moving Apr.\nAverage Sept.\n2012\n200\n150\n100\n50\n2011 2012 2013\nSource: Bureauof Labor Statistics\nFigure 2\nUnemployment outlook was discouraging…\nUnemployment Rate\nSeasonally adjusted Percent\n10\n9\nFRBSFForecast\nprior to Sept 2012\nFOMC meeting\n8\n7\n6\n201 0 201 1 201 2 2013\nSource: Bureauof Labor Statistics and FRBSF staff\n11\n\nFigure 3\nBut has improved recently\nUnemployment Rate\nSeasonally adjusted Percent\n10\n9\nFRBSFForecast\nprior to Sept 2012\nFOMC meeting\n8\nData since\nSept2012\nCurrent\nFRBSF 7\nForecast\n6\n201 0 201 1 201 2 2013\nSource: Bureauof Labor Statistics and FRBSF staff\n12\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012. “Press Release.” December 12.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm\nKose, M.

    "text": "Presentation to Portland Community Leaders\nPortland, Oregon\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 4, 2013\nThe Economic Outlook, Unemployment, and Monetary Policy1\nThank you. This is the third time I’ve spoken in Portland in the past 14 months, and it’s\nalways a pleasure to be here. But, I have to tell you, if I come here any more often, I may have\nto buy Timbers season tickets and climb Mt. Hood. And that’s something I need to think about.\nOf course, you don’t need to hear about local culture from me. So I’ll segue to my reason\nfor being here today, which is to talk about the U.S. economy and what the Federal Reserve is\ndoing to support the recovery. I’ll start with a look at the national economy, which continues to\nmake forward progress, despite a number of strong crosscurrents. I’ll then offer my forecasts for\ngrowth, unemployment, and inflation. And I’ll wind up by discussing how the Fed is pursuing\nthe goals Congress has set for us of maximum employment and stable prices.\nIn that regard, the question I get asked constantly these days is, when will the Fed begin\ncutting back on our current program of large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage\nsecurities? Later in my talk, I’ll lay out for you my perspective on this important question. But,\nbefore I do, I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nMore than four years have passed since the end of an unusually severe recession, and the\neconomy still presents us with a jumble of good news and bad news. Growth has been choppy\nand, during much of the recovery, it’s been slower than we hoped. Nonetheless, job gains over\n1 I want to thank Reuven Glick and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nthe past year have been solid. We’ve been adding close to 200,000 jobs per month and have\nregained more than 6½ million jobs lost during the downturn. The unemployment rate was 7.4\npercent in July, down from a peak of 10 percent.\nI want to point out that the Federal Reserve has been working hard to support this\neconomic rebound. We acted to push short- and long-term interest rates down to record low\nlevels. Those low rates lit a fire under interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, like autos and\nhousing, the ones where people typically borrow to make a purchase. In housing, the result has\nbeen dramatic. Across the country, home construction and sales have risen over the past year,\nand home prices are up more than 10 percent. This is just the medicine the economy needs.\nHomebuyers often need new appliances, furniture, and the like, so increased home purchases\nripple throughout the economy. Recently, longer-term rates have risen as investors prepare for\nthe eventual normalization of monetary policy. But they are still quite low by historical\nstandards.\nMeanwhile, the stock market has also been on the rise, with prices up about 15 percent\nfrom a year ago. With real estate and stock prices both higher over the past year, household\nwealth soared to a record $70 trillion in the first quarter of 2013, almost $20 trillion above its\nrecession low. That rising wealth helps give people confidence to open their wallets, which has\nunderpinned steady gains in consumer spending.\nFor their part, businesses appear to be more willing to invest in plants, equipment, and\nservices, especially in information technology. I’ve been encouraged by the greater optimism\nI’m hearing from a broad range of business contacts—people in everything from tourism to\ncommercial real estate—not just the pockets of strength we’ve seen in the past year or so.\n2\n\nAll in all, the private side of the economy has been forging ahead with considerable\nmomentum. But we’re seeing just the opposite with the public sector. Fiscal policy at the\nfederal level has become a major factor holding back the recovery. During the recession and\nearly in the recovery, federal tax and spending policy provided a big boost to the economy. In\n2009, Congress and the White House pushed through an $800 billion stimulus package that put\nmoney into the hands of households and businesses, pumping up spending.\nMore recently though, federal budget policy has shifted to austerity. Spending is down\nsharply and taxes have increased. The sequestration process has forced wholesale cuts in federal\noutlays. This budget tightening is having a big effect on the economy. This year, the drag from\nfederal spending and taxes is estimated to subtract about 1½ percentage points from growth of\ngross domestic product, which measures the total output of goods and services and is considered\nthe broadest gauge of economic activity.2 It’s as if the economy were trying to run while\ncarrying a bag of rocks on its back. The fact that it’s still moving forward is a testament to the\nunderlying strength of the private-sector recovery.\nWhere will we go from here? GDP adjusted for inflation grew at a modest rate just\nabove 1½ percent over the past year. However, I expect growth to pick up in the second half of\n2013 as the drag from the federal budget wanes and momentum in the private sector continues to\ngather steam. For this year as a whole, I see inflation-adjusted GDP growing about 2 percent,\nand then rising to about 3 percent in 2014. With the economy continuing to grow and add jobs, I\nexpect the unemployment rate to decline gradually over the next few years.\nPrice stability is the second part of the Fed’s mandate, and of course what’s happening\nwith inflation is vitally important to us. We’ve set a 2 percent inflation rate as our longer-run\ntarget because that level seems most consistent with both our maximum employment and price\n2 See Lucking and Wilson (2013).\n3\n\nstability goals. We all know that inflation can get too high. The fact is, though, that inflation\ncan also fall too low. Indeed, inflation has been running well below our target for some time,\nand earlier this year it slowed further. Over the past year, our preferred inflation measure rose at\na 1.4 percent rate, well below our 2 percent target. I am encouraged, though, by recent data that\nsuggest the declines in inflation over the past year will prove temporary. With the economy\ncontinuing to improve, I expect inflation will gradually climb back towards our 2 percent longer-\nrun target over the next few years.\nI’ll turn now to Federal Reserve monetary policy. As you know, when the financial crisis\nhit in 2008, the Fed responded aggressively to keep the financial system from collapsing and\nthereby help save the economy from a recession even worse than the one we actually went\nthrough. Among other measures, our policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, or\nFOMC, pushed short-term interest rates down close to zero. Still, at the end of 2008, the\neconomy was shrinking and jobs were disappearing. In November and December of 2008 alone,\npayrolls shriveled by almost 1½ million jobs.\nWith this kind of emergency, we had to do more. We had already maxed out our\ntraditional policy lever by cutting short-term interest rates as far as they could go. So, to provide\nadditional support to the economy, we put in place unconventional monetary stimulus programs.\nThose programs were designed to lower longer-term interest rates at the same time our\nconventional policies were working on short-term rates—a one-two punch to fight the recession.\nOur unconventional programs were real innovations and they came in two forms.3 One is\nknown in central banking jargon as forward guidance. In our case, forward guidance means that\nthe FOMC communicates to the public what Fed policy is likely to be in the future.\n3 See Williams (2012).\n4\n\nLet me explain how we are using forward guidance now. We have publicly stated that\nwhat we do with our benchmark short-term interest rate—the federal funds rate—depends on\nhow the economy performs. Specifically, we’ve said that we would keep the federal funds rate\nnear zero at least until three conditions apply: one, the unemployment rate falls to 6½ percent;\ntwo, inflation one to two years out is forecast to be no more than half a percentage point above\nour 2 percent target; and three, the public’s inflation expectations remain in check. This lets\npeople know that short-term interest rates will probably stay low for a long time. That makes\nthem willing to pay more for longer-term securities, and that in turn pushes down longer-term\ninterest rates.\nOur second kind of unconventional program involves large-scale purchases of longer-\nterm U.S. Treasury and mortgage-related securities. Currently, we are purchasing $85 billion in\nsecurities each month. These purchases increase demand for these securities, pushing up their\nprices and driving down their yields. Just like with forward guidance, lower yields on these\nsecurities push down other longer-term interest rates.\nOur forward guidance and securities purchases have given a shot in the arm to the\neconomy by significantly reducing longer-term interest rates. Today, despite the recent run-up in\ninterest costs, mortgage rates are still quite low. And low mortgage rates have been a major\nreason for the rebound in the housing market. Low financing costs have also perked up motor\nvehicle sales to levels not seen in more than five years. Manufacturing of big-ticket items such\nas autos has risen significantly, regaining all the recession losses. By contrast, production of\nnondurable goods, which doesn’t benefit as much from low interest rates, is still nearly 10\npercent below its peak.\n5\n\nWe are not the only ones who recognize that these policies are effective. Around the\nworld, unconventional policy is quickly becoming downright conventional. Both the Bank of\nEngland and the Bank of Japan have carried out large-scale asset purchases. And these two\ncentral banks and the European Central Bank are now using forward guidance as well.\nThe improving economy here in the United States raises several questions about our\npolicies. How long should we keep carrying out large-scale asset purchases? And how long\nshould we keep our benchmark short-term interest rate near zero? These are two separate\nquestions, but we’ve said the answers to both of them depend importantly on conditions in the\nlabor market. And a key barometer of the health of the labor market is the unemployment rate.\nAs I noted, our forward guidance on our key policy short-term interest rate, the federal\nfunds rate, is explicitly linked to the unemployment rate. The FOMC has stated that it will not\nbegin raising the fed funds rate at least until unemployment falls below 6½ percent. In addition,\nthe FOMC has said it will keep adding to our holdings of securities “until the outlook for the\nlabor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.” In June, Fed Chairman\nBen Bernanke clarified what we mean by “substantial improvement” in the outlook for the labor\nmarket. He said that, if the economy develops as expected, it would be appropriate to reduce the\nmonthly pace of purchases beginning later this year and eventually end the current asset purchase\nprogram around the middle of next year, at which time the unemployment rate is expected to be\nabout 7 percent.4\nClearly, the unemployment rate plays an important role in our thinking and\ncommunication about future policy. Therefore, an important issue is whether it is giving an\naccurate read on where things stand relative to our maximum employment mandate. The\nunemployment rate measures the percent of the labor force that is out of work and looking for a\n4 Bernanke (2013).\n6\n\njob. It has a number of advantages as a measure for summarizing the state of the labor market.\nFor one thing, over time it has proven to be a reasonably stable and predictable barometer of\nwhether labor market conditions are too hot, too cold, or just right in terms of creating\ninflationary pressures. Although structural changes in the labor market affect the unemployment\nrate, most of the variation in unemployment over time reflects cyclical factors, that is, whether\nthe economy is too hot or too cold. And, second, the rate closely tracks other indicators of how\nmuch slack there is in the labor market, such as data from surveys on the share of households\nthat finds jobs hard to get and the share of businesses that say it’s hard to fill openings. This\nadds to our confidence in its reliability.\nAll the same, there are reasons to worry that the unemployment rate could now be\nunderstating just how weak the labor market is.5 In particular, during the recovery, the share of\nthe working-age population that is employed has increased very little, even as the unemployment\nrate has fallen. Taken at face value, the very low ratio of employment to population suggests\nthat the labor market has improved far less than what’s implied by the decline in the\nunemployment rate.\nSo should we stop using the unemployment rate as our primary yardstick of the state of\nthe labor market in favor of the employment-to-population ratio? My answer is no. Although\nthe unemployment rate is by no means a perfect measure of labor market conditions, the\nemployment-to-population ratio blurs structural and cyclical influences. That makes it a\nproblematic gauge of the state of the labor market for monetary policy purposes. To understand\nwhy, let’s look at the behavior of labor force participation, which is the percentage of the\nworking-age population in the labor force, and the source of the difference in the employment\nand unemployment numbers.\n5 Erceg and Levin (2013).\n7\n\nOver the past few years, labor force participation has plunged below 64 percent, a level\nnot seen in almost 30 years. This drop in labor force participation explains how the\nunemployment rate can be falling while the employment-to-population ratio has been roughly\nstagnant. The overall ranks of the unemployed have been declining because many people are\nleaving the labor force, rather than finding jobs. But, it’s important to remember that much of\nthis decline in labor force participation reflects long-running demographic trends, such as retiring\nbaby boomers leaving the workforce.6 In addition, in recent years there has been a big exodus of\nyoung people and so-called prime-age adults. Again, some of this is related to ongoing trends,\nsuch as an increasing share of young adults enrolling in school, and workers moving onto\ndisability rolls.\nNonetheless, a portion of the exodus from the labor market is due to the recession and\nslow recovery. It appears that unprecedented numbers of young and prime-age workers have\nbeen bailing out of the labor force because the job market has looked dismal. Many of these\nprime-age workers who have left the labor force say they want jobs and are available to work.\nBut they don’t think they can find work, so they’ve given up looking and therefore they’re not\ncounted as unemployed. Many of these people will probably return to the job market as\nconditions improve.7\nAll this gets quite complex. On the one hand, we have structural trends, like the aging of\nthe workforce and young people spending more time in school. On the other hand, we have the\neffects of a weak economy, which discourages people from looking for work. From the\nstandpoint of gauging the state of the labor market for monetary policy, it is crucial that we\ndistinguish between structural developments in the labor market and the effects of a weak\n6 Toossi (2012a, b).\n7 Bengali, Daly, and Valletta (2013).\n8\n\neconomy. Recent estimates by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and others suggest that\nstructural factors account for most of the decline in participation over the past several years.8\nAccording to this research, structural factors reducing labor supply are the main reason that the\nemployment-to-population ratio has stayed so low while unemployment has declined. Therefore,\nthe employment-to-population ratio is sending a much too pessimistic signal regarding the\namount of slack in the labor market. On the other hand, this evidence also suggests that the\nunemployment rate probably is overstating somewhat the extent of improvement in the labor\nmarket. However, over time, as discouraged workers rejoin the labor force, this problem should\ngo away.\nAs this discussion demonstrates, it’s devilishly hard to distinguish between people who\nhave left the labor force because of ongoing trends and those who left because the job market has\nbeen hurting. There’s just a huge amount of uncertainty about what causes people to enter and\nexit the labor force for us to have much confidence in the employment-to-population ratio as a\ngauge of how close we are to maximum employment. Of course, we will continue to look at a\nwide range of indicators when we evaluate labor market conditions. But the preponderance of\nevidence indicates that the unemployment rate remains the best overall summary statistic.\nWhat does that mean for monetary policy? First, the unemployment rate and a number of\nother labor market indicators, such as payroll job gains, point to continued progress in the labor\nmarket. Clearly, we are getting closer to meeting our test of substantial improvement in the labor\nmarket.\nSecond, any changes in policy will depend not only on labor market conditions, but also\non inflation. In our July statement, the FOMC noted that inflation persistently below 2 percent\ncould pose risks to economic performance. That means we will also take into consideration\n8 Toossi (2012a, b).\n9\n\nwhether inflation is moving closer to our target. Third, any adjustments to our purchases are\nlikely to be part of a multistep gradual process, reflecting the pace of improvement in the\neconomy.\nAs I noted earlier, Chairman Bernanke has laid out a timetable for our securities\npurchases, which includes reducing them later this year and ending them around the middle of\nnext year, assuming our forecasts for the economy hold true. I haven’t significantly changed my\nforecast since then, and I view Chairman Bernanke’s timetable to still be the best course forward.\nHowever, I can’t emphasize enough that when and how we adjust our purchases will depend\ncrucially on what the incoming data tell us about the outlooks for the pace of improvement in the\nlabor market and movement towards our inflation goal.\nI should also stress that cutting back our purchases does not mean the Fed will be\ntightening monetary policy. As long as we are increasing our asset holdings, we are adding\nstimulus to the economy. And there’s another critical point: Even when we eventually halt asset\npurchases, we will continue to maintain the current very low level of the fed funds rate for at\nleast as long as the unemployment rate is above 6½ percent and the conditions regarding\ninflation and inflation expectations are met. Based on my current forecast, I don’t expect the\neconomy to reach 6½ percent unemployment until the first half of 2015, and I don’t expect the\nFOMC to raise rates until later that year. So monetary policy will continue to be extraordinarily\nstimulative for quite some time.\nI am convinced that our policies have been instrumental in reviving the economy and\navoiding what could have been an economic meltdown. But the time is approaching when our\neconomy will have enough momentum on its own without the need for additional monetary\nstimulus. This is undeniably welcome news. Although the road ahead will likely be bumpy at\n10\n\ntimes, with some twists and turns, I am confident that we will be able to navigate successfully\nthe eventual normalization of monetary policy and achieve our goals of maximum employment\nand price stability. Thank you very much.\n11\n\nReferences\nBengali, Leila, Mary Daly, and Rob Valletta. 2013. “Will Labor Force Participation Bounce Back?”\nFRBSF Economic Letter 2013-14 (May 13). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/economic-letter/2013/may/will-labor-force-participation-bounce-back/\nBernanke, Ben S. 2013. “Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference, June 19, 2013.” Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20130619.pdf\nErceg, Christopher, and Andrew Levin. 2013. “Labor Force Participation and Monetary Policy in the\nWake of the Great Recession.” Paper prepared for Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Conference on\n“Fulfilling the Full Employment Mandate,” April 12–13.\nhttp://www.bos.frb.org/employment2013/papers/Erceg_Levin_Session1.pdf\nLucking, Brian, and Daniel Wilson. 2013. “Fiscal Headwinds: Is the Other Shoe About to Drop?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2013-16 (June 3). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2013/june/fiscal-headwinds-federal-budget-policy/\nToossi, Mitra. 2012a. “Labor Force Projections to 2020: A More Slowly Growing Workforce.” Monthly\nLabor Review 135(1, January), pp. 43–64. http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2012/01/art3full.pdf\nToossi, Mitra. 2012b. “Projections of the Labor Force to 2050: A Visual Essay.” Monthly Labor Review\n135(10, October), pp. 3–16. http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2012/10/art1full.pdf\nWilliams, John C. 2012. “The Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Policies.” FRBSF Economic Letter\n2012-34 (November 13). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2012/november/federal-reserve-unconventional-policies/\n12",

    "text": "From Sustained Recovery to\nSustainable Growth:\nWhat a Difference Four Years Makes\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo\nTHE FORECASTERS CLUB\nNew York, New York\nMarch 29, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nThank you, President Rupkey, and thanks to everyone at the Forecasters Club. I\nrecently gave a talk to some business leaders back in California, and I found myself\ndescribing the Fed as an “amazingly nerdy group of people who pore over data, computer models,\nand statistical analysis.” So I hope you’ll take it as a compliment when I say that being\nhere with a bunch of folks who’ve willingly given up their lunch hour to discuss\neconomic forecasting makes me feel right at home.\nLike you, I’ve attended many gatherings such as this in the years since the onset of the\nGreat Recession. Sometime after the coffee is poured and the conversation begins, it\ninvariably turns to where things stand with the recovery. Today, I’d like to propose we\ndo something a little different …\nWith an economy at full employment, inflation nearing the Fed’s 2 percent goal, and\nthe expansion now in its eighth year, the data have spoken and the message is clear:\nWe’ve largely attained the hard-sought recovery we’ve been after for the past nine\nyears.\n1\n\nIn light of this achievement, we need to shift the conversation from “how do we achieve a\nsustained recovery?” to “how do we sustain the recovery we’ve achieved?”\nI’d like to focus my remarks today on this topic of sustainable growth and to address a\nrelated question: “What will it take to improve the trend line on GDP growth from the\nhistorically low pace we experienced during the recovery?”\nWhen I was last here four years ago, I argued that, although the financial crisis had\nundeniably left its mark on the supply side of the economy, the primary problem we\nfaced from the perspective of monetary policy was a lack of demand.1 The\nunemployment rate was stuck around 8 percent at that time, and the Federal Reserve\nwas determined to get us back to full employment and 2 percent inflation.\nSpoiler alert: As our focus shifts to sustainable growth, today I will argue that supply-\nside factors are the main impediment to growth going forward – and that this calls for\nactions outside the purview of monetary policy.\nI know that you’ve heard from quite a few of my Fed colleagues in the past, so the\nfollowing disclaimer should sound familiar: The views I express are mine alone and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nFOUR YEARS AGO\nAs I begin, I want to take you back in time. The year is 2013. The month is February.\nReal GDP growth has averaged only about 2-percent annually since the recession\nended in 2009 – a very slow pace compared with the other recoveries of the past. At\nthe same time, the level of real GDP per capita is still about 1.6 percent lower than it\nhad been five years earlier, before the recession started. Many forecasters and\nanalysts, myself included, describe the pace of the recovery to be “tepid,” “anemic,”\nand “disappointing.”\nAt this moment, it’s still an open question whether a full recovery is even in the cards\n– especially when it comes to the job market. In fact, there is debate among\neconomists as to whether the unemployment rate will ever return to its pre-recession\nlevels of around 5 percent or if we should adjust to a “new normal” of significantly\nhigher unemployment.\nTHE PRESENT\n1 Williams (2013).\n2\n\nWhat a difference four years makes … we’re now very close to reaching the Fed’s\ndual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. In fact, if you do the\nmath, we are about as close to these goals as we’ve ever been.\nThe latest jobs report has the national unemployment rate at 4.7 percent and this is\nright around where economists and the FOMC put the natural rate of unemployment.\nIncidentally, the natural rate of unemployment was largely viewed as being in the same\nneighborhood prior to the onset of the recession. So when it comes to\nunemployment, the new normal is the same as the old normal. In this one respect,\nthe economy hasn’t changed much over the past decade. But, as I’ll get to in a\nmoment, other more significant changes have taken place.\nTurning to price stability, downward inflation pressures that have held inflation\npersistently lower than 2 percent for the past several years have faded – and as I\nmentioned earlier, we’re near the Fed’s 2 percent goal. I expect that we will reach that\ngoal in the next year or so.\nWith the attainment of our dual mandate goals close at hand, now is more important\nthan ever for monetary policy to work toward what I like to call a “Goldilocks\neconomy” – an economy that doesn’t run too hot or too cold. We want the porridge\nto be just right.\nOur aim is to keep the economic expansion on a sound footing that can be sustained\nfor as long as possible. The last thing any of us want is to undermine the hard-won\ngains we’ve made since the dark days of the recession.2\nAs it stands today, with the economy in striking distance of our goals, monetary policy\nstill has the pedal to the metal. Even with the rate increase the FOMC announced a\ncouple weeks ago at its March meeting, interest rates remain near historical lows. I’m\nsure that many, if not most of you, have taken a look at the FOMC’s statement which\nnoted that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to\nprevail in the longer run.”3\nI’m often asked, “since things are going well, why not just keep our foot on the gas?” The\nanswer is that lifting it gradually off the pedal prevents the economy from\noverheating.\n2 See Williams (2016) for further discussion.\n3 Board of Governors (2017a).\n3\n\nThis is why the FOMC took action in March, and why the median view of my FOMC\ncolleagues is for three interest rate increases in 2017.4 My own view is similar to most\nof my FOMC colleagues. I should note, however, that given my forecast, along with\nupside risks, I would not rule out more than three increases total for this year.\nI want to emphasize that I see the pace of rate increases as gradual – that is, slower\nthan in past economic expansions – and intended to bring monetary policy back to a\nnormal stance.\nImportantly, I am confident that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy pace\nas we pursue this path of normalization.\nSLOW PACE OF GROWTH, SLOW GROWTH IN POTENTIAL\nI’ve spoken a bit about our recent past, and where things stand today. I want to\nspend the rest of my remarks on the future – particularly as it relates to sustainable\ngrowth.\nAs we move forward, I see the unemployment rate nudging down a bit further,\nultimately bottoming out near 4½ percent by the end of the year. Since the\nunemployment rate already has been hovering at or below most estimates of the\nnatural rate for the past year, this implies a sustained, albeit relatively modest,\novershooting of full employment. This, in turn, implies that some slowing of growth\nslightly below potential will be needed in the future.\nThe reduction in unemployment has been very impressive. One of the fascinating\nthings that’s been going on in the economy is that GDP growth has been almost\nequally unimpressive. As I mentioned, I referred to growth as “anemic” when I was\nhere in 2013.\nToday, that pace of growth of just above 2 percent during the first half of the\nrecovery is higher than my projection of 1¾ percent real GDP growth for this year\nand next.\nIncidentally, I know that many of you have it higher and that the Blue Chip, for\nexample, forecasts 2.3 percent this year and 2.4 percent next. I’ll get into one of the\nreasons for this difference in a minute – but for the purposes of this discussion, I\nthink we’d all agree that we’d all like to see our economy have the capacity to grow\n4 Board of Governors (2017b).\n4\n\nfaster without creating imbalances.\nRecently, a team of economists which included the San Francisco Fed’s John Fernald,\nlooked at why GDP growth has been so slow, measured relative to its past\nrelationship with the unemployment rate.5 Their work suggests that, for the\nunemployment rate to decline as much as it did, growth over this period must have\nconsistently exceeded its potential. In conjunction with related research, it’s clear that\nthe “disappointing” growth in GDP is in part due to slow growth in potential.6\nSUPPLY SIDE\nThis brings us back to the demand-supply distinction I made at the start.\nMy contention is that now that we’ve reached maximum employment, demand is not\nthe primary constraint that’s holding back further, sustainable expansion. Our focus\ngoing forward, therefore, should be on constraints which are largely coming from the\nsupply side of the economy.\nAs you know, overall economic growth depends broadly on growth in the supply of\nlabor and productivity gains.\nLet’s start with the supply of labor. In a nutshell, the growth rate of the labor force is\nshrinking at the very time that demand for workers is rising. We’re no longer living in\na 1970s and 1980s world, where a wave of young people and women are entering the\nworkforce. The historical transition of women to the labor force is long complete.\nBaby boomers are retiring.7 And many prime-age men are beset by health and other\nchallenges that are undermining their willingness or ability to work.8\nWith this as backdrop, over the next decade the labor force in the U.S. is projected to\ngrow at only ½ percent per year,9 and this represents a considerable drop from the\npace we’ve experienced over the past 40 years. This means that, unlike in the 1970s\nand ’80s, demographics will hold back rather than boost potential output growth.\nNow let’s look at productivity … As you know, productivity growth has been\nexceptionally weak over the past five years. I’d imagine some of you are asking, “this\nguy is coming to us from the backyard of Silicon Valley and he’s talking about weak productivity\n5 Fernald et al. (2017).\n6 Fernald (2016).\n7 Aaronson et al. (2014).\n8 Krueger (2016).\n9 Congressional Budget Office (2016).\n5\n\ngrowth? Aren’t the streets clogged with self-driving cars out there?”\nWell, first let me say that, as I’m sure you’d attest, productivity is a notoriously tricky\nthing to measure. In the tech sector in particular, we hear the common refrain that\neconomists are using outdated methods to quantify the pace of productivity growth.\nThere is some truth to that critique, but the resulting measurement distortion appears\nsmall, and it’s not at all clear that it has gotten noticeably worse over time.10\nWith that said, there is a considerable difference between today’s innovation economy\nand the tech boom of the 1990s, when many of the new innovations were designed to\nmake businesses more efficient and productive. Today, many new innovations are\naimed at our leisure time. Sharing cat videos or finding where Pokémon is hiding can\nenrich our lives but not necessarily our productivity.\nTurning back to the data … Over the past 40 years, total-economy productivity\ngrowth has typically averaged between 1 and 1¼ percent per year, and I maintain this\nis a reasonable benchmark moving forward.11 In fact, with growth in the average\neducational attainment of our labor force slowing down, one important source of past\nproductivity gains is fading.12 Barring the introduction of a major game-changing\ninnovation for businesses (which are notoriously hard to predict), it’s going to be very\ndifficult to get far above that rate of productivity growth. Combining that near 1\npercent figure with labor force growth of 0.5 percent yields my trend growth estimate\nof 1.6 percent.\nI recognize that this figure is lower than many estimates out there -- and that\ndifference may explain why my forecast of 1¾-percent GDP growth over this year\nand next is also lower than many private forecasters. But, I find the data and research\ncompelling that the new normal for growth is much lower than in past decades.\nTHE LIMITS OF MONETARY POLICY\nFour years ago, when we were addressing a lack of demand, there was a major role for\nmonetary policy to play. Four years later, as we set our sights on supply, the limits of\nour monetary policy toolkit are more telling.\nUnshackling the economy from these supply-side restraints is instead the purview of\nthings like federal fiscal policy, state and local legislative actions, philanthropy,\nbusiness investment, public-private partnerships, etc.\n10 Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).\n11 Byrne et al. (2016) and Gordon (2016).\n12 Bosler et al. (2016).\n6\n\nThe public and private decision makers who work in these realms have it within their\ntoolkits to spark growth and innovation, if they so choose … to invest in priorities\nlike education, training, safer and healthy neighborhoods, and infrastructure. All these\nthings serve to build human capital and support a growing, productive workforce –\nsupply-side factors that can move the trend line on potential growth.\nThis does not mean that the role of monetary policy is any less important moving\nforward. To promote sustainable growth, it is critically important that the Fed\ncontinue to make data-driven decisions to keep the economy from overheating and to\nprotect the hard-won gains we’ve made.\nMeanwhile, I believe strongly that any institution that has a stake in the future of\nAmerican prosperity has a role to play in moving the ball forward.\nThe San Francisco Fed is a founding member of a wonderful coalition called\nSPARCC – and in fact, I’ll be participating in an event with our partners tomorrow.\nThey include investors and community stakeholders alike – united in the belief that, if\nwe can bring investment in things like education, public health, and transit to\nunderserved communities, then ultimately we all benefit. As the organization’s motto\nsays, we all do better when everyone thrives.\nCONCLUSION\nAs I wrap up, I must say that, although it’s always wonderful to talk with you, I much\nprefer being able to do so in light of more than seven years of economic expansion,\ninflation near 2 percent, and a new normal for unemployment which thankfully looks\na lot like the old, pre-recession normal.\nIt’s great to be able to ask questions like how do we sustain the recovery we’ve achieved? – to\nbe able to look at sustainable growth post-recovery, rather than having to focus on\ncreating a sustained recovery.\nLike I said, what a difference four years makes! Thank you all very much.\n7\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher. 2014. “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects.” Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197–255. https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/labor-force-\nparticipation-recent-developments-and-future-prospects/\nBlue Chip Economic Indicators. 2017.

    "text": "Presentation to the Conference on Asian Banking and Finance at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFor delivery on June 11, 2012\nWelcoming Remarks\nGood morning. I’m delighted to welcome you to the San Francisco Fed for our biennial\ninternational Asian Banking and Finance conference. Over the years, we’ve brought together\npolicymakers, bankers, academics, and regulators to examine how global economic and financial trends\nare playing out in Asia. We initiated this conference series back in 2007, ten years after the Asian\nfinancial crisis of the late 1990s. This is our fourth gathering, and the theme this year is “Challenges in\nGlobal Finance: The Role of Asia.” There is no shortage of important topics to explore over the next two\ndays, particularly in light of the current European debt crisis and its effects on the global financial system.\nIt has been about five years since the beginning of the global financial crisis. In the United States,\nthe health of the financial system has greatly improved. The largest and most complex banks are stronger\nin terms of capital and liquidity. Loan demand is improving. And most banks have returned to\nprofitability. Recent stress tests indicated that, even under a severely adverse scenario, most of the largest\nbanking companies would have adequate capital and could continue to lend.\nIn addition, we are making important strides in addressing flaws in our framework for supervising\nsystemically important financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act responds to many of the lessons\nlearned from the crisis. Importantly, it brings major nonbank financial companies into the regulatory\nframework. It creates disincentives for large companies to keep on growing in size, complexity, and\ninterconnectedness. And it also creates a process to liquidate large financial companies in an orderly\nfashion. In these ways, Dodd-Frank helps address the too-big-to-fail problem. Similar efforts are under\n\nway in many countries, including in Asia. These should make the global financial system stronger and\nmore resilient.\nWhile the global financial system is stronger than it was three years ago, it remains vulnerable.\nThe European sovereign debt crisis threatens banks in that continent, and, by extension, elsewhere.\nClearly, it represents a significant threat to financial stability. In the worst case, the European crisis could\nundermine the financial improvements in North America and Asia. But this crisis is by no means the only\nrisk. Economic trends in many parts of the world appear to be deteriorating. Although growth in the\nUnited States remains moderate, Europe looks to be in recession. And, in China, recent indicators point\nto a marked deceleration in growth. Many large global financial institutions remain highly leveraged and\nrely on volatile wholesale funding. Others are still working through troubled loan portfolios. Efforts by\nregulators to close loopholes exposed by the crisis remain a work in progress. They will take years to\ncomplete.\nAsian financial institutions did not take part in the excesses that caused the financial crisis of\n2007–09. Of course, they had been battered and bruised during the Asian financial crisis a decade before.\nIn the aftermath of that episode, they built strong balance sheets with high capital levels and solid\nliquidity buffers. Still, most Asian banks were hit hard by the global crisis. When international credit\nmarkets froze in 2008, institutions across Asia faced severe funding challenges. This was especially so\nfor banks that needed to raise U.S. dollars. Some institutions experienced marked deposit outflows as\nconsumer and depositor confidence plummeted. And it wasn’t just Asia’s financial sector that got hit.\nThe recessions in the United States and Europe spilled over to Asian economies through trade and\ninvestment channels. As in the West, consumer confidence fell and domestic demand for loans dropped\nsharply. Asian policymakers used many of the same tools that their counterparts in North America and\nEurope did to boost economic growth and strengthen their financial sectors, including aggressive\nmonetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and regulatory reform.\n\nAt the same time, Asia played an important role in stabilizing the economic and financial\nsituations. China’s rapid growth supported economic activity in many parts of the world. Several Asian\ninstitutions contributed capital to U.S. and European banks. Others expanded internationally. Some\nAsian banks got new customers and footholds into new businesses. Moreover, Asian financial regulators\nparticipated actively in international efforts to redefine supervisory standards. Most recently, Asian\ngovernments have played vital roles in international initiatives to support stabilization efforts in Europe.\nClearly, in today’s interconnected economy, Asia is both affected by global financial events and\npositioned to influence them.\nThese observations bring me back to this conference. The sessions over the next two days will\nfocus on global finance through an Asian lens. One of the strengths of this conference series is how it\nknits together questions of finance, banking, and supervision. We are fortunate to have a diverse and\ndistinguished roster of speakers, discussants, and panelists. I’m certain we’ll have a lively exchange of\nideas. I want to thank my colleagues in the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation for\norganizing and hosting this event, and all of you for taking part. Let me now turn things over to Walter\nYao, who will introduce our keynote speaker.",

    "text": "Presentation to Community Leaders\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on July 28, 2011\nThe Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy1\nThank you very much for coming today. It’s a pleasure to be here in Salt Lake City.\nYou’ve got nearly everything here—mountains, desert, and, of course, the lake. In fact, as a\nnative Californian, I would say the only thing that’s missing is the ocean.\nMy subject today is the outlook for the economy. We are now two full years into the\neconomic recovery, yet progress on restoring the economy from the damage caused by the\nfinancial crisis and ensuing Great Recession remains discouragingly slow. The news from the\njobs front has been particularly disappointing, with the unemployment rate—currently 9.2\npercent—stubbornly high. This afternoon, I’ll give my perspective on why economic growth has\nbeen so modest and offer my outlook for the future, which anticipates some improvement during\nthe second half of this year and next year. I’ll also talk about inflation, which has seesawed in\nrecent months. Finally, I’ll explain what the Federal Reserve is doing to promote maximum\nemployment and price stability. As usual, my remarks represent my own views and not\nnecessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nBefore I go any further, I should say a few words about the budget and debt limit\nsituation in Washington, which is going down to the wire. I’ll refrain from commenting on\npolitics, but a few economic points are worth making. There is no question that we are currently\non an unsustainable long-run path of federal fiscal deficits. It is essential that budget deficits\nover the next decade be brought under control. The costs of not doing so are enormous. First,\n1 I want to thank John Fernald, Glenn Rudebusch, and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these\nremarks.\n1\n\nuncertainty about future fiscal policy and doubts about whether Uncle Sam will pay his bills are\nlikely damping consumer and business confidence. Second, heavy government borrowing\npushes up interest rates for businesses and consumers, which tends to reduce capital spending\nand long-term productivity. That’s a recipe for long-run economic decline and lower American\nliving standards. Sooner or later, we’ll have to deal with the deficit, and we should get our house\nin order sooner rather than later. Finally, the lessons from the events in Europe are clear—\nunsustainable deficits can cascade into a crisis. If that happens, policy options are limited and\nthe damage to the economy can be severe.\nHowever, I need to stress, even as the nation must come to terms with its fiscal problems,\na federal default must be avoided. Make no mistake—the Federal Reserve doesn’t have a magic\nwand that will allow the economy to get through a crisis of this magnitude unscathed.\nFortunately, the key players in Washington seem to understand the risks, which may be why\nfinancial markets have stayed reasonably calm—at least so far.\nSo then, assuming a way will be found to raise the federal debt ceiling, where do things\nstand with the economy? Since the middle of 2009, the economy has been steadily growing.\nThat’s no small accomplishment when you consider that less than three years ago we lived\nthrough the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression. The critical question is why\nthe recovery has been stuck in second gear. In particular, the pace of growth has been\ninsufficient to make much of a dent in unemployment. During the downturn, we lost nearly 9\nmillion jobs outside the farm sector. Since job growth resumed, payrolls have expanded by less\nthan 2 million jobs. Moreover, the pace at which we’re creating new jobs has slowed to a crawl.\nIn May and June, we added on average just over 20,000 jobs per month. Not only are 14 million\n2\n\npeople unemployed, but about 45 percent of them have been out of work for six months or more,\na sobering reminder of how deep and prolonged this downturn has been.\nFortunately, some of the disappointing performance this year reflects events that should\nhave only a transitory influence on the economy. These included unusually destructive\nweather—virtual plagues, if you will, of blizzards, tornadoes, and floods. Then, there was\nJapan’s disaster, which caused supply-chain disruptions in several industries, especially autos.\nProbably the biggest blow came from the spike in energy costs, which undermined confidence\nand damped consumer spending. All the same, the main effect of high energy prices on the\neconomy’s rate of growth should prove temporary. Consumers have had to reduce their\nspending on non-energy goods and services. But if energy prices hold steady, households don’t\nhave to keep cutting their spending by more and more. In fact, oil prices have fallen\nsubstantially since April on net, which means more income is available for discretionary\npurchases.\nWhile these transitory factors depressed first-half growth, it would be wrong to suggest\nthat we are only swimming against a temporary tide. The problem is that some persistent and\ndeep currents are restraining our progress.\nHousing and the Recovery\nOne of the most important currents holding back recovery has been housing. The\ncollapse of the housing market touched off the financial crisis and recession. In most recessions,\nhousing construction falls sharply, but then leads the economy back when growth resumes. As\nyou well know, that snapback hasn’t occurred this time. Before the crisis, residential investment\nas a share of the economy was at its highest level since the Korean War. Today, housing\n3\n\nconstruction remains moribund and residential investment as a share of the economy has fallen to\nits lowest level since World War II.\nOn one level, that’s not surprising. We simply built too many—in fact, millions too\nmany—houses during the boom and we are still feeling the effects of this overhang. Consider\nhousing prices. From their peak in 2006 until early 2009, home prices nationwide fell by nearly\na third. When you exclude distressed sales, prices appeared to bottom out in 2009 and early\n2010. New housing starts also appeared to stabilize in 2009, after plummeting some 75 percent\nduring the housing crash. I’m happy to report that Utah has done better than the nation as a\nwhole, and certainly the housing market here is not as depressed as in such neighboring states as\nArizona and Nevada. Prices here are down only about 20 percent from their peak, and\nforeclosure and delinquency rates are also lower.\nThe $64,000 question is when will the housing market finally recover? One daunting\nchallenge for such a recovery is the huge number of homes in foreclosure. Almost 7 million\nhomes have entered into foreclosure since the first quarter of 2008 and some 2 million are still in\nthe foreclosure process. In addition, there is a shadow inventory of homes currently owned by\ndelinquent borrowers. When you add up unsold new houses left over from the boom, homes for\nsale by owners, foreclosed residences for sale by lenders, and the shadow inventory of houses at\nrisk of distressed sale, you come up with a massive supply overhang.\nOver time, more reasonable prices and an improving economy ought to bring buyers off\nthe sidelines and set the stage for recovery. But high unemployment and anemic wage gains are\nleaving people worried about their income prospects and cautious about buying homes. Also, the\ndramatic plunge in home valuations since 2006 has made some first-time homebuyers wary\nabout entering the market because of worries that prices might fall further.\n4\n\nCredit conditions\nA second current we’ve been swimming against is tight credit conditions. Let’s take\nsmall business, for example. It’s harder today for small businesses to get credit and some of the\nreasons aren’t immediately obvious. The usual image of the small business owner is the man or\nwoman who goes to a Main Street bank looking for a loan. However, it turns out that small\nbusinesses depend indirectly on global capital markets for funding. Indeed, the ultimate lender\nto small businesses in the United States may be in Frankfurt or Hong Kong. One of the most\nimportant ways small businesses are tied to global capital markets is through commercial\nmortgages on their business properties. Before the financial crisis, lenders sold many of those\nloans to investment banks, which then pooled them as commercial mortgage-backed securities in\na process similar to the way residential mortgages were packaged. This commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities market has been depressed since the crisis, and that’s made commercial\nmortgages harder for businesses to get.2\nCredit is also an issue for consumers. Before the crisis, it seemed you could always count\non free-spending Americans to bail the economy out. But now consumers are keeping a firm\ngrip on their wallets and purses. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose during the first five\nmonths of 2011 at an anemic 1 percent annual rate. Tight credit is one reason people aren’t\nloading up at the mall, and why they aren’t buying houses and cars in anywhere near the\nnumbers we saw in the recent past. Households have gone from unusually easy access to credit\nduring the housing boom to a period of unusual tightness. Lenders are stricter with credit cards,\nand home equity loans are no longer the instant source of cash they were a few years ago. To\nqualify for a mortgage these days, you need a strong credit score and the resources to come up\n2 See Wilcox (2011).\n5\n\nwith a substantial down payment. By contrast, to qualify for a mortgage in 2005, it seemed like\nall you needed was a pulse.\nRestraints on consumer spending\nCredit is far from the only factor keeping consumers and businesses in check. The weak\njob market and slow income growth limit what households have to spend. At the same time,\nhouseholds have been trying to repair their finances after years of taking on too much debt and\nsetting aside too little in savings. Americans have come to realize the dangers of running up debt\nand they’ve rediscovered thrift. A key impetus has been rebuilding wealth lost when house\nprices collapsed and the stock market tanked. The combination of high unemployment, stagnant\nincomes, lower debt levels, and more saving is a recipe for feeble consumer spending gains.\nResearch at the San Francisco Fed suggests that monthly consumer spending per person is\nrunning at a rate about $175 below where it would be if pre-recession trends had continued.3\nOne other current I should mention is government. Local, state, and now the federal\ngovernment are aggressively cutting spending to balance budgets or trim deficits. Total\ngovernment employment is down by almost half a million since the recovery began. Budget\nreform is good medicine for the long run. But, in the short run, government belt-tightening\nmeans that the private sector will have to do even more to keep the recovery on track.\nOutlook for growth\nUp to this point, I’ve focused on some of the factors holding back growth. On the plus\nside, there are important areas of strength in the economy. Manufacturing has been expanding\nthanks in part to a rebound in the auto industry and solid demand for U.S. exports, two sectors\nthat were especially hard-hit during the recession. Corporate profits have been healthy, which\nhas helped fuel rising business investment in equipment and software. Information technology\n3 See Lansing (2011).\n6\n\nhas been on a roll, and there are even signs of a mini boom in public offerings and private share\nsales for Internet and social networking companies.\nLooking ahead, I expect the pace of economic growth to pick up. First, the financial\nsector’s health and access to credit is improving. In addition, the trend toward thrift means that\nconsumers also seem to be in better financial condition. Second, pent-up demand should help\nthe sale of durable goods as households finally replace beat-up cars and outdated appliances.\nAnd, third, the drag from housing should slowly diminish. It’s only a matter of time before we\nwork off the inventory overhang and construction picks up. How much time it takes will depend\nin part on what happens with foreclosed properties. If we begin making progress on working\ndown the foreclosure inventory, then single-family housing starts could plausibly rise from their\ncurrent level of about 400,000 per year to an average level of perhaps 1.1 million per year in\nthree or four years, according to research at the San Francisco Fed.4 To put this in perspective,\nsuch an increase would boost real gross domestic product, or GDP, by at least 1 percent.\nLet’s look more closely at real GDP, which measures the total output of goods and\nservices adjusted for changes in prices. In the first half of the year, real GDP was held down by\nall the transitory factors I mentioned and appears to have expanded at an annual rate of about 1½\npercent. As these temporary influences on growth wane and even reverse, I expect real GDP will\ngrow at a pace a bit faster than 3 percent in the second half of this year and in 2012. Meanwhile,\nthe unemployment rate should edge down to about 9 percent by the end of this year and 8¼\npercent next year. This is still a very high unemployment rate, but at least the trend should be in\nthe right direction.\n4 By contrast, if we can’t work down the foreclosure inventory, then a return to normal construction levels could be\ndelayed several more years. See Hedberg and Krainer (2011).\n7\n\nInflation\nLet me turn now to a subject that’s been the focus of a lot of attention lately—inflation.\nIn the past few years, we’ve had some sizable swings in inflation. There are several measures of\ninflation, but the one the Fed follows most closely is the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures, or PCE, which is compiled from the same data used to calculate GDP. Last year,\nby this measure, inflation was low, just a bit more than 1 percent. But in the first half of this\nyear, prices rose much more quickly. We don’t have the June data for this measure yet, but the\nannualized price increase in the first half of this year looks to have been more like 3½ percent.\nThis increase in inflation reflected sharp rises in many commodity prices, especially gasoline and\nother energy items. Gas prices peaked in April and have come down quite a bit since then. In\nfact, the PCE inflation rate was probably negative in June.\nThis sharp volatility in energy prices is not all that unusual. Because of these big ups and\ndowns, economists look beneath the surface of the overall inflation number for a better indicator\nof underlying inflation trends. When we do that, we find that there has been a clear upswing in\nthe inflation rate for non-energy goods and services this year compared with the very low levels\nseen in the latter part of 2010. What’s behind this rise in inflation? In part, higher prices for\nenergy, certain other commodities, and some imported products have worked their way into the\nprices of other goods. For example, my business contacts have repeatedly stressed the pressures\nthey are facing from higher costs for raw materials, energy, and transportation. In addition, the\nprices of goods from China have been rising. Autos represent a special case in which supply\nbottlenecks after the Japanese earthquake created scarcity that allowed retailers to charge more.\nImportantly, these are factors that are likely to provide only a temporary boost to\ninflation, rather than harbingers of an ongoing inflationary trend. In fact, with energy prices\n8\n\nfalling and forecasts for economic growth in the United States and elsewhere coming down, it’s\nprobable that inflation will subside, rather than continue to rise. With an unemployment rate of\nover 9 percent, we still have a great deal of slack in the economy, and that limits the ability of\nworkers to demand higher wages or businesses to raise prices. At the same time, there is little\nsign that financial market participants or the broader public expect inflation to accelerate in the\nmedium term.\nLooking ahead to next year, I see inflation settling in at around 1½ percent, somewhat\nbelow my long-run preferred level of around 2 percent. Of course, this is just a forecast and\nforecasts can be wrong. I want to stress though that we need to keep a watchful eye on inflation\nto make sure that recent increases aren’t ongoing.\nFederal Reserve policy\nI’d like to shift gears now to talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing. By law, the\nFed has two policy objectives: promoting maximum employment and price stability. In the face\nof this subdued recovery and an outlook for relatively low inflation, we are keeping in place our\nhighly stimulatory monetary policy. We pushed down our target for the federal funds rate close\nto zero late in 2008 and have kept it there since. The fed funds rate is the rate banks charge each\nother for overnight loans and is a benchmark for many other interest rates in the economy. We\ncontinue to believe that economic conditions warrant keeping the fed funds rate at exceptionally\nlow levels for an extended period.\nIn addition, to hold down longer-term interest rates and provide added stimulus, the Fed\nhas carried out large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage-related securities. Last month,\nwe completed—on time and on budget—the most recent round of $600 billion of longer-term\nTreasury securities purchases, which the financial press dubbed QE2. The Fed now holds close\n9\n\nto $2.7 trillion in securities and debt instruments. As these holdings mature and mortgages\nunderlying the mortgage-backed securities are prepaid, we reinvest the principal in Treasury\nsecurities to keep the total quantity of our overall securities holdings steady. Research suggests\nthat maintaining our holdings puts downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, even if we\ndon’t enlarge our portfolio.5\nIt’s clear that these measures have not been enough to usher in a robust recovery. That\nsaid, it’s important to ask though where we would be if monetary policy hadn’t been so\nstimulatory. Longer–term interest rates would be perhaps half a percentage point higher,\naccording to recent research.6 Mortgages would be less affordable, and the housing market\nwould be in even worse shape than it is, if that’s imaginable. Other interest rate-sensitive sectors\nwould also be worse off. This stimulus also probably helped prevent the U.S. economy from\nfalling into a sustained period of deflation.\nLooking ahead, we at the Fed will keep a very close eye on incoming data and adjust our\npolicy as needed to work towards our two policy goals. If the recovery stalls and inflation\nremains low or deflationary pressures reemerge, then we may need to keep our very stimulatory\npolicies in place for quite some time or even increase stimulus. On the other hand, assuming\ngrowth picks up and inflation doesn’t fall too low, then at some point we’ll need to start\ngradually removing stimulus.\nA great deal of thought has gone into designing the proper ways to unwind the measures\nnow in place. As outlined in the minutes of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, our policymaking body, our exit strategy would likely begin with a move to stop\nreinvesting principal payments on our securities holdings, which would gradually shrink our\n5 Chung et al. (2011).\n6 Chung et al. (2011), and Gagnon et al. (2011).\n10\n\nbalance sheet.7 We will be very careful to communicate our plans in advance, most notably in\nthe statements we issue after policy meetings. When appropriate, we will begin to raise the fed\nfunds rate and return to more normal policy, in which moving the fed funds rate is our main tool\nfor influencing the economy. In addition, likely sometime after the first increase in the fed funds\nrate, we will start selling assets gradually to bring the size of our balance sheet to more normal\nlevels. As always, the direction of policy, and the timing and pace of any policy actions, will be\ndictated by the evolution of the economy. Thank you very much for your attention and I would\nbe happy to take your questions.\n7 For more discussion of exit strategy, see Board of Governors (2011).\n11\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2011. “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee,” June 21–22.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20110622.htm\nChung, Hess, Jean-Philippe Laforte, David Reifschneider, and John C.

    "text": "Presentation to Business and Community Leaders\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 9, 2014\nNavigating toward Normal: The Road Back to the Future for Monetary Policy\nGood afternoon and welcome. It’s great to be here with business and community leaders\nfrom around Las Vegas, members of both our Los Angeles Branch and San Francisco Head\nOffice Boards of Directors, and Fed friends, families, and representatives from around the\nDistrict. I’m also very happy to welcome Mayor Carolyn Goodman. We had an informative tour\nof some redevelopment sites in downtown Las Vegas yesterday, including neighborhoods that\nare part of the Downtown Achieves initiative. That project has brought public- and private-sector\npartners together to address academic attainment in under-performing schools. My own staff at\nthe San Francisco Fed works closely with them on this important work.\nI’d like to talk to you today about the outlook for the economy, as well as address some\nof the whens, whys, and hows of monetary policy going forward. As ever, please remember that\nthe views I express today are entirely my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nI’ll be honest: These speeches get more and more enjoyable as time goes by because the\neconomic outlook keeps getting better and better. Instead of gloom and doom with a scattering of\n1\n\nhopeful notes, things are now pretty upbeat, with only a couple of standard economist’s caveats\nthrown in.\nTo wit: After a dip in the first quarter, real GDP bounced back sharply in the second\nquarter. All the data point toward momentum having been sustained entering the second half of\nthe year, with solid gains in consumer and business spending. Taking all the pieces of\ninformation together, I expect real GDP to grow at about a 3 percent annual rate over the second\nhalf of this year and next.1\nThe labor market is also looking a lot better. Over the past 12 months, we’ve added more\nthan 2.6 million jobs and that momentum has been sustained. These job increases helped push\ndown the unemployment rate from 7.2 percent in September 2013 to 5.9 percent this September.\nThe decline in the unemployment rate is important, because it’s generally seen as the best\nsingle barometer of labor market health. But it’s not the only indicator, and we’re seeing\ncontinued improvement across others as well. For example, measures of job vacancies and hiring\nhave strengthened. And a broader measure of underemployment—which includes the\nunemployed, people who are working part-time but want to be full-time, and people who want a\njob but haven’t looked for one in the past four weeks—has dropped significantly over the past\nyear. Similarly, the number of people out of work for over six months has come way down.\n1 Liu (2014).\n2\n\nWhile this is all good news and points to further sustained improvement, there remains\nconsiderable slack in the labor market. Because unemployment can never be zero—in any well-\nfunctioning economy, people will move in and out of jobs and new people will enter the\nworkforce—economists look to the “natural rate” of unemployment as a measure of full\nemployment. I put the natural rate at 5.2 percent, so with unemployment at 5.9 percent—a huge\ndecrease from the recession’s painful 10 percent high—we’re still a way off from full\nemployment. Looking ahead, with solid economic growth and job gains, I expect the\nunemployment rate to gradually come down, reaching 5.2 percent by late next year.\nAnother indication that the labor market still has a way to go is that we’re not yet seeing\nsolid growth in wages.2 At the moment, wage growth is hovering around 2 to 2¼ percent, when\nit really should be between 3 and 3½ percent. That’s the rate I’d expect in a fully functioning\neconomy with a 2 percent inflation rate.\nWhy hasn’t wage growth picked up more as the economy’s improved? A recent study by\nsome of my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed found that there was something of a floor on\nwages during the recession and recovery.3 Employers are generally reluctant to cut wages\noutright, so as the recovery has unfolded, wages have in many cases stayed stagnant, making up\nfor the losses they didn’t—or couldn’t—incur during the depths of the recession. That is\n2 See Aaronson and Jordan (2014) for results regarding the relationship between broad labor market indicators and\nwage inflation.\n3 Daly and Hobijn (2014).\n3\n\ncertainly a contributing factor. But, as unemployment continues its move down, we should see\nthose effects wane and wages gradually move up.\nI’m sure some employers aren’t thrilled with the idea of wages taking off. But that jump\nfrom 2 to 3 percent wage growth is what’s been missing in this recovery; in fact, it’s what we’ve\nbeen waiting for. More wage growth means more money in people’s pockets, which means more\nspending and more economic activity.\nThat’s important because inflation is too low. For anyone who lived through the 1970s\nand early ’80s, it may sound strange to say we want higher inflation. Nonetheless, persistently\nlow, rather than high, inflation has been our concern for the past few years. Inflation has been\nrunning at 1½ percent over the past year. That’s well below the Fed’s longer-term inflation goal\nof 2 percent. With the economy continuing to strengthen and labor market slack dissipating, I\nexpect we’ll see a gradual rise in inflation, reaching our 2 percent goal over the next couple of\nyears.\nTapering and continued accommodative policy\nThe ongoing improvement in the labor market has been a primary motivation for tapering\nthe Fed’s asset purchase program—that is, quantitative easing, or “QE.” As you no doubt know,\nwe’re on track to end these purchases soon, barring any dramatic changes in the economy.4 And\n4 Board of Governors (2014b).\n4\n\nas the economic situation and outlook continue to get better, we’re moving closer to the time we\ncan start thinking about normalizing policy, by which I mean raising the federal funds rate.\nI want to be clear that monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time,\nbecause we’re still quite a way from our goals. We are still experiencing a good amount of slack\nin the labor market. We need progress on unemployment, progress on wage growth, and progress\non inflation. Given the current distance from our goals and my expectation that further progress\ntoward those goals will be gradual, it’s too early to start down the path of full normalization.\nI’ve said it often enough that I should probably have a T-shirt, but let me reiterate: The\ndecision to raise rates will be data-driven, not date-driven. Based on my current forecast for\neconomic growth, employment, and inflation, it would be appropriate to start raising the fed\nfunds rate sometime in the middle of 2015. If the economy or inflation heat up faster than I\nexpect, we should lift rates sooner. If progress on these fronts slows, we should wait longer.\nWhy not now?\nI’ve stated my case for waiting for further progress on our goals before we start raising\nrates. But I increasingly hear voices saying: The economy is really heating up in some places;\nisn’t it time to start cooling things down? From my perspective, there are compelling reasons to\nremain on the current accommodative path of monetary policy.\nFor one, we still haven’t reached our goals and we need strong stimulus to keep the\neconomic expansion on track and make further progress toward full employment and 2 percent\n5\n\ninflation. Accommodative monetary policy has been an important part of getting us as far along\nin the recovery as we are today, and we don’t want to remove that support prematurely.5 We\nhave reached a point where we no longer require additional stimulus, and for that reason we’re\nending asset purchases. But if we were to withdraw accommodation too soon, progress toward\nour goals could slow or even stall.\nThis is actually exemplified by looking around this room—our audience is made up\nprimarily of representatives from Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. They’re all\nrelatively close, geographically. But if you turn to the person next to you, or walk over to another\ntable, there are going to be very different discussions about housing or unemployment.\nOne of the advantages to the Fed’s system of regional representation is that economies—\nand economic concerns—vary from area to area. The U.S. economy is a composite of a vast and\ndiverse country. Home prices may be increasing strongly in Texas but still struggling to recover\nin Connecticut. Unemployment may be extremely low in North Dakota but high in North\nCarolina.\nEven within Federal Reserve Districts, there are dramatic variations. When I go to work\non Market Street in San Francisco, I’m surrounded by cranes. The Bay Area’s property market is\nbooming—the only thing holding back growth is traffic. But in California’s Central Valley, or\nhere in Las Vegas, it’s a different story. Looking at housing prices across the District, you can\n5 See Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n6\n\nsee how uneven the recovery has been. Home prices in Hawaii and Utah are now down less than\n10 percent from their respective pre-recession peaks. Arizona, on the other hand, is nearly 30\npercent behind and Nevada is trailing its previous highs by almost 40 percent. It’s the same story\nacross the country. Some areas were just hit harder than others by the crisis and recession. 6\nEven if they were rebounding at comparable rates—which not all of them are—they have deeper\nholes to climb out of.\nYou can’t just look at the housing market in San Francisco, or unemployment in Seattle\nto gauge the health of the U.S. economy. You also need to look at the housing market in Las\nVegas and unemployment in Yuma. I don’t want to see accommodation lifted until we’re on\neconomic terra firma across the country. That doesn’t mean that every municipality in America\nneeds to be at pre-recession numbers; but it does mean we need to see further improvement in\nthe many areas where the economy is still struggling.\nThe bottom line is that, in some places, the recession is fading into memory; in others, the\nwounds are still raw. Taking into account this diversity in experience, overall, the economy’s\ngetting better all the time, as the song goes. But we still have a way to go to get to full health.\nA second issue to consider is inflation, which, as I already noted, has been too low.\nConsidering that, it might seem strange that there’s been a lot of talk about inflationary pressures\n6 See Williams (2012) and Mian and Sufi (2013) for discussion of cross-state growth variation during the recession\nand recovery.\n7\n\nlately; fears that it’s going to shoot up unexpectedly. In fact, that’s one of the arguments\nemployed by some commentators who advocate an earlier interest rate hike.\nIn their view, the Fed is lumbering along like a dinosaur, perhaps aware of the danger,\nbut too slow and unwieldy to react to a swift economic predator. Or they’re worried we’re asleep\nat the wheel—or too blinded by our own biases—and don’t see the imminent threat.\nThese concerns got a lot more attention this year when inflation started to edge up. But,\nlike Lucy with the football, just when it looked like inflation pressure might be emerging, it was\nsnatched away. Which leads to a crucial point: To adequately judge inflation’s trajectory we\nneed to carefully analyze the data and separate the signal from the noise. Monthly or quarterly\nnumbers, when taken in isolation, can give a false impression of new trends when in fact they are\njust blips in the data.\nFor most of 2013 and the beginning of 2014, we saw inflation that was very low,\nbottoming out at around 1 percent. There were many influences at work, including declining\nimport prices and reductions in Medicare payments.7 So there were special factors helping to\ndepress inflation. With those pressures ebbing, the inflation rate has floated back up. Indeed, if\nanything, the 1 percent inflation rate in 2013 was the anomaly, not the subsequent rebound to 1½\npercent.\n7 Clemens, Gottlieb, and Shapiro (2014).\n8\n\nAs for those who believe we’re too myopic, or too reliant on data that confirm our own\nprejudices: This is a misconception. For one, the views within the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) fall at points all along the spectrum. For another, we are unapologetic data\nwonks: My decisions are formed by looking at various indicators of wage pressures, employment\nand growth metrics, and a multitude of price measures. I study commentary and analysis from all\ncorners.\nAnd while I think the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis do\nfantastic jobs of collecting and distilling inflation data, I also look at—and point critics to—more\nstraightforward assessments like the Billion Prices Project from the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology.8 This tool scrapes the Internet for prices, giving a daily reading of, well, billions of\nprices of myriad products. It lacks the complicated adjustments and methods that characterize the\ngovernment agencies’ models. Nonetheless, it does track pretty closely with the official numbers.\nWhat’s more, it gives an independent assessment of consumer prices that is helpful for those who\nmay distrust official federal data. While the BPP’s numbers run a tad higher on average than the\nofficial indices, it shows that price inflation remains low and shows no sign of taking off.\nThe signal from all these indicators, both government and independent, point to the same\nconclusion: Inflation trends are quite modest. As I said, I expect that we will be moving back\ntoward our 2 percent longer-run goal over the next few years.\n8 The Billion Prices Project (2014).\n9\n\nNormalizing policy\nAs the economy gets better, we’re moving closer to setting the stage for raising interest\nrates. As I said, I don’t think it’s going to happen soon, nor do I see it being far off in the\nfuture—likely around the middle of next year is a reasonable guess to my mind. As I also said,\nthe data will drive the decision—not just how close we are to our goals, but how quickly they\ncome into sight. And, assuming the economy progresses as anticipated, rates will likely increase\nrelatively gradually. This has been a fragile recovery with significant ups and downs, and there\nare still some lingering headwinds.\nWhenever it happens—that is, whenever the data indicate is the right time—we’ll raise\nrates as we always do during an expansion.\nOne of the things I hope to see when it eventually occurs is a shift in the way the public\nviews Fed decision making. During the extraordinary economic times of the crisis, recession, and\nrecovery, we turned to forward guidance—that is, laying out in very explicit terms where we\nthought the economy and policy were headed. But once we make the return to a more normal\npolicy environment, we won’t need to be so explicit. We want instead to let the public start\nintuiting our actions by looking at the economy and the outlook, understanding it’s the data that\ndrive decisions. We want them to understand our strategy, rather than waiting to be told what we\nplan to do.\n10\n\nThe course of action we’ll eventually take was charted by a lot of research and thinking\nabout the best way to accomplish our goals with as little disruption as possible. At our last\nFOMC meeting, we published a high-level description of our plan to return to normal,\nimaginatively called “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.”9\nAs you may know, our various quantitative easing programs have significantly expanded\nthe Fed’s balance sheet to about $4.5 trillion. This has caused some concerns about how we will\nsteer the economy with such a large balance sheet: one, that it might make controlling interest\nrates too difficult, and two, that reducing the balance sheet over time could prove disruptive.\nWe’re well aware of these issues, we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about them—hence, the\ncarefully considered plan released far in advance of the actual action—and we have the tools to\ndeal with them.\nFirst, we’ll pay interest on reserves held at the Fed. That is, when banks park their money\nwith the Fed, we pay them interest on that money. By increasing the rate we pay to banks for the\nmoney they hold with us, we give them the incentive to keep their reserves with us, rather than\nhaving funds flow into the market and overheat the economy.\nSecond, we have a new tool, the reverse repo facility, which folds non-bank financial\ninstitutions into that process as well. They’ll have the ability to keep their cash with us in\n9 Board of Governors (2014a).\n11\n\nexchange for temporarily holding our assets, with a return that’s below that on excess bank\nreserves.\nThese and other tools will help us keep good control as we raise the target range for the\nfederal funds rate. And, like all tools, we’ll use them appropriately. The reverse repos in\nparticular will be carefully managed, and we’ll eventually eliminate their use when they are no\nlonger needed.\nAs for reducing the balance sheet over time, we won’t be doing it all at once. At some\npoint after we raise the target range for the federal funds rate, we will stop reinvesting maturing\nsecurities and principal payments from our asset holdings. Thereafter, as our securities mature,\nthey’ll simply roll off, and our balance sheet will slowly shrink to a more normal size.\nInstead of going further into more extensive technical explanations, I’ll note that this is\nhow policy is best managed: having a well-thought-through plan. Once you have the plan, it’s\njust a matter of executing it. I have every faith that we’ve looked at this from every angle and\nthat we can manage the transition over time.\nConclusion\nSo the message is that things are getting better. We’re on track to end our asset purchases\nand we’re preparing for the time the economy can sustain an end to accommodation. We’ll want\nto see improvements in unemployment, wages, and inflation, and we’ll be driven by the data. But\nall in all, it’s good news—with just a few of those requisite caveats thrown in.\n12\n\n13\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, and Andrew Jordan. 2014. “Understanding the Relationship between Real Wage\nGrowth and Labor Market Conditions.” Chicago Fed Letter 327, October.\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2014/cfloctober2014_327.\npdf\nThe Billion Prices Project. 2014. “U.S. Daily Index.” Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nhttp://bpp.mit.edu/usa/\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2014a. “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.”\nPress release, September 17.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2014b. “Press Release.” September 17.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917a.htm\nClemens, Jeffrey, Joshua D.

    "text": "Presentation to Boise Business and Community Leaders’ Luncheon\nBoise, Idaho\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 10, 2013\nMonetary Policy and the Recovery\nGood afternoon, it’s a pleasure to be back in Idaho. Yesterday, we toured the Simplot\npotato processing plant out in Caldwell, which is one of the most technologically advanced of its\nkind. This visit was an apt reminder of the importance of both agriculture and high-tech—not\njust to this state but to the country as a whole.\nThere’s been increased discussion of monetary policy lately and why the Fed has taken\nthe actions we have. So I’d like to talk to you today about just that—what the goals of monetary\npolicy are, how we got to this point in economic history, and where we’re going. Before I start, I\nneed to give the usual Fed disclaimer that my remarks represent my own views and do not\nnecessarily reflect the views of others in the Federal Reserve System. Now that’s out of the way,\nlet me begin.\nThe goals of monetary policy\nThe aims of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy are full employment and price\nstability. These goals are set down in law by Congress. In plain English, that means that there\n1\n\nshould be enough jobs for everyone and your paycheck should hold its value. These are laudable\ngoals that I think everyone can support.\nBut there’s a lot of noise around monetary policy and our intent can get lost in the ruckus.\nAnd when we don’t explain what we’re doing and why, I’m afraid the “MSU principle” can take\nover. That is, people will just “make stuff up.” So we at the Fed have been making a concerted\neffort to bring greater clarity and transparency to the discussion.\nOver the past several years, the Fed has undertaken unconventional monetary policies to\nachieve our goals.1 In particular, we’ve engaged in large-scale asset purchases, which most\npeople refer to as quantitative easing, or QE. In addition, we’ve increasingly used forward\nguidance, which seeks to bring more transparency and clarity about our views of the economy\nand intentions regarding future policy. Combined with near-zero short-term interest rates, these\nform the basis of our plan to get people back to work and keep inflation low and stable.\nWe took these steps after the country suffered the worst financial crisis and recession\nsince the Great Depression. The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC—the Federal\nReserve’s monetary policy body—cut the federal funds rate to close to zero. That’s the short-\nterm interest rate that acts as our main conventional policy tool. We would’ve liked to have cut\nrates even further, but nominal interest rates can’t fall much below zero. So, having reached the\n1 See Williams (2012, 2013).\n2\n\nlimit of what we could do with the short-term interest rate, the Fed introduced alternative ways to\nease financial conditions to stimulate economic growth and job creation.\nThe correlation between what the Fed is doing and how it achieves those ends isn’t\nalways clear. And we don’t always make it easy, either. I got asked a great question at a talk I\ngave a while ago. He said, “Look, I understand that the Fed is lowering interest rates, and I\nunderstand that that may get some people to buy a car when they might otherwise wait. But why\ndoes that create jobs? And why does that reduce unemployment?”\nI realized then that people don’t always make the connection that if we’re buying more\ncars, we’re creating more jobs for car manufacturers. And if we’re buying more cars, those\ncompanies need to compete for our business… so they don’t just hire people to make the cars,\nthey hire people to market and sell the cars. And with more employees on the assembly line and\nin the marketing and sales departments, they need more people in HR; they need more people in\naccounting; they need more people running the offices.\nSo now all those newly-employed autoworkers and marketing managers and accountants\nhave more money in their pockets. They’re doing things they couldn’t do before, like going out\nto restaurants—which have to hire more waitstaff to serve more customers, and order more stock\nfrom Simplot to feed them—or going to the movies or even, yes, buying more cars. It’s the\nmultiplier effect—or cause and effect and effect and effect.\n3\n\nSo those are the goals of monetary policy—full employment and price stability. But\nquestions remain about why we still need such aggressive monetary stimulus, and for that we\nhave to turn to the circumstances that brought us here.\nWhere we were—the financial crisis\nThis whole question of how we follow the line of cause and effect is important for\nthinking about where we are in the economic recovery and why. Because part of the reason the\nrecovery hasn’t been as strong as we’d like is the multiple factors that caused the financial crisis\n– and the events that have affected the recovery.\nThe fifth anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ failing led to a lot of commentary and\nreflection on the crisis. Which was good, because time and distance can dull the memory of pain\nor let people oversimplify its causes. It’s easy to forget how bad it was, and just how many\nelements came together in a perfect storm.\nIt all started in the early 2000s, as we were recovering from the dot-com crash. The\nhousing market started to take off, which was great—it provided a much-needed boost to the\neconomy. As house prices rose, people felt wealthier and started to spend more. Again, great.\nBuyers flooded into the market and everyone was sure that prices would continue to rise, which\nwas not so great. It meant lenders felt comfortable taking risks. People who didn’t actually have\nthe income to make monthly payments could get a mortgage. But it didn’t matter, because prices\n4\n\nkept rising. All of a sudden, people who put little or no money down were sitting on five- and\nsix-digit figures of home equity…which was easily converted into cash to buy SUVs or home\nentertainment systems or any number of things that had once been luxuries but now seemed\nwithin reach.\nAt the same time, financial instruments had gotten more and more complicated and lax\nregulation meant little or no oversight. Higher returns meant the people creating those\ninstruments cared less about the exposure to risk, or the effects it could have down the line, and\nmore about short-term gain. As mortgages became far more generous and easier to get, the risks\nincreased. But that risk was chopped up, repackaged, and sold on…and on and on…to investors\nspanning the globe. It reached the point that people who owned the risk often had no clue what\nthey had.\nThen the bottom fell out. People fell behind on mortgage payments, housing values\nplummeted, and credit dried up. Financial institutions stopped lending—including to one\nanother—choking off funds they depended on to finance day-to-day operations.\nThink back to 2008: Fannie and Freddie insolvent; Lehman failed; WaMu; AIG. No one\nknew how big the problem was or how it would end. It seemed very possible that the financial\nsystem as we knew it would collapse entirely. The resulting fear and panic could easily have\nushered in a major depression.\n5\n\nI want to stress that: as bad as it was, it could have been much, much worse. We could\nhave fallen into the abyss. Historically, that’s what has happened when widespread financial\npanics cut off the flow of credit. But we didn’t. And that’s in part because the Federal Reserve\ndid what it’s supposed to do: it moved quickly and decisively to safeguard the financial system.\nI would give the Fed a high grade for the actions we took. But I would probably give us a lower\ngrade for explaining and building support for our emergency programs. When millions of\nAmericans were losing their jobs and their homes, it may have seemed to many as if the Fed was\nmore focused on saving financial institutions than on saving jobs.\nBut a collapsed financial system would’ve taken the finances of average Americans along\nwith it. It would have resulted in a blow to jobs and the economy of cataclysmic proportions, on\npar with the Great Depression. However, that message got drowned out. And that meant not\nonly confusion but misinformation. Among other things, some people thought we’d launched\nsecret programs that put taxpayer money at significant risk and gave financial institutions below-\nmarket interest rates.\nTo be clear, that was simply not the case. Our lending programs were publicly\nannounced and regularly reported on. The lending was backed by good collateral and nearly\nevery penny has been repaid, with interest. In fact, Federal Reserve emergency lending\nprograms generated some $20 billion in interest income. That income, like virtually all net\nincome the Fed generates after expenses, went to the U.S. Treasury. And borrowers did not get\n6\n\nbelow-market interest rates. In fact, many of our programs charged penalty rates—we wanted\nborrowers to go back to the private markets as soon as they opened up again.\nThat brings us to the recovery. It’s a legitimate question to ask why we aren’t further\nalong in getting everyone back to work. Just as the crisis involved multiple factors that made its\nimpact so devastating, a lot has come together to hinder the recovery. The financial crisis\ndestroyed trillions of dollars of household wealth. It left the housing market in a deep\ndepression. It made credit hard to get. In addition, the federal government’s austerity is exerting\na huge drag on economic growth. And all of these factors have converged to create tremendous\nuncertainty. Let me take those in order.\nFirst, the collapse in housing prices caused a $6.5 trillion decline in U.S. household\nwealth. The stock market plummeted. People got scared, they scaled way back on their\npurchasing, and consumer spending virtually froze.\nSecond, there’s the fact that past recoveries have generally gotten a push from home\nconstruction and spending on household goods. But this recession was caused in part by a burst\nhousing bubble, which meant the usual source of a jump-start was still mired in brutal\nconditions.\nThose two factors are tied to the third: tight credit. Unless they had perfect credit, almost\nno one could get a loan. Small businesses were particularly hard-hit. For one, real estate became\n7\n\nless viable as collateral with lenders. For another, many banks they might otherwise rely on\nwere too weak to extend much credit.\nThe fourth factor restraining growth today is federal fiscal policy. This year, income tax\nrates were raised on upper-income Americans, and the Social Security payroll tax cut was\nallowed to expire—eating into disposable income that could otherwise go towards consumer\nspending. On top of that, we have budget austerity and sequestration. While one can debate the\nlonger-run costs and benefits of the resulting deficit reduction, the direct near-term result is a\nnegative contribution by the government sector to GDP growth. This year, it’s estimated that\nfederal fiscal policy is subtracting 1½ percentage points from economic growth.2\nWhile we can formulate monetary policy to chip away at some of these factors, we are\nless able to control the fifth, which is uncertainty. Business leaders are nervous about tax and\nregulatory policies. Households are worried about jobs and future income. And everyone is\nuncertain about Washington’s ability to overcome gridlock, including many in Washington.\nNone of this is bolstering anyone’s confidence.\nWhere we are—the economy today\nHowever, in spite of these multiple hurdles, the past four years have seen the U.S\neconomy slowly but surely making progress. Job growth has been fairly steady and positive.\n2 See Lucking and Wilson (2013) and Congressional Budget Office (2013).\n8\n\nOver the 12-month period through August, the U.S. economy added 2.2 million jobs. I would\nlike to report the jobs data through September, but the federal government shutdown means that\ndata hasn’t been released.\nOne puzzling issue we’ve seen with the labor market is that while job openings are\nincreasing, we aren’t seeing a similar increase in the number of people being hired. There’s been\nspeculation that this might be due to skills mismatch. That is, you can’t hire a mortgage broker\nto work at Micron. But recent studies show that this isn’t likely to be the main cause for the\nincrease in openings.3 It’s more likely that it’s still an employers’ market—there’s no real sense\nof urgency to fill an opening unless the rare perfect candidate emerges. I should add that this\nhesitance in the jobs market has a lot to do with that uncertainty I mentioned. Researchers at the\nSan Francisco Fed find that uncertainty may have added as much as 1¼ percentage points to the\nunemployment rate by late 2012.4\nI expect to see continued steady gains in jobs, with the unemployment rate edging down\ngradually over time.\nTurning to inflation, both headline and core measures have stayed low and stable. Let me\nrepeat that. Inflation is low and stable. That may seem surprising to those who have heard that\nthe Fed’s easy monetary policy is leading us to high inflation. In fact, since the start of the\n3 See Daly et al. (2012).\n4 See Leduc and Liu (2013).\n9\n\nrecession in December 2007, the inflation rate has averaged 1.5 percent, which is below our 2\npercent longer-run goal.\nNow, that doesn’t mean that individual prices of goods and services never change. The\nprice of gasoline, for instance, fluctuates depending on the price of oil. Oil is a global\ncommodity; its price is influenced by myriad market factors beyond our control. But while\nprices of some goods are rising, prices of other goods might be falling. Therefore we look at\ninflation across a broad range of goods and services.\nWhere do I see inflation going in the near future? Over the past year, the Fed’s preferred\nmeasure of consumer prices rose 1.2 percent. As the economy continues to improve and\nunemployment returns to more normal levels, I expect inflation to gradually rise over the next\nfew years, closing in on our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal.\nWhere we’re headed—the outlook\nPutting all of this together, with monetary policy continuing to provide needed stimulus, I\nexpect economic growth to pick up somewhat next year. As the economy continues to get better,\nthe highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will need to be gradually adjusted back to\nnormal. The first step will be to slow the pace of asset purchases over time, eventually ending\nthem altogether. This won’t be a slamming on the brakes, it will be an easing off the gas. And it\nwill not be a fixed date on the calendar. Instead, it will be in response to economic developments\n10\n\nand the progress we have made towards our dual goals of maximum employment and price\nstability.\nLooking further ahead, the time will eventually come to raise short-term rates again and\nnormalize the stance of monetary policy. Last December, we introduced a new form of forward\nguidance that explicitly tied the timing of the liftoff of the federal funds rate to economic events.\nSpecifically, the FOMC said that it “currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for\nthe federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains\nabove 6½ percent….” This threshold for the unemployment rate is not an automatic trigger. The\nstatement says “at least as long as.” Once unemployment falls below that threshold, we’ll\nevaluate how the recovery is progressing and decide on the appropriate course for the federal\nfunds rate then. In my own projection, even though I expect the unemployment rate to fall below\n6½ percent early in 2015, I don’t currently expect that it will be appropriate to raise the federal\nfunds rate until well after that, sometime in the second half of 2015.\nConclusion\nSo that’s where we were, where we are, and where we’re headed, and why the Federal\nReserve has pursued the monetary policies we have. I hope I’ve addressed some of your\nquestions and concerns about monetary policy and what the Fed’s intentions are. I’m happy to\n11\n\nanswer any specific ones now, but first want to thank everyone for coming out today. As I said,\nit’s always a pleasure to be in Boise.\nReferences\nCongressional Budget Office. 2013. “Automatic Reductions in Government Spending – aka\nSequestration.” (February) http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43961\nDaly, Mary C., Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert G.

    "text": "Presentation to the City Club of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 24, 2012\nThe Economic Outlook and Challenges to Monetary Policy1\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here at the City Club. This beautiful building\nconnects us with San Francisco’s history as a center of commerce and finance, which makes it a\ngreat place to give a talk about the economy. My subject is how the U.S. economy is doing and\nwhere it’s heading. I’ll take a close look at why the recovery has so far been somewhat\nlackluster, and I’ll go over measures we at the Federal Reserve recently announced aimed at\nboosting growth and getting us closer to our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\nAs always, my remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nIt’s been several years since we passed through the worst financial crisis and deepest\nrecession the nation has experienced since the Great Depression. The collapse of the housing\nmarket and the near meltdown of the financial system took an enormous toll. The past three\nyears have been marked by sluggish growth, a severely depressed housing sector, and very high\nunemployment.\nStill, as discouraging as the economic news has been at times, there’s no doubt the\neconomy is on the mend. Private-sector payrolls have climbed for 30 consecutive months,\nadding over 4½ million jobs. That’s more than half what we lost in the recession. Despite these\ngains, economic growth has not been strong enough to bring the jobless rate down to normal\nlevels. After reaching a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, the unemployment rate has declined\n1 I want to thank John Fernald and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nby nearly 2 percentage points to 8.1 percent. That’s real progress. But we still have quite a way\nto go to get the economy back to where it should be.\nIt’s not that surprising that the recovery has been sluggish. It can take quite some time to\nget over a financial crisis and a severe recession like we just lived through. But the healing\nprocess is well under way.2 Credit conditions are much improved from a few years ago. For\nmany borrowers, interest rates are at or near historic lows. And lenders seem more willing to\nextend credit. Consumer and business demand pent up during the recession is reviving. We can\nsee that, for example, in car sales, which collapsed during the recession. Now, with auto\nfinancing rates at rock bottom and more people working, motor vehicle sales have climbed over\n50 percent from their recession lows.\nAnother encouraging development is that housing is once more showing signs of life.\nWith the economy improving, mortgage rates at historically low levels, and homes\nextraordinarily affordable, confidence is returning to the housing market. Home sales are rising,\nand inventories of unsold homes have come down. We’ve started working off the huge backlog\nof foreclosed properties. Nationally, home prices have stabilized and are starting to rise. Here in\nSan Francisco, we can even say that the housing market is heating up.\nThe recovery in housing includes a rebound in home construction, something particularly\nimportant for the health of the overall economy. Housing starts simply collapsed during the\ndownturn, plummeting from a seasonally adjusted annual pace of over 2 million new units\nduring the boom to around half a million in the depths of the recession. It’s clear that, as a\ncountry, we built too many homes during the housing bubble. But it’s just as clear that the\ndearth of homebuilding over the past four years can’t continue forever if we are going to have\n2 See Williams (2012a) for a discussion of the financial roots of the crisis and how they have affected the pace of\nrecovery.\n2\n\nenough homes for the nation’s growing population. The latest data show housing starts rising to\nan annual rate of 750,000 units. That’s a big increase from three years ago, but still well short of\nthe longer-run trend of about 1.5 million units. Over the next few years, an ongoing recovery in\nhousing construction should be one of the key drivers of economic growth.\nI’ve highlighted a few sectors—autos and housing—that were hard hit during the\nrecession, but are on their way back. Why then are we unable to shift into a higher gear of\ngrowth? Three reasons stand out: the European debt crisis and recession, the budget squeeze at\nall levels of government in the United States, and a pervasive sense of uncertainty.\nI’ll start with the situation in Europe. The crisis there has been a dark cloud hanging over\nglobal financial markets and our own economy for the past two years. Greece has already\ndefaulted on its sovereign debt. Several other countries in the euro area are under severe stress.\nThe European Union and the International Monetary Fund have put in place emergency support\nprograms for Ireland and Portugal, in addition to Greece. It’s a story that is in many ways\nfamiliar to Americans—too much borrowing, creditors exposed to huge losses, and investors\nrunning for cover. But there are critical differences. In Europe’s case, some national\ngovernments are now in danger of default. In Greece, the government simply borrowed too\nmuch. In other countries, governments made large commitments to aid failing financial\ninstitutions. In all these cases, the downturn strained budgets further. As fear spread, these\ngovernments found themselves paying ever-higher interest rates, which made their fiscal plight\neven worse.\nWhat started as a financial problem has morphed into a general economic downturn—and\nthe shock waves are hitting us. With Europe in recession, U.S. companies are seeing lower\n3\n\ndemand for their products. The same is true for other countries that sell to Europe, such as\nChina, and they are experiencing slowdowns as a result.\nEuropean authorities have taken important steps to contain the crisis. Recently, the\nEuropean Central Bank announced a bold plan to stabilize the markets for government debt of\ncountries under stress. This plan should buy time for European governments to put in place\nmore comprehensive solutions for their banking and sovereign debt problems. But it is far from\ncertain that European leaders will succeed in doing so. One challenge is that, in exchange for\naid, authorities have demanded austerity measures, including tax increases and deep spending\ncuts. In the longer term, these measures are needed to put the government budgets of these\ncountries on sustainable paths. But, in the near term, austerity has held down economic growth\nfurther, prolonging economic downturns and making it even tougher to trim budget deficits.\nEurope is by no means the only thing pressing on the U.S. economy now. In our country,\ntax cuts and spending increases gave the economy a badly needed boost in the depths of the\nrecession and early in the recovery. But these stimulus measures have been unwinding. At the\nsame time, states and localities have cut spending and raised taxes as they struggled to balance\ntheir budgets. As a result, fiscal policy in the United States has shifted from the accelerator to\nthe brakes as far as growth is concerned.3 The numbers tell the story. Government consumption\nexpenditures and investment, adjusted for inflation, have declined 5.4 percent over the past two\nyears. That’s equivalent to more than a one percent reduction in gross domestic product. This\nshrinkage of the government sector can also be seen in employment at the state, local, and\nfederal levels. Total government employment has fallen by 680,000 jobs, or 3 percent, over the\npast four years.\n3 See Lucking and Wilson (2012).\n4\n\nThe drag on the economy coming from shrinking government employment and lower\nspending could turn dramatically worse at the beginning of 2013. You may have heard the\nexpression “fiscal cliff.” It refers to large federal tax increases and spending cuts that will\nautomatically take place under current legislation. These include ending the temporary payroll\ntax cut and extended unemployment benefits. Caps on some federal outlays and sharp cuts in\nothers are also set to go into effect. In addition, the Bush-era tax cuts are scheduled to expire.\nTo be sure, I don’t expect all these tax hikes and spending cuts to take place as scheduled.\nFor example, it’s likely that the Bush tax cuts will be extended temporarily and that some\nspending cuts will be deferred. Still, there’s little doubt that a number of austerity measures will\nhit. I expect that to slow our economy’s forward progress.\nIf my prediction is wrong though, and the entire range of fiscal cliff measures stays in\nplace, the effects on the economy next year would be much more severe. The nonpartisan\nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the complete fiscal cliff package would knock 2¼\npercentage points off growth in 2013 and push unemployment up a percentage point compared\nwith the less draconian scenario I expect. If that happens, the economy could find itself teetering\non the brink of recession.\nThis brings me to the third factor restraining growth: uncertainty. The crisis in Europe,\nthe fiscal cliff, and, more generally, the tumultuous events of the past five years have unsettled\nconsumers and businesses alike. In particular, they have fostered a high degree of uncertainty\nabout the future and undermined the economic confidence that spurs spending and investment.\nGreater uncertainty causes households and businesses to save more out of fear over what lies\nahead. With everyone hunkering down and preparing for the worst, businesses see a drop-off in\ndemand for their goods and services. That in turn damps economic growth and drives up\n5\n\nunemployment.4 Just about everyone I talk with stresses that pervasive uncertainty is holding\nback hiring and investment. Indeed, uncertainty about the economy—including federal fiscal\npolicy—appears to have all but paralyzed some businesses, prompting them to postpone capital\nspending and payroll expansions.\nI’d like now to offer my economic outlook and talk about what the Federal Reserve is\ndoing to help keep our economy on the road of recovery, while keeping inflation low. As a\nbackdrop for this discussion, it’s useful to say a few words about the goals of monetary policy.\nCongress assigned the Fed two goals in setting monetary policy: maximum employment and\nprice stability. In considering what maximum employment is, economists look at the\nunemployment rate. We tend to think of maximum employment as the level of unemployment\nthat pushes inflation neither up nor down. This is the so-called natural rate of unemployment. It\nis a moving target that depends on how efficient the labor market is at matching workers with\njobs. Although we can’t know exactly what the natural rate of unemployment is at any point in\ntime, a reasonable estimate is that it is currently a little over 6 percent.5 In other words, right\nnow, an unemployment rate of about 6 percent would be consistent with the Fed’s goal of\nmaximum employment. In terms of the Fed’s other statutory goal—price stability—our\nmonetary policy body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, has specified that a 2\npercent inflation rate is most consistent with our dual mandate.\nSo, how are we doing on these goals? As I said earlier, the economy continues to grow\nand add jobs. However, the current 8.1 percent unemployment rate is well above the natural rate,\nand progress on reducing unemployment has nearly stalled over the past six months. If we\nhadn’t taken additional monetary policy steps, the economy looked like it could get stuck in low\n4 See Bloom (2009) and Leduc and Liu (2012).\n5 See Daly et al. (2012) and Williams (2012b).\n6\n\ngear. That would have meant that, over the next few years, we would make relatively modest\nfurther progress on our maximum employment mandate. What’s more, the job situation could\nget worse if the European crisis intensifies or we go over the fiscal cliff. Progress on our other\nmandate, price stability, might also have been threatened. Inflation, which has averaged 1.3\npercent over the past year, could have gotten stuck below our 2 percent target.\nFor the FOMC, this was the sobering set of circumstances we were staring at during our\nmost recent policy meeting. Faced with this situation, it was essential that we at the Fed provide\nthe stimulus needed to keep our economy moving toward maximum employment and price\nstability. So, at our meeting, we took two strong measures aimed at achieving this goal.6\nFirst, we announced a new program to purchase $40 billion of mortgage-backed\nsecurities every month. This is in addition to our ongoing program to expand our holdings of\nlonger-term Treasury securities by $45 billion a month. Second, we announced that we expect to\nkeep short-term interest rates low for a considerable time, even after the economy strengthens.\nSpecifically, we expect exceptionally low levels of our benchmark federal funds rate at least\nthrough mid-2015.\nThese actions work the same way monetary policy always does—by lowering borrowing\ncosts and improving broader financial conditions.7 For example, low interest rates cut the cost of\nborrowing to buy a car, making people more willing to make the purchase. And, as car sales\nincrease—thanks to low interest rates—automakers need to produce more cars and more parts,\nwhich leads them to hire additional factory workers. This is exactly the kind of virtuous circle\nthat provides the oomph in a healthy economic recovery.\n6 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n7 See Williams (2011).\n7\n\nWe have already seen some benefits of our ongoing stimulus programs in the notable\nimprovements in the sectors of our economy that are especially sensitive to interest rates, such as\nautos and housing. In particular, purchases of mortgage-backed securities have been very\neffective at bringing down mortgage rates.8 As I noted, the housing market remains depressed,\nbut is now showing signs of life. Lower mortgage rates should provide another shot in the arm\nto the housing recovery at just the right time, just as it is beginning to generate some real forward\nmomentum. Lower rates make owning a home more affordable, which increases demand for\nnew housing. This increase in demand should put upward pressure on depressed house prices,\nmaking it easier for existing homeowners to refinance or sell their homes. The happy result\ncould be a positive feedback loop of growing confidence and improving fundamentals in the\nhousing market.\nThanks in part to the recent policy actions, I anticipate the economy will gain momentum\nover the next few years. I expect real gross domestic product to expand at a modest pace of\nabout 1¾ percent this year, but to improve to 2½ percent growth next year and 3¼ percent in\n2014. With economic growth trending upward, I see the unemployment rate gradually declining\nto about 7¼ percent by the end of 2014. Despite improvement in the job market, I expect\ninflation to remain slightly below 2 percent for the next few years as increases in labor costs\nremain subdued and public inflation expectations stay at low levels.\nOf course, my projections, like any forecast, may turn out to be wrong. That’s something\nwe kept in mind when we designed our new policy measures. Specifically, an important new\nelement is that our recently announced purchase program is intended to be flexible and adjust to\nchanging circumstances. Unlike our past asset purchase programs, this one doesn’t have a preset\nexpiration date. Instead, it is explicitly linked to what happens with the economy. In particular,\n8 See Gagnon et al. (2011).\n8\n\nwe will continue buying mortgage-backed securities until the job market looks substantially\nhealthier. We said we might even expand our purchases to include other assets.\nThis approach serves as a kind of automatic stabilizer for the economy. If conditions\nimprove faster than expected, we will end the program sooner, cutting back the degree of\nmonetary stimulus. But, if the economy stumbles, we will keep the program in place as long as\nneeded for the job market to improve substantially, in the context of price stability. Similarly, if\nwe find that our policies aren’t doing what we want or are causing significant problems for the\neconomy, we will adjust or end them as appropriate.\nLet me emphasize that these policy actions are designed to help us achieve both our goals\nof maximum employment and price stability. Inflation continues to be low and inflation\nexpectations are low and stable—what we economists call well anchored. In fact, over the past\nfour years, the inflation rate has averaged a mere 1.2 percent. That’s the lowest rate recorded\nover a four-year period since the early 1960s. And longer-term inflation expectations are at\nabout the same level they were five years ago, before the Fed began taking unconventional\nmonetary policy actions. The Fed’s recently announced actions should help move inflation up a\nbit closer to our 2 percent long-run goal.\nClearly, the bigger problem today is high unemployment. Much of the discussion about\nmonetary policy focuses on that issue—as it should. But, I want to stress, in no way has our\ncommitment to price stability wavered. Inflation is something we watch carefully, and we\nremain determined to work toward our price stability objective.\nMonetary policy cannot solve all problems that affect our economy. But it can help\nspeed the pace of recovery and get our country back on track sooner. Our policy actions are\ncompletely consistent with the statement of longer-term goals and policy strategy the FOMC\n9\n\nreleased in January.9 I’m convinced they represent the best course to move us closer to those\ngoals. Thank you very much.\n9 For more information, see Board of Governors (2012a).\n10\n\nReferences\nBloom, Nicholas. 2009. “The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks.” Econometrica 77(3), pp. 623–685.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012a. “Press Release.” January 25.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012b. “Press Release.” September 13.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\nDaly, Mary C., Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert Valletta. 2012. “A Search and Matching\nApproach to Labor Markets: Did the Natural Rate of Unemployment Rise?” Journal of Economic\nPerspectives 26(3, Summer), pp. 3–26.\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2011. “The Financial Market Effects\nof the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases.” International Journal of Central Banking 7(1,\nMarch), pp. 3–43. http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.htm\nLeduc, Sylvain, and Zheng Liu. 2012. “Uncertainty, Unemployment, and Inflation.” FRBSF Economic\nLetter 2012-28 (September 17). http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-\n28.html\nLucking, Brian, and Daniel Wilson. 2012. “U.S. Fiscal Policy: Headwind or Tailwind?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2012-20 (July 2). http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-\n20.html\nWilliams, John C. 2011. “Unconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons from the Past Three Years.” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2011-31 (October 3).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-31.html\nWilliams, John C. 2012a. “The Federal Reserve and the Economic Recovery.” FRBSF Economic Letter\n2012-02 (January 17). http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-02.html\nWilliams, John C. 2012b. “Update of ‘What Is the New Normal Unemployment Rate?’” August 13\nupdate to FRBSF Economic Letter 2011-05.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-05-update.pdf\n11",

    "text": "Presentation to Town Hall Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 4, 2011, 12:30 PM Pacific\nMaintaining Price Stability in a Global Economy1\nGood afternoon and thank you for coming. I particularly want to thank Town Hall Los\nAngeles for organizing this event. It’s a great pleasure to be here. I became president and CEO\nof the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco just two months ago. In fact, this is my first\nopportunity to speak in a public forum about the economy and monetary policy since taking on\nthis new role. For a central banker, communication is a critical part of the job. If we are to carry\nout our mission successfully, it’s essential that the public understands our actions and strategies.\nChairman Bernanke’s press conference last Wednesday, the first ever by a Fed Chairman, was a\nmajor milestone in that respect.\nOne of the most important policy questions we are grappling with at the Fed has to do\nwith inflation. This subject is on the minds these days of Americans from all walks of life. As\nanybody who’s paying more than $4 a gallon for gas knows, the prices of energy, food, and\nmany other commodities have soared in recent months. This is painful for all of us—especially\nthose with lower incomes and stretched budgets. But, despite the recent upturn, I don’t think that\ninflation will remain stubbornly high. This afternoon I will explain why inflation has risen of\nlate and why I expect it to recede. I will also talk about the prospects for the economic recovery.\nI’ll close with some remarks about monetary policy and the Fed’s unwavering commitment to\nprice stability. Of course, this talk represents my own views and not necessarily those of my\nFederal Reserve colleagues.\n1 I want to thank John Fernald, Glenn Rudebusch, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nI’ll start with a status report on the economic recovery. It is now nearly two years since\nthe economy started growing again. But, that doesn’t mean we’ve regained all the ground lost\nduring the recession. Not by a long shot. In fact, despite adding about 1½ million jobs over the\npast 13 months, there are still over 7 million fewer jobs in the United States than we had before\nthe downturn. The recovery has sputtered at times and our forward progress has been\ndisappointingly slow. That’s actually not too surprising though, given the type of recession\nwe’ve been through. Experience from around the world suggests that economic growth\nfollowing banking and financial crises, like we’ve experienced here, is often weak and\ninconsistent.2\nCertainly, some recent economic data have been lackluster. Last week, the Commerce\nDepartment estimated that real gross domestic product—the broadest measure of U.S. economic\nactivity—rose just 1.8 percent on an annual basis during the first three months of this year. This\nis quite a bit slower than the 2.8 percent growth we saw in 2010. Unusually severe winter\nweather earlier this year and a few other transitory factors held down first-quarter growth. But\nseveral more persistent forces have also been at work.\nHigher gasoline prices are at the top of the list of factors that have been a drag on the\neconomy and will continue to be so for some time. Over the past year, the price of gas at the\npump has jumped by about a third. This takes money out of the pockets of consumers and\nreduces their ability to make other purchases. In addition, the jump in energy prices raises\nuncertainty, saps confidence, and makes both consumers and businesses more cautious about\nspending. Indeed, consumer confidence, as measured by surveys of households, remains mired\nnear its recessionary lows.\n2 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).\n2\n\nThe economy faces other persistent headwinds in addition to high gas prices. The\nhousing market remains severely depressed. The large overhang of unsold homes and the\nshadow inventory of homes in delinquency or foreclosure offer scant hope for a significant\nrebound in construction or home prices in the near term. Meanwhile, government at all levels is\ncutting back, something we Californians know all too well. In addition, the horrific triple\ndisaster in Japan was not just a human tragedy. It also created bottlenecks in global supply\nchains, especially in the auto and tech sectors, and these are affecting production in the United\nStates as well as Japan.\nNow, don’t get me wrong. I am confident our economy has enough forward momentum\nto overcome these stiff headwinds. Indeed, we expect growth to rebound to over 3 percent in the\ncurrent quarter, and that the pace of recovery will continue to build further strength over the\nremainder of this year and next year. In a reversal of the dynamic that we saw during the darkest\ndays of the financial crisis and recession, we are now enjoying a virtuous circle of improving\nfinancial conditions, which support stronger spending. This, in turn, leads to more hiring and\nproduction, still stronger financial conditions, and so on.\nThis positive feedback loop is illustrated by the stock market. Broad measures of stock\nprices are up more than 10 percent over the past year, thanks in part to healthy corporate profits\nand a greater willingness of investors to take on risk. And with their investment portfolios\ngrowing again, households have been more willing to spend. That prompts businesses to hire\nmore employees to meet customer demand.\nA critical part of the recovery has been the improving labor market. In February and\nMarch, nonfarm payrolls grew by about 200,000 jobs per month, a solid pace that should pick up\nfurther as the year progresses. These job gains should push down the unemployment rate from\n3\n\nits current level of 8.8 percent to about 8½ percent by the end of the year. Still, we face a long\nroad ahead before we reach normal levels of unemployment.\nTo sum things up, despite some ups and downs, the underlying economic recovery\ncontinues at a moderate pace. Growth slowed in the first quarter, but should pick up during the\nrest of the year as transitory factors restraining the economy fade. I expect real GDP to increase\nabout 3¼ percent this year. This rate of growth is sufficiently high to help bring the\nunemployment rate down gradually, but it will take a long time before we dig ourselves out of\nthe deep hole we fell into during the recession. Though the economy is forging ahead, there is\nstill an enormous amount of idle resources out there—a situation that will likely persist for\nseveral years.\nLet me now turn to inflation. Here are some of the questions we need to ask at this\njuncture: What is the current inflation situation? What are the underlying forces driving prices?\nWhat are the prospects for inflation in the medium term? And what is the appropriate response\nof Federal Reserve monetary policy?\nRegarding the first question, we’ve seen a very substantial pickup in prices for many\nenergy, food, and industrial commodities. For example, in the past year, copper prices have risen\n26 percent, crude oil 35 percent, and corn 75 percent.3 This is cause for serious concern.\nSharply higher prices for many raw materials are driving up the prices of a range of consumer\ngoods and services, including gas and food, and are pushing readings of overall inflation\nnoticeably higher. The measure of prices that we at the Fed tend to watch most closely—the\npersonal consumption expenditures price index—increased at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the\nfirst quarter of this year. This figure is well above the longer-term inflation objective of 2\n3 Prices as of May 2. Oil refers to price of Brent crude.\n4\n\npercent, or a bit less, that most participants in our policymaking body, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, prefer.4\nThis brings me to the second question: What is driving inflation so high? Well, as I\nmentioned, rising commodity prices, especially for food and energy, have been the culprit.\nIndeed, so-called core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, was only 1.5 percent in\nthe first quarter and averaged only 0.9 percent over the past four quarters. Now I know that core\ninflation has come under a lot of criticism. After all, people need to put food on the table and fill\nthe tanks of their cars. I totally agree. It is the price of the entire household consumption basket\nof goods and services that we at the Fed care about in terms of our inflation goal, and that\ncertainly includes food and energy. But, we find it useful to look at various measures of\nunderlying inflation, including core inflation, to help us disentangle the various elements in the\noverall inflation picture. And statistical analysis shows that, over recent decades, measures of\nunderlying inflation, such as core inflation, have been helpful in predicting the future course of\noverall inflation.5\nThat brings us back to the question of why commodity prices have risen so much. Some\ncommentators have suggested that the Fed itself has contributed to the run-up by keeping in\nplace excessive monetary stimulus. According to this argument, the Fed’s policy of very low\ninterest rates and sizable securities holdings are fueling speculation in commodities. Economic\ntheory teaches us that lower interest rates will boost asset prices, including commodity prices, all\nelse equal. But it is unlikely that this effect can explain more than a very small portion of the\nhuge increase in commodity prices that we have witnessed.6 Economists at the San Francisco\n4 See the longer-run projections for PCE inflation at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20110126ep.htm (Board of Governors 2011).\n5 See Blinder and Reis (2005) and Rich and Steindel (2005).\n6 See Erceg, Guerrieri, and Kamin (2011) and Frankel and Rose (2009).\n5\n\nFed recently looked at how commodity prices reacted when the Fed announced new policy\nactions to stimulate the economy. If Fed policies were responsible for the commodity price\nboom, then we should have seen those prices jump when the Fed announced more monetary\nstimulus. In fact, the researchers found that, if anything, commodity prices fell after new policy\nannouncements and were not pushed higher by news about Fed policy.7 So, I don’t see any\nconvincing evidence that monetary policy has played a significant role in the huge surge in\ncommodity prices.\nI see the real culprit as being global supply and demand. Rising commodity prices can be\ntraced to the rapid rebound in the global economy in the past year and a half, led by robust\ngrowth in emerging market economies, which display a ravenous appetite for raw materials. For\nexample, Chinese automakers sold some 18 million vehicles last year, a third more than in 2009\nand more than any other country in history, including the United States. At the same time, as\ndemand is rising, we’ve seen supplies of some commodities curtailed by weather or political\ndisruptions. In recent months, turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East has reduced the\nglobal supply of oil and likely added a substantial risk premium to the price of a barrel of crude\nas well.\nWhat do these fast-rising commodity prices mean for inflation for the rest of the year and\nbeyond? I believe that the inflation rate will reach a peak around the middle of this year and then\nedge back downward. In other words, we are seeing a temporary bulge in inflation before we\nreturn to an underlying level of about 1¼ to 1½ percent annually. There are several reasons for\nthinking the inflation bulge will be short-lived. First, commodity prices are not likely to keep\nincreasing indefinitely at a rapid rate. Indeed, in recent weeks, prices for a number of\ncommodities, including sugar and cotton, have fallen sharply. In addition, the prices of contracts\n7 See Glick and Leduc (2011).\n6\n\nfor certain key commodities in the futures markets, such as crude oil, indicate that traders believe\nthese prices won’t keep rising at double-digit rates. For example, the numerous supply\ndisruptions that have pushed up prices of some foodstuffs, such as poor harvests in Russia and\nChina, are not likely to be repeated. So even if commodity prices remain elevated, they won’t\nkeep pushing up inflation.\nA second reason for believing that inflation will peak and then trend down is that higher\ncommodity prices generally represent only a small proportion of the cost of the finished goods\nAmerican consumers buy. For example, corn and sugar make up only a fraction of the cost of a\nbox of Frosted Flakes. Most of the cost comes from the labor involved in manufacturing,\ndistributing, and selling the breakfast cereal, including paying for air time for Tony the Tiger.\nThis means that large percentage increases in commodity prices typically translate into relatively\nsmall percentage increases in consumer prices. Of course, some goods, such as gasoline, have\nvery high commodity input shares. But, in today’s economy, these are more the exception than\nthe rule.\nThe stability of longer-term inflation expectations is a third factor that leads me to expect\nthat inflation will start to ease later this year. It’s true that surveys show that consumers expect\nmoderately high inflation over the next year. Households see gasoline prices going up and up\nand up, and, not surprisingly, they get worried about near-term inflation prospects. But medium-\nterm measures of inflation expectations have barely budged. In other words, ordinary Americans\nagree that we are seeing a transitory rise in inflation. Those survey results reflect the fact that\ninflation has remained low and relatively steady for several decades and that the public believes\nthe Fed is committed to keeping inflation under control. As long as household, business, and\n7\n\ninvestor inflation expectations remain stable, then it’s unlikely that an inflationary dynamic will\nbecome established or that underlying inflation will jump sharply.\nThis leads directly to a fourth reason for thinking inflationary pressures will ease. The\nstructural and institutional factors that led to a runaway inflationary spiral in the 1970s are\nlargely absent today. Four decades ago, many labor contracts provided for automatic cost-of-\nliving adjustments, or COLAs, which meant that higher prices fed into higher wages in a self-\nreinforcing feedback loop. Today, COLA clauses are mostly things of the past. Meanwhile,\nmeasures of wages and labor compensation, such as the employment cost index or average\nhourly earnings, have been increasing at an annual rate of only around 2 percent. When you\nfactor in productivity gains, the unit labor cost of producing goods and services has been close to\nflat. These wage trends, which reflect the high level of unemployment in the economy, act as a\npowerful brake on inflation.\nFor all the reasons I’ve mentioned, I believe the risk of a sustained period of high\ninflation is low. At the San Francisco Fed, our forecast calls for a bulge in overall inflation this\nyear, with inflation about 2¼ percent for the year as a whole. Then, as I noted earlier, inflation\nshould return to its underlying level of around 1¼ to 1½ percent by next year, well below my\npreferred medium-term goal of 2 percent inflation.\nI recognize that this forecast could prove wrong, and we will be paying very close\nattention to incoming information to watch for shifts in inflation trends. If inflation significantly\nexceeds our forecast, if commodity prices do not stabilize, if the pass-through of commodity and\nother import prices to consumer prices is higher than we expect, if long-term inflation\nexpectations start rising significantly, or if a wage–price spiral starts to emerge, then I will\nmodify my views accordingly.\n8\n\nAll these questions are on my mind when I consider monetary policy. In discussing Fed\npolicy, I should first lay out for you the current state of things. Congress has assigned the Fed\ntwo goals in setting policy: maximum employment and price stability. The financial crisis and\nrecession wreaked havoc with both of those. By a number of measures, the job market has been\nin worse shape than at any time since World War II. And, by last year, inflation had fallen to\nvery low levels. That meant that we were falling short on both counts of our dual mandate—far\nfrom full employment and also at risk of deflation, a condition of generally falling prices. In that\nsituation, we’ve kept the federal funds rate, our main short-term policy interest rate, close to zero\nto stimulate the economy.\nBut standard rules of thumb indicate that, with the economy in such a deep hole and\nunderlying inflation low, the federal funds rate should be several percentage points below zero.8\nA significantly negative interest rate is an obvious impossibility. In order to provide an\nappropriate level of stimulus, we’ve had to look to other means. So, since 2008, we have been\nactively buying longer-duration securities issued by the Treasury or government-sponsored\nenterprises with the goal of pushing down longer-term interest rates. Analysis of this program\nindicates that interest rates on longer-term Treasury securities are about half a percentage point\nbelow where they would be without this program.9 Lower interest rates help support the\nrecovery, reduce unemployment, and diminish the risk of sustained deflation.10\nIn communicating our policy, we have said we would leave the fed funds rate very low\nfor “an extended period.” The reasoning behind this is that unemployment is well above normal\nlevels and underlying inflation is subdued, for the reasons I have explained. But we do expect\nthe pace of growth to pick up and for the unemployment rate to continue its gradual decline.\n8 See Chung et al. (2011) and Rudebusch (2010).\n9 See Gagnon et al. (2010).\n10 See Chung et al. for an estimate of the macroeconomic effects of this program.\n9\n\nAnd the nature of monetary policy is that central bankers must stay ahead of the curve. Policy\nacts with a considerable lag, so we must make our decisions based on where we think the\neconomy will be many months ahead. For that reason, we have been preparing a plan to start\nremoving stimulus when conditions warrant—our so-called “exit strategy.”\nI won’t go into the technical details, but the elements of our exit strategy include draining\nbank reserves and reducing our holdings of longer-term securities, in addition to raising the\nfederal funds rate. Importantly, the exact timing of the various stages of this plan will be\ndictated by the course of the recovery and, in particular, the paths of unemployment and\ninflation. And to give the public plenty of advance notice—that important communication that I\nstressed at the beginning of my talk—such steps are likely to be signaled in our regular policy\nstatements.\nThe economy today faces many pitfalls, but I don’t believe that runaway inflation is one\nof them. That’s because Fed policymakers, like the general public, are aware of the cost to\nsociety when prices get out of control. The experience of the 1970s was very traumatic and is\nindelibly etched in our minds. During those bad old days, inflation did get out of control and it\ntook a very harsh recession in the early 1980s to purge inflation and to re-anchor inflation\nexpectations. Everyone at the Fed has learned the lessons of the ’70s and is absolutely\ncommitted to making sure nothing like that happens again.\nI fully share this determination to maintain price stability. You can rest assured that the\nFederal Reserve is committed to low and stable inflation. As I said, I view a sustained period of\nhigh inflation as very unlikely. But if we see signs of it developing, then we will act quickly and\nwe will act decisively to ensure price stability. Thank you very much.\n10\n\nReferences\nBlinder, Alan, and Ricardo Reis. 2005. “Understanding the Greenspan Standard.” In The Greenspan Era:\nLessons for the Future, proceedings of a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City in Jackson Hole, WY, August 25–27.\nhttp://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/sympos/2005/pdf/Blinder-Reis2005.pdf\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2011. “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, Summary of Economic Projections” January 25–26.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20110126ep.htm\nChung, Hess, Jean-Philippe Laforte, David Reifschneider, and John C.

    "text": "Presentation to the International Monetary Fund Annual Research Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 11, 2011\nMonetary Policy in an Era of Crises\nThe enormous and prolonged economic fallout from the global financial crisis and the\nsubsequent deleveraging have convincingly demonstrated the need to mitigate the risk of crisis.\nWe should have known this from the work of Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff (2009), but the\nlesson has finally stuck. My topic this afternoon centers on the role of monetary policy in\navoiding financial crises. The conventional wisdom can be stated as follows: The first line of\ndefense against financial instability is strong and robust micro and macroprudential policies.\nMonetary policy should only be a last resort.\nI agree with the first statement that micro and macroprudential policies are the\nappropriate first lines of defense. But I am also concerned that these defenses can be breached,\nand, as a result, monetary policy will likely need to play a more active role. Therefore, we must\nthink hard about how to design monetary policy strategies that complement macroprudential\npolicies and contribute to financial stability, and thereby contribute to macroeconomic stability.\nThis afternoon, I will aim to make three basic points: First, despite serious reforms to\nstrengthen our financial system, significant risk remains that another asset bubble could develop.\nMoreover, the financial system and the economy are still vulnerable to such an event. Second,\nfinancial stability should not be thought of as a distinct goal from macroeconomic stability and,\ntherefore, inherently separate from traditional monetary policy. Instead, risks to financial\nstability are first and foremost risks to future economic activity and inflation. Third, the\n1\n\nframework used to analyze the relationship between monetary policy, financial instability, and\nthe macroeconomy needs to be revamped. That framework must take more fully into account the\nlife cycles of asset, credit, and leverage bubbles, and it should consider the role monetary policy\nplays in feeding or restraining these bubbles. I should note that my remarks represent my own\nviews and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nAn ongoing era of crises\nIn the past few years, we’ve learned the hard lesson that financial crises are neither things\nof the past, nor afflictions solely of developing countries. The global financial crisis and the\nmore recent European sovereign debt crisis demonstrate that the complex global financial system\nis, if anything, intrinsically susceptible to systemic breakdown. Reforms in the United States and\nabroad address many of the glaring weaknesses of the pre-crisis regulatory regime. Importantly,\nbanks and other financial institutions deemed to be systemically important will now be required\nto hold greater capital and strengthen their liquidity positions.\nThese reforms are vital. But I am not convinced they will be enough to forestall another\nmajor crisis. First, as Robert Shiller demonstrated, asset price booms and busts recur throughout\nhuman history (Shiller 2005). An old maxim holds that financial markets are driven by fear and\ngreed. Evidently, no law or regulation can completely contain this dynamic. Second, recent\nreforms do not fully address a basic fact bared during the financial crisis: the funding system\nrooted in the capital markets is inherently at risk for runs, contagions, and panics. Investment\nbanks and participants in money, repo, commercial paper, and securitization markets all rely on\nvery short-term wholesale funding for longer-term and risky investments. But, they don’t have\nthe protection of deposit insurance and regular lender-of-last-resort access that banks have.\n2\n\nThird, it remains untested whether supervisors can successfully complete an orderly resolution of\ncomplex, systemically important international financial institutions during a period of heightened\nuncertainty.\nMoreover, some of the tools that were deployed in 2008 and 2009 to stem a full-blown\nmeltdown of the financial system may not be available in future crises. For example, the Federal\nReserve acted boldly and creatively to provide liquidity to critical nonbank segments of financial\nmarkets during the financial crisis.1 Today, the Federal Reserve retains all of its tools to provide\nliquidity to the banking system as a whole. But the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the Fed’s ability to\nprovide liquidity elsewhere to individual institutions and to nonbank segments of the financial\nsystem.\nIn addition, some types of liquidity support for capital markets funding involve credit\nrisk, which requires action by the fiscal authority.2 Indeed, fiscal measures were essential to\nmaintain confidence in the financial system during the crisis. Examples included the\nintroduction of Treasury guarantees on money market funds and bank debt, and capital injections\nfollowing the bank stress tests. It may take considerable time to muster the authorization of\nfiscal authorities—and that’s assuming the political climate permits such action. These\nconsiderations suggest that the risk of runs in financial markets remains a very real concern for\nfinancial and macroeconomic stability.\n1 See Williams (2011b) for a further discussion of these themes.\n2 The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) provides an excellent example of participation of the\nfiscal authority in a liquidity program. In this program, the Federal Reserve provided loans to help finance the\nissuance of asset-backed securities. The Treasury department took on some of the credit risk of the TALF loans,\nexpanding the availability of credit under the program. However, the reach of this program was limited by the\nrequirement that the Fed’s loans be adequately safe, which limited its loans to only the highest quality segment.\n3\n\nFinancial crises and the macroeconomy\nLet me now turn to my second point: Risks to financial stability are, first and foremost,\nrisks to future economic activity and inflation. Much of the discussion of the role of monetary\npolicy in safeguarding financial stability treats financial stability as if it were a standalone goal,\nindependent of macroeconomic objectives. Such a view is misguided. The main reason we care\nso much about financial stability is because financial crises can have devastating consequences\nfor standard macroeconomic variables, such as employment, output, and inflation.\nTherefore, in thinking about the role of monetary policy in maintaining financial stability,\nwe need to integrate financial stability into our models of the macroeconomy. We can’t think of\nthem as separate spheres. Approached this way, the answer to the question whether monetary\npolicy should be concerned with financial stability seems obvious. To the extent that monetary\npolicy actions influence the emergence of risks to financial stability, these actions also indirectly\naffect the future path of economic activity and inflation. Only in the extreme case that monetary\npolicy actions have no effect on risks to financial stability, or financial instability has no effects\non the macroeconomy, could one maintain that monetary policy should not take into account\nfinancial stability.\nTo make operational this idea that monetary policy cares about financial stability because\nit affects macroeconomic outcomes, we need analytical frameworks that identify the channels\nthat are at play. In addition, we must keep in mind that risks to financial stability are inherently\nprobabilistic. That means that, when we analyze monetary policy, we must take much more\nseriously the distribution of potential outcomes, not just the expected outcomes. This brings me\nto my final point.\n4\n\nRevamping monetary policy analysis\nThe past approach to studying monetary policy is not up to the task of accounting for\nfinancial instability and needs to be revamped. The fundamental problem is that the vast\nmajority of monetary policy analysis is based on textbook linear-quadratic models with rational\nexpectations.3 There has been valuable research on models with financial frictions that provide\nan important channel for asset prices to affect net wealth, and thereby collateral available for\nborrowing.4 Financial frictions are a necessary condition to seriously consider issues of\nmonetary policy and financial stability. But more is needed. Research should extend to all key\nchannels by which monetary and supervisory policies affect asset prices, credit flows, and the\nreal economy.\nHowever, incorporating these channels is still not sufficient. We also need mechanisms\nby which endogenous dynamics—not just exogenous shocks—explain the magnitude and\nduration of booms and busts in asset prices, leverage, and credit.5 One promising approach is\nmodels in which agents do not have perfect information about economic fundamentals, but\ninstead “learn” through observations of data.6 According to this approach, agents make\neconomically rational decisions based on available information. But the information they\npossess at any point in time may be sending misleading signals regarding fundamentals.\nIn learning models, the development of what eventually proves to be an asset price\nbubble can be an endogenous reaction to shocks.7 Likewise, the willingness of financial\nintermediaries to lend and the degree of leverage in the economy depends on perceptions of\n3 See Woodford (2003) for representations of this research.\n4 See, for example, Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999), Aoki, Proudman, and Vlieghe (2004), Kajuth (2010),\nand references therein.\n5 I delve into these issues further in Williams (2011a).\n6 See Lansing (2010) and Adam and Marcet (2010) for analysis of asset prices bubbles and busts in learning models.\n7 See Williams (2011a).\n5\n\nfundamentals and risk that can deviate from the rational expectations equilibrium. In these\nmodels, monetary policy can affect whether asset price and credit bubbles build up in the first\nplace and the speed with which they deflate. In addition, regulation and supervisory policy can\naffect availability of loans during booms, potentially restricting the supply of funds financing the\nbubble. Such models hold great promise for examining the design of monetary policy and the\nissue of coordinating monetary and macroprudential policies.\nImportantly, these models are inherently nonlinear and take into account the influence of\nrare events. In that way, they provide insight into the systemic aspects of monetary policy that\ncan reduce the probability and incidence of imbalances threatening financial stability and the\neconomy. That is, they help us understand how to change the macroeconomic environment that\ncreates imbalances, rather than focus on how to respond to imbalances after they occur.\nThese dynamics are similar in some ways to the effective stabilization of inflation\nexpectations. Athanasios Orphanides and I studied the features of monetary policy rules that\nwere effective at stabilizing economic activity and inflation when agents are learning.8 We did\nnot assume that stabilizing inflation expectations was an independent goal. Nor did we focus on\nhow to best respond to exogenous “shocks” to inflation expectations. We found that policy rules\nthat succeeded in stabilizing inflation expectations reduced the incidence and magnitude of\n“inflation scares.” These are episodes when inflation expectations get out of control following a\n“rare” set of adverse shocks.\nResearch on financial stability using these types of models is in its infancy. I expect that\nthe intuition from the research on monetary policy and inflation expectations will carry over to\n8 See Orphanides and Williams (2004, 2005, 2007).\n6\n\nthis growing area of investigation. In particular, both monetary policy and macroprudential\npolicies should be designed to create conditions in which the risk of crisis is kept very low. In\nthis way, we can avoid the painful macroeconomic consequences of a crisis, rather than being\nforced to clean up after the fact.\nIn summary, although macroprudential policies are the appropriate first line of defense\nagainst financial instability, these defenses are not impregnable. In all likelihood, monetary\npolicy will need to play a more active role. As a result, researchers and policymakers need to\nthink hard about how to design monetary policy strategies that complement macroprudential\npolicies and contribute to financial and macroeconomic stability. Thank you very much.\n7\n\nReferences\nAdam, Klaus, and Albert Marcet. 2010. “Booms and Busts in Asset Prices.” Bank of Japan,\nInstitute for Monetary and Economic Studies Discussion Paper 2010-E-2 (February).\nhttp://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/papers/english/10-E-02.pdf\nAoki, Kosuke, James Proudman, and Gertjan Vlieghe. 2004. “House Prices, Consumption and\nMonetary Policy: A Financial Accelerator Approach.” Journal of Financial\nIntermediation 13(4), pp. 414–435.\nBernanke, Ben S., Mark Gertler, and Simon Gilchrist. 1999. “The Financial Accelerator in a\nQuantitative Business Cycle Framework.” In Handbook of Macroeconomics, Volume 1,\neds.

Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 10, 2016\nThe Health of Nations\nThank you.

Which probably makes you wonder, “Why\nhim?” It’s a fair question, since I’m an economist who normally focuses on the macroeconomy\nand monetary policy. One answer is that more than six years ago, the San Francisco Fed and the\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation formed a partnership that has become a model of community\ndevelopment finance, aimed at directing money to support projects that improve the social\ndeterminants of health.1\nBut much more importantly, physical and economic health are inextricably linked.\nProsperity is like a Jenga tower: Take one piece out and the whole thing can fall. And since well-\nbeing is the sum of a host of intertwined factors, finding a path to economic mobility and success\nmeans addressing them all. I should pause here to deliver the standard disclaimer that the views\nyou hear today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\nResearch shows that an increase in family income improves infant health.2 Which is\ngood, because research also shows there’s a strong relationship between conditions in early life\nand health, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes in adulthood.3 In fact, one study\nfound that simply moving children from disadvantaged backgrounds to full-time, high-quality\n1 See http://www.frbsf.org/community-development/initiatives/healthy-communities/ for more information.\n2 Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2015).\n3 Currie and Rossin-Slater (2015).\n1\n\nchildcare in their early years significantly reduced risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic\ndiseases later on.4\nWe find evidence that when income increases, so do math and reading test scores, with\nchildren from disadvantaged families making particular gains.5 There also appears to be a direct\ncorrelation between the quality of a child’s neighborhood and income later in life.6 Recent\nfindings suggest that children who’ve moved out of public housing and into lower-poverty areas\nin their younger years have an increase in total lifetime earnings of around $300,000. This\ndoesn’t just benefit that one child; moving disadvantaged families with young children into\nhigher-income communities may help that family’s subsequent generations avoid poverty and\nprosper as well.7\nFor these reasons and many more that you probably don’t have the patience to hear me\nrecite, we have a broad definition of health that encompasses jobs, education, and safety.\nNow that I’ve given the requisite economist’s evidence, I want to make something of a\ndeparture. I’m going to wander outside my comfort zone of spreadsheets and talk a bit about my\nexperiences and what I’ve seen, traveling across the Fed’s 12th District.\nI first want to address a word in the title of this conference: reinvestment. Because it’s\nworth noting that we are talking about investing in neighborhoods and communities. I think\nthere’s sometimes a belief that programs aimed at improving economic mobility end up giving\nmoney away and undermining self-reliance. The same school of thought sometimes perpetuates\nthe idea that people live in poverty because they simply haven’t worked hard enough, rather than\nthe overwhelming truth: There are communities in which people face multiple hurdles, any one\n4 Campbell et al. (2014).\n5 Dahl and Lochner (2012).\n6 Chetty and Hendren (2015).\n7 Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (2015).\n2\n\nof which most of us would find daunting, and which combined are virtually impossible to\novercome.\nFor the past couple of years, I’ve been touring sites with my staff and seeing what these\norganizations and people can do, and it’s incredibly impressive and inspiring. More than any\nother in the Federal Reserve System, I oversee the District that represents what people think of\nwhen we talk about “innovation” or “entrepreneurship”: Seattle, Silicon Valley, Silicon Beach.\nThe people I’ve visited embody that spirit just as much. They have exactly the kind of ingenuity\nand entrepreneurial spirit we exalt, and everyone is working double-time. It takes imagination to\nhave a good idea and guts to get it off the ground. Doing that in an area like community\ndevelopment, where angel investors are few and resources are scarce…well, that’s MacGyver-\nlike resourcefulness.\nI second want to address why community investment matters. On the one hand, it’s a\nsimple matter of fairness. This country’s compelling origin story is that anyone who works hard\nand follows the rules can be anything they want. But it can’t happen if we’re starting at different\npoints on the racetrack. If the basis of the American dream is earned success, we need to have a\nplaying field where everyone has a fair chance. No one should be comfortable shrugging off\nentrenched inequality as simply the way the cards were dealt.\nHowever, some people need to see a detailed cost-benefit analysis, so if I take a purely\npragmatic position, I’d point out that investing in creating safe, healthy communities is good for\neveryone. For one, health care accounts for a large share of the U.S. economy, and treatment of\nchronic disease is a big part of that.8\nBut more importantly, the kids whose economic conditions put them ten paces behind the\nstarting line are an important factor in this country’s future. They’re part of our rising workforce.\n8 Gerteis et al. (2014).\n3\n\nThey’re potential sources of technological and scientific innovation. They’ll be paying into our\nSocial Security and protecting our country.\nThey can be our doctors, nurses, teachers, and legislators, or they can be caught in a cycle\nof poverty whose costs may well be exponentially larger than an early investment in their future.\nNo one who’s planning on living past the next decade can afford to dismiss their fate.\nWhether the motivation is fairness or practicality, I’ve seen firsthand what can be\naccomplished, and it’s more than convincing.\nI recently visited Kearns, a township in Salt Lake County. Kearns has a lot of challenges:\nHalf their children live in poverty. Infant mortality, obesity, and diabetes-related deaths are\nsignificantly higher than in the rest of the county, while life expectancy and graduation rates are\nmuch lower. But it also has some inherent strengths—the community is engaged, and involved in\ninitiatives to tackle those issues. The goal is to combine the community’s energy with the\ncounty’s assets for an all-inclusive healthy communities initiative, the first in the county and a\nleader in Utah.9\nOur first stop was the Olympic Oval, which is still used as a training facility—the day we\nwere there, the Korean national speed skating team was practicing. But they’ve also opened it to\nthe public, helping people get more active and giving kids a place to spend time and have\nsomething fun and different to do. That’s in part because of Derek Parra, who won a speed\nskating gold in 2002. He teaches kids from the community to skate and coaches speed skaters\nfrom the area and around the country. Yes, if you live in Kearns, your child can learn to skate\nfrom an Olympic gold medalist.\n9 For more information, see Salt Lake County’s “Healthy Kearns” initiative,\nhttp://slco.org/townships/communities/healthy-kearns/.\n4\n\nWe also saw the library, which serves as a safe place for kids to go after school. Some of\nthem spend hours there, so, even though it’s not a formal program, they found a way to provide\nhealthy snacks. The library isn’t big enough to offer all the services the kids need so it’s being\nexpanded. There are also plans to build a police substation and community center. Our hosts told\nus there are already strong relationships between law enforcement and the community in Kearns,\nand that trust is obviously vital. So this approach to building a healthy community really does\nencompass the multiple factors that contribute to success: health, education, safety, and\ncommunity cohesion.\nNext up is Mesa, Arizona. The initiative here is “creative placemaking,” an effort to\nrevitalize downtown. We saw beautiful new affordable housing—when they heard the average\nrents, my San Francisco staff all threatened to move to Mesa—complete with a courtyard\nplayground so kids have a safe place to run around. We toured Lulubell Toy Bodega—that’s\nAmy, the owner, and the mayor of Mesa. Here’s some of the unique art on offer. This was great\nfor me, because my son’s in art school and it’s rare that my work gets me cool points. When you\nwalk to the store, you can see that the area is already starting to look more like the small,\nboutique shopping areas you’d find in San Francisco or Brooklyn or LA.\nWe ate at República Empanada where Marco, the owner, told us his story. He’d wanted\nto start a small, family business and was on his way, having bought the building. Then the\nrecession knocked him for a loop, work dried up so he was struggling to make loan payments,\nand there was more than one time that it all looked ready to collapse. But he kept at it and called\non friends and family. One friend donated construction materials. Others pitched in to refurbish\nthe building. Still more loaned what money they could, and now it’s a thriving business.\n5\n\nThis goes back to the idea that a tight-knit community is a healthier one, and that every\narea of community development and revitalization is intertwined. These people are\nentrepreneurs. They’re bringing jobs to the community and showing others what can be\naccomplished. They’re bringing personality and culture. And they’re turning a neglected area\ninto a safe place people want to visit, and want to stay.\nThis is a process, and it doesn’t happen overnight. I was talking to the mayor about the\nissues I see throughout my District in places that have undergone similar renaissances. I asked if\nthey were seeing any downside effects, and he told me that they’re dreaming of the day that\ngentrification is their biggest problem. In the meantime, they’re watching what’s happening\naround the country and looking at ways to protect current residents as the area continues to\nevolve.\nLast, Honolulu. Almost everyone I mention this to says something like, “I’m sure it’s SO\nhard to live in paradise.” But the truth is, Hawaii has the same pockets of inequality and\neconomic hardship as any other state—more, in fact, than many.\nWe visited Kokua Kalihi Valley, or KKV, which is a grandmaster of treating all\ndeterminants of health and well-being. There’s a medical clinic, legal counseling, a youth\nemployment program, microbusiness support, and a healthy community kitchen.\nI spoke with Marcos, who runs their “instructional bike exchange.” Which basically\nmeans that young people in the community learn to fix bikes that are headed to the landfill. They\nearn their own bike in the process, and sell the others in the community at a fair price.\nThis is some of what comes out of the sewing project, which is part of a larger women-\nfocused initiative that includes skills and job training, English language and literacy, and\nparenting classes. That’s the supply wall and Dina, who heads the medical-legal partnership. The\n6\n\nwomen sell their handmade products—from clothes to bags to iPad covers—so if you’re ever in\nHonolulu, stop by.\nThere’s a very dignified picture of me and my staff participating in the senior center’s\ndancercise class, but I seem to have lost that slide.\nKKV also holds stewardship of a natural forest preserve. Volunteers and members of the\ncommunity tend to the gardens, sell produce at farmers markets, use the vegetables in healthy\nmeals for the KKV community, and maintain the land.\nEven the smallest things are taken care of. There’s a reading nook where people can wait\nfor family members. It’s actually more of a permanent library, because you can keep any book\nyou want.\nKKV’s work is pragmatic and efficient—when people come in to the clinic, they can get\nlegal advice on tenants’ rights, for instance. But it’s also thoughtful and creative, and helps to\ncreate the strong community bonds that have proven so essential in fostering health.\nThat’s my pitch. Community investment matters. We know that neighborhoods shape\nhealth and economic opportunity.10 We know that there are people out there with the skill and\nthe determination to make communities better. And we know that when communities thrive, it’s\ngood for everyone. All it takes is a commitment to do our part.\n10 Jutte, Miller, and Erickson (2015).\n7\n\nReferences\nCampbell, Frances, Gabriella Conti, James J.

    "text": "PREPARING FOR THE NEXT STORM:\nREASSESSING FRAMEWORKS & STRATEGIES\nIN A LOW R-STAR WORLD\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo\nTHE SHADOW OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE\nNew York, New York\nMay 5, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nThank you all very much … It’s great to be able to join such a powerhouse lineup of\neconomists who are committed to improving the conduct of monetary policy.\nI was in New York about a month ago to speak to the Forecasters Club. I contrasted\nwhere the U.S. economy was four years ago when I last spoke to that group and\nwhere we are now. I have to say, it’s a very different conversation when\nunemployment is below 5 percent than it was in early 2013 when the unemployment\nrate appeared to be stuck at 8 percent.\nIt’s been said that “getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have\nto let go at some point in order to move forward.”1\nNow that we’ve gotten the monkey of the recession off our backs, we have the luxury\nof being able to look to the future. This presents us with the opportunity to ask\nourselves whether the monetary policy framework and strategy that worked well in\nthe past remains well suited for the road ahead.\n1 Commonly attributed to C.S. Lewis.\n1\n\nSuch introspection is healthy and constitutes best practice for any organization. In\nfact, the Bank of Canada has already shown us the way. Every five years, they conduct\na thorough review of whether their policy framework remains most appropriate in a\nchanging world. This is an exercise all central banks should undertake, including the\nFed.\nHaving said that, I need to remind everyone that the views I express here today are\nmine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThere’s a buzzword in the world of emergency response: resiliency. You can’t predict\nprecisely when or where the next storm will arrive, or exactly what it will look like.\nBut you can make yourself resilient, so when the time comes, you’re ready and able to\nlimit the damage and recover quickly.\nWe need to think of our resiliency toward the next economic storm in the same terms.\nAlthough an inflation targeting framework has served central banks across the globe\nwell in the past, the world has changed in ways that call into question its efficacy\ngoing forward. In particular, there is mounting evidence that the natural rate of\ninterest, or r-star, in the United States and elsewhere has fallen to historic lows, which\nhampers the ability of conventional monetary policy to respond to the next\ndownturn.2\nAs I have argued before, in the best of all worlds, fiscal and other policies would be\nput in place that propel long-run economic prosperity and boost r-star on a sustained\nbasis.3 Absent such actions, monetary policy will be severely challenged to achieve\nstable prices and strong macroeconomic performance in a low r-star world. Therefore,\nnow is the right time to examine whether monetary policy frameworks must adapt to\nchanging circumstances.\nThere are a number of potential alternative strategies to cope with a low natural rate\nof interest, including regular reliance on unconventional policy tools, negative interest\nrates, and raising the inflation target.4 Each of these have various advantages and\ndisadvantages.\n2 Laubach and Williams (2016), Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).\n3 Williams (2016)\n4 See Williams (2009), Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2010), Ball (2014), Reifschneider (2016), Bernanke\n(2016), Williams (2016), and Kiley and Roberts (2017).\n2\n\nIn my remarks today, I’ll narrow the focus to one alternative policy framework that\ndeserves particular attention because it offers significant advantages over inflation\ntargeting, particularly in a low r-star world: flexible price-level targeting.\nFIRST PRINCIPLES\nBefore diving into the details of price-level targeting, let’s take a step back to first\nprinciples and ask: What makes for a successful monetary policy framework?\nIt comes down to three words: adaptability, accessibility, and accountability.\nBy this I mean that effective strategies should be able to adapt to change in an\nuncertain world. They should be accessible and transparent so that the public can\nplan and act in accordance with the strategy. And they should facilitate accountable\nbenchmarking and performance measurement.\nThere’s an old joke about economists stranded on a desert island. A can of food\nwashes up on the shore and they try to figure out how to open it. Their solution?\n“Assume a can opener.” History teaches us that we tend to run into trouble when we\n“assume a can opener” rather than being prepared to adapt to the realities around us.\nAs nature abhors a vacuum, monetary policy abhors stasis. Instead of being a rigid set\nof precepts, it follows the adage of “that which survives is that which is most adaptive to\nchange.”\nUnderlying constants like potential GDP, the natural rate of unemployment, and the\nnatural rate of interest are not really constant: They change over time in unpredictable\nways. Monetary policy has proven most successful when it has been able to account\nfor these changes.\nPRICE-LEVEL TARGETING AND ANCHORING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS\nAlthough the natural rate of interest is the topic du jour, the challenges for monetary\npolicy to adapt to uncertain and changing natural rates is not new. In a series of\nresearch papers, Athanasios Orphanides and I investigated the design of robust\nmonetary policy strategies that can succeed in the face of real-world uncertainties,\nincluding about the natural rates of interest and unemployment.\nTo be precise, we studied what is called a “difference” monetary policy rule. This\ntype of policy strategy is closely related to a version of the Taylor (1993) policy rule,\nbut with the main difference that policy responds to deviations of the level of prices\n3\n\nrelative to a steadily growing target level, rather than deviations of the inflation rate\nfrom a target rate.\nOne recurring finding of our research is that a policy strategy that targets the price\nlevel in this way and responds to the unemployment rate can be highly effective at\nstabilizing both inflation and unemployment in an environment of structural change\nand uncertainty.5 In a nutshell, the big advantage of this approach is that any surges or\ndrops in the inflation rate need to be made up in the future. This assures that, over\nthe medium term, inflation stays on track, even if policymakers have a very imperfect\nunderstanding of the levels of natural rates or other structural changes affecting the\neconomy.\nAs Martin Luther King, Jr. famously said: History is a great teacher. Episodes where\nmonetary policy failed can be just as instructive as times when things went well. In\nthat spirit, Athanasios and I studied a period when monetary policy failed and\neveryday people paid the price – both figuratively and literally.6 I’m talking about the\nGreat Inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, we re-examined the choices made by policymakers to\ndetermine whether the devastating increases in inflation and unemployment that\nbecame known as stagflation could have been avoided. Our findings suggest that\nanswer was yes, they could have—if the Fed had instead used an alternative, robust\npolicy strategy that effectively targeted the price level, as well as responded to the\nunemployment rate.\nWithout going into the details – I invite you to read the paper at your leisure –\naccording to our model simulations, such a robust price-level strategy could have\ndelivered fairly stable inflation throughout the 1960s and 1970s and beyond. This\nresult is seen in Figure 1, where the black line shows the actual inflation rate, which\ntwice reaches double digits. The blue line shows the simulated inflation rate that\nwould have occurred if the Fed followed a policy strategy that aims for a constant 2\npercent increase in the price level starting in 1966 (the simulation ends in 2003).\nUnder the price-level strategy, monetary policy would have avoided the mistake of the\nlate 1960s of allowing the unemployment rate to remain very low for a long time,\nwhich contributed to the run-up in inflation during that period. As a result, the Great\nInflation never materializes.\n5 Orphanides and Williams (2002, 2007, 2013).\n6 Orphanides and Williams (2013).\n4\n\nA key to this strategy’s success is the rock-solid anchoring of inflation expectations.\nFigure 2 compares a real-world measure of one-year-ahead inflation expectations from\nthe Survey of Professional Forecasters (the black line) to the model’s predictions of\nwhat inflation expectations would have been if the Fed had followed the price-level\ntargeting strategy (the blue line). An important aspect of this strategy is that it does\nnot allow inflation to stray too far from 2 percent for long. This “walking the talk” of\nprice stability reinforces the public’s understanding of the policy strategy and creates a\npositive feedback loop where stable inflation anchors inflation expectations, which in\nturn fosters stable inflation, which reinforces the anchoring of expectations, and so\non.\nThe price-level policy is not only effective in terms of price stability, but also helps\nstabilize the unemployment rate by avoiding swings in unemployment resulting from\nthe Fed trying to get inflation back on track (Figure 3). With the Great Inflation\navoided, the economic slowdown needed to bring inflation down in the early 1980s\ndoesn’t occur. Interestingly, the policy strategy followed in this model simulation\nimplicitly assumes a constant natural rate of unemployment. Nonetheless, the policy\ndoes a reasonably good job of tracking the natural rate of unemployment, which is\nassumed to be equal to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate shown by the\ndashed red line in the figure.\nPRICE-LEVEL TARGETING AND LOW R-STAR\nThis analysis makes a strong case for a flexible price-level targeting in “normal” times\nof change and uncertainty. But we are now living in a “low r-star world,” and that\nonly strengthens the case for price-level targeting.\nIf you look at natural interest rates across the globe, you’ll find something they have in\ncommon: In country after country they’re at historic lows. What’s more, they appear\npoised to stay that way as trends pushing the natural rate lower are unlikely to reverse\nanytime soon.7 To put this in perspective, the weighted average of natural rates in\nCanada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the euro area currently stands\naround 1/4 percent. That’s more than 2 percentage points below the average natural\nrate that prevailed in the two decades before the financial crisis (Figure 4).8\nWhy is price-level targeting well adapted to a low r-star world? If price growth is a\nlittle lower than target, say, during a downturn, the central bank aims to get the price\n7 See Williams (2015), Hamilton et al. (2015), Kiley (2015), Lubik and Matthes (2015), and Laubach and Williams\n(2016).\n8 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016). Estimates are available at: http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/economists/jwilliams/Holston_Laubach_Williams_estimates.xlsx\n5\n\nlevel back up in the years ahead – and vice-versa. Baked into its very design is a\n“lower for longer” policy prescription in response to sustained low inflation.9 This\nhelps support the return of the price level to the desired level and anchor inflation\nexpectations even when interest rates are constrained at the lower bound.10\nThis aspect of price-level targeting can be seen by comparing the prescriptions of a\nstandard Taylor (1993) rule to one adapted to a price-level framework.11 Figure 5\nshows the prescriptions for these two policy strategies for the years 2005–2016, where\n2005 is chosen as a starting point because this is generally viewed as a year that the\neconomy was close to its goals in terms of inflation and the unemployment rate. For\ncomparison, the actual federal funds rate is shown by the black line.\nUnder this price-level strategy, the federal funds rate responds one-for-one with\nmovements in: the inflation rate, the percent deviation of the price level from the\ntarget level, and the negative of the percentage point deviation of the unemployment\nrate from its natural rate. For these calculations, I have assumed a constant natural\nrate of interest of 2 percent and a constant natural rate of unemployment of 5 percent,\nconsistent with standard views on these natural rates at the start of this sample.\nWhat stands out in this figure is how close the prescriptions of these two policy\nstrategies are to each other before and during the recession. They only differ in a\nmeaningful way during the economic recovery after years of inflation consistently\nrunning below target. The buildup of one-sided misses below the inflation goal causes\nthe price-level strategy to keep rates low despite the improvement in the\nunemployment rate and the gradual movement of inflation back towards 2 percent.\nPRICE-LEVEL TARGETING AND ACCESSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\nSo there are clear benefits to this framework when it comes to adaptability. How\nabout accessibility and accountability?\nIn terms of accessibility, a price-level goal is easy to explain and is in some ways a\nmore natural way for the public to think of price stability than an inflation target. A\nprice-level target provides greater clarity on where prices will be 5, 10, and 30 years\ninto the future, time horizons that people think about when buying a car, a home, or\n9 Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n10 A further benefit of price-level targeting is a built-in protection against debt deflation; see Koenig (2013) and\nSheedy (2014).\n11 For these calculations, inflation is measured by the four-quarter percent change in the core personal consumption\nexpenditures price index, and economic activity is measured by the unemployment rate. For both rules, the\ncoefficient on the unemployment gap is set equal to -1.\n6\n\nplanning for retirement. This should lend itself to greater transparency and clarity for\nthe public—especially when interest rates are constrained by the lower bound.\nThe same logic holds true for accountability. A price-level regime would provide a\nclear and accessible metric by which to judge whether the central bank is successfully\ndelivering on its price stability mandate by looking at whether the price level is near its\nstipulated goal.\nAnd as the examples I discussed attest, this is not a “dove” or “hawk” issue: a flexible\nprice-level framework is well suited for achieving both price stability and employment\ngoals. In the 1960s and early 1970s, a price-level framework would have called for\ntighter monetary policy, and thereby avoided the stagflation of the late 1970s. In\nrecent years, it called for easier monetary policy than a standard Taylor rule.\nCONCLUSION\nI have highlighted some key potential advantages of a price-level framework over\ninflation targeting. By the way, some of these are shared by the related approach of\nnominal GDP targeting, an approach that is also worthy of further detailed study and\nconsideration.\nIt’s important to note that there are potential drawbacks to a price-level framework as\nwell. For one, it is only likely to succeed in the ways that I have described if it is\nfollowed consistently over time and well understood by the public (Williams 2006).\nThis is not a short-run “fix” for the low r-star problem, but rather a long-term\nsolution that will take many years to have full effect. Second, it may not be sufficient\nto deal with a very low r-star world without other complementary policy actions,\nwhether in fiscal or monetary policy.\nThe likelihood that r-star will remain low for the foreseeable future is one of the\nreasons I’m convinced that we need to assess the pros and cons of alternative\nframeworks and strategies … because our menu of options looks something like this:\n We can hope that another storm doesn’t come;\n We can hope that our existing toolkit, perhaps extended to include negative\ninterest rates, is up to the task;\n We can brace ourselves for a new normal where recessions last longer and run\ndeeper, recoveries are slower, and we risk losing the nominal anchor;\n7\n\n Or we can prepare for the next storm by taking appropriate actions in advance to\ncommit to a more resilient framework; a framework that maintains our\ncommitment to price stability and maximum employment; anchors inflation\nexpectations; and has all the advantages of the current regime.\nIt’s better to study and debate these issues now, when we’ve attained recovery, than to\nwait for the next downturn or crisis to hit. I don’t know about you, but I’d far prefer\nto prepare for the next storm while we’re in calm waters, than to wait until our boats\nare taking on water.\nI’ll finish where I started by emphasizing the need for monetary policy strategies that\nwill make us resilient and effective in the years ahead: Adaptable. Accessible.\nAccountable.\nUnder these criteria – and given the realities of the low r-star world in which we live –\nI believe that a price-level framework merits very serious consideration for central\nbanks including the Fed.\nThank you.\n8\n\nReferences\nBall, Laurence. 2014. “The Case for a Long-Run Inflation Target of Four Percent.”\nIMF Working Paper 14/92, June.\nhttps://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1492.pdf\nBernanke, Ben S. 2016. “Modifying the Fed’s Policy Framework: Does a Higher\nInflation Target Beat Negative Interest Rates?” Ben Bernanke’s Blog, Brookings,\nSeptember 13. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-\nbernanke/2016/09/13/modifying-the-feds-policy-framework-does-a-higher-\ninflation-target-beat-negative-interest-rates/\nBlanchard, Olivier, Giovanni Dell’Ariccia and Paolo Mauro. 2010. “Rethinking\nMacroeconomic Policy.” Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking 42(s1), pp.199–215.\nEggertsson, Gauti, and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates\nand Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 2003(1), pp.\n139–211. https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-zero-bound-on-interest-\nrates-and-optimal-monetary-policy/\nHamilton, James D., Ethan S.

    "text": "Community Leaders Luncheon Speech\nLos Angeles, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 8, 2013\nRebalancing the Economy: A Tale of Two Countries\nThank you so much, Dominic, both for your kind introduction and years of dedicated\nservice to the Federal Reserve. It’s a privilege to speak to such a distinguished group of business\nand civic leaders.\nIt is often said that when America sneezes, the world catches cold. This adage is a\nmodern adaptation of the 19th century saying—attributed to Prince Klemens von Metternich—\nthat, “When Paris sneezes, Europe catches cold.” Today, economic developments in China have\nobvious repercussions across borders as well, affecting everyone from small emerging\neconomies to Europe and the United States. We live in a world where our economic fates are\nincreasingly intertwined. Indeed, Metternich’s saying is now often heard with China as the\nproverbial sneezer.\nOf course, this audience already knows of the growing influence of China and Asia more\nbroadly. California is at the forefront in terms of business and cultural connections with Asia.\nIndeed, I often hear from people here that the outlook across the Pacific is more relevant to their\nbusinesses and organizations than events in Europe or elsewhere.\nWith that in mind, I’d like to talk to you today about how two countries—alike in some\nways, very different in others—need to rebalance their economies over the next decade. Those\nshifts will be similar in some aspects, divergent in others; but both face the challenge of how to\nbest manage the transition to longer-run rebalancing. Before I go any further, I should say here\n1\n\nthat the views expressed today are wholly my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others\nin the Federal Reserve System.\nIt is not surprising that understanding economic and financial issues in Asia more\nbroadly, and China specifically, is fundamental to any discussion of global economics. This is\nparticularly acute at the San Francisco Fed, where fostering expertise on Asian markets is a long-\nstanding focus. Deep knowledge of Asia is essential to formulating monetary policy; to\npromoting the stability of global financial markets; and to carrying out our responsibilities in\nbanking supervision. Continuing a tradition started many years ago by San Francisco Fed\nPresident Bob Parry and carried on by his successor, Janet Yellen, I try to make a fact-finding\ntrip to Asia at least once a year. I’ve now had the pleasure of visiting China and other Asian\ncountries on several occasions.\nThe state of two economies\nWe all know China has been a modern miracle of growth since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms\nwere introduced in 1978. For over 30 years, China’s real GDP growth has averaged about 10\npercent annually—a sustained pace of growth that is unrivaled in economic history.1 To put that\nin perspective, over the same time period, the rest of the world’s economies experienced an\naverage annual growth rate of real GDP of about 3 percent.2 China’s growth has been driven by\nan almost unbelievable pace of urbanization, both natural and managed. The share of China’s\npopulation living in cities more than doubled between 1980 and 2005, to 44 percent.3 At its\n1 See Aizenman and Spiegel (2010).\n2 See International Monetary Fund (2013).\n3 See Woetzel et al. (2009).\n2\n\ncurrent pace, we can expect to see one billion people living in cities by 2030. That’s more than\nthe current populations of the United States, Russia, and the entire European Union combined.\nThis accomplishment is breathtaking.\nHowever, that exceptional pace cannot be maintained forever, and we’ve seen China’s\nrate of growth slow in recent years. What China faces now is the same core issue confronting the\nUnited States: coming to terms with a new normal for the future. Both countries are looking to\ncreate more long-term stability by rebalancing the role that domestic consumption plays in their\neconomies. They are simply coming at it from opposite directions. The United States would like\nto decrease its reliance on consumption as the engine of growth, relying more on domestic\ninvestment and exports. China would like to see more consumer spending at home, and less\nreliance on domestic investment and exports. The contrast is striking: Chinese household\nconsumption accounted for around 36 percent of GDP in 2011; the comparable figure for the\nUnited States is 69 percent. For comparison, in the euro zone, private consumption spending\naverages around 58 percent of GDP.\nChina’s remarkable growth over the past 30 years has been fostered by an emphasis on\ninvestment and exports. As the returns to investment have declined over time, and slower global\ngrowth provides diminishing opportunities for exports, this model has become less sustainable.\nThe focus must instead shift—as China’s leaders have indicated they would like—to domestic\nhousehold consumption.\nThe United States, by contrast, has for decades consumed and invested more than it\nproduced, relying on imports to fill the gap. The question for America is: How long can it\nsustain this imbalance? With every passing year that we don’t live reasonably within our means,\n3\n\nand do not produce the goods to pay for our consumption, our debt to creditors outside the\ncountry grows. This reduces our net wealth and makes us more dependent on foreign lenders.\nResponses to the financial crisis\nEvery country’s economic path is informed by its history. As William Faulkner once\nwrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” Likewise, both China’s and America’s\npresent conditions—and their outlooks for the future—are greatly influenced by one of the most\nsignificant events of the recent past: the global financial crisis.\nChina responded to the crisis with a large-scale stimulus program, increasing lending by\nbanks to large, state-owned enterprises that totaled 4.4 percent of GDP over three years.4 These\nloans were used largely to finance infrastructure and housing projects. China’s growth had fallen\nfrom a recent high of 14 percent, in 2007, to 9 percent in 2009. With the boost from the\ngovernment stimulus, growth rebounded to 10 percent in 2010. That is, in the face of the worst\nglobal financial crisis in many decades, China’s economic growth actually increased.\nThis was widely viewed as a success, and an indication that China could persevere\ndespite continuing problems abroad. However, the slow recovery in the United States and the\nsustained downturn in Europe dampened demand for Chinese exports. This has been a powerful\nreminder—unpleasant though it was for China—that our fortunes are often enmeshed. These\nexternal burdens contributed to slowed growth, and the World Bank now expects the Chinese\neconomy to grow just 7.5 percent this year. I say “just”… obviously, most countries would be\nthrilled with 7.5 percent.\n4 See Horton and Ivanova (2009).\n4\n\nWhile China’s growth has been greatly affected by forces outside its borders, the U.S.\neconomy has been influenced by many internal conditions. In the United States, the response to\nthe crisis was threefold: federal government fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts and increased\nspending; programs aimed at restoring confidence and strength to the financial system; and, last\nbut not least, a large dose of monetary stimulus.\nThis threefold response helped avoid a complete meltdown of the financial system and\ncushioned the blow to our economy. Nonetheless, it was not enough to stave off a severe\nrecession or the myriad factors hindering the recovery. The financial crisis dealt a devastating\nblow to household wealth—a full $6.5 trillion of housing wealth was lost. Combined with a\ndeeply depressed stock market, this sent spending off a cliff. That went for all aspects of\nspending, including—or, I should say, especially—home construction and household goods.\nThis was a particular problem, because those areas of spending have typically spurred recoveries\nin the past. The situation was exacerbated by especially tight credit, bringing lending to a virtual\nstandstill.\nI don’t need to remind anyone here how bad it was. California’s economy was especially\nhard hit. We experienced one of the biggest housing booms and therefore one of the most severe\nhousing collapses. California was also much more affected by the sharp slowdown in\ninternational trade. This was felt particularly here in Southern California, where Los Angeles\nand Long Beach are two of the nation’s primary global ports. And even the tech industry was\ndealt a severe blow. While employment overall fell by 3.8 percent nationally in 2009, Southern\nCalifornia saw a 5.6 percent drop.\n5\n\nThe reversal of federal fiscal policy from stimulus to austerity in the intervening years\nhas added to the factors holding back the economic recovery. On one side, we had income tax\nincreases on upper-income Americans and the expiration of the Social Security payroll tax cut.\nThese took a bite out of disposable income that could otherwise have been directed toward\nspending. On the other, budget austerity and sequestration have resulted in a drag on spending\nby the public sector. Overall, it is estimated that federal fiscal policy is subtracting 1½\npercentage points from economic growth this year.5 On top of this, the gridlock and\nbrinkmanship in Washington, D.C., adds to uncertainty and saps confidence. This makes\nhouseholds and businesses reluctant to undertake big investments, further slowing the recovery.\nAgain, California stands to feel this pain more severely. The effects of sequestration have\nbeen neither fully felt nor fully implemented. Next year, a further $20 billion of federal defense\ncuts will take effect, which will impact a state with both a large defense contracting sector and\nnumerous military bases. Anecdotally, the uncertainty of further government cuts and the threat\nof continued gridlock in Washington has put the aerospace and defense industries in something\nof a holding pattern. The effects on these industries will be felt from contractors to construction\nworkers.\nChallenges\nEach country has challenges to overcome. China’s tightly-controlled financial sector\ncreates systemic barriers to rebalancing the economy. There are limits on investment abroad, and\na repressed financial system at home keeps interest rates low and constrains the kinds of\n5 See Lucking and Wilson (2013) and Congressional Budget Office (2013).\n6\n\ninvestments people can make. The system also favors state-owned enterprises, hindering small\nbusinesses and discouraging entrepreneurship.\nIt has also contributed to the rise in shadow banking. China’s fiscal stimulus program\nencouraged the state-owned banks to lend even further to large, state-owned enterprises. The\ngovernment was rightly worried about investment expanding too quickly—after all, over-\ninvestment and the resulting bubble in the U.S. housing sector offered a cautionary tale. So\nChina sought to restrict wider borrowing. Local governments and smaller enterprises, however,\nwere eager for capital to invest in their own areas, and financial institutions, unsurprisingly,\nfound ways around government constraints. This created a surge in China’s shadow banking\nsector, which increased its informal and private lending to small businesses and wealthy\ncustomers, much of it off-balance-sheet.\nThere is inherent risk to any loan. Whether sanctioned by the government or made in the\nshadow banking sector, there is always a possibility it will turn bad. Considering that the heavy\nborrowing by local governments was directed towards infrastructure projects that often yielded\nlittle, if any, return in the short term, timely repayment is a very real risk.\nTherefore, many observers fear that excessive lending and borrowing may be creating a\nbubble, similar to the one that burst in the United States just seven years ago. China’s corporate\nand household debt as a share of GDP rose 45 percent in the four years from 2008 to 2012. This\nis more than twice the increase in US debt during its credit boom between 2002 and 2008, when\nthe debt-to-GDP ratio rose by about 20 percent. Such rapid increases in borrowing have\nhistorically raised the risk of crises in other countries.\n7\n\nReal estate is another area of concern. On one of my recent visits, a Chinese professor\ntold me that everyone in China has two homes or more, because houses are cheap, interest on\nsavings accounts is low, and there are no property or capital gains taxes. Though he was\nobviously exaggerating, it does highlight the attractiveness of property, in light of the high\nhousehold saving rate and limits on alternative investment opportunities. In response to bubble\nconcerns, China’s government has been working since 2010 to bring down real estate prices by\nsetting limits on bank lending and raising down-payment requirements for mortgages. Despite\nthese efforts, recent data show China’s property prices continuing to rise. The resilience of\nhousing prices in the face of concerted policy efforts adds to the worry that a bubble may be\nforming.\nThis is a fine line to walk: Though a real-estate bubble is a risk, there is also concern that\neconomic growth could weaken too much and too quickly. With the rest of the global economy\nlacking the steam to pull China’s economy along, it must find some domestic engine for growth.\nIn the United States, the challenges we face are also about striking balance. One of the\nsharpest lessons of the past five years is the need to keep financial institutions from taking big\nrisks. However, risk-aversion can mean tight credit, and limited access to capital for small\nbusinesses and entrepreneurs may be the price of caution. In addition, while we need to\nrebalance our economy away from consumption over the longer term, in the short run, consumer\nspending is critical to getting the economy moving again.\nAddressing the challenges\n8\n\nSo these are the states of both nations as we move towards change. China faces a\nbalancing act in the near term: Needed economic reforms come at the price of slower growth; but\na growth-boosting injection of credit comes at the cost of greater risk to the banking system and\nthe economy down the road.\nChina’s policymakers have ruled out a stimulus package of the size implemented during\nthe crisis. They have also acknowledged that reforms cannot be implemented without a\nslowdown.\nIn various speeches, China’s leadership has said that it will tolerate some deceleration of\ngrowth—though not breaching a floor of 7 percent—in order to shift focus from exports to\ndomestic consumption.\nAs many of you know, we expect to hear the new government’s economic plans at the\nThird Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee, which starts tomorrow.\nAs always, China’s policy making will be consensus-driven and won’t happen overnight.\nChina’s leadership has reason to be guarded in approaching far-reaching reforms. It is perhaps\nthe safer option to loan money to a state-owned enterprise than to risk it on a consumer who may\nnot pay back a home mortgage—the memories of America’s recent past are all too fresh. As\nCicero counseled, “Advice is judged by results, not intentions.” And to encourage more\nconsumer spending is to encourage a certain amount of debt. That debt is, however, manageable,\nand ultimately necessary if China wants to hasten an economic rebalancing.\n9\n\nOn our side of the Pacific, the issues and discussion are much messier. In the near term,\nwe are still facing a slow recovery and high unemployment. However, the cure for what ails us\nhere and now is in some respects at odds with the longer-term rebalancing we need to achieve.\nWhich leads me to the rebalancing of economies. Unsurprisingly, economists can’t agree\nabout the primary reason China’s domestic consumption is so low and what should be done\nabout it. One possibility is the population’s focus on saving—in large part to cover the cost of\nhealth care, education, and preparation for old age. This is exacerbated by China’s massive and\nrapid urbanization; as it currently stands, most social services, such as education and health care,\nare administered in one’s home city. This means that much of the migrant workforce can’t\naccess these services in their new cities, and is forced to save to cover those expenses. While\nlocal authorities may balk at paying more for social services, there is a trade-off: addressing\nsuch structural barriers would free up workers’ income that could be spent locally, stimulating\nhost cities’ economies.\nAnother issue is increasing income inequality—something we in the United States can\nrelate to. What money is flowing to households is concentrated largely in the expanding class of\nwealthy citizens, rather than in rural and middle-class families.\nThe final and perhaps most important factor is that, while corporate profits have risen, a\ncomparable rise in individual income has not followed. Again, something that has happened in\nthe United States as well.\nLow borrowing costs for state-supported firms, combined with low wages for many\nworkers, have helped business profits at the expense of households.\n10\n\nIf China is to rebalance the economy away from exports and towards domestic\nconsumption, there must be an increase in household incomes. That means higher wages and\ndividend payments from firms. Further liberalization of the financial system will also help, as\nhigher deposit rates and more investment options would boost spending power. Furthermore,\nChina’s citizens must feel a sense of stability and certainty regarding their future. When we’re\nworried about the future, the natural response is to want to save more. So, even if these steps\nwere to be taken, the question remains whether China’s middle- and rural-class citizens are\nwilling to become bigger spenders anytime soon.\nTurning to the United States, over the longer run we need to increase investment in\neducation, physical capital, technology, and infrastructure. We will also need to put federal fiscal\npolicy on a sustainable path, which involves making some tough decisions about taxes and\nspending. Importantly, spending less on current consumption will free up resources for\ninvestment areas that foster greater production and will increase the size of the economy over the\nlong term.\nHowever, to succeed at these longer-run goals, we first need to get our economy working\nat its full potential. That’s where the Federal Reserve and monetary policy come in. Since the\nearly days of the crisis and recession, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy body, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), has been taking strong actions to foster economic recovery\nand get people back to work. We lowered short-term interest rates to near zero almost five years\nago. The goal was simple: With very low interest rates, households and businesses are more\nwilling to spend. This increase in demand for goods and services leads businesses to hire more\nworkers.\n11\n\nIt is a testament to the stubborn weakness of the recovery that even with short-term\ninterest rates near zero, it wasn’t enough to get the economy back on track. We turned to\nunconventional monetary policies to get longer-term interest rates and mortgage rates down.\nThese included large-scale asset purchases—referred to as “quantitative easing” or QE by people\noutside the Fed and LSAPs by people inside the Fed—and forward guidance—which is\neconomist-ese for communicating more clearly what we think will happen with interest rates\nover the longer term. By combining these tools with our conventional policy—the short-term\ninterest rate—we are looking to get more money flowing into the economy to increase demand\nfor goods and services and spur hiring.\nAlthough the pace of the recovery in the United States has been frustratingly slow, we\nhave made a lot of progress, and I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. We’ve\nadded nearly 6.4 million jobs over the past three years, with 2.2 million of those in the past year\nalone. Although the unemployment rate is still high at 7.2 percent, it has been steadily falling.\nA lot of the growth has been in interest-sensitive sectors such as autos, durable goods, and\nhousing. This is evidence that our monetary policy medicine is working.\nLooking ahead, with continued support from accommodative monetary policy, I expect\nthe economy to continue to expand and add a significant number of jobs, resulting in declining\nunemployment next year and in 2015. I also expect inflation, which has been quite low over the\npast year, to gradually move back to the Fed’s preferred rate of 2 percent.\nConclusion\n12\n\nChina and the United States are both facing challenges in rebalancing their economies for\nthe future. There are parallels and contrasts, but both face the difficult challenge of maintaining\ngrowth today while moving toward a new normal of longer-run economic health for tomorrow.\nThank you very much.\n13\n\nReferences\nAizenman, Joshua, and Mark M.

With that caveat in\nplace, I’d like to give an overview today of the economic outlook and its implications for\nmonetary policy.\nA sustained recovery\nWinston Churchill once said, “I always avoid prophesying beforehand, because it is a\nmuch better policy to prophesy after the event has already taken place,” and that’s good advice.\nBut I’m going to ignore it and go ahead and say that the outlook is, overall, quite good. While\nthe winter wasn’t too kind to many parts of the country, and it looks like growth in real GDP\nstalled in the first quarter, things are looking positive for the rest of the year.\n1\n\nThe severe weather in parts of the country accounts for some, though not all, of that first-\nquarter weakness. By some estimates, weather conditions reduced GDP growth by as much as\n1½ percentage points. Most of the other factors depressing first-quarter growth appear to be\ntemporary and more recent economic indicators point to substantial underlying momentum. In\nparticular, consumer spending has rebounded from winter lulls.\nThe jobs numbers are also encouraging. Following weak jobs data during the worst\nwinter months, employment gains bounced back up to average nearly a quarter million jobs per\nmonth from February through April. This rebound in employment growth is evidence that\nbusinesses view the winter’s inactivity as temporary. Taking a longer view, over the past year,\nthe U.S. economy has added nearly 2.4 million jobs. This has helped reduce the unemployment\nrate to 6.3 percent.\nDespite all this good news, there is one area of concern, which is housing. Historically,\nmost recessions have been followed by housing revivals, which significantly boosted the early\nstages of recovery. I therefore expected housing to be a much stronger tailwind by now. While\nhome construction and sales showed substantial momentum in 2012 and the first half of 2013,\nthe wind has been taken out of the sails since then. Much of the slowdown in housing-market\nactivity appears to be due to last year’s jump in mortgage interest rates. Although that is unlikely\nto reverse, other factors driving this sector should improve and I remain cautiously optimistic\nabout the outlook for housing over the next few years.\nOne source of the as-yet unrealized demand for housing is the number of adults living\nwith their parents. The recession saw a substantial increase in the percentage of Americans\nforced to move back home, or unable to make it out in the first place.1 As job growth continues,\n1 Rudebusch (2014).\n2\n\nhuge numbers of these young people are likely to move out—a relief to both them and their\nparents, I should think—and many will buy homes.\nHomes are also still pretty affordable. Household incomes are growing, mortgage\ninterest rates—despite last year’s jump—are still low, and in most areas of the country home\nprices have remained well below their pre-recession peaks. And while those prices are still\nrelatively low, they are continuing to rise.\nTogether, these various signs indicate that the disappointing data are likely temporary and\nhousing should begin to provide the support to the recovery we’ve been waiting for.\nIn other good news: Some of the key headwinds that were holding back the economy\nhave eased. This is offsetting the weakness in the housing sector and contributing to the\nfavorable outlook for the remainder of the year.\nOne headwind that is abating is from the government sector. Fiscal policies are exerting\nless drag on growth. State and local governments have seen substantial improvements in their\nbudgets, and federal spending cuts have eased. The avoidance of another round of brinkmanship\nover the federal budget has been important in mitigating uncertainty, which had been holding\nback spending and employment.2 Financial conditions also continue to improve, with substantial\nstock market gains and strengthening balance sheets for households, businesses, and banks. And\nwe are seeing an easing of credit availability to consumers and businesses.\nWith the recent spending data and dissipating headwinds, the turnaround in momentum\nfrom the first quarter is palpable. I expect a rebound in the current quarter and look for real GDP\ngrowth to average around 3 percent for 2014 and 2015. This exceeds the underlying trend rate of\n2 Leduc and Liu (2013).\n3\n\nGDP growth of around 2 percent, based on population growth and productivity gains. This\nsustained recovery in spending should continue to fuel sizable gains in employment and income.\nOf course, nothing in life is certain, and there are factors outside our control that could\nget in the way—heightened geopolitical tensions, for instance, or instability in foreign financial\nmarkets, particularly in emerging economies. We’ll continue to keep an eye on those\ndevelopments, but as things stand, the domestic outlook is positive.\nChallenges for monetary policy\nWhile the economic outlook is favorable, there are still challenges for monetary policy\nand how we at the Fed go about meeting the two goals Congress has set for us: maximum\nemployment and stable prices.\nAs I said, employment has been growing at a good clip. In fact, the number of private-\nsector jobs is back above its pre-recession peak. Overall employment, which includes the public\nsector, will probably reach its previous peak in another month or so. But that’s the number of\njobs. In the interim, the population has been growing, bringing more potential workers into the\nfold. At the same time, the first round of baby boomers is headed into retirement, which means\npeople being taken out of the labor pool.\nThose variations mean that the number of jobs consistent with maximum employment\nwill always be a moving target. That’s why economists typically rely on the unemployment rate\nas the primary metric for assessing the overall health of the labor market. The unemployment\nrate measures the number of people who are actively looking for employment as a percentage of\nthe labor force. In a strong economy, obviously, that number will be low. But it will never be\nthe case that literally nobody is unemployed. There will always be people just out of school\nlooking for new jobs or people seeking work after getting laid off—that’s the normal process in a\ndynamic and changing economy like ours. So economists think in terms of a “natural rate” of\n4\n\nunemployment, which is the rate consistent with a typical, well-functioning economy over the\nlong term. It’s hard to know precisely what the natural rate is, but I put it around 5¼ to 5 ½\npercent. To put things in perspective, the current unemployment rate of 6.3 percent is still well\nabove the natural rate. My forecast is for the unemployment rate to gradually decline over the\nnext two years, reaching the natural rate sometime in 2016.\nOne indication that unemployment is still higher than its natural rate is that growth in\nworkers’ pay has been pretty modest. In fact, wage growth has averaged only about 2 percent\nover the past few years, and there are few signs of any acceleration in wages. That said, I expect\nthat once the unemployment rate gets even closer to its natural rate, wage growth should pick up.\nNow you may be worried that if wages take off that would inexorably lead to higher price\ninflation. As I said, along with maximum employment, the Fed is charged with achieving price\nstability, by which we mean an inflation rate that is low and stable, averaging 2 percent over the\nlonger run. At the moment, the Fed’s challenge is that inflation has been well below that 2\npercent rate. We actually need to increase inflation a bit, so a pickup in wage growth would help\nus achieve that. On top of that, faster wage growth puts more money in consumers’ pockets\nwhich leads to more spending and a stronger economic recovery.\nYou may ask, “Why is low inflation a problem?” The full answer to that would take far\nmore time than we have—and not just because economists tend to be long-winded. But one key\nproblem with very low inflation or even deflation—that is, falling prices—is that it increases the\ndebt burden on borrowers by forcing them to re-pay loans using money that is worth more than\nthey planned on when they took out the loan.3 The resulting debt overhang damps the\nwillingness and ability of people and businesses to spend, putting a drag on economic growth.\n3 See Bernanke (2002) for an extensive discussion of these issues.\n5\n\nAmerica’s recent bout with low inflation is not unique. Japan and Korea have inflation\nrates well below their target levels. The countries in Europe that use the Euro are experiencing\ninflation below 1 percent, and some of them are living through out-and-out deflation.\nFor the United States and other advanced economies, economic slack is the main culprit\nbehind abnormally low inflation levels. That is, the gap between unemployment and its natural\nrate or in GDP relative to its potential. Another factor for the U.S. was lower import prices\nduring 2012 and 2013. We’re starting to see a reversal of that trend, with import prices no longer\nexerting downward pressure on inflation. And as the recovery proceeds and economic slack\nabates, inflation should gradually move back up to 2 percent.\nPolicy options and tools\nThe ongoing need to reduce unemployment and increase inflation both call for the same\nmedicine: highly accommodative monetary policy. Although the goals and overall direction of\nmonetary policy have been clear, reaching those goals has been far more challenging.\nWe started with our conventional monetary policy tool, the federal funds rate. That’s the\nrate at which banks lend to each other overnight, and serves as a benchmark for short-term\ninterest rates in general. We lowered the federal funds rate to essentially zero in late 2008, in the\nthroes of the financial crisis, and have kept it there since. We can’t move rates much lower than\nthat, and that constraint is referred to as the “zero lower bound.” Unfortunately, the severity of\nthe recession called for even greater monetary accommodation than could be achieved by\nlowering the federal funds rate, and we had to get creative.\nWe turned to what most people know as quantitative easing, and what we at the Fed refer\nto as LSAPs, or large-scale asset purchases. We’ve had three rounds of QE since late 2008,\nraising the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet to over $4 trillion. The latest round was\n6\n\nannounced in September of 2012, with a peak monthly rate of purchases of $85 billion in\ncombined long-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. What we sought to do with the\nasset purchases was lower a wider range of interest rates than we could with the fed funds rate\nalone. Lower rates translate into more borrowing and economic activity.4\nYou’ll sometimes hear people assigning a liberal slant to quantitative easing—but it was\nactually proposed by Milton Friedman. In 2000, he was asked what more the Bank of Japan\ncould do to combat deflation, since they were constrained by the zero lower bound. Friedman\nsaid, “It’s very simple. They can buy long-term government securities.”5 Which is exactly what\nthe Fed has been doing.\nOther countries have successfully implemented similar programs as well. The Banks of\nEngland and Japan have used extensive asset purchases to improve financial and economic\nconditions in their countries. The evidence so far is that it’s working. In particular, Japan, which\nhad been mired in deflation for much of the past two decades, is seeing positive and increasing\ninflation.\nWe started easing off the gas a bit in December of last year. The Fed’s monetary policy\nbody, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided that the recovery was far enough along to\ntake the first steps toward ending the process of adding monetary accommodation. This was\nbased primarily on improving conditions in the labor market and the economic outlook.\nWe agreed to reduce the pace of asset purchases—the “taper” everyone was talking\nabout—by $10 billion that month, with additional monthly reductions of $10 billion at the next\nthree meetings. We’re down to $45 billion for May, and the process of gradual reductions in the\n4 See, for example, Williams (2014).\n5 Friedman (2000).\n7\n\npace of purchases will likely continue until the purchase program comes to an end late this year.\nAt this point, it would take a substantial shift in the economic outlook to derail the tapering\nprocess.\nI say this a lot, because it’s an important message to get across: The taper does not reflect\na tightening of monetary policy. We’re not putting out the fire, we’re just gradually adding less\nand less fuel. It’s just one small step towards policy normalization, when the economy has\nsufficient heat on its own. A real tightening of policy—which would mean raising the fed funds\nrate—is still a good way off.\nWhat I just said is part of another unconventional policy the Fed undertook to help\ncombat the effects of the recession: Clearly communicating our expectations about the future\npath of the fed funds rate. We refer to it as “forward guidance.” We’ve been using FOMC\nstatements, press conferences, and speeches to make it clear that we are going to keep the funds\nrate low for a significant period, which helps hold down longer-term interest rates as well.\nIn the past, the FOMC tied the eventual lifting of the funds rate to the unemployment\nrate—specifically, saying that we wouldn’t raise the rate until unemployment fell below 6.5\npercent. At the time, with 6.5 percent fairly far off, using a numerical benchmark was helpful to\nbe clear about our policy intentions. But as we got nearer to that marker, things got more\ncomplicated. The fundamental truth of monetary policy is that decisions as large as when to\nraise rates cannot be based on a single indicator. Now that we’ve passed the 6.5 percent\nthreshold, it’s clear that the labor market is quite a ways from a complete recovery. And in the\nmeantime, the risks to the inflation outlook and financial developments also factor in to\ndecisions.\n8\n\nSo after our March meeting, the FOMC made a shift to qualitative, rather than\nquantitative, guidance. Specifically, the statement said it would base decisions on “a wide range\nof information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures\nand inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.”6\nWhen the FOMC does eventually begin to raise rates, there will be challenges. Most\nimportantly, the Fed’s highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the past five years\nmay exacerbate potential risks to financial stability. For example, interest spreads for risky\nassets such as junk bonds and leveraged loans have grown quite narrow. That suggests that\nfinancial market participants who are awash in liquidity may be ignoring or taking on outsize\npotential risks. These narrow risk spreads should be monitored closely, but for the near term,\nthey do not pose a significant threat to the economy or financial system. Similarly, the market\nfor Treasury securities seemed to be getting overly frothy early last year, with unusually low\nyields. Since then, however, yields have risen on 10-year Treasuries, and other long-term\nsecurities, such as mortgages, are back in better alignment with economic fundamentals.\nAnother challenge is that raising the funds rate, and the level of other short-term interest\nrates more generally, will be more complicated given the large amounts of bank reserves. But\njust as the Fed adapted to the financial crisis and recession by relying on unconventional tools,\nwe have new ways to adapt to normalizing policy. Most importantly, the Fed has conducted\nextensive tests of a “reverse repo” facility, in which it essentially lends out some of its Treasury\nsecurities and absorbs some of the excess liquidity in the market. This facility and similar tools\nwill enable tighter control of short-term rates when the economic recovery is strong enough to\nbring monetary policy back to normal.\n6 Board of Governors (2014).\n9\n\nConclusion\nTo sum things up: As the outlook continues to improve, the Fed is taking the first steps\ntowards normalization. The process will be gradual; it is not set in stone; and the Fed will\nrespond flexibly to economic developments. But barring any major shocks, monetary policy is\nfinally on the road to normal. And simply put, that’s good news.\n10\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 2002. “Deflation: Making Sure `It’ Doesn’t Happen Here.” Remarks before\nthe National Economists Club, November 21.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2014. “Press Release.” March 19.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140319a.htm.\nFriedman, Milton. 2000. “Keynote Address: Canada and Flexible Exchange Rates.” In\nRevisiting the Case for Flexible Exchange Rates, proceedings of a conference held by the\nBank of Canada, November. http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2010/08/keynote.pdf.\nLeduc, Sylvain, and Zheng Liu. 2013. “Uncertainty and the Slow Labor Market Recovery.”\nFRBSF Economic Letter 2013-21 (July 22). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/economic-letter/2013/july/us-labor-market-uncertainty-slow-\nrecovery/\nRudebusch, Glenn. 2014.

    "text": "Presentation to the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce\nPhoenix, AZ\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 15, 2011\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be with you in Phoenix this morning. I must tell you\nthough that I am a fervent San Francisco Giants fan, and I am still smarting from the way the\nDiamondbacks snatched the Western Division championship from us this year. But you invited\nme here to speak about the economy and the Federal Reserve. So I promise I’ll stick to my\nassigned subject for the rest of my remarks. I should note that these remarks represent my own\nviews and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe title of my talk is “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy.” I’ll sketch for you\nmy sense of where the economy is now, where it is going, and what the Fed is doing. As I see it,\nthe story is one of slow recovery from an especially severe financial crisis and recession,\npainfully gradual progress on unemployment, and receding inflation. It is a story that calls for\ncontinued action by the Federal Reserve to support a fragile economy.\nI’m happy to say that the most recent economic data offer signs that the recovery is on\nslightly firmer ground than it was earlier this year. Both consumers and businesses are\nincreasing their spending at a moderate pace. This firming can be seen in the performance of\ngross domestic product, or GDP, which is the total output of goods and services in the economy.\nIt was heartening to see that, in the July-through-September quarter, inflation-adjusted GDP\ngrew at a rate that began with a two—2.5 percent to be exact. That growth rate was moderate at\n1\n\nbest and a far cry from the rapid expansion we’ve often seen after recessions. But it was\nsignificantly better than the number for the first half of 2011, which began with a zero.\nYet I’m afraid that this recent improvement doesn’t change the basic story. The\nrecession of 2007 to 2009 ended nearly two-and-a-half years ago. But the recovery since then\nhas been notably lackluster and seems likely to continue in that vein. In fact, for many people,\nthe recovery hardly seems real at all. Unemployment has declined only about one percentage\npoint from its peak, millions of homeowners have lost their homes to foreclosure, and many\nmillions more are currently underwater.\nWhen we look at income, things are particularly tough. Personal income fell roughly 1¾\npercent in the July-through-September period after adjusting for inflation and taxes. So, if you\nor people you know are feeling squeezed, there’s good reason. The fact is, even with recovery,\ntens of millions of people are facing real hardship in the form of lost jobs, stagnant incomes, and\na harder struggle to make ends meet. One person told me recently that the fact the recession is\nover is immaterial because so many people are acting as if we were still in one.\nThe sluggishness of this recovery is distressing, but it’s not entirely unexpected. When\nwe study economies around the world, we find that recoveries are weak when they follow\nrecessions caused by financial crises.1 Now, we had a whale of a financial crisis in 2008. So it’s\nnot surprising that we have not had the sort of robust recovery that followed most other severe\nrecessions in the post-World War II period.\n1 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).\n2\n\nI’d like to look now at two factors holding back the recovery: slow growth in consumer\nspending and a depressed housing market. First off, and not to put too fine a point on it,\nconsumers feel lousy. Anxiety about the economic outlook has taken a heavy toll. Surveys of\nconsumers show pervasive gloom and confidence near record lows. One major consumer\nconfidence index has dropped to the levels posted in the depths of the recession.\nThere’s no shortage of reasons for consumers to feel anxious. The volatility in the stock\nmarket and the uncertainty in Europe have put many on edge. A large number of households are\nalso overloaded with debt, in part because home prices have crashed. And the lack of jobs leaves\nthose looking for work discouraged, and even makes those who are employed feel insecure.\nIndeed, only about one in ten households expect their income to rise over the next six months,\nwhich is near the all-time low in the 30 years people have been asked this question. With\nAmericans so demoralized, it’s not surprising that consumer spending has not played its usual\nrole in kick-starting a recovery. This year, inflation-adjusted consumer spending has been\ngrowing at just under a 2 percent pace. That’s well below the more normal recovery pace of\nabout 3 percent or more.2\nThe moribund housing market isn’t just a psychological blow to consumers. It is itself a\nmajor reason for the weak recovery. Past recoveries typically got a significant boost from a\nrebound in home construction and spending on home-related goods such as furniture, new\ncarpeting, appliances, and the like. Not this time though. Over the past three years, the pace of\nconstruction and sales of new homes have been stuck at the lowest levels recorded since the early\n1960s.\n2 See Glick and Lansing (2011) and Mian and Sufi (2011).\n3\n\nAs of September, over 3 million existing and new single-family homes were on the block.\nThat’s a big number. But to get a sense of how much of a weight is dragging down the housing\nmarket, we need to factor in what might be called a “shadow inventory.” This consists of\nanother 4 million or so homes either in foreclosure or whose owners are seriously delinquent on\ntheir mortgages. Many of those houses could come on the market soon.\nAt the same time, potential buyers aren’t buying for several reasons, even though\nmortgage rates are at record low levels. Millions of families are underwater on their current\nmortgages, making it hard for them to get out of their homes. Then too, credit is tough to get as\nlenders and regulators try to avoid the excesses of the boom years. Potential buyers face much\nhigher down payment and credit requirements than before the downturn. Finally, even some of\nthose who qualify for a mortgage may lose their nerve when they think about the steep drops in\nhouse prices in recent years.\nThis is a somber picture. But the housing market will eventually recover. Already, some\npositive trends are laying the groundwork. Home prices have dropped so much that they’re\nroughly in line with historical norms. We can see that in the relationship of the cost of buying a\nhouse versus renting one. The number of seriously delinquent mortgages in danger of\nforeclosure has begun to ease. And the recently announced federal initiative to make it easier for\nunderwater homeowners to refinance could trim monthly payments for some households. That\ncould reduce foreclosure rates—and eventually provide a modest boost to consumer spending.\nAs these factors fall into place, the housing market’s long-term dynamics should kick in.\nThe U.S. population continues to grow, which eventually will fuel housing demand. As demand\n4\n\nrecovers, home construction will return to more normal levels. I expect that process will take\nseveral years.3 But any pickup in construction will add momentum to the recovery.\nPhoenix is all too familiar with the miseries of the housing market. Arizona has been one\nof the states hit hardest. Foreclosures in the state peaked at a rate about double the national\naverage. And home prices in the Phoenix area have fallen by just over half since their 2006\npeak. That’s a remarkable collapse, without precedent in the more than 30 years that records are\navailable for the Phoenix area.\nFortunately, the Arizona market is doing somewhat better this year. The pace of existing\nhome sales was up noticeably during the first half of 2011. Meanwhile, since late 2009, the\nforeclosure pipeline has declined by nearly half. Housing starts remain at historically depressed\nlevels, but they ticked up in the third quarter. I’m hopeful that we have reached bottom and can\nmove up from here.\nI’d like to turn briefly to the business side of the economy. Manufacturing has continued\nto grow. And, after plunging during the recession, business investment in plant and equipment\nhas been a source of strength recently. Business investment surged in the third quarter, growing\nat just over a 15 percent annual pace. In addition, export growth has been relatively strong since\nthe recession ended.\nAt the same time though, surveys show that credit availability remains an obstacle for\nmany small businesses. To get financing, many business owners used to mortgage their business\n3 See Hedberg and Krainer (2011).\n5\n\nproperty. But this source has largely dried up since the crisis.4 Thus, there is a split between\nlarger corporations that can raise funds cheaply by tapping the capital markets and smaller\nbusinesses that rely largely on banks.\nI’ll finish my survey of the economy with a look at one of the most troubling aspects of\nthe recovery—the weakness of the job market. Job growth has been averaging only about\n125,000 a month this year, barely keeping up with the expansion of the labor force. The\nunemployment rate has been stuck around 9 percent, a level that can fairly be described as a\nnational calamity. Approximately 14 million people are classified as unemployed. Nearly a\nthird of them have been out of work for at least a year. This is a disturbing break from past\ndownturns, when spells of unemployment typically were short. I worry about what happens to\npeople who are out of work for such long periods. Not having a paycheck is bad enough. On top\nof that, they face an erosion of their job skills and a weakening of their attachment to the world\nof work.\nAt least three factors are keeping employers from hiring in earnest. First, and most\nimportant, businesses are reluctant to add many jobs until they feel more secure about the\nrecovery. Second, job creation at small businesses has been unusually slow, reflecting tight\ncredit and weak demand for their products and services.5 Finally, governments at all levels are\naggressively cutting spending, which means layoffs and hiring freezes. Total government\nemployment is down by about 700,000 since early 2009 and prospects are for more of the same.\n4 Wilcox (2011).\n5 See, for example, Haltiwanger (2011).\n6\n\nI’d like to move now to my outlook. My forecast projects that the growth we saw in the\nthird quarter will continue in the months ahead. The sharp slowdown during the first half of the\nyear was at least partly due to temporary factors. The big run-up in global oil and commodity\nprices held back consumer spending and business investment. In addition, the Japanese\nearthquake and tsunami disrupted U.S. auto production by making it harder to get parts. More\nrecently though, commodity prices have retraced some of their gains and the auto supply chain\nsituation has improved.\nI anticipate that real GDP will grow in 2012 at about a 2¼ percent pace and pick up a bit\nin 2013 to around 3 percent. Unfortunately, such growth will not be enough to make significant\nprogress on unemployment. I see the jobless rate dropping only a bit from its current level of 9\npercent to around 8¾ percent by the end of 2012 and reaching 8 percent at the end of 2013.\nMy forecast of sustained moderate growth stems in part from improving financial\nconditions, which seem likely to continue. Interest rates are at historic lows and corporations are\nflush with cash. Lenders are gradually relaxing their grip on credit. Meanwhile, those strained\nhousehold finances I spoke of are improving as consumers save more and pare down debt. And\nthe housing market has nowhere to go but up.\nStill, this is by no means an upbeat forecast. An important reason is that I think our\nability to produce goods and services isn’t growing at the rapid rate it was a few years ago. Of\ncourse, economies around the world have a natural tendency to expand as new technology is\nintroduced and workers become better educated. But there is evidence that, at this juncture, the\ngrowth of the productive potential of the U.S. economy has slowed.\n7\n\nResearch at the San Francisco Fed has identified a number of factors behind this\nslowdown. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw impressive gains in the productivity of U.S.\nbusinesses, reflecting the spread of information and communications technology.6 Those gains\nstarted slowing in the middle of the past decade, even before the recession. Then, during the\ndownturn, businesses slashed investment in more efficient plants, equipment, and technology.\nInvestment has been recovering, but we’re still feeling the aftereffects of earlier cutbacks.\nMeanwhile, high unemployment has caused the skill set of the workforce to deteriorate. Taken\ntogether, these factors have at least temporarily held down the economy’s natural tendency to\nexpand—and that’s reflected in my very moderate growth forecast.\nI should point out that there are risks that could cause growth to be even less than this\nforecast. The biggest risk comes from Europe, which has been facing a serious financial crisis.\nSeveral countries that use the euro as their currency have been struggling to make payments on\ngovernment debt. Greece in particular appears unable to meet its obligations. What’s more,\nworries about Greece have forced countries such as Spain and Italy to pay high interest rates on\ntheir borrowing. Some European financial institutions hold large quantities of Greek\ngovernment bonds and could face serious losses if the Athens government defaulted. The danger\nis that losses from a Greek default could spread to other euro area countries, possibly triggering\nthe kind of financial panic we saw in 2008.\nThe recent agreement by European leaders to write down Greek debt, recapitalize\nEuropean banks, and back up vulnerable economies has raised hopes that the crisis can be\nmanaged. However, there are still many political and economic obstacles to implementing an\n6 Basu and Fernald (2008).\n8\n\neffective plan. The outcome matters very much to the United States. A financial panic in\nEurope would probably cause serious disruptions in U.S. financial markets. Indeed, a San\nFrancisco Fed analysis indicates that the probability of another U.S. recession over the next 12\nmonths increases significantly when the European situation is factored in.7\nLet me turn to inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation has picked up\nmarkedly in 2011 to nearly a 3¼ percent annual rate through September. At the end of 2010, the\nrate was about 1¼ percent. The current inflation rate is well above the objective of about 2\npercent that most Fed policymakers indicate they prefer.8 However, the spike in inflation largely\nreflected temporary circumstances, which have already receded. I expect the inflation rate to\nease to around 1½ percent in both 2012 and 2013.\nHigher inflation earlier this year stemmed largely from a run-up in oil and other\ncommodity prices, as well as higher prices for some imported goods. The impetus came largely\nfrom developing countries such as China, which have enormous appetites for raw materials.\nMore recently though, downshifts in U.S. and European growth have reduced commodity price\npressures. Since the spring, these prices have dropped noticeably. Meanwhile, there is no sign\nin the United States of upward pressure on wages. Nor have we seen any evidence that the\npublic or financial market participants expect inflation to move to a higher plane. In this kind of\nenvironment, high unemployment and weak consumer demand should keep prices in check.\n7 See Berge, Elias, and Jordà (2011).\n8 See the longer-run projections for PCE inflation at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20111102.pdf..\n9\n\nSo what is the Fed doing now? Over the past few years, faced with an economy that is\nperforming far below its potential, the Fed has taken extraordinary action to boost growth. That\neffort is ongoing. Let me put it in context.\nCongress has assigned the Fed two goals: maximum employment and price stability. As\nI’ve said, I expect inflation to subside somewhat below the level most consistent with price\nstability. And clearly, with unemployment at 9 percent, we are falling far short of maximum\nemployment. During the recession, Congress and the White House increased federal spending\nand trimmed taxes to stimulate the economy. The emphasis has now shifted to controlling\nspending and reining in the federal budget deficit. Controlling the federal deficit over the long\nrun is vital to our economic health. But, at this point, government austerity means that we are\nunlikely to see much economic stimulus from fiscal policy at this juncture. Under these\ncircumstances, it’s vital that the Fed use a full range of tools to achieve its mandated\nemployment and price stability goals.\nThe Fed affects the economy by influencing short- and long-term interest rates. Our\nusual tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks pay to borrow from each other on\novernight loans. It serves as a benchmark for other short-term interest rates and indirectly\ninfluences longer-term rates as well. We have had the federal funds rate close to zero since late\n2008, so there is not much more we can do with it now. But that doesn’t mean that we have\nnothing left in our toolbox. The Fed has put in place several so-called unconventional monetary\npolicy tools over the past three years. These include large purchases of longer-term securities\nissued by the U.S. government and mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In\n10\n\naddition, we’ve made explicit statements laying out future Fed policy. Such statements can\nthemselves be effective tools at influencing interest rates and broader financial conditions.9\nOur unconventional policies are aimed at reducing longer-term interest rates. For\nexample, when we buy large quantities of Treasury securities, we increase demand for those\nsecurities. That boosts their price and lowers their yield. As the yields on Treasury securities\ncome down, other longer-term interest rates also tend to fall, reducing the cost of borrowing on\neverything from mortgages to corporate debt. We started buying longer-term securities during\nthe financial crisis in late 2008 and early 2009. And we followed with another round of\nsecurities purchases beginning late in 2010. Longer-term interest rates are measurably lower\nbecause of these programs.\nAfter our August policy meeting, the Fed announced our expectation that we would keep\nthe federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels through mid-2013. Such announcements can\naffect financial market expectations of where interest rates will be in the future, which in turn\naffects interest rates today.\nAt our September meeting, we put in place another unconventional policy. Under this\nprogram, the Fed will buy $400 billion in Treasury securities maturing in six years or more and\nsell an equal amount of Treasuries maturing in three years or less. The program should provide\nadditional help in bringing down longer-term interest rates, and it won’t increase the overall size\nof our securities holdings.\n9 Williams (2011).\n11\n\nTo summarize, the Fed has already pushed short-term interest rates about as low as we\ncan. Our unconventional policies are aimed at creating additional economic stimulus by pushing\ndown longer term rates as well. None of these are cure-alls for our economic ailments. But they\nare helpful. Growth is faster and unemployment lower than they would be without these\nprograms. And we have so far avoided an outbreak of deflation—that is, falling prices—that\nwould have made an already bad situation even worse.\nLooking ahead, our monetary policy actions will depend on how the outlook for the\neconomy and inflation develop. If economic conditions improve much more rapidly than\nexpected or if inflation shows signs of taking off, we have the tools to tighten monetary policy as\nneeded. But, I fear the more likely situation is one of continued moderate growth, persistently\nhigh unemployment and undesirably low inflation. In that case, additional monetary policy\naccommodation—either in the form of additional asset purchases or further forward guidance on\nour future policy intentions—may be needed to bring us closer to our mandated objectives of\nmaximum employment and price stability. Thank you very much.\n12\n\nReferences\nBasu, Susanto, and John Fernald. 2008. “Information and Communications Technology as a General-\nPurpose Technology: Evidence from U.S. Industry Data.” FRBSF Economic Review 2008, pp. 1–\n15. http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/review/2008/er1-15.pdf\nBerge, Travis J., Early Elias, and Òscar Jordà. 2011. “Future Recession Risks: An Update.” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2011-35 (November 14).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-35.html\nGlick, Reuven, and Kevin J.

    "text": "Panel discussion at the NBER Conference\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 18, 2013\nLessons from the Financial Crisis for Unconventional Monetary Policy\nGood afternoon and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be on this panel. The main theme of\nmy remarks is the critical importance of research in designing and implementing unconventional\nmonetary policies since the financial crisis. I hope this isn’t a controversial thesis. Nonetheless,\nI should note that, as always, my remarks represent my own views and do not necessarily reflect\nthe views of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn response to the financial crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered\nthe federal funds rate to essentially zero in December 2008 and has kept it there ever since. The\nFOMC then turned to several “unconventional” monetary policies, such as large-scale asset\npurchases (LSAPs) and forward guidance. In my remarks today, I’d like to focus on the lessons\nwe’ve learned about these unconventional policies and their prospective role going forward.\nBefore the financial crisis, almost everything we knew about unconventional monetary\npolicy came from studies of the Japanese “lost decade” and a few scattered episodes in the U.S.,\nsuch as Operation Twist in the 1960s. The conventional wisdom at the time seemed to be that\nlonger-term bond purchases didn’t have much effect on longer-term yields. As the financial\ncrisis unfolded, however, central banks became willing to give large-scale bond purchases a try.\nIn late 2008, the Federal Reserve announced it would purchase a large quantity of agency debt\nand mortgage-backed securities, and the announcement of this program had a striking effect on\nlonger-term yields and mortgage rates. In January 2009, the Bank of England followed suit and\nannounced its own asset purchase program, which similarly had sizable effects.\n1\n\nOne of the early key lessons from the financial crisis is that asset purchases can be a very\nuseful monetary policy tool at the zero lower bound. The success of these announcements led to\na flurry of research on the efficacy of asset purchases at the Federal Reserve, at other central\nbanks, and in academia. Table 1 summarizes the results from a number of research papers.\nAlthough individual estimates differ, this analysis typically suggests that $600 billion of Fed\nasset purchases lowers the yield on 10-year Treasury notes by around 15 to 25 basis points.1 To\nput that in perspective, that’s roughly the same size move in longer-term yields one would expect\nfrom a cut in the federal funds rate of ¾ to 1 percentage point.\nNevertheless, I don’t see LSAPs as being part of the FOMC’s toolkit once we leave the\nzero bound behind us. We’re still much less certain about their effects than we are about the\neffects of changes in the federal funds rate. According to Brainard’s classic analysis, the more\nuncertain you are about the effects of a policy tool, the more cautiously you should use it.\nInstead, you should rely more on other instruments in which you have greater confidence.2 We\nhave decades of experience using the federal funds rate as the main tool of monetary policy and\nwe have a reasonably good understanding of how it affects the economy. Given this\nunderstanding and the predictability of the effects of conventional policy, the short-term interest\nrate remains the best primary tool for future monetary policy.\nLet me turn to our second main unconventional monetary policy tool: forward guidance.\nBefore the crisis, we knew that a large majority of the effects of FOMC announcements could be\nattributed directly to FOMC statements, rather than to changes in the federal funds rate.3 In 2003\nand 2004, the FOMC experimented with forward guidance in the FOMC statement, using\nphrases such as, “The Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a\n1 See, for example, Gagnon et al. (2011), Joyce et al. (2011), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011, 2012),\nVayanos and Vila (2009), Hamilton and Wu (2011), Christensen and Rudebusch (2012), Swanson (2011), Li and\nWei (2013), and D’Amico and King (2013).\n2 See Brainard (1967).\n3 See Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005).\n2\n\nconsiderable period.” In December 2008, this qualitative forward guidance was dusted off and\nused again, when the FOMC stated that it expected to keep the funds rate low “for some time.”\nDespite this qualitative forward guidance, however, financial market participants’ policy\nexpectations were consistently much tighter than the FOMC’s own outlook. From 2009 to mid-\n2011, expectations from financial markets and surveys such as Blue Chip consistently showed\nthe fed funds rate lifting off from the zero bound within just a few quarters, as can be seen in\nFigure 1. This bias persisted despite the efforts of many FOMC members to communicate the\nseverity of the downturn and the resulting need for highly accommodative monetary policy for\nquite some time.\nTo push back against these excessively tight expectations, the FOMC made its forward\nguidance more explicit. In August 2011, we announced that economic conditions were “likely to\nwarrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.” As can be\nseen in Table 2 and Figure 1, this announcement had a dramatic effect on financial market\nexpectations. It caused an immediate 20 basis point drop in longer-term yields and a jump in the\nnumber of quarters the public expected the funds rate to remain at the zero bound. This\nquantitative forward guidance was extended further in January 2012 to “late 2014” and again in\nSeptember 2012 to “mid-2015,” also with significant effects (Table 2).\nThis leads me to a second lesson from the financial crisis for monetary policy, which is\nthe importance of clear communication. To add transparency and clarity to our communication\nof the likely future path of policy, the FOMC also began reporting participants’ projections of the\n“appropriate path” of the federal funds rate, as well as their projections for output,\nunemployment, and inflation. These projections are released four times a year. These\nprojections should make it easier for the public to understand both the likely future path of policy\nand the underlying factors driving our decisions.\n3\n\nThis past December, the FOMC took another step toward greater transparency by clearly\ntying its forward guidance to the state of the economy. We said we were likely to keep the funds\nrate near zero “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent,” and as long\nas inflation is not expected to exceed 2½ percent over the next year or two and inflation\nexpectations remain anchored. This should help the public understand that monetary policy\ndepends primarily on the performance of macroeconomic variables such as unemployment and\ninflation, rather than on some preset course. This “state-based” forward guidance is still a\nrelatively new experiment in FOMC transparency, but it has already proven to be an effective\ncommunication tool, focusing public attention on economic milestones in contemplating future\npolicy decisions.\nThat said, I expect that the explicit link between future policy actions and specific\nnumerical thresholds, as in the recent FOMC statements, will not be a regular aspect of forward\nguidance, at least when the federal funds rate is not constrained by the zero lower bound. This\nguidance has proven to be a powerful tool in current circumstances, when conventional policy\nstimulus has been limited by the zero lower bound. But such communication is difficult to get\nright and comes with the risk of oversimplifying and confusing rather than adding clarity.\nTherefore, in normal times, a more nuanced approach to policy communication will likely be\nwarranted. I see forward guidance typically being of a more qualitative nature, highlighting the\nkey economic factors that will affect future policy actions. Of course, if we again find ourselves\nin a situation where conventional policy has reached its limits, then we will have the ability to\nreturn to more explicit forward policy guidance to provide additional monetary stimulus.\nLet me conclude by saying that the experience with unconventional policies illustrates the\ncritical importance of research in guiding the design and implementation of monetary policy.\nBefore the financial crisis and recession, unconventional policies were still mostly theoretical\n4\n\nconcepts on the drawing board, untested on the battlefield. Once they were deployed,\nresearchers from across the globe mobilized, quickly filling the vacuum regarding what works\nand what doesn’t work. This knowledge has been essential for central banks in shaping policies\nto maximize their effectiveness. Thank you.\n5\n\nTable 1\nEmpirical estimates of LSAP effects\nEstimated Effect of\nStudy Sample Method $600B LSAP\n(±2 stderrors if avail.)a\nModigliani-Sutch(1966, 1967) Operation Twist time series 0 bp (±20 bp)\n400 bp (±370 bp),\nBernanke-Reinhart-Sack (2004) Japan, U.S. event study\n40 bp (±60 bp)\nGreenwood-Vayanos (2008) post-War U.S. (pre-crisis) time series 14 bp (±7 bp)\nKrishnamurthy-Vissing-Jorgensen (2011, 2012) post-War U.S., QE1, and QE2 time series 15 bp (±5 bp)\n30 bp (±15 bp),\nGagnon-Raskin-Remache-Sack (2011) QE1 event study,time series\n18 bp (±7 bp)\nsecurity-specific event\nD’Amico-King (2013) QE1 Treasury purchases 100 bp (±80 bp)\nstudy\nHamilton-Wu (2011) U.S., 1990 -QE2 affine no-arbitrage model 17 bp\nHancock-Passmore(2011) QE1 MBS purchases time series depends,roughly 30 bp\nSwanson (2011) Operation Twist event study 15 bp (±10 bp)\nJoyce-Lasaosa-Stevens-Tong (2011) U.K. LSAPs event study,time series 40 bp\neffect of U.S. QE1 on foreign\nNeely (2013) event study 17 bp(±13 bp)\nbond yields\nevent study, affine\nChristensen-Rudebusch (2012) QE1, QE2, andU.K. LSAPs 10 bp\nno-arbitrage model\nD’Amico-English-Lopez-Salido-Nelson (2012) U.S., pre-crisis weekly time series depends,roughly 45 bp\nevent study, affine\nBauer-Rudebusch (2013) QE1, QE2 16 bp\nno-arbitragemodel\nLi-Wei (2013) U.S., pre-crisis affine no-arbitrage model 26 bp\naSources: Modigliani-Sutch(1966, Sections 3-4), Bernanke-Reinhart-Sack (2004, Table 7, Figure 6, and author’s calculations), Greenwood-Vayanos(2008, Table 2), Krishnamurthy-Vissing-\nJorgensen (2011, Section 4), Gagnon et al.

    "text": "Presentation to NYU Stern School of Business\nNew York, NY\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 25, 2016\nRules of Engagement\nGood afternoon. While not many people coming from California would say they were\ndelighted to experience East Coast weather in February, I am in fact happy to be here—Professor\nSchoenholtz and I have been talking about my coming here for years, but my calendar hasn’t\nallowed it until now. I was almost worried that there wouldn’t be anything interesting to talk\nabout by the time I got here.\nThat fear clearly didn’t come to fruition. And because there’s still so much attention on\nthe Fed and what we’re doing, I want to talk today about what’s normal for monetary policy. Not\nthe “new normal” that I and so many others invoke when we’re talking about the shape of the\neconomy after the recession. Rather, what’s normal in terms of the process—how I think about\nmaking policy, particularly now that we’ve started the process of raising rates. And I should\npause here to say that everything you’ll hear today is what I think—the views are mine alone and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat is normal?\nWe’ve had the first rise in rates, but it’s been a long time since they were above zero.\nHow do we look at things now and what does the future look like as we make decisions that\naffect the contours of the American economy?\nI spend a lot of time talking about being data dependent. I literally made T-shirts that say,\n“Monetary policy: It’s data dependent.” But there’s some confusion, because a lot of people take\nthis to mean that I’m just waiting for the next employment or inflation report. This is what\n1\n\nhappens when a Fed official tries to substitute economistese with real English. What I actually\nmean is that being driven by the data is about having a policymaking strategy. It’s about\nimplementing consistent and predictable behavior that is driven by the economy’s performance\nrelative to our goals.\nRules, rules, rules\nAs anyone who follows the Fed knows, there are a number of approaches we use to\ninform our policy decisions.1 The most famous is the Taylor rule and its variants, which have\nbeen the subject of a great deal of study and commentary.2\nThe Taylor rule looks at where inflation and output are today and uses a formula to reach\na recommendation on where rates should be. Basically, it says that for every percentage point\nincrease in inflation, you should raise rates by more than a percentage point. And when the\neconomy falls into recession, you should lower rates.\nWhat’s striking about the Taylor rule is that it doesn’t incorporate forecasts or other\ninformation about the economy. It doesn’t take into consideration why inflation is low or where\nwe think the economy will be in two years. You don’t need hundreds of economists deciphering\nall the data and putting together elaborate forecasts. You simply focus on two key data points\nthat describe where we are today. An analogy may help: The Taylor rule says that to drive this\ncar, all you need to do is steer. Just stay in your lane—you don’t need to think about every aspect\nof road conditions or what’s coming miles down the road.\nThat sounds pretty straightforward. But there are a number of problems you run into.\nFirst is that crucial elements of the Taylor rule are the normal, or “natural,” levels of\neconomic activity and interest rates. This means knowing what the economy looks like—in terms\n1 See, for example, Board of Governors (2010).\n2 See Taylor (1993), Levin, Wieland, and Williams (2003), Taylor and Williams (2011), and Yellen (2012).\n2\n\nof GDP, employment, the unemployment rate, interest rates—when it’s running on all cylinders.\nThese natural rates play an important role in the Taylor rule, but are hard to know with any\ncertainty, and they change over time. Let me give you an example: Two years ago, I put the\nnatural rate of unemployment at about 5½ percent. But as more data came in, I reassessed, and\nnow see 5 percent as natural in the post-recovery economy. One of the hallmarks of data\ndependency is that natural rates can and do shift over time.\nThe same holds true for interest rates. The Taylor rule assumes that the long-run normal\ninterest rate is fixed forever. However, evidence is building that the new normal for interest rates\nis quite a bit lower than we’ve been accustomed to in recent years.3 Economists have a concept\ncalled the “neutral” funds rate—that is, a federal funds rate that balances monetary policy so that\nit’s neither accommodative nor contractionary. Hence the “neutral.” The longer-run neutral rate,\ncalled r* (pronounced “r-star”), is essentially what the inflation-adjusted rate of interest will be\nonce the economy’s back to full strength. This can sound confusing, since the Fed sets the\nfederal funds rate. But the neutral rate is a function of the economy, not policy; we can align the\nfunds rate with r*, but we don’t control its underlying level.\nThe point is that these natural, or neutral, levels of economic activity and interest rates\nchange over time in ways that are often unpredictable, and a steadfast rule that assumes that they\nare fixed can lead you astray.\nA second issue is what is called the “zero lower bound.” That is, interest rates can’t move\nmuch below zero. Why does this matter? Because standard monetary policy rules would have\nprescribed interest rates well below that mark during the recession and recovery. In fact, one\nversion of the Taylor rule would tell us that, in the depths of the recession, interest rates\n3 Laubach and Williams (2015), Williams (2015b).\n3\n\nshould’ve been –5 percent.4 Research shows that strict adherence to the Taylor rule in the\npresence of the lower bound carries with it considerable costs in terms of stabilizing the\neconomy and maintaining price stability.5\nOn the other end of the spectrum from the Taylor rule is something called “optimal\ncontrol.” Here, you punch your targets into the computer—I want inflation to be 2 percent, I\nwant the unemployment rate to be 5 percent—along with a baseline view of the economic\noutlook for the next several years. The computer is programmed with a detailed model of the\neconomy and calculates, with all the available information, what path for interest rates will get\nyou as close to your target as possible, period by period, over the next several years. To use the\noptimal control method, you need a detailed model of how the economy works and forecasts of\nevery aspect of where you think it’s headed.6 The polar opposite of the Taylor rule.\nThe optimal control approach puts a great deal of emphasis on the fact that monetary\npolicy works, to cite the great Milton Friedman, with long and variable lags.7 Monetary policy\ntakes at least a year or two to have its full effect, so we need to think about where we’re going\nand plan for that.8 It also accounts for headwinds, such as the impact of oil prices, volatility in\nChina, and the effect of international developments on the dollar. It’s telling you how you should\nbe driving, when you should turn the wheel, when you should let up on the gas. Optimal control\nsays it’s not just about steering the car, it’s about planning for what’s coming ahead—there may\nbe hairpin curves or exit ramps or, in a worst-case scenario, a cliff with no guardrail. Without\nwarning signs or a map of the route, how can you best navigate the road?\n4 Rudebusch (2009), Williams (2009).\n5 Reifschneider and Williams (2000).\n6 Yellen (2012).\n7 Friedman (1961).\n8 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n4\n\nPut that way, it sounds like optimal control is preferable to a simple Taylor rule. On its\nface, most people would argue that accounting for potholes—and everything else—along the\nway is essential. So why don’t we just abandon these simple rules and embrace optimal control?\nThe answer is that, for all our intellect—and I’ll admit, economists are very sure their\ncollective intellect is almost too much for the world to handle—there’s a limit to how much we\ntruly know about the future. We have forecasts, which are based on sound data and analysis. But\nthey’re only forecasts, and the unexpected can always erupt. I don’t have a 100 percent degree of\ncertainty where housing prices are going. I don’t know for sure what’s going to happen with\nChina. I wouldn’t bet my life on what the ECB or Bank of Japan is going to do. We may think\nwe have it all figured out, but sometimes economists’ track records leave something to be\ndesired. So there is a risk with the optimal control approach that we’ll believe our theories and\nour models too much, and that can lead us astray.9 There is a need for humility and to recognize\nour limitations.\nIf Taylor rules are too rigid and optimal control relies too much on perfection, is there a\nGoldilocks approach? One that looks ahead and adapts to changing circumstances, but doesn’t\nrely on the omniscience of economists?\nSomething called “difference rules” fit that bill. Personally I am a big fan of difference\nrules, for a couple of reasons. First, I’ve written a lot about them, and nothing pleases economists\nmore than being able to talk about their own research.10 Second, this same research finds that\nthese rules perform well in a wide variety of circumstances and are particularly suited for the\nlower bound.11\n9 Orphanides and Williams (2008), Levin and Williams (2003).\n10 Orphanides and Williams (2002, 2006), Orphanides (2003).\n11 See also Tetlow (2015).\n5\n\nThe key to the success of difference rules is that they don’t prescribe the level of interest\nrates, but the change in them. According to difference rules, if inflation is expected to be higher\nthan the desired level, you raise interest rates; if unemployment is rising, you lower interest rates.\nNothing else enters into the calculation—not the natural level of economic activity or the neutral\ninterest rate. That means that they don’t rely on these hard-to-measure and changing concepts.\nInstead, they simply monitor the data in a way that keeps the economy on track.\nOne rule to rule them all?\nNow, despite the lengthy explanation of the differences between variants of monetary\npolicy rules and optimal control—and there are differences—the bottom line is that they’re not\nthat different. They’re driven by the same factors. If the economy is in recession or inflation is\nundesirably low, all of them will say that interest rates should be low. Where they differ is in\nwhat they take into account and how they weigh different factors.\nSo it would be easy to propose, as many people have, that we pick one approach or rule\nand stick to it. Proponents of this view say that having a set rule helps in communicating our\nintentions. It offers clarity and predictability about what the Fed is doing and why. It also, to\nsome extent, “holds the Fed to account”—that is, we have a rule to follow and if we don’t, we\nhave to explain our thinking.\nI don’t object to this in principle at all—I think central banks like the Fed have become,\nand should continue being, more open about policy rules and analysis. Several countries now\npublicly share these kinds of analyses: The Riksbank in Sweden, for instance, and the Norwegian\nNorges Bank.12 It just means being open and transparent about the thinking and analysis that go\n12 See their websites: http://www.riksbank.se/en/Press-and-published/Published-from-the-Riksbank/Monetary-\npolicy/Monetary-Policy-Report/ and http://www.norges-bank.no/en/Monetary-policy/.\n6\n\ninto monetary policy and how policymakers come to the conclusions they do. So I shouldn’t\nobject to having a set rule to follow, to offer the public more clarity, right?\nIf only life were that simple.\nAs the preceding discussion highlighted, while each of these policy strategies has value,\nthere is no consensus about which one works best. The truth is that there is no absolutely right\nrule. They’re all just different ways to think about policy, and to come to a truly educated\ndecision, it helps to look at the range of options. That is exactly what I do. I don’t focus\nexclusively on one rule, but examine a wide variety, hoping to glean insights and commonalities\nby comparing prescriptions from different approaches. In this regard, I favor an eclectic\napproach, recognizing that policy is always made with a high degree of uncertainty and one\nshouldn’t place all their bets on one approach.\nWhile I understand the impetus behind wanting a single rule to follow, it’s just not ready\nfor prime time.13 It reminds me of the FDR quote that rules aren’t necessarily sacred, principles\nare.\nRules and perspectives\nFundamentally, what all these approaches do is help us think about policy, and the\nabundance of perspectives is important. The Fed is unique among central banks in the way we\nare organized. And one of the benefits of that structure is that it brings together 19 people with\ndifferent backgrounds, different experiences, and different opinions. There is a lot of\ndisagreement among policymakers and economists about what works best. Trying to pigeonhole\nall of them into one rule runs counter to the federated structure of the Fed that seeks to\nincorporate a diversity of views. Operating under one rule would mean losing the richness that’s\nfundamental to our success.\n13 Williams (2015a).\n7\n\nTalking through different viewpoints and thought processes ensures that we’re truly\nlooking at the economy through the correct lens, and vigorous debate means no one’s operating\nby knee-jerk reaction. This is why we can’t just be replaced by a monetary policy robot, tempting\nas that might sound.\nRules and discretion in action\nAll of this helps to explain the recent Federal Open Market Committee decision to raise\nrates, and our expectation that the subsequent increases will be gradual.\nI get asked a lot why the Fed raised rates when inflation was not just low, but when it had\nbeen persistently below target for some time. This decision is actually a good illustration of the\nuse of various approaches to thinking about monetary policy.\nBoth the basic and modified Taylor rules would call for an immediate increase in rates,\nmostly because we’re so close to our maximum employment goal. On the other hand, some\npeople would call for waiting to act until we see the whites of inflation’s eyes. The far reaches of\nthe spectrum get brought together because we’re also considering the difference rule and optimal\ncontrol, which take forecasts into account in varying degrees, and because there are currently 17\nvoices in the room—who’ve spent the previous week debating the same issues with their own\nstaffs of PhD economists. The fact that we raised rates when we did is an example of how ideas\nand instructions from all points on the playing field can come together in thoughtful, well-\ndebated consensus.\nMy own view is that it was time. The economy has been showing solid momentum, the\nrecovery was well into its seventh year, and I’m someone who takes forecasts into account. I\nexpect to see U.S. GDP growth of about 2¼ percent for 2016, unemployment edging down\nfurther below my estimate of the natural rate, to about 4½ percent by late in the year, and\n8\n\ninflation—despite the stubbornness it’s shown—to move back up to our 2 percent goal within the\nnext two years. All of which argue for getting on the normalization track.\nI also expect this to be a gradual process. This reflects the fact that the economy still\nneeds a gentle shove forward from monetary policy, as we continue to navigate some\nheadwinds—like weakness abroad—and their effects, particularly on the dollar and commodity\nprices. It also reflects my wish to take things slowly, to be able to adjust to circumstances and\ndata as they come in. These projections take into account the headwinds, low growth, and low r*\nthat come out of our models and are incorporated into the optimal control paths.14\nAgain, this highlights that I give importance to forecasts, but am perfectly aware of their\nfallibility. And that the three things I’m most driven by are data, data, and data.\nConclusion\nSo there you have it. The Fed uses a number of approaches to help us think about the\neconomy and monetary policy—they’re all insightful, they’re all useful, and they’re all a part of\nthe debate. But none is absolutely fail-safe. They will continue to be part of the discussion, but\nthe idea that we should follow only one—never deviating from the path—is ill-advised.\n14 Williams (2016).\n9\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2010. “Report to the FOMC on Economic Conditions\nand Monetary Policy.

    "text": "Presentation to CFA Society Hawaii Annual Economic Forecast Dinner\nHonolulu, Hawaii\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on March 5, 2015\nThe View from Here:\nThe Economic Outlook and Its Implications for Monetary Policy\nGood evening and thank you. It’s truly a pleasure to be here. I was just in New York\nwhere the temperature was in the teens. I can unequivocally state that I prefer it here in Hawaii.\nWhat I’d like to do tonight is give you the 30,000-foot view: the economic outlook of the\ncountry as a whole and how I view the trajectory of monetary policy in that context.\nEconomists rarely make definitive statements—we usually add dozens of modifiers and\ncaveats, which is why a typical sentence can run to about 90 words. But I feel comfortable\nsaying in the absolute that 2015 is going to be a very interesting year for monetary policy.\nNow is probably a good time to deliver the usual disclaimer that the views expressed here\ntoday are entirely my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nIf you’re a Fed-watcher, you know they don’t reflect the views of some of my\ncolleagues….\nThe outlook\n1\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate of full employment and price stability, and our aim is to set\nmonetary policy that best achieves both those goals.\nStarting with employment, the U.S. Congress mandated a goal of “maximum\nemployment”…though it didn’t actually define precisely what that meant. Which is a good\nthing—it means we have to think hard about what the right employment level should be in a\nhealthy economy, examine the data, and use economic analysis based on a number of factors,\nrather than aiming for an arbitrary or potentially anachronistic target. Most economists—\nincluding me—think about maximum employment in terms of the unemployment rate. When the\neconomy is at full strength, the unemployment rate is somewhere between 5 and 5½ percent. My\nview, to be precise, is that 5.2 percent is the right number.\nWe’re obviously getting much closer to our target of full employment. The\nunemployment rate was 5.7 percent in January, though for clarity’s sake, I should note that I’m\ndelivering these remarks less than 10 hours before the new numbers for February will be\nannounced. In any case, it’s dramatically lower than the 10 percent peak we saw at the height of\nthe Great Recession. In addition to the falling unemployment rate, we’re seeing exceptional job\ngrowth and improvement across multiple labor market indicators. They all tell the same story:\nThat the U.S. economy and labor market are on the mend and closing in on the full employment\ngoal. My view is that we will reach maximum employment by the end of this year, if not sooner.\n2\n\nIndeed, given the momentum in the economy, there’s a good chance we could see the\nunemployment rate fall below 5 percent sometime later this year or next year.\nI’ve been in this job for four years now, which have not exactly covered the cheeriest of\neconomic times. In the early days, it was hard not to feel like a harbinger of doom when I took\nthe stage at events like this. So it’s a very, very welcome day that I can stand here and say that\nwe’re closing in on our maximum employment goal.\nTurning to our second mandate, price stability, we again use a range of economic\nanalyses to determine our goal because Congress—again in its infinite wisdom—didn’t specify\nwhat, exactly, “price stability” should mean. We, meaning the Federal Open Market Committee\nor FOMC, define it as a 2 percent inflation rate over the medium term. Not every month, not\nevery year, but on average we want 2 percent inflation, based on the most comprehensive\nmeasure of prices of consumer spending. Currently, that number is well below our 2 percent\ngoal. In fact, it’s been below 2 percent for the past few years.\nIn that context, how do I see the future of our price stability mandate unfolding? Despite\nthe current low rate of inflation, I’m actually quite confident that we’ll be able to reach our 2\npercent target within the next few years. This—as my inbox makes clear—provokes the\nquestion of why I expect that inflation will pick up, considering that it’s been persistently low for\nso long.\n3\n\nMy answer is that, with the U.S. economy improving and unemployment falling to quite\nlow levels, I expect wage pressures to build and price pressures to return to more normal levels\nover the course of the next two years. There are also significant near-term factors currently\npushing inflation down that I expect to be transitory: falling import and energy prices due to\nglobal economic developments and the decline in oil prices.\nTaking those in turn: First, wage and price pressures. One of the reasons people question\ninflation’s momentum is that wage growth has been extremely sluggish. In a normal cycle, when\nthe economy picks up, wage growth follows—and that hasn’t happened yet. But there are\nreasons for that.\nMy research staff has been studying a feature of the last recession with the charming title\n“downward nominal wage rigidity.” In essence, employers were loath to cut wages during and\nafter the Great Recession. As a result, wages have remained stagnant to make up for the pay cuts\nthat never came, but businesses wanted to impose.1 As the economy picks up, these pent-up\nwage cuts will dissipate, the gap will close, and we should see wages start to rise more strongly.\nThis reflects the broader tendency for a lag between the “cause” of the economy\nrebounding and the “effect” of wage inflation.2 If past is prologue, as Shakespeare wrote, we\nshould look to prior recessions, which have followed the same pattern: one in which wage\ngrowth doesn’t really start to pick up until the economy nears full employment. As I said earlier,\n1 Daly and Hobijn (2015).\n2 Daly and Hobijn (2014).\n4\n\nthat’s in sight, and I expect wages to start moving up as we get closer; but given historical\nprecedent and economic patterns, I’m not surprised that we haven’t seen that movement yet. As\nthe unemployment rate goes from the mid-5s down to the low 5s over the rest of the year, we’re\ngoing to see a labor market that’s much stronger, which will spur wage and price growth, which,\nin turn, will overwhelm some of the other factors that have been pushing inflation down—which\nI’ll turn to now.\nThe first is falling import prices. Europe, China, and Japan, the biggest economies\noutside the United States, are all experiencing disappointment in growth and inflation. With the\nexception of the U.S. and a handful of other countries, the global economic outlook has\ndarkened. That has led to strong policy actions, both by central banks and governments abroad,\nto stimulate their economies.\nSo what happens when you have weakness abroad and those central banks are trying to\nstimulate their economies? One effect is that it causes their currencies to fall in value relative to\nthe dollar. This is a standard function of monetary policy, and I should point out that the strength\nof the dollar relative to other currencies reflects the weaker economic conditions in those\ncountries compared to the U.S.\nThe end result is that the U.S. dollar has increased in value over the past year, which has\nlowered the prices we pay for imported goods and services, which in turn has pushed down the\nU.S. inflation rate.\n5\n\nThe second is energy—I don’t have to tell anyone here that oil prices have plummeted.\nAnd that’s having an enormous impact because energy is a significant part of the consumer\nspending basket. So as gasoline and other energy prices have come down sharply, they’ve also\nlowered the inflation rate.\nWhat do I think of these two factors? It’s something of a personal tenet that\npolicymakers have to be very careful about not reacting to short-term fluctuations in commodity\nor other import prices. Instead, I take a perspective that looks one or two years ahead—research\nshows that’s the minimum amount of time it takes for monetary policy to have its full effect.3\nWhat I’m considering, as a policymaker, is what effect those factors that are currently\nunfolding—movements in the U.S. economy, weakness abroad, oil prices—will have not this\nweek or this month, but later this year and in 2016 and 2017. Given that lag between the\nimplementation of policy and its full effect, the question should be: What’s the path we’re on and\nwhat’s the right monetary policy for that path?\nHistory and experience show that energy price swings leave an imprint on inflation in the\nshort term, but don’t affect underlying inflation rates over the medium term.4 The same holds\ntrue for movements in the exchange value of the dollar: They obviously affect inflation in the\nshort run, but they don’t have much of an impact further down the road.5\n3 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n4 Evans and Fisher (2011) and Liu and Weidner (2011).\n5 Gust, Leduc, and Vigfusson (2010).\n6\n\nI’m therefore looking at underlying rates of inflation, not just the month-to-month\nmovements, but the fundamental trends. Fed economists are frequently accused of neither eating\nnor driving, because we like to look at what we call “core” inflation, which excludes food and\nenergy prices. For the average consumer, those matter a lot—you can’t really talk about what a\ndollar can buy if you don’t look at those products. But for economic trends, and for guiding\nmonetary policy, measures of inflation that remove the most volatile components, like core\ninflation, or something called the “trimmed mean” inflation,6 give a better lay of the land.\nWhat I see when I look at the data that strip out the short-term volatility is an economy\nthat’s got a good head of steam and is getting close to full employment and an inflation trend\nthat’s running about 1½ percent based on the trimmed-mean measure. That’s why, as things\ncontinue to get better, I see the strengthening domestic economy overwhelming the energy and\ncurrency valuation impacts, and inflation gradually moving back to 2 percent.\nInflation expectations from business and consumer surveys are generally consistent with\nthat forecast. On the other hand, financial markets are sending mixed signals, with declining\nyields on inflation-indexed securities suggesting that inflation expectations may have fallen. It’s\nalways important to listen to what financial markets are saying. But it’s also important to note\nthat the research shows the meaning of these movements is not definitive.7 And while markets\nare important, interpreting their fluctuations is not a substitute for the economic research and\n6 See http://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce/index.cfm.\n7 Christensen, Lopez, and Rudebusch (2010) and D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014).\n7\n\nanalysis we look to when thinking about economic developments and determining appropriate\npolicy.\nIn a nutshell: Things are looking better—in fact, they’re looking downright good. The\neconomy is showing solid momentum and there’s good news in virtually every sector. I expect\ngrowth to be just under 3 percent in real GDP nationwide. I see the continued improvements in\nthe economy pushing wages and prices up, and inflation moving back toward its target. And, as\nI said, I expect to reach full employment by the end of the year.\nImplications for monetary policy\nOf course, what everyone wants to know is what all this means for monetary policy.\nI personally still think it’s appropriate to start the process of normalizing monetary policy\nthis year. “Normalizing policy,” as we all know, is code for “raising interest rates.” The exact\ntiming for that is going to depend on the data—I cannot emphasize enough, by the way, that our\ndecisions are data-driven. I say it in every speech, every interview, every conversation…. The\ndata may push us a little further in one direction or another, and there will be a lot of discussion\nand debate. But assuming that things unfold along the lines I’ve forecast, I think that by mid-\nyear it will be the time to have a serious discussion about starting to raise rates. I’m not making\na prediction about what the Fed will do; I am saying that in my view, it would be appropriate to\nstart seriously weighing the pros and cons of taking action at that time. This is a good thing:\nAfter all, the economy’s improved a lot, unemployment’s coming down, and we may be able to\n8\n\nstart cutting back on accommodation because of that strength. Of course, the one thing that\nwould change my view would be if the data contradicted the forecast I laid out today.\nNot everyone agrees, of course. There are a number of people who think we should wait\nuntil inflation is very close to, or has crossed, the finish line. They’re mainly worried that raising\nrates too soon would allow inflation to fall further and possibly derail the recovery. The\nargument is: What’s the rush? Why not get as much evidence as possible that your forecast is\nright?\nThe case for extensive patience certainly has valid points, and esteemed supporters, so let\nme explain my position.\nFirst, it’s important to remember that I’m not talking about instituting tight policy, I’m\ntalking about taking a first step in pulling back somewhat on what is a very high degree of\naccommodation. To use an over-worn, but accurate, analogy: There’s a difference between\neasing off the gas and applying the brakes. Monetary policy has been extremely stimulative for\nthe past six-plus years, and it’s going to remain so for quite some time. Even after we start\nraising interest rates they will be very low and the Fed’s $4 trillion-plus balance sheet will\ncontinue to provide substantial stimulus. So no one should worry that we’re pulling the rug out\nfrom underneath the economy.\n9\n\nSecond is the factor I mentioned previously: Monetary policy, as Milton Friedman\nfamously reminded us, has long and variable lags.8 As I said, it usually takes a year or two for\npolicy to have its full effect. As a result, policy must be forward-looking. When you’re driving\ntowards a stoplight, you don’t keep your foot on the accelerator; you ease off so you’re ready to\nstop at your target. Otherwise you slam on the brakes—and probably wind up in the middle of\nthe intersection.\nThe data convince me that inflation will move back up to our target as the economy\nstrengthens and we close in on full employment. Nearing our goal means easing up on the gas.\nBy waiting until we’re face-to-face with 2 percent inflation, we could drastically overshoot the\nmark—winding up in that metaphorical intersection or even fully running the red light.\nOvershooting our target would force us into a much more dramatic rate hike to reverse course,\nwhich could have a destabilizing effect on the markets and possibly damage the economic\nrecovery. The decision to raise rates is actually three decisions: Not just when, but how quickly\nand how high. I see a safer course in a gradual increase, and that calls for starting a bit earlier.\nIt’s been posited by some that the risk of overshooting the inflation target is minimal,\nbecause inflation is so low and is unlikely to accelerate quickly. I’ll offer a counterpoint to that,\nfrom a time in U.S. history when things looked similar to the snapshot today: In 1965, when the\nFed was debating whether to tighten policy, core inflation was 1¼ percent, labor costs were\n8 Friedman (1961).\n10\n\ngrowing relatively slowly, and the unemployment rate was about one-half percentage point\nabove the estimate of maximum employment at that time.\nOnly 18 months later, core inflation was over 3 percent, labor cost growth had more than\nquadrupled, and the unemployment rate was down three-quarters of a percentage point—the\neconomy was on a tear. I’m not predicting that this will happen today, but it’s a reminder of just\nhow fast things can change when the economy is strong.9\nThe Fed has a lot of decisions ahead, and people have a lot of opinions about those\ndecisions. I’m sure I’m going to hear some of them in Q&A.... But the attention shouldn’t just\nbe focused on what the Fed’s going to do, because there’s also the story that’s unfolding\nglobally: the policy decisions in Japan, Europe, and elsewhere will spill over to other economies\naround the world.\nNow I’ve talked a lot about my forecast and what I expect to happen. Of course, events\nrarely follow the script. There are downside risks to the forecast—mostly related to\ndevelopments abroad. And there are upsides as well, for example, we could have another year of\nbetter-than-expected job growth.\nTypical economist, always with a caveat.\nBut also typical of an economist, I’ll be watching the data and the decisions that are being\nmade, and not just relying on a forecast.\n9 See Orphanides and Williams (2013) for a discussion of monetary policy during this episode.\n11\n\nAnd that’s really the message here, my mantra: Decisions are data-driven.\nThe data convince me that we’ll close in on maximum employment by the end of the\nyear. The data convince me that as we do, wage and price pressures will rise. The data convince\nme that as that happens, it will push inflation up, and we’ll meet our target in about two years.\nThe data convince me that lags in monetary policy mean acting before we reach our goals, not\nwhen we reach them, to avoid overshooting the targets. And that means the data convince me\nthat the time is coming when we’ll be making our first steps down the road to normalization.\nThank you.\n12\n\nReferences\nChristensen, Jens, Jose Lopez, and Glenn Rudebusch. 2010. “Inflation Expectations and Risk Premiums\nin an Arbitrage-Free Model of Nominal and Real Bond Yields.” Journal of Money, Credit, and\nBanking 42(s1), pp. 143–178.\nDaly, Mary C., and Bart Hobijn. 2014. “Downward Nominal Wage Rigidities Bend the Phillips Curve.”\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking 46(s2), pp. 51–93.\nDaly, Mary C., and Bart Hobijn. 2015. “Why Is Wage Growth So Slow?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2015-\n01 (January 5). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2015/january/unemployment-wages-labor-market-recession/\nD’Amico, Stefania, Don Kim, and Min Wei. 2014. “Tips from TIPS: The Informational Content of\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Security Prices.” Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Finance and\nEconomics Discussion Series working paper 2014-24.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201424/201424abs.html\nEvans, Charles L., and Jonas D.M.

    "text": "Comments prepared for the conference “A Just Society: Honoring Joseph Stiglitz”\nColumbia Business School, New York, NY\nJohn C. Williams\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nOctober 16, 2015\nThe Rediscovery of Financial Market Imperfections\nThis conference is a fitting way to recognize Joe Stiglitz’s numerous accomplishments\nand profound contributions across the field of economics as a researcher, a teacher, and a\nrenowned figure not just within the academic community, but in the public arena as well. My\nremarks will focus on one small subset of Joe’s vast body of research, that which deals with\nfinancial market imperfections and the macroeconomy. My perspective is from my seat at the\nFederal Reserve, both as an economist and policymaker. Before I go any further I have to state\nthat the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nIn thinking about this topic, I am transported back 25 years to one spring day at Stanford,\nmy first class of Joe’s first-year graduate macroeconomics course. The required text was Olivier\nBlanchard and Stanley Fischer’s Lectures on Macroeconomics, which, I should add, cost a\ncredit-constrained graduate student a bundle. Joe began the lecture with the offhand remark that\nhe assigned this book only so we could see what mainstream macro looked like, but in this\ncourse we were going to learn how the economy really worked. For the next ten weeks we were\nimmersed in theories of imperfect information, moral hazard, adverse selection, credit rationing,\nand all the reasons the economy did not live up to the textbook description.\n\nRecall that this was happening at a time when much of the academic macroeconomics\nprofession was eschewing the Keynesian in favor of the frictionless, perfectly competitive,\ncomplete information, real business cycle theories. Joe was decidedly swimming against the tide.\nBut with his enthusiasm, passion, and conviction, you’d never have known it.\nSome perspective on this situation is useful. Back in the mid-1960s, when Joe started his\nresearch career, there was a growing appreciation that financial markets and the economy did not\nconform to the Arrow-Debreu ideal. This is reflected in the Fed’s own macroeconometric model,\nthe MPS model developed by Franco Modigliani at MIT, Albert Ando at Penn, and Fed\neconomists in the late 1960s.1 The model featured a detailed accounting of the balance sheets of\nfinancial institutions and included important roles for credit rationing in the monetary\ntransmission mechanism to housing and household wealth on consumption. Admittedly, the\nprimary justification for credit rationing was not market failure, but the extensive regulations,\nincluding Regulation Q, that led to bouts of disintermediation and credit constraints in housing\nfinance.\nDuring the ensuing years, academic macroeconomic theory increasingly jettisoned these\ncomplications and confined itself to the fundamental determinants of financial conditions and\naggregate spending, such as changes in technology. In the real business cycle (RBC) and related\napproaches, researchers fully took on board the arbitrage-free approach to pricing assets and\ndelinking asset prices from economic decisions. This process culminated in the development and\nwidespread use in central banks of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models.\n1 Brayton et al. 1997.\n\nEarly DSGE models wholly abstracted from asset pricing, bank lending, and all other aspects of\nthe financial system.2 All financial flows were assumed to circulate effortlessly.\nAt the Fed, we were slow to abandon our tried-and-true models and jump on this\nbandwagon. In large part, this reflected the need to have models that are empirically relevant—\nthat “fit the data”—so they are useful for forecasting and quantitative analysis. But it also\nreflected the human capital developed in the institution that valued insights and perspectives that\nwere no longer in vogue.\nIn the early 1990s, around the time I joined the Fed, the staff at the Board of Governors\ndeveloped a new macroeconometric model, dubbed FRB/US.3 It eliminated most of the balance\nsheet apparatus designed to deal with Regulation Q and the explicit modeling of the banking\nsector. However, it did incorporate links between imperfections in financial markets and\neconomic decisions. For example, the central role of internal financing was recognized through a\ncorporate cash flow channel on investment. Similarly, household credit constraints were modeled\nas rule-of-thumb consumers. Although asset price risk premia were modeled in very stylized\nways, they did feed into consumer and business spending decisions.\nThis was the state of play when financial markets started to set off alarms in 2007. To an\noutside observer, it might appear that we at the Fed were armed with macro models that were\nsimply ill-equipped to diagnose the ills that beset the economy or devise effective treatment\nplans. And that would be half true. But, it would ignore the most important asset we had (well,\nbesides the monopoly franchise to create unlimited amounts of reserves): The in-depth\nknowledge of the theories of financial market imperfections that Joe and many others had\n2 See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 2005.\n3 Reifschneider, Tetlow, and Williams 1999.\n\ndeveloped over the preceding 40 years. Many economists and policymakers at the Fed—\nincluding then-Chairman Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen—were steeped in the literature that had\nits intellectual roots in this research.\nAs events unfolded, I was struck by the immediate translation of abstract theoretical\nmodels to the real world. Despite the fact that the trend in macro for decades was to abstract\nfrom these issues. Despite the fact that many of the early problems were in capital markets or the\nshadow banking system, rather than traditional commercial banking. Despite the fact that many\ntheoretical models focused on the nonfinancial business sector’s decisions to invest and produce,\nwhile, at least in the early stages, the real-world problems were centered in financial firms. I\ncould imagine Ben Bernanke thinking, “I have seen this before and I know what it means.”\nAlmost overnight, Fed economists and policymakers pivoted to applying the insights and tools\nthey were taught—in many cases, back in graduate school—to understand what was going\nwrong, why, and what could be done to fix it.4\nThree insights of the theoretical literature were key. First, owing to various information\nand market imperfections, the degree of credit rationing and its effect on the economy depends\non the state of the world. Constraints that in “good” times may not bind and therefore may be\ninvisible can have huge consequences during a period of stress. Second, financial and economic\ndecisions depend on perceived probabilities of default. When those probabilities rise, panic sets\nin and everyone hunkers down—even those who should, in principle, feel safe—and economic\nactivity collapses. Third, under extreme circumstances, these effects are so acute that credit is\nunavailable at any market price.\n4 Bernanke 2015.\n\nAll of these ideas owe their intellectual roots to the research on asymmetric information\nand financial market frictions that started back in the 1960s and was developed over the\nsubsequent 40 years.5 The details and names differed—whether it was called “the financial\naccelerator” or “credit rationing”—but the insights that grew out of this extensive line of\ndecades-long research shaped our understanding of events and the policy responses that\nfollowed.\nThree policies are particularly noteworthy in this regard. First, in addition to discount\nwindow lending to banks, the Fed used its emergency lending powers to provide liquidity to\nprimary dealers and commercial paper markets, money market mutual funds, and securitization\nmarkets in response to parts of our credit markets shutting down.6 Second, working with the\nother key regulatory agencies and the U.S. Treasury, the Fed’s first stress tests, or Supervisory\nCapital Assessment Program, forced the largest banks to have adequate capital reserves in a\nseverely adverse economic environment. This program was designed to overcome the private\ninterest in avoiding stock dilution and assure that banks were far away from risk of insolvency,\nand thereby ready and able to get credit flowing again.\nThird is monetary policy. Standard textbook theories saw little benefit from balance sheet\npolicies. But, going back to the work of Jim Tobin, some economists had highlighted the\npotential for balance sheet policies to affect the economy in the presence of financial market\nimperfections. The aggressive use of purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and\nlonger-term Treasury securities, more commonly referred to as quantitative easing (QE), became\n5 See, for example, Stiglitz and Weiss 1981, Bernanke and Gertler 1989, Greenwald and Stiglitz 1993, Kiyotaki and\nMoore 1997, and references therein.\n6 See Williams 2011 for a summary.\n\na critical and powerful tool of monetary policy.7 These purchases worked by pushing up prices of\nTreasuries and MBS and related assets, fostering financial conditions that supported stronger\neconomic growth. Although these effects were not in our off-the-shelf models, economists at the\nFed and elsewhere quickly ramped up analysis and found ways to incorporate these effects in\nmodels and to analyze the effects of policy actions.8\nThis period of seat-of-the-pants analysis and cobbling together models with financial\nfrictions has morphed into an extensive research program on the theory and empirics of financial\nmarket imperfections. Indeed, Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) find that financial risk premium\nshocks are a major driver of economic cycles. Macroeconomists are busy building models that\nincorporate these frictions in a variety of ways.9 Much of this research is still fairly rudimentary.\nNonetheless, it represents an exciting rediscovery of the importance of financial market frictions\nin macroeconomics.\nTo sum up, we have, to some extent, gone full circle in bringing institutional details and\nmarket imperfections into macro thinking and models in the past 50 years. That brings me to a\nconversation I had with a colleague a while ago. When I explained that my macro teachers at\nStanford were Bob Hall, Tom Sargent, John Taylor, and Joe, not to mention my LSE professors\nChris Pissarides, Charlie Bean, and Richard Layard, he quipped that he now understood why I\nwas so confused about macroeconomic principles. But what I have learned in the past 20 years is\nthat this eclectic approach to studying the economy is the greatest gift my teachers gave me. And\nwe did end up using Blanchard and Fischer’s book in a later class, so that investment paid off in\nthe end as well. More generally, having economists with diverse perspectives at the Federal\n7 See D’Amico et al. 2012 and Williams 2014 for summaries.\n8 See, for example, Gagnon et al. 2011, Chung et al. 2012, Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero 2012, and references therein.\n9 Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno 2010 and Clerc et al. 2015\n\nReserve—who learned from inspiring teachers like Joe Stiglitz—has served us and our country\nwell over these very difficult past eight years and will continue to do so in the future.

    "text": "Presentation to the National Association for Business Economics\nSan Francisco, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 9, 2013\nBubbles Tomorrow and Bubbles Yesterday, but Never Bubbles Today?1,2\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be here at NABE’s 55th annual meeting. Your organization\nhas done as much as any to support the profession and promote discussion of the most important\neconomic questions of our time, so it’s a privilege to join you.\nIn my talk this morning, I will focus on an issue that has fascinated and perplexed\neconomists for centuries—asset price bubbles. Obviously, the events of the past two decades\ndemonstrate that this topic is not merely of academic interest. Asset price booms and busts\ndistort the course of the economy and can leave enormous economic wreckage in their trail. In\nconsidering this topic, I’ll start by reviewing the basics of asset price theory. I’ll then highlight\nsome striking inconsistencies between theory and evidence in standard models of asset prices.\nI’ll then explore some recently developed theories that may help explain why bubbles sometimes\nform and why they crash. And I’ll close with some speculation about the implications for\nmonetary and macroprudential policy. I should add that my remarks represent my own views\nand not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWe economists like to explain things using highly stylized models. We build make-\nbelieve worlds, populate them with creatures that act according to strictly prescribed rules, and\n1 I want to thank Kevin Lansing and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 The title is a reference to Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, by Lewis Carroll (1871). The\nWhite Queen offers Alice “jam every other day” as an inducement to work for her:\n“I’m sure I’ll take you with pleasure!” the Queen said. “Two pence a week, and jam every other day.”\nAlice couldn’t help laughing, as she said, “I don’t want you to hire me—and I don’t care for jam.”\n“It’s very good jam,” said the Queen.\n“Well, I don’t want any to-day, at any rate.”\n“You couldn’t have it if you did want it,” the Queen said. “The rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday—but\nnever jam to-day.”\n1\n\nanalyze what happens. Or, as my wife said after I described one of my research papers to her:\n“You really never did stop playing Dungeons and Dragons, did you?” The thing is, most of the\ntime, this approach works remarkably well. Often, the simplest model—with patently unrealistic\nassumptions—yields the keenest insights into how a market or an economy works. Without\ndoubt, Occam’s razor has proven to be a most valuable item in the economics toolkit.\nUnfortunately, asset prices have proven less amenable to this kind of treatment. A\ncursory reading of the academic literature on asset prices reveals a litany of puzzles,\nconundrums, paradoxes, and anomalies. Much of the research on asset prices continues to rely\non highly stylized models with identical agents, rational expectations, and optimizing behavior.\nAccording to the prevailing view, asset price surges that many would perceive to be bubbles are\nnot really so. Instead, they are seen to reflect the influences of fundamental forces, such as a\ndecline in risk appetite. This reminds me of the White Queen in Through the Looking-Glass,\nwho says jam will be given every other day, but never today. Adherents of this view may admit\nthat bubbles have occurred in the past—like the dot-com boom and bust. And they may even be\nwilling to accept that bubbles are something to worry about in the future—say, in financial\nsupervision. But, in practice, they are never willing to find a bubble in the present. There’s\nalways a reason why what looks like a bubble, walks like a bubble, and quacks like a bubble is\nnot actually a bubble. But, as I’ll discuss in a moment, this is changing. Recent research not\nonly recognizes that asset price bubbles really do form, but also holds great promise in unlocking\ntheir secrets and identifying them.\nLet’s now consider standard asset price theory, according to which the price of an asset\nequals the discounted expected return of holding the asset for one period. For example, take a\nshare in a corporation. The return consists of two parts: the dividend payment the owner\n2\n\nreceives and the capital gain or loss from selling the share. The same formula applies to owning\na house or a bond, or any asset for that matter. For the house, the dividend payment is the\nservice flow the owner derives from living in it or renting it out. For the bond, it is the coupon\npayment. According to this theory, three variables can affect asset prices: the discount factor, the\ndividend payment, and the expected future price appreciation.\nIt helps to simplify things a bit further. Under certain assumptions, including the absence\nof bubble-like behavior, Myron Gordon developed over 50 years ago an illuminating way of\npresenting this asset price formula. He noted that the ratio of the asset price to the dividend\npayment is inversely related to the difference between the expected future rate of return and the\ngrowth rate of inflation-adjusted dividends.3 That is, all else equal, the price-to-dividend ratio\nshould be high when expected future dividend growth is high or when the expected future return\nto the asset is low. This is a classic case of an elegant and parsimonious theory. So, how does it\nstand up to the data?\nThe first hurdle the model faces is the long history of boom and bust cycles in a variety of\ndifferent asset prices. These were thoroughly documented by Robert Shiller in his book\nIrrational Exuberance.4 I’m an economist, so I need to show some numbers here. Figure 1\nshows two well-known recent U.S. asset price booms and busts. The solid blue line shows the\nprice-to-dividend ratio of the S&P 500 stock index from 1990 to the present. The dashed red line\nshows the time series of the house price-to-rent ratio from the CoreLogic home price index, in\nwhich the rent data are the Bureau of Economic Analysis data on owners’ equivalent rent. In the\nstock market boom of the late 1990s, the price-to-dividend ratio rose over 100 percent in the five\nyears up to the end of the boom in 2000. The recent housing boom was relatively tame by this\n3 Gordon (1959).\n4 Shiller (2005). Another must-read is Kindleberger’s Manias, Panics, and Crashes (1978).\n3\n\nstandard. The house price-to-rent ratio climbed around 50 percent during the five years before\nthe market peak in 2006. To put these numbers in perspective, according to flow of funds data,\nin the five years before they peaked, U.S. stock market wealth soared $12 trillion and housing\nwealth increased some $10 trillion.\nWhat does the Gordon model have to say about these and other large surges in asset\nprices? Two explanations are possible based on changes in economic fundamentals. One is an\nupward shift in the expected growth rate of future dividends. The second is a reduction in\ninvestors’ expected returns on the asset. Importantly, in standard asset pricing theory,\nexpectations of future dividend growth and future returns on assets are assumed to be rational.\nThat is, expectations are assumed to be consistent with the structure of the model.\nI’ll start with the first explanation, that a rise in the price-to-dividend ratio is caused by\nhigher expected dividend growth. The evidence on this is clear and negative. With respect to\nU.S. stocks, over history, the price-to-dividend ratio is uncorrelated with future real dividend\ngrowth.5 A similar pattern is seen with regard to the U.S. housing market. The price-to-rent\nratio is uncorrelated with future real rent growth.6 The international evidence is somewhat more\nmixed. But a recent cross-country study found that, in most countries, the correlation between\nthe house price-to-rent ratio and future real rent growth is either statistically insignificant or has\nthe opposite sign of that predicted by the theory.7 Indeed, in the most recent U.S. housing boom,\nthe high house price-to-rent ratio observed during the boom did not foreshadow subsequent high\nreal rent growth. In fact, the growth rate of real rents actually declined in the period following\nthe peak price-to-rent ratio. It’s simply not the case that asset price movements can be explained\nby shifts in rational expectations of future dividend growth.\n5 Cochrane (2008).\n6 Campbell et al. (2009) and Gelain and Lansing (2013).\n7 Engsted and Pedersen (2012).\n4\n\nSo that leaves the possibility that a lower expected return might be driving the increase in\nasset prices during a boom. The lower expected return could reflect a combination of lower\nalternative investment returns, say as measured by the general level of real interest rates, and/or a\nlower risk premium on the asset in question. As in the case of dividend growth, the evidence on\nexpected future real interest rates driving asset prices is negative. Equity dividend-to-price ratios\nare generally not correlated with future changes in real interest rates.8\nThus, expectations of future dividends or real interest rates fail to explain asset price\nmovements. Given that, standard approaches ascribe much of the variation in asset prices to\nmovements in the discount factor used to compute the present value of future dividends. This is\nthe logic of Sherlock Holmes, who said that, “when you have eliminated the impossible,\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”9 Time variation in the discount\nfactor is the only remaining rational explanation. However, on their own, you can’t really judge\nwhether movements in the discount factor are reasonable. After all, they are simply defined as\nthe residual component of an identity implied by the theory. In this regard, the discount factor is\nakin to total factor productivity, which Moses Abramovitz famously described as “a measure of\nour ignorance.”10\nMoreover, the explanation that the discount factor is the main driver of movements in the\nprice-to-dividend ratio has potentially falsifiable implications. In particular, it says that when the\nprice-to-dividend ratio is high, rational investors should expect a relatively low rate of return on\nthe asset. When valuations are low, rational expected returns should be high.11 For example, if\nrational investors discount future dividends by less, perhaps owing to a reduction in risk\n8 Campbell and Shiller (1988).\n9 The Sign of the Four by Arthur Conan Doyle (1890).\n10 Abramovitz (1956).\n11 Greenwood and Shleifer (2013).\n5\n\naversion, then the price-to-dividend ratio rises and we see a boom in the asset price. And the\nexpected future rate of return on the now higher-priced asset will be correspondingly lower.\nSo, are the data consistent with this prediction of the theory? One test is to compare real-\nworld measures of investors’ expected returns with the expected returns implied by the theory.\nFortunately, there are a number of surveys of investor expectations of future returns on stocks\nand houses that can be brought to bear on this question.\nLet me jump to the bottom line. The evidence from surveys of investors’ expected\nreturns is directly at odds with the implications of standard asset price theory. For one, stock\nmarket investors tend to expect high future returns when the price-to-dividend ratio is high,\ncontrary to the theoretical prediction of a negative relationship between rational expected returns\nand the level of asset prices relative to dividends.12 A picture tells the story. Figure 2 shows\nGallup survey results on the relationship between the S&P 500 price-to-dividend ratio and\ninvestor optimism regarding stock market returns over the next year. Gallup asks whether\npeople are optimistic, pessimistic, or neutral about future market returns. The figure reports the\ndifference between the number saying they are optimistic or very optimistic and those saying\nthey are pessimistic or very pessimistic. As the figure shows, periods of high stock valuations,\nsuch as the late 1990s and mid-2000s, are when investors were more optimistic regarding future\nstock gains. And during periods of relatively low valuations, such as the early 2000s and the\nperiod of the global financial crisis, investors had relatively low expectations of stock market\nreturns. The positive relationship between current stock prices and expected future returns is\nconsistent across a variety of surveys and alternative model specifications.\nThis same relationship is evident in data on house prices. Figure 3 plots the level of\nhouse prices and expected future house price appreciation in the United States over the past\n12 Greenwood and Shleifer (2013). Thanks to the authors for supplying data used in Figures 2 and 4.\n6\n\ndecade. Each data point represents one of four major cities in a given year.13 The pattern is\nclear. Optimism about future house price appreciation tends to increase when house prices are\nhigh. Just as with stocks, the survey evidence directly contradicts the fundamental story that\nhigh house prices can be explained by a decline in the rational expected return from\nhomeownership.\nLet me sum up my points so far. According to standard asset price theory, an increase in\nasset prices must reflect either an increase in expected future dividend growth or a reduction in\nthe expected return on the assets. We see large run-ups in equity and home prices. But they are\nnot associated with higher future dividend growth rates or lower expected returns based on\nsurveys. So far, this evidence is mainly destructive. But, in fact, a first step to understanding\nasset price bubbles can be found in the survey data I just discussed. The key is to relax the\nassumption of rational expectations and allow people’s decisions to be driven by their\nperceptions of what the future may hold.\nA striking regularity seen in the survey data is that expectations of future gains are highly\npositively correlated with past observed returns. That is, despite the admonition that past\nperformance is no guarantee of future results, people appear to assume exactly that in predicting\nfuture stock returns. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the Gallup survey of investor\noptimism about future stock market gains and the trailing 12-month change in the S&P 500 stock\nprice index. The correlation is strongly positive. Indeed, the worst reading for the investor\noptimism index for the period shown in the figure occurred in early 2009, just as the stock\nmarket plunged to its recession low. And the highest reading of investor optimism occurred in\nearly 2000, just before the tech stock crash. The evidence is compelling. People tend to\nextrapolate future stock price movements from recent stock price performance. This finding is\n13 Case, Shiller, and Thompson (2012).\n7\n\nconfirmed by econometric analysis that uses different measures of investor expectations and\ncontrols for various other factors.14\nThe same dynamic of extrapolative expectations also plays out in housing markets in the\nUnited States and abroad. Figure 5 shows the relationship between expected house price\nappreciation over the next year from surveys and the percentage change in house prices observed\nover the prior year for four major U.S. cities over the past decade. As in the case of stock prices,\nthe correlation is strongly positive. Figure 6 shows similar patterns for Norway and Sweden, two\nother countries that have experienced massive house price booms.15 Just as in the United States,\nwhen house prices go up, people expect them to continue to rise. And when they fall, people\nturn much more pessimistic about future house price appreciation.\nMany researchers are probing why people have the procyclical pattern of optimism seen\nin these surveys. One key element in the theories coming out of this research is that people do\nnot possess the full set of information assumed in the standard asset price model with rational\nexpectations. Instead, they must make do with the limited information at hand when judging\nlikely future discounted dividend payments and the future price of the asset. Indeed, a growing\nbody of evidence in behavioral economics and finance shows that people’s expectations of future\nasset returns depend on their past experiences.16 This process of forecasting with limited\ninformation has been shown to cause forecast errors that can drive a wedge between asset prices\nand the values implied by economic fundamentals.17\nThe recognition that people behave this way can move us a long way closer to\nunderstanding how asset price bubbles can emerge and how they can crash. To see this, let me\n14 Greenwood and Shleifer (2013).\n15 Jurgilas and Lansing (2013).\n16 Vissing-Jorgensen (2003) and Malmendier and Nagel (2011).\n17 Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1991) and Barsky and DeLong (1993).\n8\n\nreturn to the standard asset price formula. Recall that the price of an asset equals the value of its\ndividend plus the discounted value of the price at which you expect to be able to sell the asset. If\none then assumes that investors’ expected price appreciation of the asset depends positively on\nits recent past price change, this introduces a positive feedback loop into asset price dynamics\nthat is absent from the standard model assuming rational expectations. Indeed, a simple model\nof extrapolative expectations of future asset price movements does a very good job of explaining\nthe big swings in the U.S. stock price-to-dividend ratio over time.18\nThis principle has proven a good model of investor expectations. But a challenge to\nmodels based on extrapolative expectations is that they may create too much positive feedback in\nasset prices, producing excess volatility at odds with the data. Despite the failures of standard\nasset price theory, the price-to-dividend ratio is a good predictor of future excess returns on the\nstock market relative to the risk-free rate.19 That is, a high price-to-dividend ratio today predicts\nrelatively low average future stock returns. Therefore, for a model to succeed, it needs to allow\nfor procyclical investor optimism, while incorporating a self-stabilizing mechanism that\neventually stops and reverses this process, bringing prices back toward fundamental values. This\nis a delicate balance. One promising approach is to posit two types of traders, one with\nextrapolative expectations and the other that trades based on fundamentals.20 In a nutshell, the\ntraders with extrapolative expectations drive the procyclical optimism, while the fundamental\ntraders exert a stabilizing influence that keeps things from going completely off the rails.21\nResearchers have yet to coalesce around one preferred model. However, a common\ntheme in this literature is that the presence of a small amount of sand in the ability of people to\n18 Adam, Beutel, and Marcet (2013).\n19 Cochrane (2008).\n20 Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1990) and Greenwood and Shleifer (2013).\n21 For an alternative approach, see Adam et al. (2013).\n9\n\nprocess information can lead to large and sustained swings in asset prices, with significant\nrepercussions for the economy. An important implication of these models is that\nnonfundamental asset price movements do not represent exogenous “shocks” to the economy.\nRather, they are part of the endogenous behavior of the economic system. In particular, these\nasset price movements tend to amplify and propagate other shocks that occur within the system.\nThis recognition of the source of asset price movements means that work on monetary\nand macroprudential policies needs to refocus on how these policies may damp or amplify asset\nprice cycles, rather than how they should respond to asset prices per se. For monetary policy,\none implication of theories with endogenous asset price bubbles is that the time horizon over\nwhich policy affects the economy may be longer than typically thought. In particular, the policy\nresponse to cyclical movements in economic activity and inflation may have effects on investor\nbeliefs and the behavior of asset prices that reach well into the future.\nThe lesson from history is clear: asset price bubbles and crashes are here to stay. They\nappear to be a consequence of human nature.22 And the events of the past decade demonstrate\nthe enormous human costs of asset price bubbles and crashes.\nTo understand the past and avoid a recurrence of the devastating events we lived through\nso recently, we need to acknowledge that investors and financial markets do not behave the way\nrational asset price theory implies. We need to incorporate these channels into the models we\nuse for forecasting, risk analysis, and policy evaluation. This opens up a world where actions,\nincluding regulatory and monetary policy measures, may have unintended consequences—such\nas excessive optimism, risk taking, and the formation of bubbles—that are assumed away in\nstandard rational models.\n22 Kindleberger (1978).\n10\n\nOf course, this is a difficult task, and successful models are likely to be far more\ncomplicated than the simple and elegant rational models we have relied on in the past. But, it’s\nessential if we want to design policies that foster robust economic performance in the future.\nThank you.\n11\n\nFigure 1\nAsset Price Booms and Crashes\nRatio\n3\nS&P 500\nprice-to-dividend ratio\n2.5\n2\n1.5\nCoreLogic 1\nhouse price-to-rentratio\nNormalized to 1\n0.5\nin January 1995\n0\n90 92 94 96 98 00 02 04 06 08 10 12\nSources: CoreLogic,BEA, and S&P 500 data from Shiller (2005, updated).\nFigure 2\nStock Prices and Investor Optimism\n% Optimistic -% Pessimistic\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nFitted line\n-20\n-40\n-60\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nS&P500 Price-to-Dividend Ratio\nSources: Greenwood and Shleifer (2013), Wells Fargo/Gallup, and S&P 500 data from Shiller (2005, updated).

    "text": "Presentation to the CFA Hawaii Seventh Annual Economic Forecast Dinner\nHonolulu, Hawaii\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on March 1, 2012\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy1\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to participate in this event and to enjoy the beauty and\nhospitality of the wonderful state of Hawaii. Sadly, this is my first visit here in 25 years. In fact,\nthe last time I was here was back when I worked for a small business in the San Francisco Bay\nArea after I graduated from college. The business owner sent me on an all-expenses-paid, week-\nlong vacation as a reward for hard work. Throughout my career at the Federal Reserve, I’ve tried\nto convince my bosses of the productivity-enhancing benefits of such an enlightened\nmanagement practice. Unfortunately, I never succeeded. Now, as President of the San Francisco\nFed, it is my pleasant duty to visit all nine states in the 12th Federal Reserve District. I plan to be\ndiligent in fulfilling that duty. So, I assure you, it won’t be another 25 years till I’m back.\nIn my remarks this evening, I’m going to talk about the current state of the economy,\nwhere it’s headed, and what the Federal Reserve is doing to boost growth while keeping inflation\nlow. My remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nIt’s been over two-and-a-half years since the end of the worst recession of the post-World\nWar II period. The economy is growing, and the recent economic news has been increasingly\n1 I would like to thank John Fernald, Rob Valletta, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in the preparation\nof these remarks.\n1\n\npositive. This is very welcome progress, but it’s brought us only part of the way back.\nUnemployment remains a huge problem, and that means real hardship for millions of Americans.\nThe severe recession and subdued recovery have prompted the Fed to carry out a series of\nextraordinary policy actions to restore the economy to health. Most notably, we’ve kept our\nbenchmark short-term interest rate near zero for over three years. This aggressive Fed response\nis an important reason why the economy has moved to more solid ground. But, as I’ll explain,\nthe Fed’s job is not over yet. Far from it. Congress has assigned the Fed two goals: maximum\nemployment and stable prices. We have lots of work to do before we can say we’ve met those\ngoals. Looking at past deep recessions, you would have expected the economy to be doing much\nbetter than it is by now. Why has this recovery has been so lackluster? The reason has\neverything to do with what took place beforehand. We’ve had a wild ride—first a housing boom\nof epic proportions, then a housing bust, a near-collapse of the financial system, and a terrible\nrecession.\nLet’s go back to 2006, right before the recession hit. That marked the peak of an\nunprecedented run-up in U.S. home prices. But the bubble burst. Home prices plunged by over\n30 percent nationwide, and even more in states such as Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. As the\nhousing market went into a tailspin, about a quarter of borrowers found themselves owing more\nthan their homes were worth. Delinquencies and foreclosures surged.\nWith millions of mortgages going sour, financial institutions that had placed big bets on\nhome loans posted massive losses. It was like an epidemic. No one knew which financial\ninstitutions were infected with toxic assets. Everyone was suspect. Financial institutions were\nafraid to lend money to anybody, including each other. That choked off the flow of funds that\n2\n\nfinancial institutions and businesses depend on for their day-to-day operations. The result was a\nworldwide financial crisis.\nIf left unchecked, this kind of financial panic could have ushered in an economic\ncataclysm like the Great Depression, when 25 percent of the workforce was out of work. Why\ndidn’t we plunge into the abyss? A key reason was that the Federal Reserve did what it was\nsupposed to do. The Fed is the nation’s government-chartered central bank. And one of the most\nimportant duties of a central bank is to safeguard the financial system. In a crisis, that means\nacting as lender of last resort, supplying emergency loans to financial institutions when normal\nfunding isn’t available. The U.S. Treasury Department and other federal agencies were also\ndoing all they could to shore up the financial system.\nNow, I know that this financial support to big banks and Wall Street firms made many\npeople irate, especially when so many Americans were losing their jobs or their homes. We\nshould remember, though, that ordinary people suffer terribly when the financial system breaks\ndown. The ultimate goal of our programs was to avert a major depression and much higher\nunemployment.\nBecause of these programs, we were able to avoid a meltdown of the financial system and\nhead off a depression. But we couldn’t prevent a terrible recession. The shock waves from the\nburst housing bubble and the financial crisis were simply too great.\nAs it happens, it’s normal that severe recessions and sluggish recoveries follow financial\ncrises.2 Research at the San Francisco Fed and other places shows that downturns following\nfinancial crises are much more severe when the preceding expansions had unusually rapid\n2 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).\n3\n\ngrowth of credit and leverage.3 When the credit pendulum swings, it takes many years for\nhousehold and business spending to return to normal. And, in fact, there was extraordinary credit\ngrowth before the recession. Between 1999 and 2006, housing debt more than doubled.4\nSo it’s not so surprising that we got an anemic rebound. The financial crisis unleashed\npowerful forces that have damped spending and sapped the recovery of its vigor. I’ll mention\nthree. First, it destroyed a huge amount of household wealth. Second, it flattened the housing\nmarket. Third, it made it hard for businesses and households to get credit. Let’s look at each of\nthese.\nFirst, when house prices collapsed, the wealth of American households plunged by about\nsix-and-a-half trillion dollars. That equals more than 40 percent of the total size of the U.S.\neconomy. Many people went from feeling rich to feeling poor, with neither the means nor the\nwill to spend. Instead, they became intent on repairing their finances by increasing their saving\nand trimming their debt. In other words, they deleveraged. During the recession, the household\nsaving rate climbed to about 6 percent of income from about 1 percent. It’s still about 4-1/2\npercent. In the long run, higher saving is healthy. But, in the near term, it puts a brake on\nspending and slows growth.\nSecond, the depressed housing market has been a drag on growth. Home construction\nplays an important role in the economy, of course. When you add in items that often go with a\nnew home—things such as furniture, carpets, and appliances—you’re talking about a significant\n3 Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2011).\n4 Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2010).\n4\n\nfraction of overall economic activity.5 Today, there are still millions of homes in foreclosure, and\nmillions more on the verge. All those distressed properties are acting like a weight keeping home\nprices from rising. The result is that new home construction and sales are still near the lowest\nlevels recorded since the early 1960s.\nTight credit is a third powerful force holding back the recovery. Lenders who were too\nquick with a loan in 2006 have turned very cautious. Consumers who lack gold-plated credit\nscores and cash for a hefty down payment find it tough to get a mortgage. That limits home sales\nand refinancing. Fortunately, there are signs that credit conditions are easing a bit. Already,\ncorporations that can sell securities have great access to capital.\nThese three forces—household finances, housing, and credit—are likely to hold down\nspending growth for some time. But let me emphasize, though—overall, things are getting\nbetter. You can sense greater optimism out there—albeit cautious optimism.\nLet’s look then at the positive side of the ledger. Little by little, households are repairing\ntheir finances. Businesses are gradually increasing production and hiring. The housing sector\nappears to have stabilized and is showing some signs of life. Consumer spending, which\nrepresents close to 70 percent of all economic activity, hasn’t been growing fast, but it’s been\ngrowing steadily. More motor vehicles were sold in January than in any month in nearly four\nyears. The growth in consumer spending is also evident here in Hawaii. Last year was the best\nfor tourist visits since 2007.\nExports have consistently been a bright spot for the economy over the past few years.\nOverseas demand for American products continues to grow. This increase has been rapid to our\n5 See, for example, Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011) and Feroli et al. (2012) for analysis of the effects of the\nhousing crash on the economy.\n5\n\nNorth American trading partners, and also to emerging economies of East Asia, including China.\nIndeed, exports are one reason U.S. manufacturers have been creating jobs at a pace not seen\nsince the 1990s.\nGross domestic product, or GDP, measures the nation’s total output of goods and\nservices. After adjusting for inflation, GDP grew at less than a 1 percent annual rate in the first\nhalf of 2011, dragged down by temporary factors, including the surge in oil prices, and the\nJapanese tsunami. Growth picked up to about 2¼ percent in the second half of 2011 as those\ntemporary factors receded. My forecast calls for GDP to rise about 2¼ percent this year and 2¾\npercent in 2013. That’s not rip-roaring by any means. But it’s an improvement.\nI’m especially encouraged by the good news from the job market. In the past four\nmonths, the unemployment rate has fallen about three-quarters of a percentage point. It’s now at\nits lowest level in nearly three years. All the same, the kind of moderate economic growth I\nforecast won’t keep bringing the unemployment rate down quickly. That rate is currently 8.3\npercent. I expect it to remain over 8 percent into next year and still be well over 7 percent for\nseveral years to come. If my forecast is correct, the unemployment rate will have stayed at or\nabove 8 percent for more than four years. Such a long period of unemployment above 8 percent\nhas not happened in over 70 years.\nFor its part, inflation has been relatively contained. The prices of oil and other\ncommodities did surge early last year in the face of strong global demand. This caused the\noverall inflation rate to rise above our 2 percent target. Oil prices have run up again recently, and\nhave returned to their peak levels from last spring. As far as other commodity prices are\nconcerned, we haven’t seen a similar surge. With the economy still underperforming and wage\n6\n\ngrowth modest, inflation should remain subdued. I expect inflation to be about 1¾ percent this\nyear and to be about 1½ percent next year, down from about 2¾ percent in 2011.\nThere’s a risk the economy could do worse than this moderate forecast. The main threat\nis the debt crisis in Europe. The latest news from that continent is somewhat reassuring,\nalthough more severe turmoil is still possible. Once again, European leaders have found a short-\nterm fix to Greece’s problems. Hopefully, that will prevent the situation from spinning out of\ncontrol and igniting a wider financial crisis in Europe.\nIn addition to the actions of European political leaders, central banks have been actively\nsupplying liquidity to the European banking system. The Fed set up temporary currency swap\nlines with several foreign central banks last November. These lines allow those central banks to\nborrow dollars and, in turn, lend those dollars to banks in their countries. In addition, the\nEuropean Central Bank has provided hundreds of billions of euros in three-year loans to\nEuropean banks. These actions have defused concerns about the ability of European banks to\nrenew credit when their debts come due. In this way, Europe has avoided what could have been\na massive credit crunch as banks pulled back lending sharply. I don’t need to remind you that, in\ntoday’s interconnected world, financial turmoil in Europe would definitely hurt our economy as\nwell.\nEven if the European crisis doesn’t flare up again, growth is slowing in many parts of the\nworld. Many European countries already appear to be in recession, and there is a danger that this\nsituation could worsen significantly as governments put in place austerity measures. Turning to\nAsia, growth in China has also slowed as that country has tightened monetary and credit policies\nto reduce inflation. Indeed, the list of countries that are still experiencing solid growth is getting\n7\n\nshorter all the time. If China’s economy has a hard landing, there really aren’t many sources of\nstrength left in the global economy.\nLet me move now to what this all means for Fed policy. As I noted earlier, our statutory\nmandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability.6 We are far short of maximum\nemployment. And I expect inflation to fall this year below the 2 percent level that we view as\nconsistent with our mandate. This is clearly a situation in which we have to keep applying\nmonetary policy stimulus vigorously.\nThe Fed’s monetary policy body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or\nFOMC. As you know, the Fed influences the economy through its ability to affect interest rates.\nIn December 2008, when the recession was hitting with full force, the FOMC lowered the federal\nfunds rate, the rate banks pay to borrow from each other on overnight loans, close to zero. It’s\nbeen there ever since. Given the weakness in the economy, standard monetary policy guidelines\nindicate that the federal funds rate should have gone deep into negative territory. But, of course,\nit’s not possible for interest rates to go much below zero.\nSo the Fed has had to look for alternative ways to stimulate the economy. For example,\nwe’ve purchased over one-and-three-quarters trillion dollars of longer-term securities issued by\nthe U.S. government and mortgage agencies. This raises the prices on these securities, which\nlowers their yields. And lower yields on longer-term Treasury securities tend to push down other\nlonger-term interest rates. That reduces the cost of borrowing across the board, from mortgages,\nto business loans, to corporate debt. Our securities purchases are an important reason why\nlonger-term interest rates are at or near post-World War II lows.\n6 See Williams (2012) for a discussion of the Fed’s mandate and the implications for the conduct of\nmonetary policy.\n8\n\nIn addition, we’ve publicly announced that we expect to keep the federal funds rate\nexceptionally low at least through late 2014. This guidance tells investors that short-term interest\nrates are likely to stay low for a long time, which then gets passed through to longer-term rates.\nOf course, our statements are not an absolute commitment to keep rates near zero. It’s simply\nthe FOMC’s current judgment about the best future course of policy. If the economic outlook\nchanges, then the guidance could change too.\nLet me emphasize that the unusually stimulatory monetary policy now in place won’t last\nforever. Eventually we will cut back the size of our securities holdings and raise our unusually\nlow interest rate target. We’ve thought hard and communicated frequently about how to exit\nfrom these special conditions.7 The key point is that the economy currently needs an\nextraordinarily supportive policy. But we’ll reverse course when the time comes to remove this\nsupport.\nWe’ve also taken two steps to improve our communication of the Fed’s monetary policy\nstrategy and plans. First, we released a statement of our longer-run goals and strategies—\nessentially, a declaration of our monetary policy principles.8 That statement noted that we view a\n2 percent inflation rate as most consistent with our mandates. It also emphasized that we will\ncontinue to balance our goals of maximum employment and price stability in making policy.\nSecond, we now regularly report our views about the probable course of short-term\ninterest rates over the next few years. Under current economic circumstances, most Fed\npolicymakers judge that near-zero short-term interest rates will be appropriate well into 2014. In\n7 See the discussion of exit strategy in the minutes for the June 2011 FOMC meeting (Board of Governors\n2011).\n8 For more information, see Board of Governors (2012).\n9\n\nthis way, our interest rate forecasts reinforce our public guidance. Releasing the views of\npolicymakers in this fashion should further reduce public uncertainty about our plans. And that,\nin turn, improves the effectiveness of our policies.\nWe at the Fed are broadening our commitment to openness and accountability. And\nwe’re doing all we can to carry out the mission Congress gave us. The Fed’s powers are limited.\nLower interest rates alone can’t fix all the economy’s problems. But monetary accommodation is\nindispensible. The economy would be in much worse shape if the Fed weren’t acting so\nenergetically.\nLooking ahead, we may need to do more if the recovery falters or if inflation stays well\nbelow 2 percent. If the economy does need more stimulus, restarting our program of purchasing\nmortgage-backed securities would probably be the best course of action. The policy actions the\nFed takes will depend on how economic conditions develop. If circumstances change, our\npolicies will adapt. No matter the circumstances, I assure you that we at the Fed are doing\neverything we can to achieve the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Thank you\nvery much.\n10\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2011. “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee,” June 21–22. http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20110622.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012. “Press Release,” January 25. http://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York. 2010. “Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit.” August.\nhttp://www.newyorkfed.org/research/national_economy/householdcredit/DistrictReport_Q22010.pdf\nFeroli, Michael E., Ethan S.

    "text": "Supporting Strong, Steady, and\nSustainable Growth\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo the\nWorld Affairs Council of Sonoma\nSanta Rosa, California\nApril 6, 2018\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon everyone, and thank you for the kind introduction. I’ve spent this\nyear so far giving “good news” speeches; talking about the strong economy, the long\nexpansion, and robust job growth. And with good reason: We’re in the third – in fact,\nvery soon to be the second – longest economic expansion in American history. We\nPage 1 of 9\n\nadded over two million jobs last year, the unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been\nsince 2000,1 and inflation is closing in on our 2 percent target.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is a leading example of the growth we’re seeing across\nthe country. Many of the things that drive us crazy—bad traffic, sky-high housing\ncosts, and sidewalks and streets blocked by construction—are signs of a robust\neconomy. It’s easy to blame the gridlock on 101 on all the techies flooding the Bay\nArea. But it’s not just tech that’s powering the American economy—far from it. This\nhealthy expansion is taking place nationwide and across the full range of sectors. And\nit’s part of a global trend of stronger-than-expected growth.\nToday, I will continue to accentuate the positive and highlight the reasons I expect the\neconomy will continue to improve, reaching milestones that we haven’t seen in nearly\n50 years. I’ll finish with my views on what this means for monetary policy and how we\ncan keep this economy, strong, resilient, and growing at a steady pace.\nBefore I go any further, it would be best to give the usual Fed disclaimer that the\nviews I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in\nthe Federal Reserve System.\nWhat drives sustainable growth?\nLast year real gross domestic product, or GDP, increased 2.6 percent. This is a solid\nperformance. Importantly, it’s above the trend growth rate, which I peg at about 1¾\npercent.\n1 This speech was finalized before the release of March employment data on the morning of April 6, 2018.\nPage 2 of 9\n\nI’m often asked what the trend growth rate is and how it differs from GDP growth.\nThe trend growth rate is the rate of growth that can be sustained by the economy over\nthe long term. It has two main drivers: labor force growth and productivity growth.\nWith more people working, making things and using their income to buy things, the\nmore we can produce. Equally, if innovations in technology mean that companies can\nmake more state-of-the-art microprocessors in an hour than they could before, that\nwill also contribute to higher sustainable growth.\nAn important development of the past decade is that the trend growth rate today\nappears to be considerably slower than the growth trends we’ve previously seen in our\nlifetimes. This slower pace of growth is a reflection of a sharp decline in labor force\ngrowth and relatively slow productivity growth.2\nWhat’s behind the decline in labor force growth? Two main things: First, the baby\nboomers are retiring in droves, and second, the fertility rate in the United States has\ndeclined to a low level.3\nAnd despite the rampant innovations we’re seeing around us, especially in the Bay\nArea—robots delivering take-out, driverless cars, and Alexa in every living room—\nthese aren’t yet translating into rapid gains in productivity growth. To give some\ncontext, in the 1990s and early 2000s, annual productivity gains in the United States\naveraged 2 to 3 percent. By contrast, productivity gains over the past decade have\naveraged only about 1 percent per year.\n2 Fernald (2016).\n3 Hamilton et al. (2017).\nPage 3 of 9\n\nLooking ahead, I expect growth to average around 2.5 percent over this year and\nnext. Strong financial conditions, better-than-expected global growth, and fiscal\nstimulus of lower taxes and higher spending have all created tailwinds that account for\ngrowth running above trend.\nGrowth above trend doesn’t necessarily pose a particular risk at this time. But it’s one\nof the factors I’m assessing when I’m thinking about how to best support economic\ngrowth over the medium term. In that regard, a question I’m frequently hearing as the\nexpansion closes in on nine years is: are we “due” for a recession?\nThe short answer is no. Recessions don’t happen because a timer goes off. Research\nshows that the odds of going into a recession are the same whether you’re in the\nseventh, eighth, or ninth year of the expansion.4 Instead, recessions generally happen\nbecause of some big event: the housing crash of a decade ago or the bursting of the\ndot-com bubble in the early 2000s. These kinds of events are notoriously hard to\npredict, and the recessions that often follow don’t happen because the business cycle\nhas a time limit on it.\nGiven that the current pace of growth is above trend, my view is that we need to\ncontinue on the path of raising interest rates. This will keep things on an even footing\nand reduce the risk of us getting to a point where the economy could overheat, and\ncreate problems that could end badly.\nObviously, growth figures are the ones that many people are focused on. But as\nPresident of the San Francisco Fed and a voting member on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), I’m judged on what happens to employment and inflation. The\n4 Rudebusch (2016).\nPage 4 of 9\n\nFederal Reserve has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, so\nmy day job is about understanding what’s going on with those figures and then\nmaking appropriate monetary policy recommendations.\nEmployment\nWhen it comes to the maximum employment goal, we have made enormous strides\nand I see the labor market continuing to improve. We added about 2.2 million jobs in\n2017. That’s about twice the number needed to keep pace with normal labor force\ngrowth.5 Based on the data we’ve seen recently, we are set to add even more jobs to\nthe economy this year.\nWith jobs growth being so robust, the unemployment rate has moved down to\naround 4 percent. Based on my forecast for the economy, I expect the unemployment\nrate to continue to edge down to 3-1/2 percent by next year. That would be the\nlowest rate of unemployment recorded in the United States since 1969. What’s\nhappening in the nation as a whole is also happening here in California, where the\nunemployment rate is already the lowest since 1969.\nThese low unemployment numbers have many people asking why we’re not seeing\ngreater wage growth, but that number actually has been slowly ratcheting up. And this\nis consistent with the reports I’ve been hearing from business leaders for a while. As\ntalent becomes increasingly scarce, they’re offering higher wages in a bid to compete\nfor employees. I expect this to intensify as the competition for workers gathers steam.\n5 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016).\nPage 5 of 9\n\nInflation\nWage growth is the perfect segue to discuss inflation. Six years ago, the FOMC set\nitself the goal of 2 percent inflation. Admittedly, since then, inflation has been running\nbelow that mark most of the time. This underrun of our target reflects a number of\ninfluences. These include the weak economy following the recession, a strong dollar\nthat reduced the costs of imported goods and services, and some special factors that\nhad a temporary effect on prices in certain categories.\nInflation undershooting its target by a few tenths of a percentage point probably\ndoesn’t sound that concerning to most people. In fact, historically, high and rising\ninflation has acted as an alarm bell to warn that the economy is on an unsustainable\nfooting. But inflation that’s too low also poses a risk. Very low inflation raises the\npossibility of deflation – that is, falling prices – which carries with it its own set of\nproblems for the economy. That’s why, as a policymaker, I’m keeping such a close eye\non the behavior of inflation, even when the economy is performing so well.\nThe good news is for most of the past year, inflation has been running closer to 2\npercent.6 With the economy strong, and strengthening further, I expect that we’ll see\ninflation reach and actually slightly exceed our longer-run 2 percent goal for the next\nfew years.\n6 Over the 9 months ending in February 2018, the annualized rate of core PCE inflation was very close to 2 percent.\nPage 6 of 9\n\nMonetary Policy\nI began by describing a very positive economic outlook of strong growth, low and\nfalling unemployment, and inflation that is closing in on our 2 percent long-run goal.\nAgainst this background, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate\nby ¼ percentage point at our most recent meeting.7\nWe also indicated that we expect further gradual interest rate increases to be\nappropriate. In particular, our recent projections indicate that the center of the\ndistribution of FOMC projections foresees a total of three to four rate increases this\nyear and further gradual rate increases over the next two years, bringing the target\nfederal funds rate to around 3-1/2 percent by the end of 2020.8 In my view, this is the\nright direction for monetary policy.\nWe are certainly not “due” for a recession, but it’s equally important we keep growth\non a sustainable footing to keep the strong economy going as long as possible. This\ngradual process of removing the monetary stimulus put in during the recession is\ndesigned to keep the healthy expansion on track, maintain inflation near our 2 percent\ngoal, and to minimize the risk that the economy could overheat down the road.\nNote that the rate increases we have put in place so far have not stalled the economy.\nIn fact, the economy continues to steam ahead. For that reason, I am confident that\nwe can carry on the process of gradually moving interest rates up over the next two\nyears while seeing solid growth and historically low rates of unemployment.\n7 Board of Governors (2018a).\n8 Board of Governors (2018b).\nPage 7 of 9\n\nThat’s our plan. Of course, even the best-laid plans can go awry when the unexpected\nhappens. Therefore, my approach is to always follow the data very carefully and adjust\nmy recommendations accordingly. If actual growth is paltry, or if there are signs of an\neconomy that’s overheating and inflationary pressures are building too fast, then I’ll\nreevaluate my position and advocate for adjusting the path of rates accordingly.\nTo sum up: the outlook is very positive. The economy is on course to be as strong as\nwe have seen in many decades and inflation is moving closer to our target. The\nchallenge for monetary policy is to keep it that way. This is never an easy task, but we\nare well positioned to achieve our goals, and to respond to any unexpected twists and\nturns that may lie in the economic road ahead.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nPage 8 of 9\n\nReferences\nBidder, Rhys, Tim Mahedy, and Rob Valletta. 2016. “Trend Job Growth: Where’s\nNormal?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2016-32 (October 24).\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2016/october/trend-job-growth-where-is-normal/\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018a. “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement.” Press release, March 21.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180321a.ht\nm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018b. “FOMC Projections\nmaterials, accessible version.” March 21.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20180321.htm\nFernald, John. 2016. “What Is the New Normal for U.S. Growth?” FRBSF Economic\nLetter 2016-30 (October 11). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/publications/economic-letter/2016/october/new-normal-for-gdp-\ngrowth/\nHamilton, Brady E., Joyce A.

    "text": "Keeping the Recovery Sustainable:\nThe Essential Role of an Independent Fed\nRemarks by\nJOHN C. WILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo\nThe Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce\nSanta Cruz, California\nFebruary 28, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nThank you Professor Walsh. For those of you who do not know Carl, in addition to\nbeing a distinguished economics professor at UCSC, he’s a longtime friend and\nassociate of the San Francisco Fed, having served as a staff economist back in the\n1980s and as a visiting scholar since then.\nI also want to thank everyone at the Chamber for inviting me to join you here, in\nparticular Executive Director Bill Tysseling. Bill, congratulations on your retirement!\nThis is an impressive organization. Your members put about 15,000 of your neighbors\nto work across the broad spectrum of the business community that you represent.\nThat’s music to the ears of a Fed president who’s tasked with maximizing\nemployment and price stability.\nI also have a deep-rooted appreciation for how hard your jobs can be. After I\ngraduated from college, I managed a small business called Blondie’s Pizza. I know\nfrom first-hand experience and from talking to other local business owners, the daily\nchallenges of running a business.\n1\n\nFROM RECESSION TO RECOVERY\nI always love coming to Santa Cruz.\nI like to think of myself as connected to Santa Cruz by marriage. You see, my wife is\na proud alumna of UCSC, which I guess makes me a “banana-slug-in-law.”\nBefore my wife and I were married – back when we were dating – I used to regularly\ndrive down here to Santa Cruz. I have many fond memories of my visits to the city,\nthe beaches, the boardwalk, and rides on the Giant Dipper.\nSo I was heartbroken for everyone in the community when I saw the devastation\nfrom the earthquake in 1989. But, the community came together to rebuild, even as\nsome doubters suggested it would never rise again from the rubble.\nJust a few short years into the rebuild, Sunset magazine wrote that the region had\nfound its essence again as a quote “lovely and goofy, laid-back but … deeply passionate”\ncommunity.1\nI think that’s a great metaphor for the way our country has rebuilt our economy after\nthe Great Recession.\nI know this has been a tough journey for a lot of people, and many are still\nstruggling. But putting the economic recovery in perspective, we've come a very long\nway.\nToday, the data show an economy that has recovered. As I’ll discuss further in a\nmoment, nationwide, we’ve reached full employment. Inflation is moving toward our\n2 percent target. And we’re in the eighth year of the economic expansion.\nWith this in mind, I thought I’d take this opportunity to share some thoughts on the\nrole of the Fed in our country, and where I see the economy and monetary policy\ngoing. Now seems like as good a time as ever to note that the views I express are\nmine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n1Fish (1995)\n2\n\nTHE ROLE OF THE FED\nSo who are we at the Fed? The short answer is that we’re an amazingly nerdy group\nof people who pore over data, computer models, and statistical analysis.\nThe more specific answer is that we’re a unique institution in the government, both in\nfunction and in structure. Congress has mandated that our job is to keep the\neconomy stable and on track, with a focus on two big goals: maximum employment\nand price stability.\nYou may have heard us refer to these goals as our “dual mandate.”\nContrary to the popular misconception, we’re not “the feds.” We’re not politicians or\nfiscal policymakers. We don’t spend money or set taxes. We don’t write legislation.\nAnd unlike politicians, we’re not elected. In conducting monetary policy, we base our\ndecisions on what’s best for the long-term health of the economy, without political\ninfluence from Congress, the Administration, or others.\nTo my mind, this is the single most important feature of the Fed: the ability to act\nindependently of short-term political influence… which allows us to respond to\nchanging circumstances as needed. Across the world, independent central banks have\nproven to be more effective at stabilizing inflation and keeping their countries’\neconomies performing up to their full potential than countries where the central bank\nis under political control.\nSo what exactly is it that we do? For starters, we – and we alone – set U.S. monetary\npolicy, and we inform our decisions with economic research and real-world input\nfrom business and community leaders from across the country.\nIn San Francisco alone, we have over two dozen PhD economists on staff and eight\nboards and advisory councils that regularly meet and provide me with information\nabout economic and financial conditions across the nine western states that make up\nthe Fed’s 12th District.\nDespite what you may have heard, we don’t actually print money. The Bureau of\nEngraving and Printing in the U.S. Treasury does that. We do make cash available\nthroughout the country. We run key parts of the nation’s payments system. And we\nconduct oversight of banks and other financial institutions.\nNow, I mentioned that we’re unique – one of the reasons I say this is that the Federal\n3\n\nReserve System was founded, by design, to have a very interesting federated structure.\nI’m president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which covers the largest\nof 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Our region contains 36 percent of the nation’s\nlandmass and about a fifth of the nation’s population.\nWe’re a private institution with our own Board of Directors, to whom I report. Our\nwebsite is actually a “dot org” – www.frbsf.org.\nAt the same time, we’re also part of the national Federal Reserve System that’s\noverseen by the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. The Governors are\nappointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. They’re\nfull government employees, and in case you’re wondering, they’re a “dot gov” –\nwww.federalreserve.gov.\nIt’s my role to be the eyes and ears of what’s happening in our District – your\nperspectives, your outlook, what keeps you up at night. This part of my job is\nespecially important at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC\nfor short – the committee that makes monetary policy decisions.\nGOLDILOCKS ECONOMY\nOur goal is to attain what I like to call a “Goldilocks economy” – an economy that\ndoesn’t run too hot or too cold. We want the porridge to be just right.\nOf course, it’s not always easy to achieve that just-right economy. Financial booms\nand busts such as the dot-com and housing bubbles of the past few decades can cause\neconomic swings despite our efforts to contain them. But carefully designed monetary\npolicy can help smooth out those fluctuations and protect families from economic\nturmoil.\nIn ordinary times, we focus on affecting interest rates by buying and selling short-term\nU.S. Treasury bills. Yet, the period since the financial crisis and Great Recession of\n2007 through 2009 has been extraordinary.\nTherefore, to further stimulate the ailing economy, we also purchased long-term\nTreasury and mortgage-backed securities—you may know this as “quantitative easing”\nor “QE.” This helped the economy achieve the relatively healthy state that it’s in\ntoday.2\n2 Williams (2014) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).\n4\n\nAgain, remember that our goals are to maximize employment and price stability so\nthat anyone who is looking for a job can find one, and the money in your wallet\nretains its value.\nCURRENT POLICY\nAs I wrap up, I want to give you a snapshot of where our economy and monetary\npolicy are today.\nIn December, the FOMC nudged rates up and projected that we’d likely raise interest\nrates gradually in 2017. Specifically, the median projection was for three increases this\nyear. 3 We stood pat after our meeting a month ago, but we’ll meet again in March to\nassess whether the time is right to raise rates further. In my view, a rate increase is\nvery much on the table for serious consideration at our March meeting.\nI’ve been publicly supportive of a gradual increase in rates, and I am confident that\nthe economy will continue to grow at a healthy pace even as we raise rates.\nThe aim is to keep the economic expansion on a sound footing – not too hot, not too\ncold – that can be sustained for as long as possible. The last thing we want is to\nundermine the hard-won gains we’ve made since the dark days of the recession.4\nNow, my wife has warned me to stop using medical analogies. She’s in the health\nsciences field and she says all my finance friends get them wrong. So I’ll use a tennis\nanalogy: You always want to position yourself for the next shot.\nGiven where we are now, our best position is in the middle of the court, where we\ncan handle shots that come from either direction.\nI mentioned earlier that we’re currently around full employment. This doesn’t mean\nthat every man, woman, and child is working 24/7, 365 days of the year. That’s not\npossible or even desirable. Instead, we aim for something economists call the\n“natural rate” of unemployment – the level where the economy is running neither too\nhot nor too cold. Goldilocks.\nIt’s impossible to know exactly what the magic number is, but it’s generally thought to\nbe between 4¾ and 5 percent. With the national unemployment rate hovering around\n3 Board of Governors (2016).\n4 See Williams (2016) for further discussion.\n5\n\nthat lower number in recent months, we’ve reached that goal. If you’re keeping score\nat home, that’s less than half of where it was in the immediate aftermath of the Great\nRecession when it reached 10 percent.\nThat’s not to say that no one is struggling. This economic recovery hasn't been the\nsame for everyone. There are people who were left behind. There are people who\nwere, frankly, left behind even in the best of times.\nIn many ways, Santa Cruz is a microcosm of the dichotomy we see throughout our\nregion and throughout the country. Your area benefits from the influence of the\nUniversity and a vibrant tourism sector, helping to keep job growth solid in recent\nyears. But there aren’t enough well-paid jobs in growth sectors for everyone, leaving\nsome folks to struggle.\nWhile unemployment in Santa Cruz has fallen by more than half from the double digit\nhighs it reached in the aftermath of the recession, the current rate is well above the\nstate as a whole. I know that if you’re struggling, better doesn’t feel good enough.\nAt this point, monetary policy is somewhat limited in what it can do in this regard.\nGreater investments in education, public and private capital, and research and\ndevelopment are needed to fuel economic growth and raise living standards, and\nthose are the purview of fiscal policymakers and private businesses.\nYet, there are things we can do, and are doing at the Fed to be a part of the solution\nfor challenges facing local communities. I’m particularly proud of my team in San\nFrancisco who’ve established our Bank as a leader in Community Development –\nconnecting the various investors, community leaders and other stakeholders in\nrecognition that when communities thrive, it’s good for everyone.\nI’ve talked quite a bit about the employment side of things. The other side of the dual\nmandate coin is price stability. The FOMC has set a long run goal of 2-percent\ninflation and, frankly, we’ve been running persistently below that goal for several\nyears. Much of this is due to the comparative strength of the dollar and a decline in\nenergy prices. Those downward inflation pressures have been fading, however, and\nour graph lines are moving in the right direction to reach the 2-perent goal over the\nnext year or so.\nSo given where we are in terms of unemployment and inflation, we’re very close to\nachieving our dual mandate goals. Yet monetary policy essentially still has the pedal to\nthe metal, with interest rates that remain near historical lows. We need to gradually\nease our foot off the gas in order to avoid a “too hot” economy that in the end isn’t\n6\n\nsustainable.\nCONCLUSION\nSo what does this all mean for your own businesses and families? There’s a song that\nsays “you say it best when you say nothing at all.” Hopefully that doesn’t apply to my\nremarks today! In many ways, you feel our impact best when you don’t feel it at all ...\nwhen you don’t have to bring suitcases of cash to the gas station to fill your tank …\nwhen you can plan for your future around the kitchen table without having to worry\nabout finding a job in double digit unemployment. When you’re not feeling the rug\npulled out from under you thanks to a massive economic calamity.\nOver the past several years, monetary policy has played an essential role in moving\nour country from recession to recovery. With over seven years of economic\nexpansion, an economy at full employment, and inflation moving toward our 2\npercent goal, it has an essential role to play today in keeping this recovery sustainable.\nAnd for those who are still left behind, it’s on all of us to do our part, in our own way\nto help fill in the gaps.

    "text": "Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance, Singapore, Singapore\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 28, 2015\nMacroprudential Policy in a Microprudential World\nGood afternoon and thank you. I first want to say what a pleasure it is to be in Singapore\nfor the first time, and how auspicious to be coming in the year of the 50th National Day. I’m\nparticularly pleased to see the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore working together to organize this excellent symposium.\nWe’re here today to talk about the evolution of regulatory reform. For central bankers\nand financial regulators it’s virtually de rigueur to emphasize the importance of taking a\nmacroprudential approach to maintaining financial stability. Given the events of the past decade,\nthis renewed focus on fostering a robust, resilient financial system is entirely appropriate.1 But\nwhat does this mean in practice? The answer to this question differs across countries, depending\non laws, institutions, and history. There are many countries with deep experience in this arena\nand many in the audience today have firsthand knowledge of implementing macroprudential\npolicies. Given my own experience, I will take a decidedly U.S.-centric perspective, based on the\nunique legal, institutional, and market structures of my home country, where macroprudential\npolicies are still relatively new and untested. Before I proceed any further, I should emphasize\nthat my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\nNow that I have that out of the way, let me be clear what I mean by “financial stability.”\nI’ll quote the European Central Bank’s definition: “A condition in which the financial system—\n1 See, for example, Group of Thirty (2010).\n1\n\ncomprising financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures—is capable of\nwithstanding shocks and the unravelling of financial imbalances, thereby mitigating the\nlikelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation process which are severe enough to\nsignificantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment opportunities.”2 It goes\nwithout saying that the global financial system did not meet this definition when confronted by\nthe Lehman shock and subsequent events. The resulting near meltdown of the global financial\nsystem almost toppled economies around the world. Even with dramatic and, in many cases,\nunprecedented action by governments and central banks, the fallout from the financial crisis was\ndevastating. I should note that the renewed concern for financial stability represents more a\nreturn to the roots of central banking than new-age thinking. The Federal Reserve itself was\ncreated from the ashes of the panics and depressions that plagued the U.S. economy in the late\n19th and early 20th centuries.\nIn my remarks I will focus on policy options directed at improving financial stability in\nthe United States. These include monetary policy and micro- and macroprudential policies. Lest I\nbury the lede: My main conclusions are: (1) monetary policy is poorly suited for dealing with\nfinancial stability concerns, even as a last resort; (2) a macroprudential, financial system-wide\nperspective is needed—but in the United States, explicitly macroprudential tools are hard to find;\nand (3) given (1) and (2), we need to rely primarily on microprudential regulations and\nsupervision to achieve macroprudential goals. A final conclusion is that constant repetition of the\nwords “macroprudential” and “microprudential” will render me unable to speak after about five\nminutes, so I’ll revert at times to “macro-pru” and “micro-pru” to spare us all.\nThe role of monetary policy in financial stability\n2 This is taken from the European Central Bank (ECB) website:\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/glossary/html/glossf.en.html\n2\n\nLet me start with the least controversial topic first: the role of monetary policy in\nsupporting financial stability goals. It has become a mantra in central banking that robust micro-\nand macroprudential regulatory policies should provide the main lines of defense for threats to\nfinancial stability. Nonetheless, there is some concern that these alone may be insufficient. Those\nwho hold these worries conclude that there should be a financial stability goal in the monetary\npolicy mandate. Central bankers themselves regularly refer to the connections between monetary\npolicy and financial stability. At the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Norges Bank, the\nSveriges Riksbank, and elsewhere, policy discussions have frequently highlighted the tradeoffs\nbetween, and the appropriate balancing of, macroeconomic and financial stability goals.3\nIt is noteworthy that the recent heightened focus on the connections between monetary\npolicy and financial stability is a sea change from the consensus before the global financial crisis.\nCentral bankers were then nearly unanimous in their undying faith and fealty to a version of\ninflation targeting, whereby monetary policy is single-mindedly focused on price stability and,\nusually more quietly, other macroeconomic goals. Financial stability was viewed as a potentially\ndangerous distraction, risking the central bank’s attention to, and credibility in, achieving its\nprice-stability mandate. This approach was codified in numerous central bank charters, which in\nsome cases mandated consequences if the inflation goal was not met.4\nDespite the clear need to consider all potential tools to avoid a financial crisis, I am\nunconvinced that monetary policy is one of them. Three observations lead me to this conclusion.\nFirst, monetary policy actions offer unfavorable and costly tradeoffs between macroeconomic\nand financial stability goals. Second, using monetary policy in pursuit of financial stability could\n3 See, for example, Bank of England (2013), Norges Bank (2014), Sveriges Riksbank (2014a).\n4 Even at the Federal Reserve, where inflation targeting was never formally adopted, financial stability was rarely\ndiscussed at monetary policy meetings during the run-up to the financial crisis. See Fligstein et al. (2014) for a\ntextual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee transcripts in the years before the global financial crisis.\n3\n\nundermine the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to its inflation target and unmoor\ninflation expectations. Third, the great uncertainty about, and long lags between, monetary policy\nactions and risks to the financial system argue against their playing a meaningful role.\nTaking these in turn: The first issue is the high cost, in terms of macroeconomic goals\nsuch as price stability and full employment, of using monetary policy to address potential risks to\nfinancial stability. Under normal circumstances, macroeconomic and financial stability goals are\nlikely to be in harmony. However, in some circumstances, such as when the economy is weak\nbut risks to financial stability appear to be growing, they may come into conflict. In such a case,\nthe concern over financial stability may suggest raising interest rates higher than would be\nappropriate for macroeconomic goals, resulting in higher unemployment and lower inflation.\nThis problem is starkly illustrated by the real-world tradeoff that Sweden’s central bank,\nthe Sveriges Riksbank, faced in trying to mitigate risks to financial stability using monetary\npolicy. Let me set the stage. In recent years, Sweden’s economy has been in the throes of\npersistently high unemployment and low inflation. At the same time, household debt has grown\nrapidly. In response, the Riksbank undertook a tighter monetary policy stance than purely\nmacroeconomic considerations would have called for. In effect, inflation and unemployment\ngoals were subordinated to reduce the risks to financial stability that stemmed from Sweden’s\nhigh level of household debt. Lars Svensson has argued that the Riksbank’s monetary policy\nactions induced a significantly higher rate of unemployment and a sustained shortfall of inflation\nrelative to its target.5 Sweden’s dilemma is not an isolated example; a similar set of issues has\nfaced Norway’s central bank, the Norges Bank.6\n5 Svensson (2013).\n6 For example, in the Norges Bank’s Monetary Policy Report (2014), they frame their policy decision as follows:\n“Both the objective of keeping consumer price inflation close to 2.5% and the objective of sustaining capacity\n4\n\nThe second, related, observation is that policy actions aimed at addressing financial\nstability could drive inflation far from its target for many years. This could undermine faith in\nthe central bank’s commitment to its inflation target and affect inflation expectations, which have\nbeen known to slip when central banks emphasize the role of financial stability when\ndeliberating monetary policy. Figure 1 shows survey data on longer-run measures of inflation\nexpectations for the United States, the euro area, Norway, and Sweden.7 These have remained\nstable in the United States and the euro area throughout the tumult of the global financial and\neuro crises, as well as the aggressive monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the\nECB. In contrast, long-run inflation expectations in Norway and Sweden fell below target when\ntheir central banks were highlighting financial stability worries.8 This followed long periods of\ninflation averaging below target levels and central bank communication that financial stability\nconcerns had been affecting policy decisions.\nAfter the Riksbank reversed course in July 2014, inflation expectations rebounded,\nproviding additional evidence to suggest a link between adherence to a financial stability\nmandate and inflation expectations. The Norges Bank, on the other hand, stayed the course and\ninflation expectations have remained depressed. So far, it’s unclear how durable this slippage\nwill be. Nonetheless, it is an apt reminder of the potential long-run costs of losing sight of the\nprice stability mandate. The steadfastness of the nominal anchor in most advanced economies\nhas been, and continues to be, a key factor in many central banks’ ability to maintain low and\nstable inflation during and after the global financial crisis. If the anchor were to permanently slip,\nutilization in the years ahead could in isolation imply a somewhat lower key policy rate forecast…. On the other\nhand, a lower key policy rate may increase the risk of a further buildup of financial imbalances.”\n7 Figure 1 is based on a chart in Levin (2014).\n8 Other surveys show smaller downward movements in long-run inflation expectations. See Norges Bank (2014) and\nSveriges Riksbank (2014b).\n5\n\nit would wreak lasting damage to central banks’ control over both inflation and economic\nactivity, at considerable cost to the economy.\nMy third observation is that while the costs of using monetary policy to address financial\nstability risks are clear and sizable, the potential benefits of such actions are much harder to pin\ndown. In part, this uncertainty is due to the difficulty inherent in analyzing and measuring tail\nrisks that could develop in the future. But it also reflects the shortcomings of available economic\nmodels, which do not provide much guidance on how monetary policy may affect such risks. 9\nMoreover, monetary policy is likely to affect financial stability in myriad ways and even the\ndirection of these effects may depend on the circumstances at hand. For example, Svensson\nargues that the Riksbank’s policies may have actually increased the already high household debt-\nto-income ratio, potentially exacerbating financial stability risks rather than mitigating them.10\nMore generally, once perceived risks to the financial system have begun to emerge, the\nimplications for monetary policy are unclear. Take the current example of the purported effect of\nlow interest rates on excessive risk-taking in financial markets. Does this argue for more rapid\npolicy actions to discourage further risk accumulation? Or does it imply a more gradual course of\naction to minimize the risk of a sudden adverse market reaction? It’s not at all obvious. Based on\nthe standard principle that highly uncertain policy actions should be used with caution, the\nambiguous effects of monetary policy on financial stability are another argument for limiting use\nof this tool.11\nMicro- and macroprudential policy and financial stability\n9 See Adrian and Shin (2008) for a model of the interaction of monetary policy and financial stability.\n10 Svensson (2013).\n11 See Williams (2013) for a recent treatment of the implications of policy uncertainty on optimal policy choice of\nmonetary policy.\n6\n\nI am convinced that monetary policy should not be used to address risks to financial\nstability given the very real and sizable costs, not to mention that the potential benefits are\nanything but certain. This brings me to micro- and macroprudential regulatory and supervisory\npolicies, which better address financial stability at less cost to other economic goals. One of the\nkey lessons of the recent crisis (and, for that matter, earlier crises) is the need to move beyond a\nstandard microprudential framework. We should instead supplant the focus on individual\ninstitutions’ financial soundness, based on traditional measures of regulatory capital, with a more\nsystemic view of the financial system’s overall health.\nOf course, strong microprudential regulation is a prerequisite for a robust and resilient\nfinancial system. The regulatory reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III—including larger\ncapital and liquidity-cushion requirements—strengthen the resilience of financial institutions\nfrom a microprudential perspective.12 This not only decreases the odds of an idiosyncratic\nfailure, but reduces the contagion risks posed by outside events. However, experience teaches us\nthat this alone may not be sufficient. The macro-pru approach extends the regulatory lens to\ninclude the interconnectedness of institutions and markets; correlations in strategies and risks\nacross the financial system; risks of contagion across institutions during panics; and financial\nmarkets’ performance under stress.13 As I said earlier, countries around the globe have embraced\nthis macroprudential approach in their various regulatory reforms in different ways.\nThe development of a more macroprudential approach in the United States has been\nshaped by its particular legal and regulatory constraints, and in large part continues to be built on\nmicroprudential foundations. In fact, there are few explicitly macro-pru tools available in the\nUnited States of the kind found in many other countries. In addition, the sizable share of finance\n12 See Shin (2011) and Yellen (2015).\n13 See Bank of England (2009) and Group of Thirty (2010).\n7\n\nand credit that occurs outside of banks, in the so-called shadow banking sector, severely limits\nthe ability of regulators to impose macroprudential restrictions like loan-to-value limits. Hence\nthe title of this talk: Macroprudential policy in a microprudential world.\nDespite these limitations, there are important ways in which a macroprudential\nperspective is being integrated into the regulatory and supervisory framework in the United\nStates. I’ll list three examples. Of course, this list is far from complete, and it ignores important\nissues such as resolution of failed institutions and regulation of nonbank financial institutions.\nBut it highlights some of the key successes and challenges in executing macroprudential policies\nin the United States.14\nThe first is a detailed examination of the goings-on throughout the financial system—that\nis, looking beyond just the regulated depository institutions—to identify emerging threats to\nfinancial stability before it’s too late. The second is strengthening market structures to reduce the\ndanger of credit markets freezing up during a crisis. And third is the use of stress tests as an\nindirect, but nonetheless powerful, method to bring a macroprudential outlook to an otherwise\nmicroprudential tool.\nOne obvious lesson from the crisis is the need to have a full understanding of the\ncomplex interrelationships that permeate the financial ecosystem. Risks in one part of the system\ncan easily and rapidly spill over to other parts, as was seen in 2007-2008, when problems in the\nshadow banking sector—including investment banks and insurers—threatened to overturn the\nentire system. Such monitoring and analysis of developments throughout the financial system\nhas become a regular practice at the Fed.15 It has already helped identify latent or emerging risks\n14 See Fischer (2015) for a more complete discussion.\n15 See Bernanke (2013) and Adrian et al. (2014).\n8\n\nto financial stability. One example is the rapid growth of leveraged lending that led to the\nsupervisory guidance to banks issued by U.S. regulators in 2013.16\nThe second macroprudential effort is the strengthening of market structures critical to the\nprovision of credit.17 These include the recent regulatory reforms regarding money market\nmutual funds, designed to reduce the risk of flight from these markets during a panic, as we saw\nin 2008. Other efforts include reforms to the institutional structure around clearing of derivatives,\nand repurchase agreements aimed at minimizing contagion and market breakdowns during stress.\nIn fact, this is one area where monetary policy does intersect with financial stability.18 In\nparticular, the central bank can play the role of a ready, ultrasafe, short-term borrower, which\nmay reduce the incentive in the financial sector to create risky money-like financial\ninstruments.19 On the other hand, it may increase risks of a run on short-term funding markets\nduring a panic.20 This is an important issue that requires more study.\nThe third incorporation of macro-pru perspectives is the annual stress tests (officially\ncalled the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR) undergone by large banks.21\nThe stress tests appear at first glance to be purely micro-pru exercises: They evaluate each firm’s\nbalance sheet in isolation, subject to a set of common aggregate economic shocks—the so-called\n“severely adverse scenario.” The results, in terms of approving capital plans, are determined on a\nfirm-by-firm basis, rather than by looking at the health of the overall financial system.\n16 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (2013).\n17 See Fischer (2015).\n18 See Williams (2014), Sheedy (2014), and Koenig (2013) for further discussion of ways in which monetary policy\nframeworks can affect financial stability.\n19 See Stein (2012), Kashyap and Stein (2012), and Cochrane (2014).\n20 Frost et al. (2015).\n21 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015). Note that the CCAR process is for the largest banks.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a separate set of tests for medium- to large-sized banks.\n9\n\nBut that takes far too narrow a view of the endeavor. In fact, the stress tests sit right at the\nintersection of the micro- and macroprudential worlds. First, the tests provide a huge amount of\ninformation regarding the intricate and numerous connections between financial institutions,\nalong with the correlations in their strategies and exposures. This feeds into the macroprudential\nmonitoring and analysis discussed earlier. Second, the design of the severely adverse scenarios\ncan incorporate aspects of the potential risks to the economy and the financial system that this\nmacro-pru observation has uncovered. These could include overvaluation of asset prices,\nduration risk at banks, lack of liquidity in bond markets, rapid growth in household debt,\nexcessive risk-taking in shadow banks, foreign shocks...the list goes on. The point is that the\nstress tests place a penalty—and thereby an implicit shadow cost—on activities that would incur\nlarge losses in the test scenario. This creates a disincentive for banks to undertake such pursuits,\nwhich should reduce the very activity that threatens financial stability.\nDespite the macroprudential features already present in the current iterations of stress\ntests, it’s clear that this is still a work in progress and there is further potential for bringing\nmacroprudential perspectives into the tests. This includes more explicit treatment of the\ninterconnectedness of institutions and the endogeneity of financial and economic conditions. In\naddition, the tests can be used as a way to measure the overall susceptibility of the financial\nsystem to a crisis or panic, rather than a singular focus on individual firms’ capital plans.\nConclusion\nThere is a broad consensus that strong and effective micro- and macroprudential policies\nare needed to assure a robust and resilient financial system. As always, the devil is in the details.\nFor the United States, the situation is somewhat more nuanced owing to the legal, institutional,\nand regulatory landscape. Microprudential regulation and supervision will for the foreseeable\n10\n\nfuture be the bulwark against systemic risks. Nonetheless, macroprudential approaches are\nincreasingly being integrated into the regulatory framework and this process is sure to continue,\nalbeit in a manner reflecting the unique aspects of the United States.

Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 19, 2016\nDiversity and Inclusion without Excuses\nThank you, and good morning. It’s a special honor to be here and speak at this important\nand timely conference marking the launch of the Center for Research on Diversity in the Financial\nServices Industry at the Rutgers Business School. It’s also a unique pleasure not to talk about the\neconomy and when we’re going to raise interest rates. Instead, I have the chance to discuss\nsomething that in many ways is more important than interest rates: How do we create more diverse\nand inclusive cultures and organizations in the financial services industry, including the Federal\nReserve? Before I go any further, I should inject the usual Fed disclaimer that everything I say\ntoday reflects my own views and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThe title of this conference speaks truth. The first part, “Improving Diversity in the\nFinancial Services Industry,” makes clear that we aren’t here to declare victory or celebrate a job\nwell done. We’re together today because we have a shared problem: The financial services industry\nand the Federal Reserve are not as diverse as they should or need to be.1 Our organizations affect all\nAmericans, yet in large part we don’t share the same cultural and gender diversity of the public we\nserve. This point is made abundantly clear when I listen to activists and other representatives from\nminority communities. Their impassioned plea is to see diverse representation and perspectives in\n1 See U.S. GAO (2013) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website,\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/employment/jobpat-eeo1/index.cfm.\n1 | P age\n\nthe C-suite, but also to ensure that we effectively serve the interests of underrepresented Americans\nwho struggle with a lack of jobs, opportunity, and yes, financial services. That we see and act based\non the whole picture, not just our reflection in the mirror. And they’re right: It’s imperative that we\nare all engaged in the rich tapestry of culture and experience that our country has to offer.\nThe second part of the conference title—“A Holistic View”—is just as telling. We don’t\nhave all the answers we need to solve this problem, and we recognize that. We need to experiment,\nshare stories, and learn from each other if we hope to succeed. And, quite honestly, we need to learn\nthe lessons from others who have found ways to create and sustain more diverse and inclusive\ncultures than our own. I’m reminded of a conversation I had a while back with Congresswoman\nMaxine Waters. I was proudly listing all the things we’re doing at the Fed to increase the diversity\nof our outside suppliers. She responded that, while that was all well and good, all of these ideas\nhave been around for decades, and why were we so late to the game?\nThat observation itself was a testament to our lack of diversity. Just because we’re smart and\nour hearts are in the right place doesn’t make us wise or effective. In a more diverse culture, we\nwouldn’t be trying to reinvent the wheel ourselves, but would most likely have learned from those\nwho have blazed the trail ahead on these issues. And we undoubtedly would have been more\nsuccessful at achieving our diversity goals.\nUntil we advance our diversity and inclusion efforts, we are all missing enormous\nopportunities to expand our horizons, our vision, our labor pool, and ultimately, our success, both\nfor our organizations and our society. There’s a business case as well as a moral one, and they’re\nboth equally persuasive. Starting with the business case, in today’s highly diverse and changing\nsociety, we can’t compete for the best talent if we don’t welcome and encourage diversity and\n2 | P age\n\ninclusion.2 And if we don’t attract and retain diverse employees, we are missing out on a huge and\ngrowing part of the labor force. Moreover, diverse perspectives often lead to better thinking and\nbetter outcomes.3\nFurthermore, abstracting from dollars and cents, the very success of our nation depends on\nall segments of society participating fully in all aspects of our economy. Our national story is that of\na melting pot, combining multitudes of cultures and experiences. There’s no place for bastions of\nprivilege in the financial sector, the government, the tech sector, or any other important segment of\nour economy and society. If we don’t recognize this, the outside world certainly does. Today’s\nsociety, with instantaneous social media campaigns and political demands for change, is not\nsatisfied with the status quo or promises that eventually things will get better. And I agree. In fact,\nI’ll be the first to admit that the demands for us to be more diverse and inclusive originating outside\nour walls have provided a healthy, and perhaps needed, kick in the pants to move faster and be\nmore accountable regarding our progress on diversity and inclusion.\nThe Federal Reserve in particular is in the spotlight for a lack of diversity in our senior\nranks and on our Boards of Directors, and rightly so. Our record is not what it should be, and\nchange has been too slow at best, or, sadly, in some instances, nonexistent. Let’s be clear—this is\nnot for a lack of talented people out there. Take my organization, the San Francisco Fed, as an\nexample. We are situated in a remarkably diverse region, with a population that has a higher share\nof members of minority groups than elsewhere in the country.4 Our colleges are turning out large\n2 For example, the National Center for Education Statistics (2016) projects an outsize increase in minority shares of\ncollege attendees in coming decades.\n3 Recent research finds a direct relationship between greater workforce diversity and favorable business outcomes\n(Hunt, Layton, and Prince 2015). See also Ellison and Mullin (2014) and Joshi and Roh (2009).\n4 For example, see 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data for the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont MSA\n(http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml).\n3 | P age\n\nnumbers of bright and eager people of highly diverse backgrounds.5 So, we should be perfectly\npositioned to tackle head-on the lack of diversity and inclusion.\nIt hasn’t proven that easy. Although our overall workforce is ethnically diverse and we have\nseen gains in diversity at the most senior ranks of our Bank, we fall short in the ranks of middle\nmanagement. Like many other organizations, we have made strides in attracting diverse job\ncandidates through outreach programs and job fairs focused on female and minority job seekers.\nWe have also enhanced our recruiting practices to minimize implicit bias that can distort outcomes.\nIn our intern program, we’ve partnered with organizations that provide corporate internship and\nplacement opportunities for low-income, first-generation college students and we’ve teamed up\nwith programs that seek to increase the number of qualified students entering the fields of\ninformation security. And, we continue to expand our employee resource groups to empower our\ndiverse employees to engage in dialogue with leadership and drive change. Of course, we are\nalways seeking new ideas, and I look forward to learning about additional strategies during the\nsessions on developing pipelines and recruiting strategies for financial services firms.\nHowever, despite our efforts, our diversity pipeline drops from a torrent to a trickle once\nemployees reach the cusp of leadership positions. We far too often hear from employees that it\ntakes too long to get promoted or that they didn’t see a clear road ahead into a leadership role in our\norganization. We aren’t special in this regard—a 2015 Mercer report highlighted these same issues\nin the financial sector in Chicago.6 I’m sure many in this room have the same experience, and I look\n5 For example, see data on degrees awarded from the University of California\n(http://universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/degrees-awarded-glance) and California State University\n(http://www.calstate.edu/as/stat_reports/2014-2015/degree1415.shtml).\n6 Mercer (2015).\n4 | P age\n\nforward to the discussion of this topic during the panel on the glass ceiling in financial services this\nafternoon.\nWe at the San Francisco Fed are currently taking a number of steps to attack this problem,\nand I am optimistic about the road we are on. At an enterprise level, we created a Diversity Council\nchaired by a senior executive and membership composed of Bank leaders who coordinate and\npromote our diversity and inclusion efforts. Senior leaders regularly discuss our pipeline of future\nmanagers and leaders, with a focus on identifying gaps and opportunities for diversity and inclusion\nin our management ranks. We are setting the expectation that leaders mentor and sponsor diverse\ncandidates into leadership roles. Through our Diversity Council, use of analytics, and senior\nleadership succession reviews we are actively working towards our goal of minimizing the choke\npoints and keeping our pipeline strong.\nBut, most importantly, as leaders of organizations, we must hold ourselves accountable to\nprovide an inclusive environment that recruits, retains, and develops diverse talent. You have heard\nme say the word “accountable” more than once this morning because I believe that leadership\naccountability is crucial to advancing diversity and inclusion. Despite the efforts that I just\ndescribed, if we as leaders do not hold ourselves responsible for our own actions—for example, in\nour hiring and promotion decisions, who we seek out for advice, and who we call on in meetings—\nthese efforts will not have the desired impact. And it is equally important that we are accountable\nfor the actions we are not taking—who are we not hiring or promoting, who is not in our inner\ncircles, and who we are overlooking in meetings.\nThere is still more to do. I personally read all of our employee engagement survey responses\ncarefully and talk to employees about how they experience life at the Bank. It’s clear from their\n5 | P age\n\ncomments that, for many employees, the San Francisco Fed can seem a backward-looking, stuffy,\nslow-moving organization. We are currently undertaking a major cultural change at the Bank with a\nkey goal to enhance our appeal to a diverse applicant and employee pool. This means different\nthings to different people. For some, an atmosphere of more casual attire is welcoming and allows\npeople to come to work as “who they are.” For others, greater flexibility in work hours and\ntelecommuting is what’s needed.7 For many, especially women and minority candidates, an\nenvironment that genuinely embraces diversity at all levels of leadership is what is most vital.\nInstead of thinking of work as a place where employees need to “fit in,” I want to see our\norganization become a place that fits our employees and embraces our differences.\nBy creating a more welcoming and inclusive culture—meaning a culture that holds itself\naccountable for encouraging and developing all employees and providing a sense of belonging at\nwork—we will be better able to attract, retain, and grow a highly productive and diverse workforce.\nIn this regard, I look forward to learning what else can be done in the “Successful Case Studies”\nsession this afternoon. It’s absolutely essential that we not only stop putting up unintended barriers\nto diversity, but that we also affirm every day through our words and our deeds that we value and\ncelebrate it. These efforts require organizational and behavioral self-awareness and a commitment,\nstarting at the top, to foster change. Again, both the business case and the fact that it’s the right\nthing to do should drive our resolve.\nI’ve been talking so far about our employees, but as I mentioned earlier, we have more work\nto do in terms of the diversity of our Boards of Directors and outside Advisory Councils. Although\nthe representation of women and minorities among our Directors has improved in recent years, it\n7 Recent research by a leading economics scholar emphasizes the importance of flexibility in work hours for advancing\nqualified female candidates, especially in the financial and legal sectors (Goldin 2014).\n6 | P age\n\nstill isn’t representative of the people we serve.8 At the San Francisco Fed, we have taken steps\nsimilar to those for employee recruiting. Senior leaders of the Bank meet quarterly to review\nopenings on our Boards and advisory groups with a focus on identifying and building a pipeline of\noutstanding diverse candidates that are representative of the communities we serve.\nI should be clear that we do not control the selection of the candidates for our Boards of\nDirectors. Instead, according to the Federal Reserve Act, those decisions are made by the member\nbanks themselves, our San Francisco Board of Directors, or the Board of Governors, depending on\nthe nature of the positon. But, we can and do play an important role in introducing potential\ncandidates to the Federal Reserve and by having a strong slate of diverse candidates, we hope to\nachieve greater diversity on our Boards.\nIn addition, we have created the new 12th District Community Advisory Council to ensure\nthat we are hearing a wide range of voices and perspectives from throughout our District. We plan\nto kick off this new Council next year, with semiannual meetings with senior executives of the San\nFrancisco Fed. Membership will include representatives from community groups, community\ndevelopment organizations, and other members of the public. This council supplements the Federal\nReserve Board’s Community Advisory Council, which has membership from across the country, as\nwell as similar councils set up by other Federal Reserve Banks.\nI’ve gone over some of the key challenges we face regarding diversity and inclusion at my\norganization and some of the things we are doing to get us where we need to be. But, as I have said\nmany times already, I know we don’t have all the answers, and I look forward to learning from the\n8 According to Federal Reserve System tabulations, minority representation on Boards at Reserve Banks increased from\n16 percent in 2010 to 24 percent this year. The proportion of women directors increased from 23 percent to 30 percent\nover the same period.\n7 | P age\n\nother participants at this conference and in the future. I also know that this isn’t an issue that can be\nfixed overnight by flicking a switch. If it were, we wouldn’t be having this conference and I\nwouldn’t be speaking here.\nInstead, it takes focused leadership from the top of the organization, dedicated to an\nongoing, long-term commitment to achieve greater diversity and inclusion. Change like this takes\ntime and perseverance. As leaders of our organizations, we must hold ourselves accountable and not\nmake excuses or look for others to tackle this problem. Admittedly, it’s often a process of two steps\nforward and one step back, and can feel like the Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was forced to roll a\nboulder up a hill, only to see it roll back and hit him, over and over, for eternity.\nBut, this doesn’t have to be a Greek tragedy. As leaders, we can be staunch advocates,\ntaking responsibility for creating a culture that embraces and engages diversity and inclusion in\nevery way, and making sure that obstacles and hurdles are overcome. I am personally committed,\nand I hope you will join me in advancing diversity and inclusion in the financial sector with a sense\nof urgency and, most importantly, without excuses.\nThank you.\n8 | P age\n\nReferences\nEllison, Sara Fisher, and Wallace P.

    "text": "Presentation to UCLA Anderson School of Management, Los Angeles, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 28, 2015\nThe Economic Outlook: Live Long and Prosper\nGood afternoon, and thank you.\nI’m always happy to come to LA. One of the great pleasures of being president of the\nFed’s 12th District is that it’s probably the closest a kid who studied economics was ever going to\nget to the entertainment industry. But I was reflecting on my drive in that after monetary policy\nbeing in the news for the past few weeks, for once, I have something in common with\nHollywood: Everyone’s a critic.\nSo today I’d like to discuss the outlook, monetary policy, and where I see us headed.\nBefore I get going, I should stress that the views expressed here today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nI shouldn’t have to issue a spoiler alert before I say that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee decided to hold off on raising interest rates at our last meeting. I considered it a close\ncall, in part reflecting the conflicting signals we’re getting: On the one hand, the U.S. economy\ncontinues to strengthen and is closing in on full employment, while on the other, global\ndevelopments pose downside risks.\nThe unequivocally good news is that the economic expansion is entering its seventh year\nwith solid momentum. Over the past five years, real GDP growth has averaged a little over 2\npercent and the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly a percentage point per year. I expect that\npace of recovery to continue, despite strong global headwinds.\n1\n\nConsumer spending is powering the economy. We’ve seen real consumer spending\nincrease more than 3 percent over the past year and auto sales are on pace to reach 17 million\nvehicles this year—the highest level seen since the early 2000s. Strong fundamentals point to\ncontinued solid gains going forward: Despite the recent declines in the stock market, the ratio of\nwealth to income is close to all-time highs, household debt burden has come down considerably,\nand real income growth—helped by the drop in energy prices—remains strong. Business\nspending is on an upswing as well. Overall, I see real GDP increasing at a 2¼ percent annual rate\nin the second half of 2015, and GDP growth to be a little above 2 percent next year.\nThe labor market continues to improve as well. We’re on pace to add 2.5 million jobs this\nyear and job vacancies are the highest they’ve been since they started collecting the data back in\n2000. Given the progress we’ve made and the momentum we’re seeing, we should reach or\nexceed full employment on a broad set of measures by the end of this year or early next year. In\nparticular, I expect the unemployment rate to fall below 5 percent later this year and remain there\nthrough 2016.\nThis brings me to the question of how to gauge what a healthy, full-employment labor\nmarket looks like. The most common metric is the “natural rate” of unemployment—the optimal\nrate we can expect in a fully functioning economy. Before the recession, it was generally thought\nto be around 5 percent.1 Since then, there has been a lot of research examining whether the\nevents of the past decade have pushed the natural rate up—say, due to an increasing skills\nmismatch between workers and jobs—or down, owing to changes in the demographic makeup of\nthe labor force—that is, a greater representation in the workforce of groups that tend to have\nlower unemployment rates.2 My assessment is that there has not been any lasting, significant\n1 Weidner and Williams (2011).\n2 Aaronson et al. (2015), Daly et al. 2012, and Lazear and Spletzer (2012).\n2\n\nshift in either direction. My estimate of the natural rate of unemployment today is 5 percent,\nconsistent with pre-recession estimates. With the current rate at 5.1 percent, we are very close.\nTurning to inflation: It is still lower than I’d like. Based on my favorite measure—the\ntrimmed mean—the underlying rate is stable at just over 1½ percent. To understand why\ninflation has remained low despite an economy nearing full employment, we have to look\nbeyond our shores. The rise of the dollar and the fall in oil prices over the past year have lowered\nimport prices and pushed the inflation rate down. Based on past experience, these effects should\nprove transitory. As they dissipate, and as the economy strengthens further over the next year, I\nsee inflation moving back up to our 2 percent goal in the next two years.\nThere are upside risks to my forecast, specifically an even stronger and faster rebound in\nhousing and a more pronounced spending boom from lower energy prices. So far, lower oil\nprices haven’t caused much of a surge in consumption, but as people get used to paying less, that\ncould change. And there are, of course, the downside risks: There’s the threat of slowdowns and\nspillovers from abroad, and the dollar could appreciate further.\nOn raising rates\nThese domestic and global developments have implications for monetary policy. We’re\nbalancing a number of considerations, some of which argue for a little more patience in raising\nrates and others that argue for acting sooner rather than later. Our decisions reflect a careful\njudgment about the relative risks and merits of those factors.\nI’ll start with the arguments for being a bit more patient in removing monetary\naccommodation. For one, we are constrained by the zero lower bound in monetary policy and\nthis creates an asymmetry in our ability to respond to changing circumstances. That is, we can’t\n3\n\nmove rates much below zero if the economy slows or inflation declines even further. By contrast,\nif we delay, and growth or inflation pick up quickly, we can easily raise rates in response.3\nThis concern is exemplified by downside risks from abroad. Economic conditions and\npolicies from China to Europe to Brazil have contributed to a substantial increase in the dollar’s\nvalue. This has held back U.S. growth and inflation over the past year.4 Further bad news from\nabroad could add to these effects.\nInflation has been below our 2 percent target for more than three years now. This is not\nunique to the United States. Although we ultimately control our own inflation rate, there’s no\nquestion that globally low inflation, and the policy responses this has provoked, has contributed\nto downward pressure in the U.S. As I said, my forecast is that inflation will bounce back, but\nthis is just a forecast, and there is the risk that it could take longer than I expect. With inflation\npersistently running below our target, some argue that the need to start normalizing monetary\npolicy is not pressing.\nThose are some of the main arguments on the side of the ledger arguing for a little more\npatience. On the other side is the insight of Milton Friedman, who famously taught us that\nmonetary policy has long and variable lags.5 I like to use a car analogy to illustrate it. If you’re\nheaded towards a red light, you take your foot off the gas so you can get ready to stop. If you\ndon’t, you’re going to wind up slamming on the brakes and very possibly skidding into the\nintersection.\nIn addition, an earlier start to raising rates would allow us to engineer a smoother, more\ngradual process of policy normalization. That would give us space to fine-tune our responses to\nreact to economic conditions. In contrast, raising rates too late would force us into the position of\n3 Evans et al. (2015).\n4 See, for example, Amiti and Bodine-Smith (2015).\n5 Friedman (1961).\n4\n\na steeper and more abrupt path of rate hikes, which doesn’t leave much room for maneuver. Not\nto mention, it could roil financial markets and slow the economy in unintended ways.\nFinally, experience teaches us that an economy that runs beyond its potential for too long\ncan generate imbalances that ultimately lead to either excessive inflation or an economic\ncorrection and recession. Two recent examples are sobering. In the late-1990s, the expansion\nbecame increasingly fueled by the euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. In the first half of the 2000s, the economy\nbecame increasingly reliant on irrational exuberance over housing, resulting in house prices\nspiraling far beyond fundamentals and massive overbuilding. Of course, in both cases, those\nfantasies burst at great cost to our economy.\nI want to be clear that, in raising concerns about the potential for imbalances, I’m not\ntalking about fighting the last war. It is a more general point: When you have a high-pressure\neconomy, with unsustainably high levels of economic activity for a long period of time, people\nmay make decisions based on excessive optimism, rather than sound economic basics. That\nmentality can happen any time, but it’s emboldened by an economy that’s on a tear.\nI am starting to see signs of imbalances emerge in the form of high asset prices,\nespecially in real estate, and that trips the alert system. One lesson I have taken from past\nepisodes is that, once the imbalances have grown large, the options to deal with them are limited.\nI think back to the mid-2000s, when we faced the question of whether the Fed should raise rates\nand risk pricking the bubble or let things run full steam ahead and deal with the consequences\nlater. What stayed with me were not the relative merits of either case, but the fact that by then,\nwith the housing boom in full swing, it was already too late to avoid bad outcomes. Stopping the\nfallout would’ve required acting much earlier, when the problems were still manageable. I’m not\n5\n\nassigning blame by any means, and economic hindsight is always 20/20. But I am conscious that\ntoday, the house price-to-rent ratio is where it was in 2003, and house prices are rapidly rising. I\ndon’t think we’re at a tipping point yet—but I am looking at the path we’re on and looking out\nfor potential potholes.\nIn considering the FOMC’s monetary policy choices, it’s important to remember that\nwe’re in a very different place now than when we first instituted extremely accommodative\npolicy. The economy has come a long way since the dark days of late 2009. We’ve added over\n12 million jobs, more than 3 million of them last year. Even better, most of those were full-time.\nIt’s been a tough journey back, and monetary policy has played a crucial role in healing a once-\nailing economy.6\nIn the past, I have found the arguments for greater patience to clearly outweigh those for\nraising rates. The labor market was still far from full strength and the risk to the recovery’s\nmomentum was very real. As the economy closed in on full employment, the other side of the\nledger started gaining greater weight and the arguments have moved into closer balance.\nLooking forward, I expect that we’ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the\nnear future and inflation will gradually move back to our 2 percent goal. In that context, it will\nmake sense to gradually move away from the extraordinary stimulus that got us here. We already\ntook a step in that direction when we ended QE3. And given the progress we’ve made and\ncontinue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates,\nmost likely starting sometime later this year. Of course, that view is not immutable and will\nrespond to economic developments over time.\nWhat to expect when you’re expecting a new normal\n6 See Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n6\n\nAs we make our way back to an economy that’s at full health, it’s important to consider\nwhat constitutes a realistic view of the way things will look. The pace of employment growth, as\nwell as the decline in the unemployment rate, has slowed a bit recently…but that’s to be\nexpected. When unemployment was at its 10 percent peak during the height of the Great\nRecession, and as it struggled to come down during the recovery, we needed rapid declines to get\nthe economy back on track. Now that we’re getting closer, the pace must start slowing to more\nnormal levels. Looking to the future, we’re going to need at most 100,000 new jobs each month.7\nIn the mindset of the recovery, that sounds like nothing; but in the context of a healthy economy,\nit’s what’s needed for stable growth.\nAs the next year unfolds, what we want to see is an economy that’s growing at a steady\npace of around 2 percent. If jobs and growth kept the same pace as last year, we would seriously\novershoot our mark. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and it’s\nactually desirable, that the pace is slowing.\nConclusion\nThe economy is on solid footing and a good trajectory. There are risks, as there always\nare in life. And there’s always the possibility of what British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan\nsaid when asked what worried him most: “Events, dear boy, events.” But all in all, things are\nlooking up, and if they stay on track, I see this as the year we start the process of monetary policy\nnormalization.\nThank you.\n7 Aaronson et al.

    "text": "Presentation to the University of San Diego School of Business Administration\nSan Diego, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 3, 2012\nMonetary Policy and the Slow Recovery: It’s Not Just About Housing\nThank you. It’s a particular pleasure to be with you this morning. The subject of my talk\ntoday is the outlook for the economy and Federal Reserve policy. I’ll start with a look at the\nnational economy, focusing on why the recent recession was so severe and why the recovery has\nbeen relatively anemic. I’ll then talk about prospects for growth, employment, and inflation.\nFinally, I’ll discuss what the Federal Reserve is doing to bolster the recovery. My remarks\nrepresent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me begin by saying that I’m encouraged by recent signs of a stronger, self-sustaining\nrecovery. I’m especially glad to see that the economy is adding jobs at a pretty decent clip. Still,\nwe have a long way to go. The Fed’s mandate from Congress is to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices.1 Inflation generally has been subdued over the past few years.\nBut, more than four years after the recession began, the unemployment rate is still 8.3 percent,\nleaving us far short of our employment goal. The Fed has acted vigorously to boost the\neconomy. It’s critical that we keep doing so in order to achieve our statutory mandate.\nI’d like to start with a little bit of history. We are in the aftermath of the worst financial\ncrisis and economic downturn since the Great Depression. The downturn came in the wake of an\nunprecedented run-up in housing prices, followed by a traumatic collapse. Although the\nrecession started with this burst housing bubble, the economy’s problems over the past few years\n1 Williams (2012b).\n1\n\nhave extended well beyond housing. In the broad sense, what we’ve seen has been a sharp fall in\nhousehold and business demand for goods and services. That has caused the economy to\nperform well below its potential.\nLet’s look at this in more detail. The housing boom was a classic financial bubble, fueled\nby speculative excess. Buyers kept bidding up prices, convinced they could sell for more than\nthey paid. Lenders enabled this behavior by offering excessively easy terms. The growth in\nhouse prices outstripped anything that could be supported by market fundamentals, such as\nhousehold incomes or rental rates on comparable properties.\nThe inevitable crash landed with a resounding thud. Beginning in 2006, home prices\nplummeted. Eventually they fell by about a third nationally. About a quarter of borrowers found\nthemselves under water, owing more than their homes were worth. Large chunks of the wealth\nof tens of millions of Americans vanished. Overall, the destruction of net worth from housing\nequaled more than 40 percent of the value of annual U.S. production.\nWhen wealth is destroyed on such a vast scale, the economic effects are severe. During\nthe boom, higher house prices helped fuel consumption as people tapped home equity to buy\ncars, boats, vacations, and the like. When house prices did a U-turn, households hunkered down.\nThey cut spending and salted away more savings to rebuild lost wealth. And that wasn’t the\nhousing bust’s only depressing effect. By early 2009, home construction had plunged by over 75\npercent from its 2006 high. It’s remained near historical lows since. That’s put a lid on demand\nfor construction materials and home furnishings. And it’s kept millions of carpenters, plumbers,\nand others in construction and real estate out of work.\n2\n\nIt’s impossible to understand the economy of the past few years without taking into\naccount these housing effects.2 Consider the difference in economic performance between states\nhit hard by the housing bust and states that got off relatively lightly. Figure 1 shows price\ndeclines by state. The hardest hit states, including Nevada, Arizona, California, and Florida, are\nshown in red. Prices in these states plunged by 40 percent or more from their peaks. By\ncontrast, the states shown in green posted price declines of less than 15 percent. In one green\nstate, North Dakota, prices actually increased.\nFigure 2 shows the drop in employment during the downturn by state, using the same\ncolor coding as Figure 1. For example, in the hard-hit states, shown in red here, employment fell\nby 8 percent or more. The overlap with the pattern of house price declines is striking. The states\nwhere home prices fell most were generally among those that suffered the worst job losses\nduring the recession. In states where prices fell less, employment declined less.3\nTo be sure, this overlap was not perfect. Employment fell in all but North Dakota and\nAlaska, with sharp declines registered even in some states where the housing bust wasn’t harsh.\nExamples include Indiana, Ohio, and South Carolina. One reason this happened is the tight web\nthat binds economic activity in far-flung places in the modern world.4 When under water\nhomeowners in the Central Valley put off buying new cars, auto workers in Indiana may lose\ntheir jobs.\nBut, what is fascinating, and perhaps surprising, is this: The close relationship between\nthe fall in home prices and state economic activity has largely disappeared during the recovery.5\n2 See, for example, Mian and Sufi (2011), Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011), and Feroli et al. (2012).\n3 Williams (2012a).\n4 Mian and Sufi (2011).\n5 Williams (2012a).\n3\n\nFigure 3 shows state employment gains during the rebound. There’s almost no systematic\nrelationship between employment growth and home price declines.\nFigure 4 reinforces this. The blue line measures the gap in employment growth rates\nbetween states where the job market has been relatively stronger and states where it has been\nweaker. This gap grew sharply during the recession, reflecting in part the uneven effects of the\nhousing bust. But, during the recovery, the gap has been smaller than at any time since the mid-\n1970s. In other words, across the country, state-level employment growth has become quite\nbalanced.\nThese comparisons indicate that the economy faces obstacles that are national in scope.\nThe slow pace of expansion has affected all regions of the country. During the recovery, states\nwhere house price declines have been relatively mild have not done noticeably better than states\nwhere housing got hammered. Powerful forces have kept us stuck in a slow-growth pattern.\nSome of those forces reflect the direct effects of the housing collapse on household finances.\nThe connection with housing is less direct for other forces holding back the economy. I’ll\nhighlight three of those forces: tight credit, uncertainty, and government contraction.\nTight credit was clearly a product of the housing bust. But it took on a life of its own\nwhen fallout from housing almost brought down the global financial system in 2008. The\nrepercussions of those dramatic events still affect markets today. Let me explain how this played\nout.\nWhen home prices crashed, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures surged. Exposure\nto risky U.S. subprime mortgages was spread globally through investments held by financial\ninstitutions. Those mortgages had been repackaged to create financial instruments of mind-\nbending complexity. When the music stopped, it was hard to tell who was left with all those\n4\n\ntoxic assets. Financial institutions became afraid to lend money to anybody, including other\nfinancial institutions. The result was a massive credit crunch that choked off the flow of funds\nfinancial institutions and nonfinancial businesses depend on for their day-to-day operations.\nMany financial institutions that had placed big bets on housing posted massive losses. Some of\nthem failed.\nThankfully, central banks and governments around the world stepped in to provide\nemergency loans and other support. Those interventions prevented complete financial collapse.\nIn the United States, the financial system has healed to a very considerable extent. The Fed\nrecently conducted a series of tests on the largest U.S. banks. We found that most of them would\nhave adequate capital even if the economy went through another extreme downturn.\nAs financial institutions have regained their footing, access to credit has improved.\nNevertheless, we haven’t returned to normal. Many small businesses and consumers still\nstruggle to get loans. For example, to get a mortgage, a borrower must have a top-notch credit\nrating and the cash to make a substantial down payment.\nUncertainty is a second factor holding back the recovery. Businesses, investors, and\nhouseholds remain skittish, even in the face of better economic news. Many of my business\ncontacts say they remain cautious about expanding because they’re unsure about future\nconditions. Ordinary Americans worry about job prospects and future income. Everybody is\nunsettled by the highly charged political environment.\nFinancial turmoil in Europe has added another dimension to the unease here. The\nimminent threat of European financial meltdown has diminished. But the underlying problem of\ncountries with unsustainable debt has not been resolved. Over the next few years, the total debt\nload among countries that use the euro will grow larger. I’ve heard Europe’s policy described as\n5\n\nkicking the can down the road. But the risk is that Europe might be rolling an ever-growing\nsnowball down a hill.\nGovernment cutbacks are a third obstacle to growth. Typically, government spending\nrises when the economy turns down. That’s because the cost of safety net programs, such as\nunemployment insurance, go up. And sometimes governments deliberately boost spending to\nstimulate the economy. But the federal government’s long-term budget problems loom large.\nAnd state and local government finances are reeling from the economic downturn. As a result,\ngovernment stimulus has been unusually limited.\nFigure 5 compares recent inflation-adjusted spending by state and local governments with\npast periods. The red line represents the most recent recession and recovery. The shaded region\nportrays the range of outcomes over the eight previous recessions and recoveries, with the\naverage displayed in black. During the current period, the housing bust has cut into the revenue\nof state and local governments, forcing them to slash spending.6 That contrasts with comparable\nperiods in the past, when such spending typically increased.\nI don’t see government spending turning around soon. Indeed, spending at the federal\nlevel is set to contract sharply at the end of this year as several temporary programs end. Some\nof those programs may be extended. But, overall, we can expect federal spending trends to\nweigh on near-term economic growth.\nHowever, things are getting better as far as tight credit and uncertainty are concerned.\nImprovements in credit, and rises in business and consumer confidence, have helped the\neconomy gain real traction. We can see the improvement in the data. Consumer spending hasn’t\nbeen growing fast, but it’s been growing steadily. Car sales have surged and nearly reached pre-\n6 Feroli et al. (2012).\n6\n\nrecession levels in February. The rebound in car sales and strong exports of other goods have\nhelped U.S. manufacturers create jobs at the fastest pace since the mid-1990s.\nReal gross domestic product measures the nation’s total output of goods and services\nadjusted for inflation. During the first half of 2011, real GDP expanded at just under a 1 percent\nannual rate. Then, in the second half, it shifted into higher gear, rising at nearly a 2½ percent\npace. My forecast calls for GDP growth to pick up further to about 2½ percent this year and 2¾\npercent in 2013. That’s not overdrive, but it does represent improvement.\nAs I said earlier, the news from the labor market has been heartening. The jobless rate\nhas fallen about three-quarters of a percentage point since August and is now at its lowest level\nin three years. Unfortunately, the kind of moderate economic growth I expect won’t sustain such\nrapid progress. The February unemployment rate held steady at 8.3 percent. I expect\nunemployment rates to remain around 8 percent through year-end. And we’re still likely to be\naround 7 percent at the end of 2014. We haven’t had such a long period of high unemployment\nin the United States since the Great Depression. And this phenomenon is widespread.\nCompared with December 2007, when the recession began, the unemployment rate is up in all 50\nstates. That’s true even in North Dakota and Alaska, the two states where total employment\ngrew during the recession.\nEconomists have been debating why unemployment has been so high during this\nrecovery. Broadly speaking, they fall into two camps. One group argues that changes in the\nstructure of the economy are pushing up the unemployment rate. The other group maintains that\nhigh unemployment is the result of a severe downturn, which significantly cut demand for goods\nand services.\n7\n\nThose who favor a structural explanation point out that many job seekers lack the skills\nemployers need. For example, computer industry employers are having a hard time finding\nqualified workers. But they’re not likely to find such employees in the ranks of jobless\nconstruction workers. If such labor market mismatches are widespread, they could be boosting\nthe unemployment rate.\nTo put this in perspective, I’m going to introduce the concept of the natural rate of\nunemployment. The natural rate is basically an equilibrium jobless rate that pushes inflation\nneither up, nor down. Before the recession, most economists thought this rate was around 5\npercent. Today though, economists in the structural camp argue that the natural rate has risen\nsubstantially, largely because of the labor market mismatches I described. The idea is that a lot\nof people are unemployed not because jobs are lacking, but because those jobs require skills\nunemployed workers don’t have. If this were correct, then our 8.3 percent unemployment rate\nmight not be that far above the natural unemployment rate. In other words, we might not really\nbe so far from the Fed’s goal of maximum sustainable employment.\nI’m not convinced. Research at the San Francisco and New York Feds suggests that job\nmismatches are limited in scope. The difficulty some Silicon Valley companies find hiring\nsoftware engineers is not enough to fundamentally transform the labor market. Now, other\nfactors besides skill mismatches may also have helped push up the natural unemployment rate.\nOver the longer term, mismatches and other labor market inefficiencies may have raised the\nnatural unemployment rate from about 5 percent to around 6 to 6½ percent.7 So, in my view, the\nnation remains far from the Fed’s goal of maximum sustainable employment.\n7 See, for example, Daly et al. (2012) and Weidner and Williams (2011).\n8\n\nThe Fed’s other goal is to keep prices stable. I would say that we’ve succeeded pretty\nwell on that score. Inflation overall has been well-contained. Taking a long view, over the past\n15 years, the overall inflation rate has averaged almost exactly 2 percent, which is the Fed’s\ntarget rate of inflation. The same is true of the past five years, a tumultuous period of crisis,\nrecession, and recovery.\nNow, it’s true that inflation picked up to 2½ percent last year as the prices of oil and other\ncommodities surged in the face of strong global demand. Oil prices have run up again recently\nin response to geopolitical concerns. But other commodity prices have not generally followed\nsuit. I expect inflation to be near our 2 percent target this year and edge down a bit toabout 1½\npercent in 2013.\nLet me summarize where the Fed stands in terms of achieving its congressionally\nmandated goals. We are far below maximum employment and are likely to remain there for\nsome time. The housing bust and financial crisis set in motion an extraordinarily harsh\nrecession, which has held down consumer, businesses, and government spending. By contrast,\ninflation is contained and may even fall next year below our 2 percent target.\nUnder these circumstances, it’s essential that we keep strong monetary stimulus in place.\nThe recovery has been sluggish nationwide, not just in states hit hard by the housing bust. High\nunemployment, restrained demand, and idle production capacity are national in scope. These are\njust the sorts of problems monetary policy can address. And we don’t need to worry that our\nstimulative monetary policy could fuel regional imbalances.\nMonetary policy works by raising and lowering interest rates. The Fed’s policymaking\nbody is the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. In December 2008, when the\nrecession’s full force hit, the FOMC slashed its benchmark interest rate close to zero. It’s been\n9\n\nthere since. Standard monetary policy guidelines tell us this rate should have gone deep into\nnegative territory. But that’s not possible.8\nSo the Fed has had to find other ways to stimulate the economy. One measure we’ve\nadopted has been to buy large quantities of longer-term securities issued by the U.S. government\nand mortgage agencies. Our purchases have raised demand for these securities, lowering their\nyields. And that has put downward pressure on other longer-term interest rates, making it\ncheaper for households, businesses, and governments to borrow.\nThese policy actions have been effective. For example, recent gains in automobile sales\nhave a lot to do with cheap financing. And our securities purchases have helped drive longer-\nterm interest rates near to post-World War II lows. In particular, our purchases of mortgage-\nrelated securities appear to have lowered home loan rates significantly.9 Low mortgage rates\nhave been crucial in stabilizing home sales and construction.\nI should emphasize that our unusually stimulative monetary policy won’t last forever.\nEventually, as recovery picks up, we will trim our securities holdings and raise our interest rate\ntarget. We’ve planned in detail for this, and we’re confident we can do it in a timely and\neffective fashion.10 But, that time is still well off in the future.\nWe’ve passed through extraordinary economic times that have required extraordinary\nresponses from the Fed. We’re not miracle workers. Lower interest rates alone can’t instantly\nput the economy right. But things would be much worse if we hadn’t acted so forcefully. We\n8 See Rudebusch (2009) and Chung et al. (2012) for discussion of the effects of the zero bound on interest\nrate policy in the recession, and Swanson and Williams (2012) for estimates of the effects of constrained\nmonetary policy.\n9 Hancock and Passmore (2011) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) find significant effects\nof mortgage-backed securities purchases. Stroebel and Taylor (2009), by contrast, do not.\n10 See, for example, the discussion of exit strategy in the minutes for the June 2011 FOMC meeting\n(Board of Governors 2011).\n10\n\nwere vigilant in 2008 and 2009 when the economy was in dire straits. We remain vigilant now,\nwhen the economy is showing real signs of improvement, sharply focused on our goals of\nmaximum sustainable employment and price stability. Thank you very much.\n11\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2011. “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.” June 21–22.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20110622.htm\nChung, Hess, Jean-Philippe Laforte, David Reifschneider, and John C.

    "text": "Presentation to the 2017 Economic Forecast, sponsored by Sacramento Business Review and\nSacramento Business Journal, Sacramento, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 17, 2017\nLooking Back, Looking Ahead\nGood afternoon. It’s great to be back in my hometown of Sacramento, and especially here\nat CSU Sacramento. My family has strong ties to Sac State going back to its earliest days. My\nfather received his undergraduate degree in 1950 when classes were held in rented space at\nSacramento Junior College. My mother worked in the English department for many years. And\nmy brother did both—he earned his business degree here while an employee of the university. I\ngrew up near the campus and fondly recall biking over the Guy West Bridge to take advantage of\nthe tennis and racquetball courts.\nToday I’ll cover the progress the U.S. economy has made, where I see things headed, and\nwhat this means for monetary policy. Before I proceed, I should note that the views I express\nhere are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve\nSystem. With that disclaimer out of the way, I’ll get started.\nThrough the lens of the dual mandate\nAs a Federal Reserve policymaker, I tend to look at virtually everything through the lens\nof our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability, and I’ll describe\neconomic developments—past, present, and future—through that lens.\nI’ll begin with maximum employment. Of course, this doesn’t require that every man,\nwoman, and child work 24/7, 365 days of the year. Instead, it means we have a number of jobs\nconsistent with a vibrant, healthy economy. Economists tend to think of this in terms of\nunemployment, rather than employment. Put in those terms, our goal isn’t to have an\n1\n\nunemployment rate of zero. Instead, it’s to be near what economists call the “natural rate” of\nunemployment, the level where the economy is running neither too hot nor too cold. It’s\nimpossible to know exactly what that magic number is, but it’s generally thought to be between\n4¾ and 5 percent today.1 By the way, that’s about the same number that economists typically\nthought before the recession, so in this one respect the economy hasn’t changed much over the\npast decade.\nWith the national unemployment rate now at 4.7 percent, we’ve reached that goal. It’s\nworth pausing a moment to reflect on this accomplishment. We are now in the eighth year of the\neconomic expansion. The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in the fall of 2009 in the\naftermath of the Great Recession. Since then, it’s fallen by more than half, as the economy added\nover 15½ million jobs.\nI’ve been talking about the national economy so far, but the improvement in the\nSacramento labor market has also been dramatic. This area was very hard hit by the housing\ncrash and recession and the unemployment rate in the Sacramento metropolitan area soared to\n12.5 percent in 2010. Over the past six years, things have improved, with the metro area adding\nover 120,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropping to near 5 percent.\nDespite the progress here and across the country, there has been considerable debate\nwhether the standard unemployment rate accurately reflects the strength of the labor market. In\nparticular, some commentators are concerned that a large number of people are standing on the\nsidelines of the labor market, neither working nor officially counted as unemployed. They point\n1 In the December 2016 Summary of Economic Projections, the central tendency of estimates of the long-run level\nof the unemployment rate ranged between 4.7 and 5 percent (Board of Governors 2016a). The Congressional Budget\nOffice estimates the natural rate to be 4¾ percent as of August (CBO 2016). The median estimate from the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters in August 2016 was 4.8 percent (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/2016/survq316). The Blue Chip Economic Indicators\nestimate is 4.8 percent as of October 2016.\n2\n\nto the sizable decline in the labor force participation rate, which measures the fraction of the\npopulation age 16 and over that has a job or is looking for one. The low level of labor force\nparticipation raises the possibility that lots of potential workers may still be waiting for the job\nmarket to improve further before rejoining the labor market.\nCloser examination of this question indicates that the low participation rate is mostly\nexplained by long-term trends, such as the wave of baby boomer retirements and young people\nstaying longer in school.2 Staff at the San Francisco Fed along with other researchers have\ndelved deeper into this issue. They took a different tack by treating everybody in the population\nas potentially in the labor force and constructing a broader unemployment rate—a “non-\nemployment index.”3 This measure incorporates the unemployed and nonparticipants alike,\nbased on their respective tendency to find jobs. For example, many folks who are out of the labor\nforce say they want a job but are not currently looking for various reasons, while others are in\nschool or retired from a career and may return to work later. When one carefully accounts for the\navailability of nonparticipants this way, the resulting broad non-employment index is consistent\nwith a labor market at full strength.\nThis conclusion is reinforced by survey evidence from regular people—by which I mean\nnot just economists. When asked how hard it is to find a job, households’ responses are currently\nright in line with, or even a little better than, the signal we’re getting from the unemployment\nrate.4\nThat’s great news about the job market, and it means that we won’t need as much job\ngrowth going forward as we’ve seen in the past few years. Because we’re at maximum\n2 See for example Aaronson et al. (2014), Fujita (2014).\n3 Hornstein, Kudlyak, and Lange (2016).\n4 Data are from the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey (https://www.conference-\nboard.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm). See Weidner and Williams (2011).\n3\n\nemployment now, the future is less about creating an ever stronger labor market, and more about\nmaintaining a healthy one. That means creating enough new jobs to keep up with the increase in\nthe size of the labor force. That number depends on things like the number of people retiring this\nyear or graduating from school and entering the workforce. Relative to past decades, labor force\ngrowth has slowed substantially due to an aging population, stabilization in women’s\nparticipation in the labor force, and other factors. As a result, the number of new jobs we need\nhas dropped as well. I put it at around 80,000 a month currently. Looking ahead, estimates that\ntake account of likely labor force trends imply a range from 50,000 to a little over 100,000.5\nLast year job gains averaged about 180,000 a month. That’s more than twice as fast as we\nneed to keep up with the trend in labor force growth and, quite honestly, is unsustainable in the\nlong run. With job gains continuing to outpace labor force growth for some time, I expect the\nunemployment rate to edge down over the next year, bottoming out around 4½ percent—a very\nstrong labor market by any standard. Looking further into the future, I expect job gains to slow to\na pace more in line with the growth in the labor force.\nI have focused on the labor market so far, so I’ll turn briefly to the outlook for GDP\ngrowth. Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP increased by 2 percent last year, and I expect growth this\nyear and next year to slow somewhat to a pace close its trend rate. My estimate of trend GDP\ngrowth is between 1½ and 1¾ percent per year, which reflects slowing longer-run trends in labor\nforce and productivity growth.6\nTurning to our second mandate of price stability, the Fed’s monetary policy committee—\nthe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short—has set a long-run goal of 2 percent\n5 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (2016). See also Aaronson, Brave, and Kelley (2016).\n6 Fernald (2016).\n4\n\ninflation.7 Inflation has been running persistently below that goal for several years. Over the past\ncouple of years, the strengthening of the dollar and declines in energy prices have pushed\ninflation down, but these influences have been fading. To cut through some of the noise, it’s\nuseful to look at measures of inflation that strip out volatile prices and provide a clearer view of\nthe underlying trend. These suggest that underlying inflation is running about 1¾ percent. So,\nwe’re not quite at our target yet, but we’re getting closer. The combination of fading transitory\nfactors and a strong economy should help us get back to our 2 percent goal in the next couple of\nyears.\nTo sum up, the economic expansion remains on track well into its eighth year. The labor\nmarket is strong, the economy has good forward momentum, and inflation is moving towards our\ngoal. There are, of course, risks to the outlook—there always are. No forecaster has a perfect\ncrystal ball. Although much of the discussion of late has been about uncertainty regarding fiscal\nand other federal policies, there are numerous other factors both domestic and abroad that may\ncause our economy to do better or worse than currently predicted. But I, like most of my\ncolleagues, view these as both broadly similar in magnitude to the past and roughly balanced\nbetween the upside and the downside.8\nMonetary policy\nSo, taking this all together, what does it mean for interest rates? As I said at the start, I\nlook at this through the lens of the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price\nstability. In the context of a strong economy that has reached our maximum employment goal\nand with inflation nearing our price stability goal, it makes sense that the FOMC has undertaken\na process of raising interest rates from their historical low levels. We’ve made two rate hikes so\n7 Board of Governors (2016b).\n8 Board of Governors (2016a).\n5\n\nfar, the most recent at our December FOMC meeting, bringing the target range for the federal\nfunds rate to 50–75 basis points. This rate increase was an appropriate small step in the process\nof removing monetary stimulus put in place during the recession.\nEven with the most recent increase in interest rates, the stance of monetary policy\ncontinues to support economic growth. Looking ahead, further gradual increases in the target fed\nfunds rate will likely be appropriate to bring monetary policy back to a more normal setting\nconsistent with an economy at full strength. I should be clear: In arguing for gradual increases in\ninterest rates over the next few years, I’m not aiming to stall the economic expansion. In fact, it’s\njust the opposite: My aim is to keep it on a sound footing so that it can be sustained for as long as\npossible.9\nHistory teaches us that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate\nimbalances, eventually leading to excessive inflation, asset market bubbles, and ultimately\neconomic correction and recession. A gradual process of raising rates reduces the risks of such\nan outcome. It also allows a smoother, more calibrated process of normalization that gives us\nspace to adjust our responses to any surprise changes in economic conditions. If we wait too long\nto remove monetary accommodation, we hazard allowing imbalances to grow, requiring us to\nplay catch-up, and not leaving much room to maneuver. Not to mention, a sudden reversal of\npolicy could be disruptive and slow the economy in unintended ways.\nAs I said, my goal is to sustain the economic expansion. The best way to accomplish that\nis by supporting a pace of growth consistent with the economy’s potential and 2 percent\ninflation. I fear that if we allow the economy to overshoot this mark by too much, eventually we\nwill need to reverse course to bring the economy back on track. The experience of past business\n9 See Williams (2016) for further discussion.\n6\n\ncycles shows that this is a hard, if not impossible, act to pull off, and ultimately ends in\nrecession. A gradual process of removing monetary accommodation reduces this risk.\nSummary\nAlthough it has been a long, hard road back from the recession, the American economy is\nin good shape and headed in the right direction. We’ve reached our employment goal, and\ninflation is well within sight of and on track to reach our target. Given the progress we have\nmade and signs of continued solid momentum in the economy, and consistent with our agreed-\nupon monetary policy approach, it makes sense for the Fed to gradually move interest rates\ntoward more normal levels. As always, the actual pace of rate increases will be driven by the\nevolution of economic conditions and its implications for achieving our dual mandate objectives.\nThank you.\n7\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher. 2014. “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects.” Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197–255.\nhttp://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/fall-2014/fall2014bpea_aaronson_et_al.pdf\nAaronson, Daniel, Scott A.

    "text": "Presentation to the Deutsche Bundesbank Conference Housing Markets and the Macroeconomy:\nChallenges for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability\nEltville am Rhein, Germany\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on June 5, 2014\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy: Happy Marriage or Untenable Union?\nThank you. It’s great to be here, both for the scenic setting in the Rheingau and for the\nchance to discuss the primary issues facing central bankers with an outstanding group of scholars\nand policymakers. Standing here today, I can’t help but think how nice it would be if the San\nFrancisco Fed had a study center in the Napa Valley. Alas.\nOf late, central bankers can’t seem to get enough talk about financial stability and its\nconnections to monetary policy. At the Federal Reserve, policymakers often point to financial\nstability concerns as relevant to their monetary policy decisions, especially in the context of the\ncurrent extraordinarily accommodative stance of policy. At the Bank of England, the Monetary\nPolicy Committee’s statement included an explicit financial stability escape clause for their bank\nrate forward guidance.1 The Norges Bank explicitly incorporates financial stability in its\nmonetary policy discussions and decisions. And the Riksbank’s very public policy deliberations\nhave centered on the tradeoffs between, and the appropriate balancing of, macroeconomic and\nfinancial stability goals.\nIn my remarks today, therefore, I will discuss what I view as the key issues regarding the\nappropriate role of monetary policy in supporting financial stability. I’ll also highlight some\nspecific directions in which further progress is badly needed. As ever, the views represented are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n1 See Bank of England (2013).\n1\n\nBefore I proceed, I should make clear what I mean by financial stability. Given that I’m\nin Germany, I’ll quote the European Central Bank’s definition: “as a condition in which the\nfinancial system—comprising of financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures—is\ncapable of withstanding shocks, thereby reducing the likelihood of disruptions in the financial\nintermediation process which are severe enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings\nto profitable investment opportunities.”2 In retrospect, the global financial system clearly did not\nmeet this definition of financial stability when confronted by the Lehman shock and subsequent\nevents of late 2008.\nThe heightened attention to the connections between monetary policy and financial\nstability represents a sea change from the consensus that was reached in the years preceding the\nglobal financial crisis. Back then, central bankers were nearly unanimous in their undying faith\nand fealty to a variant of inflation targeting, whereby monetary policy should be single-mindedly\nfocused on price stability (and, usually more quietly, macroeconomic stabilization). Financial\nstability was generally viewed as a potentially dangerous distraction, risking the central bank’s\nattention to, and credibility in, achieving its price-stability mandate. Indeed, this approach was\ncodified in numerous central bank charters, which in some cases dictated consequences if the\ninflation goal was not met. Even at the Federal Reserve, where inflation targeting was never\nformally adopted, financial stability was rarely discussed at monetary policy meetings during the\nrun-up to the financial crisis.3\nInstead, policymakers and the segment of the economics profession interested in central\nbanking focused on the task of attaining and preserving price and economic stability. An\n2 This is taken from the European Central Bank website: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/fsr/html/index.en.html\n3 See Fligstein et al. (2014) for a textual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee transcripts in the years before\nthe global financial crisis.\n2\n\nenormous effort went into theoretical and empirical research on best practice monetary policy\nstrategies within this general framework. This research was completely abstracted from any\nconcerns related to financial stability.\nThe elevation of financial stability concerns at central banks and other regulatory\nagencies is a natural reaction to the events of the global financial crisis, when the near-meltdown\nof the financial systems in many countries almost toppled the global economy. Even with the\ndramatic—and in many cases, unprecedented—actions of governments and central banks, the\nfallout from the financial crisis has been greater and longer-lasting than had been experienced in\ngenerations. Indeed, this renewed concern for financial stability represents more a return to the\nroots of central banking than new-age thinking. After all, the Federal Reserve was created from\nthe ashes of the panics and resulting depressions that tormented the U.S. economy in the late 19th\nand early 20th centuries.\nThe renewed recognition of the importance of preserving financial stability is entirely\nappropriate and perhaps long overdue. However, the current discussion of the relationship\nbetween financial stability and monetary policy has mostly lacked rigorous theoretical and\nempirical analysis. Unlike the extensive literature on monetary policy rules and optimal\nmonetary policy, our understanding of the interactions and tradeoffs between monetary policy\nand risks to financial stability remains limited and, to put it bluntly, unsatisfactory, given what’s\nat stake. We all talk about the need to account for financial stability in thinking about monetary\npolicy, but, to borrow a phrase from American TV lore: “Where’s the beef?”\nI see three key issues around the role of monetary policy in financial stability. The first\nis: What are the costs of using monetary policy actions to address perceived or potential risks to\n3\n\nfinancial stability? The second is: How do monetary policy actions affect financial stability\nrisks? And, third: Can monetary policy be designed to improve these tradeoffs?\nTradeoffs between macroeconomic and financial stability goals\nI’ll start with the question of the costs of using monetary policy to address financial\nstability risks. Perhaps this issue is best illustrated by the ongoing debates at the Riksbank\nregarding the appropriate course for monetary policy. In using this example, I am in no way\njudging the decisions that have been made; rather I am using it as a timely real-world illustration\nof this issue. As background, Sweden’s economy has experienced inflation persistently below\ntarget, accompanied by extremely high and growing household debt. In a nutshell, the Sveriges\nRiksbank has undertaken a somewhat tighter stance of monetary policy than it would were it\nbased purely on macroeconomic conditions. This has resulted in a more gradual return to\ninflation and unemployment goals, in order to reduce potential risks to financial stability\nstemming from Sweden’s very high level of household debt.4\nThis situation is not unique: Financial stability considerations have played out in Norway\nas well. In its latest Monetary Policy Report, the Norges Bank frames its policy decision as\nfollows: “Both the objective of keeping consumer price inflation close to 2.5% and the objective\nof sustaining capacity utilization in the years ahead could in isolation imply a somewhat lower\nkey policy rate forecast… On the other hand, a lower key policy rate may increase the risk of a\nfurther buildup of financial imbalances.”5\nThese decisions have clear and important costs in terms of achieving unemployment and\ninflation goals. For example, Lars Svensson (2013, and references therein) uses model\n4 See Sveriges Riksbank (2014, p. 17) for a recent description of these considerations.\n5 Norges Bank, (2014, p. 16).\n4\n\nsimulations to show that the monetary policy actions of the Riksbank, based on a concern for\nfinancial stability, have induced a significantly higher rate of unemployment and a sustained\nshortfall of inflation relative to its target. He goes on to argue that the policy, by reducing\nincome, has actually increased the already high household debt-to-income ratio, potentially\nexacerbating financial stability risks.6\nPreserving the nominal anchor\nTurning to the risks: The costs of modifying the stance of monetary policy in deference to\nfinancial stability considerations may be even greater than those implied by cyclical deviations\nof inflation and economic activity from desired levels. If the central bank actions aimed at\naddressing financial stability risks are large and persistent, the inflation rate will likely deviate\nfrom target for many years. The protracted failure to deliver on the inflation objective could\nundermine the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to its inflation target and unmoor\ninflation expectations (Levin 2014).\nParticularly worrisome are the incipient signs that inflation expectations are slipping in\ncountries that have emphasized financial stability in monetary policy deliberations. Figure 1\nshows survey data on longer-run measures of inflation expectations for the United States, the\neuro area, Norway, and Sweden.7 Longer-run inflation expectations have remained very stable\nin the United States and euro area, despite the tumult of the global financial and Euro crises and\nthe subsequent aggressive monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the ECB. In\ncontrast, Norway and Sweden have seen some slippage in long-run inflation expectations below\n6 It is not clear how much the concern for financial stability affects Norges Bank decisions. They combine concerns\nfor financial stability and for robustness to uncertainty together in describing the deviation from a policy path\ndevoted purely to price stability and capacity utilization goals (Norges Bank, 2014, pp. 20-21).\n7 This chart is based on that in Levin (2014).\n5\n\ntarget levels over the past year or so, based on this survey.8 This follows a long period of\nrealized inflation averaging below-target levels and central bank communication that financial\nstability concerns have been affecting policy decisions.\nAlthough this evidence is far from dispositive, it is an apt reminder of the potential long-\nrun costs of losing sight of the price stability mandate. The steadfastness of the nominal anchor\nin most advanced economies was a key factor in central banks’ ability to keep inflation low and\nstable during and after the global financial crisis. It was forged over many years of consistent\ncommitment to price stability and successfully fighting the inflation dragon. If the anchor were\nto slip, it would wreak lasting damage to a central bank’s control over both inflation and\neconomic activity, at considerable cost to the economy. This applies equally to deviations above\nand below the target.\nAlthough the costs of using monetary policy to address financial stability risks are clear\nand potentially sizable, the benefits are much harder to pin down. In part this is due to the\nchallenge inherent in analyzing and measuring tail risks. But, importantly, it also reflects the\nshortcomings of standard macroeconomic models that entirely abstract from risks to financial\nstability and are therefore silent on how monetary policy may affect these risks.\nMost standard macro models, such as DSGE models, generally used for monetary policy\nanalysis simply lack the channels by which interest rates could potentially create risks to the\nfinancial system and thereby ultimately to the economy.9 The consensus framework is built on a\nfoundation of optimizing agents, rational expectations, and frictionless financial markets. This\n8 I should note that other surveys show smaller downward movements in long-run inflation expectations. See\nNorges Bank (2014) and Sveriges Riksbank (2014).\n9 This is not to say that there are no models that make these connections. See, for example, Adrian and Shin (2008)\nand references therein. However, these channels have yet to be adopted more broadly in analysis of monetary\npolicy.\n6\n\napproach assumes that asset markets clear through arbitrage-free relationships. Deviations from\nfundamentals are either assumed away or buried in exogenous risk premia. Such a framework\nseverely limits one’s ability to think deeply about how monetary policy actions could affect risks\nto financial stability.\nI recognize that this situation is changing, with new theories and approaches being\ndeveloped as I speak, and I find this encouraging. Indeed, the papers at this conference represent\nimportant strides in developing theories that can help illuminate the interactions of monetary\npolicy and financial stability. But much, much more needs to be done.\nBehavioral economics and asset prices\nLet me highlight one issue that I see as particularly important in thinking about how\nmonetary policy may affect risks to financial stability: the modeling of asset prices. Standard\nasset price theory tells us that an increase in asset prices must reflect either an increase in\nexpected future dividends or a reduction in the expected return on the asset. But the evidence is\nat odds with this prediction. Elevated levels of equity and house prices are not typically\nassociated with higher future dividend growth rates or lower expected returns, based on\nsurveys.10 Something else is going on.\nOne way to decipher this breakdown in the standard model is to relax the assumption of\nrational expectations and allow people’s decisions to be driven by their perceptions of what the\nfuture may hold, whether grounded in reality or not. In particular, the empirical evidence\nindicates that people tend to extrapolate future stock price movements from recent stock price\nperformance (Greenwood and Shleifer 2013, Williams 2013). Figure 2 plots the degree of\n10 See Williams (2013) for further discussion and references to the literature.\n7\n\ninvestor optimism about future stock market gains from a Gallup survey against the trailing 12-\nmonth change in the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock price index. The correlation is highly positive.\nIn fact, the worst reading for the investor optimism index for the period shown in the figure\noccurred in early 2009, just as the stock market plunged to its recession low and was on the\nverge of a remarkable rebound. The highest reading of investor optimism occurred in early 2000\nfollowing the dot-com boom, on the cusp of the crash.\nThe same type of extrapolative expectations plays out in housing markets in the United\nStates and abroad. When house prices go up, people expect them to continue to rise. And when\nthey fall, people turn much more pessimistic about future appreciation. Figure 3 plots surveys of\nexpected house price appreciation over the next year against the percentage change in prices\nobserved during the prior year for four major U.S. cities over the past decade. Similar patterns\nfor house price expectations are seen in Norway and Sweden, two other countries that have gone\nthrough huge house price booms (Jurgilas and Lansing 2013).\nOne way to make sense of these patterns in asset prices is to abandon the assumption of\nfull information assumed in the standard asset price model with rational expectations. Instead,\ninvestors make do with the limited information at hand when judging likely future discounted\ndividend payments and the future price of the asset. A growing body of evidence in behavioral\neconomics and finance shows that people’s expectations of future asset returns depend on their\npast experiences (Vissing-Jorgensen 2003 and Malmendier and Nagel 2011). In fact, a simple\nmodel of extrapolative expectations of future asset price movements does a very good job of\nexplaining the big swings in the U.S. stock price-to-dividend ratio over time (Adam, Beutel, and\nMarcet 2013).\n8\n\nWhy does this pattern of behavior matter for thinking about monetary policy and\nfinancial stability? The recognition that people behave in this way can move us a long way\ncloser to understanding how asset price booms and busts can emerge and how policy actions\ncould influence that process. Let me give a concrete example. Low interest rates boost\nfundamental valuation of assets. In a world of rational expectations, asset prices adjust and\nthat’s it. But, if one allows for limited information, the resulting bull market may cause investors\nto get “carried away” over time and confuse what is a one-time, perhaps transitory, shift in\nfundamentals for a new paradigm of rising asset prices. This is the type of dynamic Robert\nShiller (2005) found common to numerous booms throughout history. Such a process can also\nhelp us understand why households and financial institutions take on greater risks during asset\nbooms, as they too fall into the trap of excessively optimistic expectations about the future\n(Williams 2011). More generally, it provides an opening to understand how risks to the financial\nsystem can grow, even when economic agents act optimally given the information they have.\nMonetary policy frameworks in support financial stability\nThe discussion of the very real and sizable costs of using monetary policy to deal with\nrisks to financial stability—along with the uncertain benefits of doing so—argues for finding\nalternative tools that engender more favorable tradeoffs. It has become a mantra in central\nbanking to declare that robust micro- and macro-prudential regulatory and supervisory policies\nshould provide the first and second lines of defense for financial stability. And that monetary\npolicy actions should only be a last resort. I agree with this conclusion.\nHowever, this framing of the question is overly limited when it comes to thinking about\nhow monetary policy can support financial stability. It is too steeped in the mechanism of\n9\n\nresponse to asset bubbles or looming risks. One of monetary policy’s most important lessons—\nborne out in both theory and practice—is that the framework for policy is more important than\nthe details of the execution. In terms of price and economic stability, anchoring inflation\nexpectations and responding in a systematic way to economic developments are by far the most\nimportant elements of good monetary policy.\nInstead of thinking about how monetary policy should respond to risks to financial\nstability, we should focus on studying ways to design policy frameworks that support financial\nstability with only a modest cost to macroeconomic goals and anchoring inflation expectations.\nTwo recent proposals illustrate this type of thinking. The first is moving from inflation targeting\nto nominal income targeting. The second is conducting monetary policy in a way that reduces\nthe creation of private-sector money-like assets. I am not personally advocating either of these\nproposals, but I do view them as creative ways to think of how to bend the curve in terms of\nmacroeconomic and financial stability tradeoffs.\nThe idea that nominal income targeting could be supportive of financial stability is\nrelatively straightforward (Koenig 2013, Sheedy 2014). Debt contracts are typically written in\nnominal terms, so the ability to repay depends on one’s nominal income. If the central bank acts\nto keep nominal income on a steady growth path, then—at least on the aggregate—people will be\nable to continue to repay their loans and the deadweight losses and disruptive effects associated\nwith foreclosure and bankruptcy can be avoided. Moreover, the nominal income targeting\nframework has favorable characteristics in the presence of the zero lower bound. That said,\nnominal income targeting does allow for persistent deviations of inflation from target, which\nmay undermine the anchoring of expectations. These are the types of tradeoffs that require\nfurther study and analysis.\n10\n\nThe second proposal that has gained attention is the idea that a central bank with the\nability to pay interest on bank reserves can independently use the quantity of bank reserves to\naffect the stability of the financial system (Stein 2012, Kashyap and Stein 2012 Cochrane 2014).\nNote that this does not cause a tradeoff in terms of price and economic stabilization goals\nbecause the central bank retains the ability to set the short-term interest rate. The basic idea is\nthat in today’s economy, the concept of money extends beyond traditional definitions and\nincludes short-term fixed-income securities. In these models, a central bank’s provision of\ninterest-bearing short-term accounts to a broad set of intermediaries extending beyond depository\ninstitutions reduces the incentive of the private sector to create excessive short-term debt that\ncontributes to financial instability. Again, this is an intriguing idea that calls for further study of\nits benefits and possible unintended consequences.\nTo sum up, we are all aware of the importance of having a robust, resilient financial\nsystem. Recent events have made that all too clear. The challenge for economists and\npolicymakers is to better understand the sources of these risks and the tools that can be devised\nto reduce them, without undermining the hard-fought achievement of price stability and well-\nanchored inflation expectations.

    "text": "Presentation to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\nState of the West Symposium\nStanford, California\nBy John C. Williams\nExecutive Vice President and Director of Research\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 4, 2011\nThe Economic Outlook1\nThank you very much. It’s a great pleasure to speak at SIEPR’S first annual State of the\nWest Symposium. I’ve been asked to give my views on the economy, both in the 12th Federal\nReserve district, which covers the western part of the country from Guam to Idaho, and for the\nnation as a whole, as well as explain what the Federal Reserve is doing to meet its mandates of\nmaximum employment and price stability at this juncture. Economic policy can be controversial\nand debate about it heated. I would like to present myself as an embodiment of the principle that\neven the fiercest rivals can at times achieve a meeting of the minds. I am a product of both UC\nBerkeley—where I got my bachelor’s degree—and Stanford, where I earned my Ph.D. I’ve\nmanaged to benefit from my training in economics at these two institutions, which can have such\nstarkly different views of the world, and I’ve learned to appreciate the ideas of scholars even\nwhen I disagree with them. But one problem remains: I still don’t know which side of the\nstadium to sit on at the Big Game. And now for a disclaimer: I should stress that my comments\nrepresent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nDuring the past few years, giving talks about the economy has been sobering at best and\ndepressing at worst. Thankfully, things are looking considerably brighter now. That’s because,\nafter what was perhaps the worst recession of the postwar era and a recovery that proceeded in\nfits and starts, the economy finally seems to be attaining escape velocity. That is to say, the\n1 I would like to thank Reuven Glick, Rob Valletta, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nrecovery appears increasingly to be becoming self-sustaining, driven primarily by private-sector\ndemand rather than relying so much on government support.\nEven though we have achieved liftoff, we are by no means rocketing to the moon. I\nwould characterize the outlook for growth as solid, but not spectacular. The Commerce\nDepartment last week reported that real, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a 3.2\npercent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2010, up from 2.6 percent in the previous quarter. In\nfact, the headline GDP number considerably understates the economy’s forward momentum.\nBusinesses built up inventories at a slower rate in the fourth quarter, which held down output\ngrowth. When you take out the effect of inventories, real final sales grew at over a 7 percent\nannual rate in the fourth quarter, the best performance for this measure since 1984.\nAt the San Francisco Fed, we see this momentum continuing to build, with real GDP\nexpected to expand 4 percent this year and 4½ percent in 2012. The main drivers of growth are\nimproving household and business confidence, a banking and financial system that is rebuilding\nits strength, and pent-up consumer demand for durable goods such as cars and, eventually,\nhousing. I would describe the process under way as a positive feedback loop with improving\neconomic conditions contributing to a strengthening of house prices and the financial system.\nThis in turn helps ease the availability of credit, providing a boost to the economy. This is\nexactly the opposite direction of the negative loop experienced during the financial crisis.\nNow 4 percent is a good, strong number and a welcome improvement over what we’ve\nseen the past several years. But it’s short of the sizzling growth that took place after past severe\nrecessions, such as the powerful snapback that occurred after the 1981–82 downturn, when the\neconomy grew 7¾ percent in 1983. What’s more, given the deep hole we fell into during and\n2\n\nafter the financial crisis of 2007–08, the current pace of growth means we still face a long slog\nbefore we get back to full employment and full utilization of the nation’s productive capacity.\nWhy has the recovery been so weak for so long and why aren’t we getting the kind of\nrebound that we saw in the early 1980s? To answer these questions, I think it’s important to\nunderstand the specific nature of the recession of 2007–09 and the lingering effects that have\nhampered economic performance during the recovery. During the postwar period, most\nrecessions occurred after the Fed tightened interest rates to counter rising inflation. When the\nFed reversed course and eased rates, the economy bounced back. By contrast, the recent\nrecession was the product of the worst housing bust and worst financial crisis since the Great\nDepression. Let’s not forget how perilously close we came to a meltdown of the financial\nsystem and how tight credit markets became. Research shows that recessions caused by\nfinancial crises tend to be followed by slow, gradual recoveries.2 Damage to the financial system\nmakes it tough for households and businesses to get the credit they need to spend and invest. It\nsaps confidence and puts consumers and businesses into a defensive crouch.\nThe combination of losses in housing and stock market wealth, the credit crunch, and the debt\noverhang, all of historic proportions, created a perfect storm for a massive consumer pullback.\nIn 2008, inflation-adjusted personal consumption expenditures fell 1.9 percent as households\nclamped down on spending. Households were shell-shocked by the decline in their net worth\nfollowing the housing market meltdown and subsequent plunge in stock prices. The first figure\nshows the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income. As you can see, the past\n15 years have seen swings in wealth that hadn’t occurred previously in the postwar period.\nWhen wealth rises, households feel richer and spend more. When it falls, they feel poorer and\n2 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) for discussions of the evidence on banking and\nfinancial crises in history.\n3\n\ncut back. And don’t forget—\nFigure 1\nThe Bubble Decades\nconsumer spending makes up\nRatio of Net Worth to Disposable Personal Income\nHouseholds andNonprofit Organizations\nRatio\nnearly 70 percent of GDP. The\n6.4\nfinancial crisis occurred at a time 6.0\n5.6\nwhen household debt had gone\nAverage from\n5.2 1952-1995\nthrough the roof. During the\n4.8\nhousing boom years, when it\n4.4\nseemed that to get a loan you just\n4.0\n50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 00 05 10\nneeded to show up and sign your\nname, the ratio of household debt to disposable personal income surged from about 1 at the start\nof the decade to an all-time high of 1.3 in 2007. Now, households are burdened with debt, face a\nweak labor market, and worry about saving for the future. This is hardly a prescription for a\nrapid rebound in confidence and spending. 3\nThe labor market and the elevated unemployment rate have rightfully been a focus of our\nattention. In this regard, it’s important to stress two things: Conditions are looking better, but we\nhave a long way to go before we return to health. During the recovery, employers raised output\nby cranking up productivity instead of hiring additional workers. The result has been a jobless\nrecovery, the third time since the early 1990s that a recession has been followed by weak job\ngains.\nThe stark contrast between the three most recent jobless recoveries and the V-shaped\nrecoveries of the past is illustrated in Figure 2. Even though we’re a year and a half into the\nexpansion phase, we’ve seen virtually no net increase in payroll employment, consistent with the\npast two recoveries. This compares with the typical pattern of about a 5 percent increase in jobs\n3 See Glick and Lansing (2011).\n4\n\nexperienced 18 months into\nFigure 2\nJobless Recovery Redux\npostwar recoveries before the\nNonfarmPayroll Employment\nIndexedto 100 at trough of business cycle; seasonally adjusted\n1990s. During the last three\nIndex\n112\nmonths of 2010, the economy\n110\nEarlierrecessions\n108\nadded about 130,000 jobs per\n106\n2007\nmonth, real progress, but a pace\n104\n102 1990\ninsufficient to make much of a\n100\ndent in the unemployment rate. 2001\n98\n-12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30\nMonths from NBER Trough\nI do think we will see\nsizable job gains in the months and years ahead, as shown by the dashed line in the figure.\nIndeed, these gains should be enough to bring the unemployment rate down significantly over\ntime. We project that the unemployment rate will fall gradually below 9 percent this year and to\nabout 7½ percent toward the end of 2012. But, when you’re coming down from an\nunemployment rate that reached 10 percent, such gains will seem disappointingly slow. It would\nstill leave us far from full employment, which we may not get back to until around 2014.\nBut, I don’t want to be overly bleak in my comments. Lately, we’ve seen a welcome\nacceleration in consumer outlays. Real personal consumption expenditures rose at a 4.4 percent\nannual rate in the fourth quarter of 2010, the fastest growth rate since the first quarter of 2006.\nWe hear reports of strong holiday sales and brisk traffic at shopping malls, auto dealers, hotels,\nand restaurants.\nMoreover, there is a silver lining to the sharp drop in consumer spending that occurred\nduring the recession. The fact that households curtailed spending so dramatically means that\nthere is a lot of pent-up demand for cars and other durable goods. The case of motor vehicles is\n5\n\ninstructive. From 2006 to 2009, we saw annual sales of autos and light trucks plummet from\nmore than 16½ million to less than 10½ million—a 37 percent decline over three years. Sales\nfell well below the pace needed to keep the stock of vehicles growing along its trend. This is\nillustrated in Figure 3, which\nFigure 3\nPent-up Demand for Cars\nshows U.S. light vehicle sales\nCar and Light Truck Sales\nSeasonally adjusted annual rate\nover the past 40 years, along with Millions\n20\na rough estimate of the longer- 18\n16\nterm trend. As you can see, sales\n14 Trend\nwere well above trend during the 12\n10\nfirst half of the 1990s, when\n8\nhousing wealth and easy credit\n6\n68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 00 04 08\nfed a buying binge. I don’t Note: Three-month moving average.\nexpect annual sales to shoot back up to 16 million overnight. After all, the job market is still\nweak and confidence hasn’t yet fully recovered from the events of the past few years. But it’s\nalso clear that Americans haven’t yet abandoned the automobile. Eventually they’ll need to\nreplace those tired, run-down cars. Motor vehicle sales are now running at about a 12½ million\nannual rate, about 2 million above the 2009 pace. Over the next few years, I expect at least\nanother sizable increase as we get back to more normal levels.\nI expect the pattern of slow recovery that we see for products such as motor vehicles to\neventually extend to housing, albeit with a longer lag. The housing market was the center of the\nstorm and it will take quite a while for it to right itself. Although credit conditions are gradually\nimproving, it’s still comparatively hard for prospective buyers to get mortgages, especially given\nhow many mortgages are underwater. The market is glutted with a huge inventory of unsold\n6\n\nhomes and foreclosures remain high, despite the legal and procedural problems highlighted by\nthe “robo-signing” controversy. House prices are still falling, with the CoreLogic Home Price\nIndex registering a 5 percent decline in the year that ended in November. We are beginning to\nsee some improvement in sales volume, but construction remains at a very low level. Lower\nunemployment, rising incomes, easier credit, and the process of household formation will\neventually bring about a turnaround.\nHousing starts plunged even more steeply than auto sales, from a pace over 1.7 million\nunits in 2005 to less than 450,000 in 2009. This is shown in Figure 4. The story is much the\nsame as for autos. House construction was way above trend during the housing boom. This\nexcess construction created a huge housing overhang that needs to be undone. Since the housing\ncrash, construction has come almost to a standstill. With so little construction taking place, the\noverhang of available housing will dissipate. Eventually, we will need to start building\nsignificantly more new homes to replace old demolished homes and meet the demand of new\nhouseholds. But it will take some time before the economy gets a lot of help from housing\nconstruction. And that’s a big\nFigure 4\nPent-up Demand for Housing\nchange from past recessions.\nHousing Starts\nSingle family homes; seasonally adjusted annual rate\nOrdinarily, housing is one of the Thousands\n2000\n1800\nsectors leading the way when the\n1600\n1400\neconomy bounces back from\n1200\n1000 Trend\nrecession. In part, that’s for the\n800\n600\nreason that I already mentioned.\n400\n200\nThe Fed typically adds monetary\n0\n68 72 76 80 84 88 92 96 00 04 08\nstimulus to fuel recovery, and Note: Three-month moving average.\n7\n\nhousing is one of the most interest-sensitive sectors. But, this time, it’s the housing market itself\nthat is the problem. Although low interest rates are helping the sector, they can’t yet overcome\nthe fierce headwinds holding back a housing recovery.\nAnother explanation for a subdued recovery lies overseas. The recent recession was truly\nglobal in nature, which meant we couldn’t export our way back to health. In fact, trade flows\ncollapsed following the financial crisis and the global recession, and they have only begun to\nrecover. The world’s advanced economies are generally expanding, but at only a moderate rate.\nMeanwhile, the European sovereign debt crisis and Japan’s continued economic struggles show\nthat significant downside risks remain. I expect that the debt problems of Greece, Ireland,\nPortugal, and other countries will be managed without inflicting major harm on the U.S.\neconomy. But slow growth in Europe and other advanced economies suggests that we will see\nrelatively moderate export gains in upcoming quarters.\nInflation has been another area of concern for us. This may be surprising to hear from the\nFed, but my concern is not too much inflation, but rather too little. Let me explain. Most\nparticipants in the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC,\nsee an inflation rate of about 2 percent or just a bit under that as being most consistent with the\nFed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In 2008, the core inflation\nrate—which excludes volatile food and energy prices—was right at 2 percent. But, with\nsubstantial slack in the economy, core inflation fell to 1.7 percent in 2009 and then to 0.8 percent\nlast year. This is the lowest reading over four quarters recorded in the 50 years these data are\navailable. Unfortunately, this disinflationary trend is continuing. Over the second half of last\nyear, core inflation was just 0.5 percent. This pattern of continued disinflation is eerily, in fact, I\nmight say ominously, reminiscent of Japan’s experience in the 1990s, when that country fell into\n8\n\nchronic deflation and economic malaise from which it still hasn’t recovered. But, before you\naccuse me of having slipped back into a depressing mode, I promise to return later to the reasons\nI think we can and will avoid Japan’s fate.\nI’d like to turn to economic conditions in our region, which in some ways offer a\nconcentrated example of what has happened in the nation as a whole. This conference is about\nthe West. At the Fed, we think in terms of districts—that is, states served by a specific Federal\nReserve Bank. The San Francisco Fed’s 12th District includes nine states: California, Oregon,\nWashington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, and Hawaii. Our District got walloped\nabout as hard as any during the downturn, which is not surprising, given our dubious distinction\nas the region with the biggest housing boom in the nation followed by the most severe housing\nbust. Declines in house prices in major western metropolitan areas such as Las Vegas and\nPhoenix, and smaller metro areas such as Merced in California’s Central Valley, have been as\nlarge as 50 to 60 percent.\nOne result of our oversized exposure to housing and the worse-than-average economic\nperformance of recent years has been carnage in the labor market. From the employment peak in\nDecember 2007 to the trough in December 2009, total nonfarm payroll employment fell nearly 9\npercent in the 12th District compared with about 6 percent nationwide. In December, Nevada’s\n14.5 percent unemployment rate was the highest of any state in the nation, followed by\nCalifornia at 12.5 percent.\nAnother result was some of the most severe state and local government fiscal crises in the\nnation. Budget gaps for the upcoming fiscal year are expected to be slightly larger among\nDistrict states than nationwide. Nevada and California rank among the states facing the largest\npercentage shortfalls. In California, the resulting spending cuts have been very dramatic and far\n9\n\nbigger than reductions during prior fiscal crises in the early 1990s and early 2000s. Between\nfiscal year 1991–92 and 1993–94, the cumulative cuts in general fund spending were 10 percent.\nIn fiscal 2001–02, they were 1.7 percent. By contrast, from fiscal year 2007–08 to 2010–11,\nCalifornia reduced spending by 19 percent, harsh medicine indeed.\nStill, from a macroeconomic point of view, the region is clearly on the rebound. The\nhousing market appears to have stabilized. As housing becomes less of a drag, other sectors of\nthe regional economy are able to pull us forward. In this regard, I’d like to focus on two areas in\nwhich the 12th District has advantages compared with the rest of the nation: technology, and\ntrade with China and other booming Asian economies. Thanks to these advantages, there’s\nreason to expect that our region may grow faster than the nation as a whole in the years ahead.\nJust as we led the way down, so may we help lead the way up.\nHigh-tech encompasses computers and information technology more broadly, as well as\nrelated services. It also includes biotechnology and other research-intensive, technologically\nadvanced activities. Broadly defined, tech accounts for about 10 percent of the nation’s overall\neconomic activity. But in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, it’s in the range of 15\npercent or more. And in the San Francisco Bay Area, information technology directly accounts\nfor more than 20 percent of wage and salary income.\nThe recession badly hurt tech companies, largely because business spending on capital\ngoods, including high-tech equipment and software, all but ground to a halt. That spending\nbounced back in late 2009 and 2010 as hardware upgrades could simply no longer be deferred.\nIn 2010, business spending on technology hardware and software rose over 13 percent, the best\nperformance since 2000, at the tail end of the tech boom. As a result, information technology\nhas been one of the few sources of sustained employment growth. In the 12th District, IT-related\n10\n\njobs grew substantially faster than in the nation as a whole. Furthermore, a pickup in the pace of\njob gains in the District’s IT manufacturing sector in the second half of 2010 signals that\nemployment gains are likely to continue.\nTrade is another area that was hit hard during the recession but presents a long-term\nopportunity for the West, thanks to our proximity to Asia, the world’s most dynamic economic\nregion. China and much of the rest of Asia have been bulwarks of growth throughout the\nrecession and recovery. While growth in Europe, the United States, and Japan has been sluggish,\nmany emerging economies have bounced back quickly. This is good news for western states.\nOn the import side, many Asian goods enter the United States through Los Angeles/Long Beach,\nOakland, Seattle, and other West Coast ports. Receiving, storing, and transshipping those\nproducts provide a tremendous boost to our regional economy. On the other side, exports to Asia\nas a share of GDP are almost twice as high in the nine states of the 12th District than in other\nparts of the nation. Nationwide, exports to Asia represented about 25 percent of total exports in\nthe first 11 months of 2010. In California, that figure was about 40 percent and in Washington\nState, the center of Boeing aircraft production, it was more than 50 percent.\nInterestingly, the geographical breakdown of our trade with Asia has changed over time.\nSince 1990, Asia’s share of the U.S. merchandise goods trade has remained roughly constant at\n25–30 percent of our exports and 35–40 percent of our imports. What has changed is the relative\nrole of China. In 1990, China accounted for only 1 percent of U.S. exports and 3 percent of\nimports. By 2009, U.S. exports to China had risen to 7 percent of total exports and imports from\nChina had risen to 19 percent. Correspondingly, the shares of Japan and the rest of Asia have\ndeclined. China is even more important regionally. California’s exports to China rose nearly 30\n11\n\npercent in the first 11 months of 2010. Export growth to China from District states other than\nCalifornia and Washington was more than 40 percent.\nIt’s fair to say then that we in the western United States have a big stake in China’s\nremarkable economic story. Figure 5 compares the growth rates of per capita real GDP in China,\nJapan, Korea, and several other Asian countries in the decades after they achieved economic\ntakeoff, following\nFigure 5\nGrowth Miracle Redux\nimplementation of structural\nAverage GDP per capita growth after growth takeoff\n%\n12\nreforms. China’s growth First Decade\nSecond Decade\n10\nperformance in the first decade Third Decade*\n8\nafter takeoff was not much higher\n6\nthan the 7–8 percent annual\n4\ngrowth rates posted by Japan and\n2\nKorea at similar stages of\n0\nJapan Korea, Rep. Malaysia China India\ndevelopment. However, in the\nGrowth takeoff dates: Japan (1955), Korea (1967), Malaysia (1973), China\n(1979), India (1982).\n*Third decade data for India for 7 years only.\nsecond and third decades after\ntakeoff, growth in those countries slowed as their economies matured. Japan averaged 6 percent\ngrowth in the second decade after takeoff and 3.5 percent in the third decade. By contrast, China\nhas sustained high growth rates into the second and third decades, growing nearly 10 percent\nannually 30 years after takeoff.\nMany questions important to our region arise from China’s growth. For example, how\nwill competition from China affect our advanced technology industries, such as solar equipment,\nas Chinese manufacturers continue to climb the value chain? To what extent will U.S. product\n12\n\nand service providers be able to tap into the burgeoning Chinese consumer market? If trends in\nthese areas are favorable, the benefits to our region’s economy are likely to be substantial.\nI’d like to close with a discussion of what the Fed is doing at this point in the economic\ncycle. A natural question is, if we have solid growth, why has the Fed’s monetary policy\nremained so stimulative? As you know, we have set our main short-term interest rate policy tool,\nthe federal funds rate, at a target close to zero. The FOMC stated that it expects to keep its fed\nfunds target at that level “for an extended period.” The Fed supplemented this near-zero fed\nfunds rate by buying $1.7 trillion in longer-term Treasury securities, and debt and mortgage-\nbacked securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, from late 2008 through\nearly 2010. In November last year, the Fed announced its intention to expand the size of its\nsecurity holdings further by purchasing an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury\nsecurities by the middle of 2011.4\nI think the way to understand this is to distinguish between rates and levels. The\neconomy’s growth rate now is respectable and improving. But, because the recession was so\ndeep, the level of economic activity is still relatively low as measured by our utilization of labor\nand productive resources. In other words, the economy still has enormous slack. Millions of\npeople could be put back to work and many more goods and services could be produced without\nigniting unwelcome inflation.\nAnother way to think about this is to look at the Fed’s statutory mandate. Congress has\nassigned the central bank the goals of fostering maximum employment and price stability.\nBecause the economy is weak and inflation has fallen close to zero, we are falling short on both\ncounts. The unemployment rate is far above the level that can be sustained without triggering\n4 See Yellen (2011) for an explanation of the mechanism and rationale for the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases.\n13\n\ninflation. Economists call that noninflationary rate the natural rate of unemployment. I believe a\nnumber of factors associated with the crisis and recession have temporarily boosted the natural\nrate from its long-run trend of 5¼ percent to around 6–6½ percent. This means we have a gap of\nbetween 2½ and 3 percentage points between where we are now and full employment. On the\nprice side, as I noted earlier, most FOMC participants define price stability as an inflation rate of\njust under 2 percent, after taking out volatile food and energy prices. Recent core inflation\nreadings have come in well below 1 percent, which is not far enough away from deflation. So,\nwith unemployment too high and inflation too low, the law regulating monetary policy impels\nthe Fed to do what it can to move the economy back to desired levels of employment and\ninflation.\nIn fact, monetary policy models show that the federal funds rate should actually be\naround a negative 4 percent to achieve the ideal level of stimulus.5 Obviously, that’s impossible.\nThe federal funds rate is constrained by a number that to monetary policy is what the speed of\nlight is to physics—in this case, zero. We can’t push the federal funds rate below that zero lower\nbound. In order to provide the right level of stimulus, the Fed has to look elsewhere.\nThat explains the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase program. It is simply the pursuit of\nmonetary policy by other means. The Fed controls the fed funds rate, the interest rate banks\ncharge each other for overnight loans. The level of the fed funds rate ripples through the\nfinancial system and ultimately affects the levels of medium- and long-term interest rates, other\nasset prices, and thereby the economy. The Fed’s purchases of longer-term securities have\nsimilar and, in some ways, even more direct effects. By boosting demand for longer-term\nsecurities, Fed purchases push down rates at the longer end of the yield curve compared with\nwhere they would be otherwise. And those lower rates help ease overall credit conditions, boost\n5 See Chung et al. (2011a).\n14\n\nasset prices, and stimulate economic activity. Fed researchers estimate that by the second half of\n2012 these asset purchases will raise the level of real GDP almost 3 percent and contribute an\nincremental 3 million jobs to the economy. Some 700,000 jobs will be generated just by the\nmost recent phase of the program. The unemployment rate is estimated to be about 1½\npercentage points below where it would be absent the Fed’s asset purchases.6\nMany misconceptions surround the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases. For example,\ncommentators have equated it with the so-called quantitative easing programs pursued by the\nBank of Japan in the past. But the mechanisms are fundamentally different. Under quantitative\neasing, the central bank buys short-term securities at volumes far above normal, flooding the\nbanking system with reserves. By contrast, the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases involve longer-\nterm securities and the mechanism of action is simple supply and demand. By increasing\ndemand for such securities, yields fall relative to where they would be without the Fed\npurchases. The idea isn’t to build up reserves, but to directly push longer-term interest rates\ndown.\nWithout this monetary stimulus, the recession would have likely been very much worse\nand the recovery might have failed to reach the escape velocity I referred to at the beginning of\nthis talk. Moreover, it has so far helped protect us from sliding into deflation as Japan did.\nImportantly, these policy actions have not damaged the public’s confidence in the Fed’s\ncommitment to price stability. Longer-term inflation expectations, whether measured by surveys\nof households or economists, or by prices paid in financial markets for protection from inflation,\nremain well anchored. That said, it’s important to emphasize that when the right time comes, the\nFed will reduce monetary stimulus. A great deal of thought has gone into designing the proper\nways to unwind the measures that are now in place, and I’m confident we’ll be able to do so\n6 See Chung et al. (2011a, b) for further details on these estimates.\n15\n\nsuccessfully and maintain price stability. Meanwhile, we can finally say that we’re headed in the\nright direction and picking up speed, which makes giving speeches about the economy a pleasure\nagain.

W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nNew York, New York\nMarch 30, 2017\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nINTRODUCTION\nGood afternoon. You heard correctly, I’m indeed here representing the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco.\nSome of you may be asking yourself, “Why him? What does an economist who traffics in\nmonetary policy and normally focuses on the macroeconomy have to do with efforts like these?” And\nin a broader sense, why would an institution like the San Francisco Fed be a part of this\ncoalition?\nThese are fair questions. At the same time, I would argue that it would also be fair to\nask the inverse … why would an organization concerned with our country’s economic future\nwillingly step aside from big challenges such as these?\nPROSPERITY IS LIKE A JENGA TOWER\nProsperity is like a Jenga tower: Each individual piece matters to the stability of the\nentire tower. Take one piece out and the whole thing can fall.\n1\n\nSince well-being is the sum of a host of intertwined factors, expanding our economic\npotential means addressing all of these factors holistically. This includes the factors\nthat we’re discussing today; factors like economic mobility, diversity, the built\nenvironment and public health:\no That’s why the pioneering work on Transit Oriented Development and early\neducation that Nancy Andrews and the Low Income Investment Fund are doing is\nso important;\no It’s why Marion Standish’s work on community power-building through the\nCalifornia Endowment is such an important piece to all this;\no It’s why our moderator, Melissa Jones’s work to mitigate displacement matters so\nmuch;\no It’s why we are all so fortunate that Don Schwarz and the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation have connected new and related stakeholders through their leadership\nwith the “Culture of Health.”\nWe live in a world where prosperity for any of our communities is prosperity for all\nour communities … a world where our ability to reach our greatest economic\npotential depends on the ability of our neighborhoods and our neighbors to reach\ntheir’s: As says SPARCC’s motto, We all do better when everyone thrives.\nI should pause here to deliver the standard disclaimer that the views you hear today\nare mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\nEven those of us economists who are most dedicated to our craft, recognize that\nthere sometimes is a limit to what economic policy can do. Robert Kennedy once\nfamously noted that the measure of GDP, for example, quote “does not allow for the\nhealth of our children, the quality of our education or the joy of our play. It does not include the\nbeauty of our poetry … [or] the intelligence of our public debate … It measures neither our wit nor\nour courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our\ncountry, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”\nTo this he concluded “it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we\nare Americans.”\nI had occasion yesterday to speak to a group of economic forecasters about how we\ncan grow our economy faster while still keeping it in the “Goldilocks” zone – the\n2\n\nplace where the economy is not running too-hot or too-cold and the porridge is just\nright … the place where we minimize the risks of another economic crisis or\nrecession.\nOne of the points I made, is that doing so will require investment in our communities\n– and that even though such investments are beyond the purview of monetary policy,\nthere are things that each of us can do, in our own way, to move all of us forward.\nThere is a Talmudic proverb that says that while none of us are obligated to complete\nthe work of repairing the world, this does not give any of us license to step aside and\ncease from trying.\nOUR WORK AT THE SAN FRANCISCO FED\nAt the San Francisco Fed this means that although it is not within our purview to\nmake direct investments, it is absolutely within our mission and our values to bring\ntogether investors and community stakeholders in pursuit of the future we aspire to\nfor all our communities.\nWe’ve set a goal at our Bank of creating a more diverse and inclusive culture and\nworkforce. We’ve done so not only because it’s the right thing to do from a moral\nstandpoint – not only because a failure to do so means missing out on opportunities\nto expand our own horizons, vision, and labor pool – but because we produce better\nresearch and we’re more adept at monetary, regulatory, and supervisory policy, when\nwe cast the widest possible net for talent, opinions and perspectives.\nThe same holds true when we look more broadly at our communities. Leaving\nanyone behind, means holding all of us back. The research tells us that when we\nincrease a family’s income, their children’s math and reading scores tend to increase\nwith it. One estimate suggests that child who moves from public housing into a\nlower-poverty area can earn $300,000 more income throughout the rest of her or his\nlife. Another recent study found that Americans living in poverty here in New York\nCity and in other urban areas can see their life expectancy dwindle by seven years.\nThis is not only a stain on the moral soul of our country, it’s an obstacle to our\neconomic potential, productivity, and global competitiveness.\n3\n\nCONCLUSION: WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO\nThis is why the Fed is a founding member of SPARCC. It’s why we’re working with a\nbroad array of partners in cities like LA and San Francisco.\nIt’s why we’re seeking answers to the big important questions like how we move the\nneedle on income inequality … how we can encourage the sorts of investment that\ndeliver results for all Americans irrespective of zip code or race… how we measure\nwhat’s working … and how we recruit partners that reflect the diversity which makes\nour country so strong.\nIt’s why we’re so enthusiastic to join you here today. Thank you very much.\n4",

    "text": "Presentation to the Rotary Club of Seattle\nSeattle, Washington\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 7, 2011\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy and Role for Monetary Policy1\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to speak here today. I want especially to pay\nmy respects to Admiral Biesel, whose remarks remind us what America is capable of when we\nface a challenge. I’m very glad to be in Seattle, a city known for its excellent quality of life,\nnatural beauty, and rich cultural resources.\nI’m here to speak about the nation’s economy and what the Federal Reserve is doing to\npromote recovery. It’s worth reminding ourselves that, after suffering the worst financial and\neconomic crisis in several generations, we are now in the third year of economic recovery. In\nfact, I am hopeful that the pace of recovery will pick up over the next few years as the economy\nheals from the wounds of the housing crash and financial crisis. We should keep in mind that the\nfundamental drivers of long-run economic health—our highly skilled and educated workforce,\nour entrepreneurial spirit, and our cutting-edge technology—remain intact at present. As I will\ndiscuss in a few minutes, a critically important goal for policy is to ensure that the economic\ndifficulties we face today do not create lasting scars that diminish our longer-term economic\nprospects. I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nAlthough I remain bullish on the American economy in the long run, the fact is that we\nface real difficulties right now. The recovery has lost much of the momentum gained early last\n1 I would like to thank John Fernald, Glenn Rudebusch, Bharat Trehan, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in the\npreparation of these remarks.\n1\n\nyear and the outlook for the economy over the next year has grown darker. The GDP numbers\ntell the story. Real gross domestic product—or GDP—is a broad measure of the goods and\nservices Americans produce. It grew at nearly a 4 percent annual rate in the first half of 2010,\nbefore slowing to about a 2½ percent rate in the second half. Then, in the first half of 2011, the\nreal GDP growth rate fell to a scant 0.7 percent. That’s dangerously close to stall speed.\nThis slow growth explains why the economy is adding so few jobs these days. Last week\nwe learned that payrolls outside the farm sector didn’t increase at all in August. Indeed, over the\npast four months, we’ve added only 40,000 jobs per month on average. That’s well below the\npace needed to bring the unemployment rate down from its current level of 9.1 percent. And this\nnumber understates the degree of underemployment in the economy. When you count those who\nwant to work but have given up looking and those who only work part time because that’s all\nthey can find, the underemployment rate exceeds 16 percent.\nThe recent slowdown was due in part to temporary factors. The weather was unusually\nbad in many parts of the country this past winter, the Japanese earthquake disrupted global\nsupply chains, and, perhaps most importantly for U.S. economic growth, oil and other\ncommodity prices surged. Higher prices at the pump staggered Americans and took a sizable\nbite out of consumer spending at a particularly sensitive moment for the economy.\nThe effects of these temporary brakes on growth have largely faded. But several more\npersistent trends are also impeding recovery. The news from the housing market has been\nparticularly dismal. Past recoveries typically got a kick start from a rebound in home\nconstruction and spending on furniture, appliances, and other big-ticket items people needed for\ntheir new houses and apartments. This time, though, construction is stuck at post-World War II\n2\n\nlow levels. A huge supply of homes is available for sale, which keeps prices down. Add to that\nwhat might be called a shadow inventory of some 4 million homes whose owners are seriously\ndelinquent on their mortgages or in foreclosure. Despite great loan terms and low prices, buyers\nwho qualify for credit are understandably nervous about jumping back into the housing market.\nAnd, of course, millions of other potential buyers are underwater on their current mortgages,\nmaking it hard for them to sell or refinance.\nMeanwhile, the bounce in consumer spending often seen in the wake of recessions has\nbeen unusually tepid this time around. The combination of huge amounts of household debt,\nlosses in the housing and stock markets, and high unemployment has clearly taken a toll on both\nthe ability and willingness of households to spend. People are on edge waiting for the other shoe\nto drop. Consumer sentiment plunged last month, which was partly a reaction to the unnerving\nnews about the federal debt ceiling debate in Washington, D.C., and the European debt crisis. In\nfact, the latest consumer sentiment readings are near the all-time lows recorded in late 2008\nduring the most terrifying moments of the financial crisis. Here is a telling statistic: Sixty-two\npercent of households expect their income to stay the same or decline over the next year, the\nworst reading in the over 30 years that this question has been asked. With consumer spending\nmaking up 70 percent of the economy, it’s hard to have a robust recovery when Americans are so\ndispirited.\nRecent developments raise questions about the strength and durability of the recovery.\nStill, despite all the obstacles, the odds are that we will continue along the path of recovery and\nthat the pace of growth will pick up modestly. The temporary shocks that I mentioned earlier\nhave begun to fade. Manufacturing—automobile production in particular—is starting to recover\nfrom the effects of the Japanese earthquake. Oil prices have come down. Importantly, the\n3\n\nfinancial system’s health has improved greatly over the past few years. Interest rates are at\nhistoric lows and corporations are flush with cash. Banks are slowly relaxing their grip on loans.\nThese factors should lay the foundation for gradual economic improvement. My forecast calls\nfor the economy to grow around 2 percent in the second half of 2011 and gain further strength\nnext year. Unfortunately, that won’t be anywhere near fast enough to bring down the jobless rate\nmuch. I expect unemployment to remain around 9 percent through the end of this year and to\nstill be above 8½ percent at the end of next year.\nThis recovery is very different from most other postwar upturns, which tended to be\nrelatively vigorous. We’re in the third year of renewed growth and the unemployment rate is\nstill higher than at almost any other time since World War II. Shockingly, the economy today\nhas the same number of jobs as in February 2000, more than 11 years ago. And almost a third of\nthe unemployed—nearly four-and-a-half million people—have been out of work for at least a\nyear, a striking break from past downturns when unemployment spells were typically short. The\nlonger it takes to get this economy back to full health, the greater the risk that the recession will\nleave permanent scars. Millions of workers have gone years without jobs. They are losing out\non work experience and their attachment to the labor market is fraying. Many potentially\nproductive people could become much more difficult to employ or drop out of the labor market\naltogether.\nAt the same time, we are vulnerable to negative shocks that could put the recovery at risk.\nThat’s why events in Europe are such a cause for concern. Fears that some nations in the euro\nzone will not be able to make payments on their debts have spread from smaller countries, such\nas Greece and Ireland, to larger economies, such as Spain and Italy. This is not something we\ncan dismiss as somebody else’s problem. A full-blown financial meltdown in Europe would hit\n4\n\nU.S. exports, which have been one of the economy’s few bright spots. Perhaps more\nimportantly, it could slam U.S. financial markets and deal a further blow to already fragile\nconfidence. In other words, a downturn in Europe could knock the props out from under the\nU.S. recovery.\nWe’ve had our own shock right here at home in the form of the contentious debate over a\nlong-term fix for the federal budget deficit. It’s essential that we bring the budget under control.\nBut, how this is accomplished is extremely important, both for our country’s short- and long-run\neconomic health. First, let’s look at the long view. The budget decisions made today will affect\nour nation’s future investments in job training and education, research and development, and\npublic and private capital. These are the critical determinants of our long-term economic\nprospects and standard of living. In the near term, efforts at deficit reduction may reduce\ndemand and further slow the already precarious recovery. In addition, the deficit controversy has\nadded one more ingredient to the currents of economic anxiety that are roiling households and\nbusinesses. And, as I mentioned before, the short and the long run are connected. The longer it\ntakes to get the unemployment rate back down, the greater the risk that there will be permanent\nscars to the economy.\nLet me now say a few words about inflation. At the end of last year, 12-month inflation\nwas a very low 1.4 percent, according to the Fed’s preferred measure of household consumption\nprices. That had some people wondering whether we were at risk of sustained deflation, in\nwhich prices actually fall. Since then, spikes in oil and some other commodities have driven up\ninflation. Over the 12 months through July, prices increased 2¾ percent. But I don’t expect this\ninflation bump to persist. The earlier rise in commodity prices was fueled by strong demand,\nespecially in the rapidly expanding economies of the developing world. At the same time, the\n5\n\nprices of goods imported from China and other countries rose as producers there passed along\ntheir own higher costs. Recently though, prices for oil and many other commodities have\ndeclined, largely due to reduced expectations for global economic growth. In addition, the price\nhikes for imports have mostly passed through the system, like the proverbial pig in the python.\nLooking ahead, I expect inflation to ease to about a 1½ percent annual pace next year.\nThis is somewhat below the 2 percent level that I see as the appropriate medium-term goal. My\nexpectation that inflation will fall reflects the fact that the economy is performing so far below its\npotential. Such economic slack tends to depress inflationary pressures. It means that workers\nhave very limited ability to demand higher wages and businesses can’t push through price\nincreases that will stick. For example, the latest report showed that wages grew around 2 percent\nover the past year, hardly a prescription for high inflation. In addition, surveys show that\nexpectations for inflation remain stable.\nTo sum up, the economy is improving, but at such a modest pace that it will be years\nbefore we see a substantial reduction in unemployment. At the same time, we face heightened\nrisks that could cause growth to fall short of even these modest expectations or, even worse, send\nus back into negative territory. And inflation, which has been running higher than I’d like, is\nnow moderating and likely to drop below preferred levels.\nLet me turn to monetary policy and what the Federal Reserve is doing to promote\neconomic recovery. Congress has mandated that the Fed pursue the twin goals of maximum\nemployment and price stability. During the recession, the economy deteriorated sharply and\ninflation dropped to very low levels. In response, the Fed’s policymaking body—the Federal\nOpen Market Committee, or FOMC—took aggressive monetary action. It lowered the Fed’s\n6\n\nbenchmark short-term interest rate—known as the federal funds rate—close to zero in December\n2008 and has left it there since. In addition, the FOMC carried out two rounds of purchases of\nTreasury, mortgage-backed, and government-sponsored-agency securities, bringing our holdings\nof these instruments to $2.65 trillion. These purchases have reduced longer-term interest rates,\nthereby improving financial conditions more generally and providing a boost to the economy.\nThey also reduced the risk of slipping into sustained deflation.2\nDespite these efforts, the recovery slowed to a crawl this year. But what does this mean\nfor monetary policy? After all, monetary policy cannot cure all that ails our economy, which in\nlarge measure involves the aftereffects of the mortgage lending boom, the housing crash, and the\nresulting financial crisis. But, monetary policy can help limit the damage and provide support to\nother areas of the economy. A medical analogy is useful. Today’s economy is like a patient who\nhas suffered a number of injuries and needs time to heal. For the healing process to succeed, it is\nessential that the bleeding be stopped, the patient be properly hydrated, blood pressure and\ntemperature properly regulated, and secondary infections avoided and treated. These treatments\ndon’t cure the injuries directly, but they reduce the risk of the patient getting worse and allow the\nnatural healing process to take hold.\nThe monetary policy situation is similar. Like the hospital patient, the economy took a\nturn for the worse and faces heightened risks. In addition, inflation is expected to drift down.\nThese circumstances called for additional monetary easing. At our August meeting, the FOMC\ntook a step in that direction, issuing a statement that we are likely to keep the federal funds rate\nat exceptionally low levels at least through mid-2013. In one respect, this wasn’t such big news.\nEven before the announcement, financial market participants generally didn’t expect the Fed to\n2 See Chung et al. (2011).\n7\n\nraise rates much earlier than mid-2013. But it was news in the sense that it removed uncertainty\nand helped financial markets better understand our intentions. In response to the FOMC\nstatement, financial market expectations of future interest rates and U.S. Treasury yields fell.\nNote also that we are not tying our hands by making this announcement. We haven’t made a\nguarantee. We will alter our policy as appropriate if circumstances change.\nRight now, though, the real threat is an economy that is at risk of stalling and the prospect\nof many years of very high unemployment, with potentially long-run negative consequences for\nour economy. There are a number of potential steps the Fed could take to ease financial\nconditions further and move us closer to our mandated goals of maximum employment and price\nstability.3 Of course, these “treatments” won’t make our economic problems go away and their\ncosts and benefits must be carefully balanced. But they could offer a measure of protection\nagainst further deterioration in the patient’s condition and perhaps help him get back on his feet.\nThank you very much.\n3 See Bernanke (2011).\n8\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben. 2011. “Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.” Testimony before\nthe Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC,\nJuly 13. http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20110713a.htm\nChung, Hess, Jean-Philippe Laforte, David Reifschneider, and John C.

    "text": "Presentation to the Urban Land Institute, San Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 6, 2015\nPresident Williams presented similar remarks at the Community Leaders Luncheon in Salt Lake\nCity, Utah on October 1, 2015.\nThe Economic Outlook: Live Long and Prosper\nGood afternoon, and thank you.\nIt’s a pleasure to be here, particularly because the San Francisco Fed and the Urban Land\nInstitute actually have some overlap in our work. While most of what the Fed does is well\nknown—and well commented on—we’re also involved in community development. Our team\nworks with professionals across the built environment—from housing to transit to health—to\nhelp strengthen local economies. In fact, they’ve partnered with the ULI.\nToday I’d like to give an update on the outlook, monetary policy, and where I see us\nheaded. Before I get going, I should stress that the views expressed here today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nI shouldn’t have to issue a spoiler alert before I say that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee decided to hold off on raising interest rates at our last meeting. I considered it a close\ncall, in part reflecting the conflicting signals we’re getting: On the one hand, the U.S. economy\ncontinues to strengthen and is closing in on full employment, while on the other, global\ndevelopments pose downside risks.\nThe unequivocally good news is that the economic expansion is entering its seventh year\nwith solid momentum. Over the past five years, real GDP growth has averaged a little over 2\npercent and the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly a percentage point per year. I expect that\npace of recovery to continue, despite strong global headwinds.\n1\n\nConsumer spending is powering the economy. We’ve seen real consumer spending\nincrease more than 3 percent over the past year and auto sales are on pace to exceed 17 million\nvehicles this year—the highest level seen since the early 2000s. Strong fundamentals point to\ncontinued solid gains going forward: Despite the recent declines in the stock market, the ratio of\nwealth to income is close to all-time highs, household debt burden has come down considerably,\nand real income growth—helped by the drop in energy prices—remains strong. Business\nspending is on an upswing as well. Overall, I see real GDP increasing at about a 2 percent annual\nrate on average over the second half of 2015 and next year.\nThe labor market continues to improve as well. We’re on pace to add about 2.4 million\njobs this year and job vacancies are the highest they’ve been since they started collecting the data\nback in 2000. Given the progress we’ve made and the momentum we’re seeing, we should reach\nor exceed full employment on a broad set of measures by the end of this year or early next year.\nIn particular, I expect the unemployment rate to fall below 5 percent either later this year or early\nnext year and remain there into 2017.\nThis brings me to the question of how to gauge what a healthy, full-employment labor\nmarket looks like. The most common metric is the “natural rate” of unemployment—the optimal\nrate we can expect in a fully functioning economy. Before the recession, it was generally thought\nto be around 5 percent.1 Since then, there has been a lot of research examining whether the\nevents of the past decade have pushed the natural rate up—say, due to an increasing skills\nmismatch between workers and jobs—or down, owing to changes in the demographic makeup of\nthe labor force—that is, a greater representation in the workforce of groups that tend to have\nlower unemployment rates.2 My assessment is that there has not been any lasting, significant\n1 Weidner and Williams (2011).\n2 Aaronson et al. (2015), Daly et al. (2012), and Lazear and Spletzer (2012).\n2\n\nshift in either direction. My estimate of the natural rate of unemployment today is 5 percent,\nconsistent with pre-recession estimates. With the current rate at 5.1 percent, we are very close.\nTurning to inflation: It is still lower than I’d like. Based on my favorite measure—the\ntrimmed mean—the underlying rate is 1.7 percent. To understand why inflation has remained\nlow despite an economy nearing full employment, we have to look beyond our shores. The rise\nof the dollar and the fall in oil prices over the past year have lowered import prices and pushed\nthe inflation rate down. Based on past experience, these effects should prove transitory. As they\ndissipate, and as the economy strengthens further over the next year, I see inflation moving back\nup to our 2 percent goal in the next two years.\nThere are upside risks to my forecast, specifically an even stronger and faster rebound in\nhousing and a more pronounced spending boom from lower energy prices. So far, lower oil\nprices haven’t caused much of a surge in consumption, but as people get used to paying less, that\ncould change. And there are, of course, the downside risks: There’s the threat of slowdowns and\nspillovers from abroad, and the dollar could appreciate further.\nOn raising rates\nThese domestic and global developments have implications for monetary policy. We’re\nbalancing a number of considerations, some of which argue for a little more patience in raising\nrates and others that argue for acting sooner rather than later. Our decisions reflect a careful\njudgment about the relative risks and merits of those factors.\nI’ll start with the arguments for being a bit more patient in removing monetary\naccommodation. For one, we are constrained by the zero lower bound in monetary policy and\nthis creates an asymmetry in our ability to respond to changing circumstances. That is, we can’t\n3\n\nmove rates much below zero if the economy slows or inflation declines even further. By contrast,\nif we delay, and growth or inflation pick up quickly, we can easily raise rates in response.3\nThis concern is exemplified by downside risks from abroad. Economic conditions and\npolicies from China to Europe to Brazil have contributed to a substantial increase in the dollar’s\nvalue. This has held back U.S. growth and inflation over the past year.4 Further bad news from\nabroad could add to these effects.\nInflation has been below our 2 percent target for more than three years now. This is not\nunique to the United States. Although we ultimately control our own inflation rate, there’s no\nquestion that globally low inflation, and the policy responses this has provoked, has contributed\nto downward pressure in the U.S. As I said, my forecast is that inflation will bounce back, but\nthis is just a forecast, and there is the risk that it could take longer than I expect. With inflation\npersistently running below our target, some argue that the need to start normalizing monetary\npolicy is not pressing.\nThose are some of the main arguments on the side of the ledger arguing for a little more\npatience. On the other side is the insight of Milton Friedman, who famously taught us that\nmonetary policy has long and variable lags.5 I like to use a car analogy to illustrate it. If you’re\nheaded towards a red light, you take your foot off the gas so you can get ready to stop. If you\ndon’t, you’re going to wind up slamming on the brakes and very possibly skidding into the\nintersection.\nIn addition, an earlier start to raising rates would allow us to engineer a smoother, more\ngradual process of policy normalization. That would give us space to fine-tune our responses to\nreact to economic conditions. In contrast, raising rates too late would force us into the position of\n3 Evans et al. (2015).\n4 See, for example, Amiti and Bodine-Smith (2015).\n5 Friedman (1961).\n4\n\na steeper and more abrupt path of rate hikes, which doesn’t leave much room for maneuver. Not\nto mention, it could roil financial markets and slow the economy in unintended ways.\nFinally, experience teaches us that an economy that runs beyond its potential for too long\ncan generate imbalances that ultimately lead to either excessive inflation or an economic\ncorrection and recession. Two recent examples are sobering. In the late-1990s, the expansion\nbecame increasingly fueled by the euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. In the first half of the 2000s, the economy\nbecame increasingly reliant on irrational exuberance over housing, resulting in house prices\nspiraling far beyond fundamentals and massive overbuilding. Of course, in both cases, those\nfantasies burst at great cost to our economy.\nI want to be clear that, in raising concerns about the potential for imbalances, I’m not\ntalking about fighting the last war. It is a more general point: When you have a high-pressure\neconomy, with unsustainably high levels of economic activity for a long period of time, people\nmay make decisions based on excessive optimism, rather than sound economic basics. That\nmentality can happen any time, but it’s emboldened by an economy that’s on a tear.\nI am starting to see signs of imbalances emerge in the form of high asset prices,\nespecially in real estate, and that trips the alert system. One lesson I have taken from past\nepisodes is that, once the imbalances have grown large, the options to deal with them are limited.\nI think back to the mid-2000s, when we faced the question of whether the Fed should raise rates\nand risk pricking the bubble or let things run full steam ahead and deal with the consequences\nlater. What stayed with me were not the relative merits of either case, but the fact that by then,\nwith the housing boom in full swing, it was already too late to avoid bad outcomes. Stopping the\nfallout would’ve required acting much earlier, when the problems were still manageable. I’m not\n5\n\nassigning blame by any means, and economic hindsight is always 20/20. But I am conscious that\ntoday, the house price-to-rent ratio is where it was in 2003, and house prices are rapidly rising. I\ndon’t think we’re at a tipping point yet—but I am looking at the path we’re on and looking out\nfor potential potholes.\nIn considering the FOMC’s monetary policy choices, it’s important to remember that\nwe’re in a very different place now than when we first instituted extremely accommodative\npolicy. The economy has come a long way since the dark days of late 2009. We’ve added over\n12½ million jobs, more than 3 million of them last year. Even better, most of those were full-\ntime. It’s been a tough journey back, and monetary policy has played a crucial role in healing a\nonce-ailing economy.6\nIn the past, I have found the arguments for greater patience to clearly outweigh those for\nraising rates. The labor market was still far from full strength and the risk to the recovery’s\nmomentum was very real. As the economy closed in on full employment, the other side of the\nledger started gaining greater weight and the arguments have moved into closer balance.\nLooking forward, I expect that we’ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the\nnear future and inflation will gradually move back to our 2 percent goal. In that context, it will\nmake sense to gradually move away from the extraordinary stimulus that got us here. We already\ntook a step in that direction when we ended QE3. And given the progress we’ve made and\ncontinue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates,\nmost likely starting sometime later this year. Of course, that view is not immutable and will\nrespond to economic developments over time.\nWhat to expect when you’re expecting a new normal\n6 See Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n6\n\nAs we make our way back to an economy that’s at full health, it’s important to consider\nwhat constitutes a realistic view of the way things will look. The pace of employment growth, as\nwell as the decline in the unemployment rate, has slowed a bit recently…but that’s to be\nexpected. When unemployment was at its 10 percent peak during the height of the Great\nRecession, and as it struggled to come down during the recovery, we needed rapid declines to get\nthe economy back on track. Now that we’re getting closer, the pace must start slowing to more\nnormal levels. Looking to the future, we’re going to need at most 100,000 new jobs each month.7\nIn the mindset of the recovery, that sounds like nothing; but in the context of a healthy economy,\nit’s what’s needed for stable growth.\nAs the next year unfolds, what we want to see is an economy that’s growing at a steady\npace of around 2 percent. If jobs and growth kept the same pace as last year, we would seriously\novershoot our mark. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and it’s\nactually desirable, that the pace is slowing.\nConclusion\nThe economy is on solid footing and a good trajectory. There are risks, as there always\nare in life. And there’s always the possibility of what British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan\nsaid when asked what worried him most: “Events, dear boy, events.” But all in all, things are\nlooking up, and if they stay on track, I see this as the year we start the process of monetary policy\nnormalization.\nThank you.\n7 Aaronson et al.

    "text": "Presentation to Joint Meeting of the San Francisco and Salt Lake City Branch Boards of\nDirectors, Closing Luncheon\nSalt Lake City, UT\nBy John C. Williams\nExecutive Vice President and Director of Research, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 8, 2010\nSailing into Headwinds: The Uncertain Outlook for the U.S. Economy\nThank you very much for coming today. This afternoon I’ll be talking about the\neconomy—where it’s headed and my thoughts about why it hasn’t done better. I should stress\nthat my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve\ncolleagues.\nMy title is “Sailing into Headwinds: The Uncertain Outlook for the U.S. Economy.”\nYou’ll notice that I use the word “sailing,” not “sinking.” Given the very real economic\ndisappointments we’ve experienced lately, it’s important to keep in mind that we are making\nforward progress. Our economy continues to expand, even if the pace is slow. For those of you\nwho are familiar with sailing, it’s like beating to the windward with a very stiff breeze in our\nface. You don’t get there fast and the voyage is rough, but eventually you do reach safe harbor.\nI am confident we will find safe harbor, even if we feel a little seasick right now.\nCertainly we have experienced lackluster growth over the past several months and we face\nsignificant risks that could hold back the tempo of recovery. But the situation is much improved\nfrom the depths of the recession. The private sector is adding jobs and a truly terrible financial\ncrisis is largely behind us. To keep things in perspective, think back to where we were just two\nyears ago, when the financial system was on the brink of collapse, banks were fighting for their\nlives and some of Wall Street’s most prominent names disappeared. We’ve come a long way\n1\n\nsince then. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve policies remain highly supportive of growth, our trading\npartners are recovering, and the confidence of businesses and consumers is gradually returning.\nI won’t pretend that some very serious problems aren’t still with us, but I see a double dip\ninto recession as highly unlikely. Instead, I expect the recovery to gradually gain momentum,\nwhich will fuel a slow return to health of the job market. Inflation should remain subdued and I\nthink that both unacceptably high inflation and sustained deflation are very unlikely.\nI’ll talk about the economy in greater depth shortly. But first I’d like to try to demystify\nfor you if I can the institution I work for—the Federal Reserve. You undoubtedly know that we\nare part of the government and that we conduct monetary policy. But, beyond that, there’s much\nconfusion about who we are, and what we do and don’t do. The Fed is the nation’s central bank,\nwhich means that we control the amount of money in the economy. In practice, we do this by\nadjusting the money supply to make the overnight interest rate that banks charge each other for\nloans what we want it to be. This, in turn, influences other interest rates and financial conditions\nmore generally. And interest rates are one of the keys to how much people will spend and invest,\nwhich directly affects how fast the economy grows. All else equal, when rates are low,\nconsumers and businesses are more willing and able to finance consumption and investment.\nHigh interest rates have the opposite effect, damping consumption and investment.\nIn the world of central banks, the Fed is a unique institution. When Congress created it in\n1913, lawmakers wanted to make sure that it remained close to the communities it served. The\nWashington, D.C., Beltway didn’t exist then, but you might say that Congress wanted to ensure\nthat the Fed didn’t get caught up in the inside-the-Beltway mentality. So, in addition to creating\nthe Federal Reserve Board in Washington charged with overseeing the Federal Reserve System,\n2\n\nit also chartered 12 regional Fed banks in cities across the country. The Reserve Banks are\nhybrid public-private institutions, with private-sector boards of directors. In fact, I and my\ncolleagues at Reserve Banks are not government employees, but instead part of the private\nsector. Bank employees perform a variety of functions, including the supervision of banks,\ndistribution of currency to financial institutions, and administration of the payments system.\nThis structure allows the Fed to maintain close ties with local businesspeople and community\nleaders.\nMonetary policy, which includes the setting of short-term interest rates and the amount\nand composition of the assets that the Fed holds, is set by a body called the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or the FOMC, which meets once every six weeks in Washington. The committee\nconsists of all seven governors and five of the twelve reserve bank presidents, who serve on a\nrotating basis. The other seven presidents participate in meeting deliberations, but do not vote on\npolicy decisions. Our president in San Francisco, Janet Yellen, was recently appointed by\nPresident Obama to be governor and vice-chair of the Federal Reserve Board under Chairman\nBen Bernanke. So, pending confirmation, she’ll be switching seats at FOMC meetings. All\nseven governors, including the chairman and vice-chairman, cast votes on monetary policy.\nThe Fed is unique among central banks in one other respect. Many other central banks\nare charged with keeping prices stable—that is, making sure that inflation stays in check and that\ndeflation doesn’t occur. The Fed too is tasked with maintaining stable prices. But Congress also\nassigned us the mission of promoting maximum sustainable employment. This means that the\nFed is often engaged in a balancing act—trying to set interest rates at a level that encourages\nstrong sustainable growth while keeping the inflation rate low and stable.\n3\n\nFinally, the Fed is independent, which means that we set monetary policy on our own,\nbased on our analysis of the economy, and are shielded from interference from other arms of the\nfederal government. That distinguishes us from the Treasury Department, which is part of the\nexecutive branch and is under the authority of the White House. Fed Governors are appointed by\nthe President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to 14-year terms. Reserve Bank presidents are\npicked by the Reserve Bank boards of directors subject to Board of Governors approval.\nThis degree of independence permits the Fed to set policy based strictly on economic\nconsiderations, not short-term political considerations. However, we are accountable in the\nsense that the Fed Chairman must report twice a year to Congress and Fed officials can be called\nbefore Congress to answer questions.\nI should emphasize a few things the Fed doesn’t do. It doesn’t set taxes or make\ndecisions on government spending, except for the costs of its own operations. Such fiscal policy\nactions are properly the domain of elected officials and would be inconsistent with the\nindependence of the central bank.\nI’d like to turn now to the outlook for the economy. As I hinted at the start of my talk,\neconomic data have been disappointing for the past several months. The housing sector, which\nhad been boosted by temporary government programs, has turned south, with both sales and\nconstruction falling sharply. Growth in consumer spending has remained modest. And, private-\nsector job gains have also been modest, with only about 80,000 private jobs added per month\nduring the past three months. There are a few sectors that are doing well. Business investment\nin equipment and software has rebounded and the manufacturing sector continues to expand at a\ngood clip.\n4\n\nThe recovery is now in its second year. It appears that the recession ended in mid-2009.\nEven before the recent slowdown, the pace of recovery had already fallen well short of rapid\nrecoveries from deep recessions in the past. Then, this spring, the economic ship sailed into the\ndoldrums. Growth of real gross domestic product, or GDP, the broadest measure of the\neconomy’s total output of goods and services, slowed to a 1.6 percent annual rate in the second\nquarter of this year, after increasing at a 3.7 percent rate in the first quarter. The most recent data\npoint to growth of only about 2 percent in the current quarter.\nEconomists like to be precise in their descriptions. In a talk a month ago I described the\npace of growth as “moderate,” bordering on modest. Well, since then, we’ve clearly moved well\ninto modest territory. Yet, despite this loss of momentum, the recovery continues to tack\nforward, fighting stern headwinds. Why has the pace of economic recovery been so\nunderwhelming? Real GDP grew about 3 percent over the past four quarters. This pales in\ncomparison to the 7¾ percent growth seen in the first year of the recovery from the last very\ndeep recession, the one that occurred in 1981 and 1982. It’s more like the two most recent\nrecoveries, the ones that occurred at the beginning of the 1990s and after the 2001 recession.\nThese were far more muted, giving rise to the unhappy phrase “jobless recovery.”\nSome of the recent weakness is surely due to temporary factors that will end. But, others\nare likely to endure. Economists have identified several major factors contributing to the weak\nrecovery. Perhaps most notable is the fact that the recession followed the worst global financial\ncrisis since the Great Depression. Research has clearly demonstrated that economic recoveries\nthat come in the wake of banking and financial crises tend to be slow and painful.1 This pattern\n1 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) for discussions of the evidence on banking and\nfinancial crises in history.\n5\n\nreflects the critical role that credit plays in greasing the wheels of economic activity. Following\na severe crisis, the process of rebuilding the health and confidence of borrowers and lenders alike\nis a long, drawn-out affair. Second, U.S. households are straining under mountains of debt\naccumulated during the housing boom and for years before. We had become a nation of\nborrowers, not savers, and we are now having to make painful adjustments. Consumers,\nnormally reliable participants in recoveries, are standing on the sidelines. They feel compelled to\nrepair their finances in lieu of cruising the auto showroom or shopping for 3-D TVs. Meanwhile,\nbusinesspeople have been left extraordinarily cautious and averse to all kinds of perceived risks,\nwhether from the economy, financial markets, or government policies.\nOn top of that, the construction boom of the mid-2000s created an enormous overhang of\nhouses and other structures that will take years to work off. Finally, monetary policy has reached\nthe limit of what it can do by conventional means. The Fed’s benchmark policy interest rate is\nalready effectively at zero, the lowest it can go. The Fed can’t reduce short-term interest rates\nany more than it already has. That constrains Fed policy and has prompted us to turn to\nunconventional programs to stimulate the economy, such as buying mortgage securities in order\nto lower long-term interest rates.\nThese are all reasons to expect a slower-than-normal recovery.2 One way to think about\nit is to recognize that low interest rates, although helpful, can’t fully offset the headwinds that we\nare facing. Lenders have become unusually strict in doling out loans and potential borrowers\nhave become unusually cautious in taking on debt. In such an environment, even low rates can’t\n2 Weidner and Williams (2010) quantify the different influences that have slowed the current economic recovery\nrelative to past experience.\n6\n\nconvince people to buy a lot of homes and autos. Similarly, in the face of uncertainty, businesses\nmay prefer to accumulate cash rather than borrow for expansion.\nStill, as I stressed at the onset, things are not all gloomy. Although the pace of growth is\nfrustratingly slow, the economy continues to expand. We see steady improvement in the\navailability of credit, which should improve conditions in the housing and auto markets. We’ve\nalso seen a marked improvement in the willingness of investors to take on reasonable risks, as\nmeasured, for example, by the gap between interest rates on corporate securities and safe\nTreasury securities. Some of the major downside risks to the outlook have receded as well.\nIn particular, the very frightening European fiscal crisis that erupted this spring, although\nfar from over, has been very well contained. European governments, the European Central\nBank, and the International Monetary Fund acted quickly and effectively to stem a full-blown\nmeltdown. Several countries have instituted aggressive actions to control their ballooning\ngovernment debt and have undertaken reforms aimed at improving economic efficiency and\ncompetitiveness. These actions have so far stopped the crisis from spreading a contagion across\nthe continent.\nOur forecast at the San Francisco Fed is for real GDP growth of about 2½ percent this\nyear. We expect growth to pick up steam next year to between 3½ and 4 percent. Unfortunately,\nthis growth forecast implies only a very gradual decline in unemployment from its current 9.6\npercent rate. I don’t expect the unemployment rate to start to fall until next year. And I expect\nit to remain above 8 percent until sometime in 2012. It will likely take several more years for it\nto return to more normal levels. That is the main reason why this recovery doesn’t feel a whole\n7\n\nlot better than recession. Growth itself doesn’t provide great relief if the unemployment rate\nstays high and so many families still are suffering.\nFinally, I’d like to discuss the outlook for inflation. The measure of inflation I follow\nclosely is the core personal consumption expenditure price index, released each month by the\nCommerce Department. Over the past year, it increased 1.4 percent, somewhat below the 2\npercent level that most FOMC members view as consistent with price stability and about 1\npercentage point below its level at the start of the recession. The fact that inflation declined after\na severe recession is no surprise. In most recessions, slack in labor and goods markets reduces\ninflationary wage and price pressures, resulting in downward movements in inflation.\nActually, the surprise isn’t that inflation has fallen. The surprise is that it’s fallen so\nlittle, given the depth and duration of the recent downturn. Based on the experience of past\nsevere recessions, I would have expected inflation to fall by twice as much as it has. What\nexplains the muted response of inflation this time around? Economic research shows that\ninflation has become much less persistent in the past two decades.3 That’s a dramatic break from\nthe wage-price spirals and escalating inflation of the 1970s. The key to this change in the\nbehavior of inflation is that, following the Fed’s successful reduction of inflation starting in\n1979, people have come to expect that prices will be stable. We call that anchoring of inflation\nexpectations. Unlike the 1970s, when people lacked confidence that the Fed would move\naggressively to control rising inflation, today people expect the Fed to do its best to keep\ninflation low and stable. As a result, people expect that movements in inflation related to the\nbusiness cycle or other influences will be temporary and not lead to permanently higher or lower\ninflation.\n3 See Williams (2006) and Stock and Watson (2010) for analysis and discussion of the change in inflation dynamics.\n8\n\nThis fundamental transformation of the behavior of inflation has important implications\nfor the inflation outlook. First, we expect inflation to dip a bit lower to about 1 percent,\nreflecting the continued weakness of the economy. But, with expectations well anchored, the\nrisk of slipping into a sustained period of falling prices, or deflation, is very small.4\nIn sum, recent data have dimmed somewhat the near-term outlook for growth, but over\nthe next year or two I expect the wind to begin to fill the economy’s sails and for unemployment\nto fall slowly. Inflation remains subdued and the risks of sustained deflation or unacceptably\nhigh inflation appear remote. In any voyage, storms are to be expected, even terrible gales like\nthe one we’ve been through. But, with any luck, the sailing will gradually become smoother as\nthe recession recedes behind us.\n4 See Williams (2009) for a discussion of the risk of deflation and its relationship to the anchoring of inflation\nexpectations.\n9\n\nReferences\nReinhart, Carmen S., and Vincent R.

Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 23, 2011\nUnconventional Monetary Policy: Lessons from the Past Three Years1\nThank you for the kind introduction and for giving me the opportunity to address this\nvery distinguished group in the beautiful city of Zurich. The Swiss National Bank’s annual\nresearch conference has established itself as one of the world’s most substantive forums for\ndiscussion of monetary policy issues. The theme selected for this year’s conference, “Policy\nChallenges and Developments in Monetary Economics,” is particularly timely and relevant. In\nthe past three years, there has certainly been no shortage of policy challenges and developments\nin the field of monetary economics.\nChairman Bernanke said, “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.”2 Well,\nextraordinary measures have been taken. In the face of severe dislocations in financial markets\nand deep declines in economic activity, several central banks have lowered short-term policy\nrates essentially to their zero lower bound. A number of central banks—including the Federal\nReserve—have also used nonstandard or “unconventional” monetary policies. By that I mean\nefforts to influence interest rates and economic activity using tools other than the short-term\npolicy rate.\nBefore the financial crisis, most everything we knew about unconventional monetary\npolicy came from studies of Japan’s Lost Decade and a few scattered episodes in the United\nStates. Now, as a result of the events of the past three years, we have numerous examples of\n1 I would like to thank Eric Swanson, Glenn Rudebusch, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in the preparation of\nthese remarks.\n2 Bernanke (2009).\n1\n\nunconventional monetary policy to study. Tonight I’d like to review some of the lessons gleaned\nfrom these experiences. I also want to highlight some of the key remaining questions regarding\nthe implementation of such policies and their effectiveness as monetary stimulus.\nIn my remarks, I’ll focus on two of these unconventional monetary policy tools—forward\npolicy guidance and large-scale asset purchases, or LSAPs in Fedspeak. There are two reasons\nfor this focus. First, these are the policies that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have\nrelied on most heavily over the past three years.3 As a result, they are also the policies that\nwe’ve learned the most about. And second, these policies are ongoing, and therefore likely to be\nthe most relevant for thinking about future policy. I suppose this is an opportune time to add that\nmy remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nForward policy guidance\nPrior to the crisis, the theoretical literature on the zero lower bound was virtually\nunanimous on one point: A central bank with the ability to credibly commit to a future path of\nshort-term interest rates could, except in the most extreme cases, circumvent the effects of the\nzero lower bound.4 This conclusion stemmed from two insights. First, the output gap and\ninflation rate in standard textbook New Keynesian models are completely determined by long-\nterm interest rates. They do not depend on the short-term rate, except to the extent that the long-\nterm rate is equal to the expected path of future short-term rates. Second, if a central bank can\ncredibly commit to future policy actions, it can continue to control longer-term interest rates,\neven when the short-term rate is at the zero lower bound. It can do so by “managing\n3 Another unconventional monetary policy, analyzed by Svensson (2001), is large-scale foreign currency purchases.\nIndeed, the Swiss National Bank’s recent exchange rate announcement can be thought of as an unconventional\nmonetary policy action in this respect. However, there is still relatively little empirical research on the effectiveness\nof this approach and so I do not discuss it further here.\n4 See, for example, Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003, 2006).\n2\n\nexpectations” about the future path of short-term rates. Thus, in theory, forward guidance about\nthe future path of policy is a potentially powerful tool that can almost completely solve a central\nbank’s problems at the zero lower bound.\nHowever, there are reasons to be skeptical that forward guidance would be such a\npanacea in practice. One of these caveats is implicit in the theory itself. The optimal forward\nguidance policy is not time-consistent. According to the theory, for this policy to have the\ndesired effects, the central bank must commit to two things: keeping the short-term policy rate\nlower than it otherwise would in the future, and allowing inflation to rise higher than it otherwise\nwould. However, when the time comes for the central bank to fulfill this commitment, it may not\nwant to do so. It might find it hard to resist the temptation to raise rates earlier than promised to\navoid the rise in inflation.5 Indeed, policymakers have generally shied away from policies that\npromise temporarily high inflation in the future, such as price level targeting, that are in theory\neffective at circumventing the zero bound. This reluctance arises in part out of a concern that\nsuch an approach could unmoor inflation expectations.6\nA second caveat to the power of forward guidance is that the public may have different\nexpectations of the future course of the economy and monetary policy than the central bank. The\nexpectations channel is crucial for the effectiveness of optimal forward guidance policy. If the\npublic has an imperfect understanding of the central bank’s intended policy path, then forward\nguidance may not work as well as advertised.7 Therefore, a key challenge for forward guidance\nis communicating the intended policy path to the public. Complicating this communication\nchallenge further, optimal forward guidance is inherently state-contingent and depends on\nmyriad factors and risk assessments. These are inherently difficult to convey to the public.\n5 See Adam and Billi (2007), who show that the effects of the zero lower bound are much larger when the central\nbank cannot commit to future policy actions.\n6 Evans (2010) is an exception. See Walsh (2009) for a discussion of this issue.\n7 See Reifschneider and Roberts (2006) and Williams (2006).\n3\n\nMoreover, the public and the media tend to gloss over such nuances and take away simple sound\nbites.\nThere are a number of examples of central banks using forward guidance on monetary\npolicy. A few central banks—New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden—provide explicit forward\nguidance in the form of policy rate projections. Other central banks providing guidance have\nlimited themselves to short statements indicating the direction and time frame of future policy\nactions, rather than full descriptions of an intended policy path.8 The Federal Reserve’s public\nuse of phrases such as “considerable period,” “measured pace,” and “extended period” falls into\nthis category. The Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan have also used forward guidance\nregarding the timing of and conditions for rate increases.9\nLet me conclude my discussion of forward guidance by summarizing the evidence of its\neffectiveness. Several studies have examined the effects of central bank communication more\ngenerally.10 They found that the Federal Reserve’s policy statements have significant effects on\nfinancial market expectations of future policy actions and on Treasury yields. Only a few studies\nhave looked at the effectiveness of forward guidance policies at the zero lower bound. One\nexample was the Bank of Canada’s April 2009 statement that it expected to hold the policy rate\nconstant until the second quarter of 2010, which had an immediate effect on financial market\nexpectations regarding short-term interest rates. The conditionality of the guidance worked as\nwell. When the Canadian economy appeared to be recovering from the recession more quickly\n8 Rudebusch and Williams (2008) provide a discussion of these attempts.\n9 Bank of Canada (2009). In 1999, the Bank of Japan announced that it would continue its zero interest rate policy\n“until deflationary concerns are dispelled.” In 2010 it said, “The Bank will maintain the virtually zero interest rate\npolicy until it judges, on the basis of the ‘understanding of medium- to long-term price stability’ that price stability\nis in sight, on condition that no problem will be identified in examining risk factors, including the accumulation of\nfinancial imbalances.”\n10 See Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005); Kohn and Sack (2004); and Bernanke, Reinhart, and Sack (2004).\n4\n\nthan anticipated, market participants began to expect interest rates to rise ahead of the previously\nannounced date.11\nOf course, we at the Fed have our own recent case study that speaks to the effectiveness\nof forward guidance. The Federal Open Market Committee’s statement issued following our\nAugust meeting said, “The Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions—including\nlow rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are\nlikely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.”\nAs Figure 1 shows, two-year Treasury yields fell by about 10 basis points and ten-year Treasury\nyields fell by about 20 basis points following the announcement. This provides prima facie\nevidence of the powerful effects of forward guidance at the zero bound.\nLarge-scale asset purchases\nLet me turn now to large-scale asset purchases, or LSAPs, the main alternative to forward\nguidance in the unconventional monetary policy arena today. LSAPs are central bank purchases\nof securities funded by an increase in reserves. Their history is older than forward guidance. It\ngoes back at least to Operation Twist, the 1961 joint initiative of the Kennedy Administration\nand the Federal Reserve to purchase longer-term Treasury securities. More recently, the Bank of\nJapan began its so-called quantitative easing policy in 2001. It ultimately resulted in Bank\npurchases of almost 35 trillion yen of Japanese government bonds. In March 2009, the Bank of\nEngland announced it would purchase 200 billion pounds of U.K. gilts. And the Federal Reserve\ncarried out three rounds of large-scale asset purchases during the Great Recession. Two rounds\nof “QE1” took place in November 2008 and March 2009, during the financial crisis. The third\nround followed the “QE2” announcement in November 2010.\n11 See Chehal and Trehan (2009).\n5\n\nA number of theories consider the channels by which LSAPs affect Treasury yields and\nfinancial conditions more broadly.12 I will highlight two: signaling and portfolio. The signaling\nchannel works through the effects asset purchases have on public expectations of future short-\nterm interest rates. The portfolio channel works through the effects on factors that affect yields\nother than expectations of future short-term interest rates.\nThe basic idea of the signaling channel is that, when the central bank conducts asset\npurchases, it is signaling its strong intention to add monetary stimulus by other means as well.\nSuch signaling may lower longer-term yields in two ways. First, it could lower the expected\nfuture path of short-term rates. Second, it could reduce the uncertainty around this path, which\nmay reduce the interest rate risk associated with holding longer-term securities.\nThe theories underlying the portfolio channel are more diverse. In part, this is because\nthe workhorse models of asset pricing—the representative-agent consumption CAPM model and\nthe affine arbitrage-free model—generally do not allow the supply of a security to affect its\nprice. In those frameworks, the supply of the asset is irrelevant for asset pricing.13 Instead, one\nhas to go back to older, more eclectic theories of asset pricing, such as Tobin’s “portfolio\nbalance” model or Modigliani and Sutch’s “preferred habitat” theory. These assume that a range\nof heterogeneous investors have different preferences for different asset classes and that arbitrage\nacross these asset classes is limited. This approach has been integrated into a modern, no-\narbitrage, asset-pricing framework and has been used to guide empirical analysis of LSAP\neffects.14\n12 See Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) for a thorough discussion.\n13 Piazzesi and Schneider (2007) explore quantity effects in the consumption-CAPM framework, whereby changes\nin the relative supplies of different assets affect the household’s consumption process and optimal portfolio decision.\nHowever, this channel results in only very small effects on asset prices.\n14 See Vayanos and Vila (2009) for a recent theoretical model, and Greenwood and Vayanos (2008) and Hamilton\nand Wu (2011) for empirical applications.\n6\n\nThere has been a profusion of studies estimating the effects of LSAPs on asset prices.\nTable 1 summarizes a number of these studies. In order to facilitate comparison, the estimated\neffects in each analysis have been renormalized to correspond to the estimated effect on longer-\nterm bond yields of a $600 billion LSAP operation. That, of course, was the size of the Federal\nReserve’s asset purchase program completed earlier this year.\nExcept for a few outliers, the estimated effects on Treasury yields are remarkably close,\nespecially when you consider the wide variety of sample periods and methods employed.\nSpecifically, the estimated effects typically lie in the neighborhood of 15 to 20 basis points.\nGenerally, the estimates are reasonably precise. Although some might argue that 15 to 20 basis\npoints is small, keep in mind that the typical response of the 10-year Treasury yield to a 75 basis\npoint cut in the federal funds rate is also about 15 to 20 basis points.15 I’ve never heard anyone\nargue that a 75 basis point cut in the funds rate is small potatoes!\nAlthough there is general agreement regarding the magnitude of LSAP effects on\nTreasury yields, there is less agreement regarding the channels LSAPs work through, as\ndiscussed in the paper by Bauer and Rudebusch16 presented at this conference. One way to\ndistinguish between the signaling and portfolio channels is to examine the responses of a variety\nof yields and asset prices to LSAPs. If the main effect is through signaling, then we would\nexpect a strong co-movement among all classes of longer-term yields. In contrast, a relatively\nmuted response of assets that are not close substitutes for Treasury securities would be evidence\nof a portfolio effect.\nThe evidence is far from conclusive, but it does tentatively support some role for the\nportfolio channel. First, by some measures, expected short rates fell by less than government\n15 See Chung et al. (2011, p. 24).\n16 Bauer and Rudebusch (2011).\n7\n\nsecurities of equivalent maturity.17 Second, there is some evidence in the literature that the pass-\nthrough from purchases of Treasury securities to private borrowing rates, such as corporate bond\nrates, may be relatively low.18 To the extent that this is true, it would argue against a strong\nsignaling effect. That said, there remains a great deal of uncertainty regarding the relative\nimportance of these channels.\nMoreover, there is also uncertainty regarding how the portfolio channel actually works.\nIn particular, to what extent is it the size or the composition of the central bank’s balance sheet\nthat matters? This question is no mere theoretical curiosity, but has very real practical relevance.\nFor example, it is critical for gauging the efficacy of a maturity extension program that lengthens\nthe maturity of securities holding with no change in the quantity of holdings, such as the policy\nannounced earlier this week by the FOMC. This program contrasts with a policy that simply\nincreases the holdings of Treasury securities, such as the Fed’s second asset purchase program\ninitiated late last year. The size-versus-composition question bears directly on the relative\neffectiveness of the two policy variants. In addition, the question is relevant for comparing the\neffects of a policy of purchasing Treasury securities with one of buying mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\nFurther research\nAs I have discussed, researchers have made great strides in improving our understanding\nof the effects of unconventional policies. The evidence from the experiences of the past few\nyears convincingly demonstrates that both forward guidance and large scale asset purchases are\nuseful policy tools when short-term interest rates are constrained by the zero bound. Despite this\n17 See Gagnon et al. (2011) and Joyce et al. (2011).\n18 See Swanson (2011), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011), Joyce et al. (2011), and Wright (2011) for\nanalysis of the effects on private rates. Neely (2011) finds strong pass-through from the Fed’s LSAPs to yields on\nforeign sovereign debt.\n8\n\nprogress, I see at least four important issues that are in need of further study. First, what are the\neffects of LSAPs on the overall economy? Specifically, does lowering Treasury yields through\nLSAPs have the same effect on the economy as an equivalent movement in the federal funds\nrate? Or, are the effects of LSAPs attenuated owing to limited pass-through to other asset prices\nor limited duration of LSAP effects?19\nSecond, what approach should central banks take in formulating and communicating\nunconventional policies, whether forward guidance or LSAP programs? For example, what are\nthe advantages of targeting a specific quantity of LSAPs as opposed to targeting a level or ceiling\non interest rates at a particular point on the yield curve? This question is, of course, a new take\non Poole’s (1970) analysis of the choice of a monetary policy instrument. And, if a quantity\napproach is preferable, should LSAP programs be formulated more like a policy rule rather than\ndiscrete lump-sum announcements?20\nThird, should unconventional policies be a regular part of our toolkit or should they be\nreserved only for extraordinary times? That is, should forward guidance and LSAPs complement\nstandard short-rate policies at all times or only at the zero lower bound? These policies are still\nrelatively unfamiliar to the public. Consequently, their effects on the public’s inflation\nexpectations, appetite for risk, and so forth are difficult to predict. This adds an element of\nuncertainty and raises concern about unintended consequences. In addition, LSAPs may create\ndistortions to asset prices or financial market functioning. These negative effects have received\nscant attention in the research literature and are not well understood. Of course, these costs must\nbe weighed against the value of asset purchases for macroeconomic stabilization.\nFinally, how do these policies change our thinking about the optimal rate of inflation? In\nparticular, if unconventional monetary policies can effectively circumvent the zero lower bound,\n19 See Baumeister and Benati (2010) and Chung et al. (2011) for analyses of the macroeconomic effects of LSAPs.\nSee Wright (2011) for a discussion of the duration of LSAP effects.\n20 See Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2009).\n9\n\nthen there is less of a need for an inflation cushion. But, if these policies cannot in practice be\nused as substitutes for reducing the short-term rate, then there is greater need for an inflation\ncushion.\nThese questions offer a wealth of important topics for researchers to explore. The lessons\nwe learn from this research will be critically important when central bankers consider\nunconventional policies in the future. On that note, let me end with a little forward guidance: I\nexpect we will have an extended period of policy challenges, and that developments in monetary\neconomics will be crucial to the future success of monetary policy.

    "text": "Presentation to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco’s 2016 Member Conference\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 21, 2016\nAssessing the New Normal(s)\nGood morning. I represent the 12th Federal Reserve District, and that covers a lot of\nterritory—in fact over a third of the country. An important part of my job is to travel across the\nwestern United States, meeting with people and getting grassroots information about how the\neconomy is doing. But, I’ll admit that once in a while it’s nice to give a speech closer to home\nand be able to sleep in my own bed tonight. That is to say, it’s a pleasure to be here today.\nI’m going to talk about where I see the U.S. economy going and what that means for\nmonetary policy. In addition to the usual reading of the tea leaves about the near-term economic\noutlook, I will take a longer-term perspective and focus on how the new normal for the U.S.\neconomy is shaping up. Before I proceed, I should note that the views I express here are mine\nalone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe dual mandate\nAs a Fed policymaker, I tend to see virtually everything through the lens of our dual\nmandate goals of maximum employment and price stability, and I’ll describe economic\ndevelopments through that lens.\nI’ll begin with employment. Our goal is not to have an unemployment rate of zero.\nInstead, it’s to be near what economists call the “natural rate” of unemployment: That’s the rate\nwe can expect to see in a healthy “Goldilocks” economy—one that’s running neither too hot nor\ntoo cold. It’s impossible to know exactly what that magic number is, but it’s generally thought to\n1\n\nbe between 4¾ and 5 percent today.1 By the way, that’s about the same number that economists\nthought before the recession, so this is one case where the new normal is the same as the old. As\nI’ll note later in my remarks, this is more the exception than the norm.\nWith the unemployment rate at 5 percent, we’re very close to that goal. Of course, the\nunemployment rate isn’t the only measure of labor market health, and it’s reassuring that a range\nof indicators have been improving and are sending similar signals. In particular, one labor market\nindicator that I look to measures what regular people—by that, I mean not just economists—say\nwhen they are asked how hard it is to find a job. Those responses are currently right in line with,\nor in fact even a little better, than the signal we’re getting from the unemployment rate.2\nThat’s great news about the job market, and it means that we won’t need as much job\ngrowth going forward as we’ve seen in the past few years. Because we’re pretty much at full\nemployment now, the future is less about creating an ever stronger labor market than about\nmaintaining a healthy one, which means creating enough new jobs to keep up with the increase\nin the size of the labor force. That number depends on things like the number of people retiring\nthis year or graduating from school and entering the workforce.\nThese factors can change a lot over time. During the 1960s and 1970s, the growing youth\npopulation and rapid labor force entry by women pushed up labor force growth and the rate of\njob growth needed to keep up. It reached a peak of about 160,000 jobs per month in 1980 and\nstayed close to that level through the 1990s. Since then, with labor force growth slowing due to\nan aging population, stabilization in women’s participation, and other factors, required job\n1 In the September 2016 Summary of Economic Projections, the central tendency of estimates of the long-run level\nof the unemployment rate ranged between 4.7 and 5 percent (Board of Governors 2016b). The Congressional\nBudget Office estimates the natural rate to be 4¾ percent as of August (CBO 2016). The median estimate from the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters in August 2016 was 4.8 percent (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/2016/survq316). The Blue Chip Economic Indicators\nestimate is 4.8 percent as of October 2016.\n2 Data are from the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey (https://www.conference-\nboard.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm). See Weidner and Williams (2011).\n2\n\ngrowth slowed substantially. I put it at around 80,000 a month currently. Looking ahead,\nestimates that take account of potential labor force trends imply a range from 50,000 to a little\nover 100,000.3\nSo this year’s pace of job gains of about 180,000 jobs a month is more than twice as fast\nas we need to keep up with the trend in labor force growth and, quite honestly, is unsustainable\nin the long run. With job gains continuing to far outpace labor force growth, I expect the\nunemployment rate to edge down over the next year, bottoming out somewhere between 4½ and\n4¾ percent—a very strong labor market by any standard. Under these conditions, we should\nexpect the pace of job gains to slow, and no one should be alarmed when it does—we should\nonly be alarmed, frankly, if we don’t see that necessary slowdown.\nThis slowdown in labor force growth also has important implications for the new normal\nfor economic growth. In the long run, two factors determine the speed at which the economy can\ngrow in a balanced manner: the size of the labor force and labor productivity. The Congressional\nBudget Office projects that the labor force in the U.S. will grow at about ½ percent per year over\nthe next decade.4 As I mentioned, the transition of women to the labor force is long complete and\nthe baby boomers are already retiring. This is a considerable drop from the pace experienced\nover the past 40 years. This means that, unlike in the 1970s and ’80s, demographics will hinder\nrather than boost potential output growth.\nWe have also seen a significant slowdown in productivity growth. Over the past 40\nyears total-economy productivity growth, or GDP per hour, has typically averaged between 1\nand 1¼ percent per year. Since the 1970s, we’ve only deviated from this pace during the\ninformation technology boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Therefore, a reasonable\n3 Bidder, Mahedy, and Valletta (forthcoming). See also Aaronson, Brave, and Kelley (2016).\n4 CBO (2016).\n3\n\nbenchmark is that total-economy productivity growth in the range of 1 to 1¼ percent represents\nnormal, incremental growth. This view is consistent with research by leading experts.5 Moreover,\nsince educational attainment per worker is unlikely to rise the way it did during much of the 20th\ncentury, the future pace of productivity growth will likely be at the lower end of the historical\nrange, that is, not much above 1 percent.6\nPutting these two ingredients together, demographics and productivity, in my view the\ntrend growth rate of the U.S. economy is between 1½ and 1¾ percent per year.7 This is,\nadmittedly, a far cry from the 3 percent rates ingrained in our memories from the 1980s and\n1990s. Demographic and productivity trends are difficult to bend. In many ways the die has\nalready been cast.\nOf course, there may be a revolutionary invention or technology just around the corner.\nOur crystal ball is hazy about when the next technological revolution will arrive. In the\nmeantime, it’s more likely than not that slow growth is both real and here to stay. And while the\ndays of 3 percent growth are behind us, at least for the foreseeable future, it isn’t the end of the\nworld. We can still run a strong economy. GDP increased about 2 percent last year, yet we added\n2¾ million jobs, and 2016 looks to be a lot like 2015, with continued moderate GDP growth and\nsolid job gains.\nTurning to our second mandate of price stability, the Fed’s monetary policy committee—\nthe Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC for short—has set a long-run goal of 2 percent\ninflation.8 Inflation has been running persistently below that goal for several years. Over the past\ncouple of years, the strengthening of the dollar and declines in energy prices have pushed\n5 Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) and Gordon (2016).\n6 Fernald (2016).\n7 Fernald (2016).\n8 Board of Governors (2016a).\n4\n\ninflation down, but these influences should fade over time. To cut through some of the noise, it’s\nuseful to look at measures of inflation that strip out volatile prices and provide a clearer view of\nthe underlying trend. These suggest that underlying inflation is running about 1¾ percent. So,\nwe’re not quite at our target yet, but we’re getting pretty darn close. The combination of fading\ntransitory factors and a strong economy should help us get back to our 2 percent goal in the next\nyear or two.\nTo sum up, the economic expansion remains on the right track. The labor market is\nstrong, the economy has good forward momentum, and inflation is moving towards our 2 percent\ngoal.\nWhat it means for interest rates\nSo, what does this mean for interest rates? In the context of a strong economy with good\nmomentum, it makes sense to get back to a pace of gradual rate increases, preferably sooner\nrather than later. Let me be clear: In arguing for a gradual increase in interest rates, I’m not\ntrying to stall the economic expansion. It’s just the opposite: My aim is to keep it on a sound\nfooting so that it can be sustained for a long time.9\nHistory teaches us that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate\nimbalances, potentially leading to excessive inflation, asset market bubbles, and ultimately\neconomic correction and recession. A gradual process of raising rates reduces the risks of such\nan outcome. It also allows a smoother, more calibrated process of normalization that gives us\nspace to adjust our responses to any surprise changes in economic conditions. If we wait too long\nto remove monetary accommodation, we hazard allowing imbalances to grow, requiring us to\nplay catch-up, and not leaving much room to maneuver. Not to mention, a sudden reversal of\npolicy could be disruptive and slow the economy in unintended ways.\n9 See Williams (2016a) for further discussion.\n5\n\nAs I said, my goal is to sustain the strong economy for as long as possible. The best way\nto accomplish this is by supporting a moderate pace of growth that is consistent with the new\nnormal pace of GDP and jobs growth and that will keep the unemployment rate near the natural\nrate. I fear that if we allow the economy to overshoot this mark by too much, eventually we will\nneed to reverse course to bring the economy back on track. The experience of past business\ncycles shows that this is a hard, if not impossible, act to pull off, and ultimately ends in\nrecession. A gradual process of removing monetary accommodation reduces this risk.\nHow low can rates stay?\nSo far, I have talked a lot about the new normal for the labor market and economic\ngrowth. What about interest rates? Like job growth and GDP growth, the new normal for\ninterest rates is likely much lower than we are used to. There is growing evidence of a significant\ndecline in the natural rate of interest, or r* (r-star), over the past quarter-century to historically\nlow levels. The natural interest rate is the short-term real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate that\nbalances monetary policy so that it is neither accommodative nor contractionary in terms of\ngrowth and inflation. While a central bank sets its short-term interest rate, r-star is a function of\nfactors beyond its influence.\nA variety of economic factors have pushed natural interest rates very low, and they\nappear poised to stay that way.10 This is the case not just for the United States but for other\neconomies as well. In a recent paper, Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and I estimated the\ninflation-adjusted natural rate for four major economies: the United States, Canada, the euro\narea, and the United Kingdom.11 In 1990, estimates ranged from about 2½ to 3½ percent. By\n10 See Williams (2015), Hamilton et al. (2015), Kiley (2015), Lubik and Matthes (2015), and Laubach and Williams\n(2016).\n11 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016). Estimates are available at: http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/economists/jwilliams/Holston_Laubach_Williams_estimates.xlsx\n6\n\n2007, on the eve of the global financial crisis, these had all declined to between 2 and 2½\npercent. Since then, all four estimates have dropped sharply, to slightly below 1½ percent for\nCanada and the United Kingdom, about ½ percent for the United States, and well below zero for\nthe euro area.\nThe underlying determinants for these declines are related to the global supply and\ndemand for funds, including shifting demographics, slower trend productivity and economic\ngrowth, emerging markets seeking large reserves of safe assets, and a more general global\nsavings glut.12 The key takeaway from these global trends is that interest rates are going to stay\nlower than we’ve come to expect in the past. This does not mean they will be zero, but when\njuxtaposed with pre-recession normal short-term interest rates of, say, 4 to 4½ percent, it may be\njarring to see the underlying r-star guiding us towards a new normal of 3 to 3½ percent—or even\nlower. Importantly, this future of low interest rates is not due to easy monetary policy; instead, it\nis the rate expected to prevail when the economy is at full strength and the stance of monetary\npolicy is neutral.\nConclusion\nAlthough it has been a long, hard road back from the recession, the American economy is\nin good shape and headed in the right direction. We’re essentially at full employment, and\ninflation is well within sight of and on track to reach our target. Given the progress we have\nmade and signs of continued solid momentum in the economy, and consistent with our agreed-\nupon monetary policy approach, it makes sense for the Fed to gradually move interest rates\ntoward more normal levels.\n12 Council of Economic Advisers (2015), International Monetary Fund (2014), Rachel and Smith (2015), and\nCaballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2016).\n7\n\nThis policy path should be viewed in the context of an economy that has mostly cleared\nthe Great Recession but faces a future that looks very different from the past in important ways.\nAlthough the natural rate of unemployment appears close to what it was a decade ago,\ndemographic trends and a sustained productivity slowdown have pushed down the normal\ngrowth rates of jobs and GDP and have lowered the normal rates of interest. These developments\nwill shape the economic landscape for years to come.\nThank you.\n8\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Scott A.

    "text": "Presentation to the University of San Diego School of Business Administration\nSan Diego, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 3, 2012\nMonetary Policy and the Slow Recovery: It’s Not Just About Housing\nThank you. It’s a particular pleasure to be with you this morning. The subject of my talk\ntoday is the outlook for the economy and Federal Reserve policy. I’ll start with a look at the\nnational economy, focusing on why the recent recession was so severe and why the recovery has\nbeen relatively anemic. I’ll then talk about prospects for growth, employment, and inflation.\nFinally, I’ll discuss what the Federal Reserve is doing to bolster the recovery. My remarks\nrepresent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me begin by saying that I’m encouraged by recent signs of a stronger, self-sustaining\nrecovery. I’m especially glad to see that the economy is adding jobs at a pretty decent clip. Still,\nwe have a long way to go. The Fed’s mandate from Congress is to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices.1 Inflation generally has been subdued over the past few years.\nBut, more than four years after the recession began, the unemployment rate is still 8.3 percent,\nleaving us far short of our employment goal. The Fed has acted vigorously to boost the\neconomy. It’s critical that we keep doing so in order to achieve our statutory mandate.\nI’d like to start with a little bit of history. We are in the aftermath of the worst financial\ncrisis and economic downturn since the Great Depression. The downturn came in the wake of an\nunprecedented run-up in housing prices, followed by a traumatic collapse. Although the\nrecession started with this burst housing bubble, the economy’s problems over the past few years\n1 Williams (2012b).\n1\n\nhave extended well beyond housing. In the broad sense, what we’ve seen has been a sharp fall in\nhousehold and business demand for goods and services. That has caused the economy to\nperform well below its potential.\nLet’s look at this in more detail. The housing boom was a classic financial bubble, fueled\nby speculative excess. Buyers kept bidding up prices, convinced they could sell for more than\nthey paid. Lenders enabled this behavior by offering excessively easy terms. The growth in\nhouse prices outstripped anything that could be supported by market fundamentals, such as\nhousehold incomes or rental rates on comparable properties.\nThe inevitable crash landed with a resounding thud. Beginning in 2006, home prices\nplummeted. Eventually they fell by about a third nationally. About a quarter of borrowers found\nthemselves under water, owing more than their homes were worth. Large chunks of the wealth\nof tens of millions of Americans vanished. Overall, the destruction of net worth from housing\nequaled more than 40 percent of the value of annual U.S. production.\nWhen wealth is destroyed on such a vast scale, the economic effects are severe. During\nthe boom, higher house prices helped fuel consumption as people tapped home equity to buy\ncars, boats, vacations, and the like. When house prices did a U-turn, households hunkered down.\nThey cut spending and salted away more savings to rebuild lost wealth. And that wasn’t the\nhousing bust’s only depressing effect. By early 2009, home construction had plunged by over 75\npercent from its 2006 high. It’s remained near historical lows since. That’s put a lid on demand\nfor construction materials and home furnishings. And it’s kept millions of carpenters, plumbers,\nand others in construction and real estate out of work.\n2\n\nIt’s impossible to understand the economy of the past few years without taking into\naccount these housing effects.2 Consider the difference in economic performance between states\nhit hard by the housing bust and states that got off relatively lightly. Figure 1 shows price\ndeclines by state. The hardest hit states, including Nevada, Arizona, California, and Florida, are\nshown in red. Prices in these states plunged by 40 percent or more from their peaks. By\ncontrast, the states shown in green posted price declines of less than 15 percent. In one green\nstate, North Dakota, prices actually increased.\nFigure 2 shows the drop in employment during the downturn by state, using the same\ncolor coding as Figure 1. For example, in the hard-hit states, shown in red here, employment fell\nby 8 percent or more. The overlap with the pattern of house price declines is striking. The states\nwhere home prices fell most were generally among those that suffered the worst job losses\nduring the recession. In states where prices fell less, employment declined less.3\nTo be sure, this overlap was not perfect. Employment fell in all but North Dakota and\nAlaska, with sharp declines registered even in some states where the housing bust wasn’t harsh.\nExamples include Indiana, Ohio, and South Carolina. One reason this happened is the tight web\nthat binds economic activity in far-flung places in the modern world.4 When under water\nhomeowners in the Central Valley put off buying new cars, auto workers in Indiana may lose\ntheir jobs.\nBut, what is fascinating, and perhaps surprising, is this: The close relationship between\nthe fall in home prices and state economic activity has largely disappeared during the recovery.5\n2 See, for example, Mian and Sufi (2011), Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011), and Feroli et al. (2012).\n3 Williams (2012a).\n4 Mian and Sufi (2011).\n5 Williams (2012a).\n3\n\nFigure 3 shows state employment gains during the rebound. There’s almost no systematic\nrelationship between employment growth and home price declines.\nFigure 4 reinforces this. The blue line measures the gap in employment growth rates\nbetween states where the job market has been relatively stronger and states where it has been\nweaker. This gap grew sharply during the recession, reflecting in part the uneven effects of the\nhousing bust. But, during the recovery, the gap has been smaller than at any time since the mid-\n1970s. In other words, across the country, state-level employment growth has become quite\nbalanced.\nThese comparisons indicate that the economy faces obstacles that are national in scope.\nThe slow pace of expansion has affected all regions of the country. During the recovery, states\nwhere house price declines have been relatively mild have not done noticeably better than states\nwhere housing got hammered. Powerful forces have kept us stuck in a slow-growth pattern.\nSome of those forces reflect the direct effects of the housing collapse on household finances.\nThe connection with housing is less direct for other forces holding back the economy. I’ll\nhighlight three of those forces: tight credit, uncertainty, and government contraction.\nTight credit was clearly a product of the housing bust. But it took on a life of its own\nwhen fallout from housing almost brought down the global financial system in 2008. The\nrepercussions of those dramatic events still affect markets today. Let me explain how this played\nout.\nWhen home prices crashed, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures surged. Exposure\nto risky U.S. subprime mortgages was spread globally through investments held by financial\ninstitutions. Those mortgages had been repackaged to create financial instruments of mind-\nbending complexity. When the music stopped, it was hard to tell who was left with all those\n4\n\ntoxic assets. Financial institutions became afraid to lend money to anybody, including other\nfinancial institutions. The result was a massive credit crunch that choked off the flow of funds\nfinancial institutions and nonfinancial businesses depend on for their day-to-day operations.\nMany financial institutions that had placed big bets on housing posted massive losses. Some of\nthem failed.\nThankfully, central banks and governments around the world stepped in to provide\nemergency loans and other support. Those interventions prevented complete financial collapse.\nIn the United States, the financial system has healed to a very considerable extent. The Fed\nrecently conducted a series of tests on the largest U.S. banks. We found that most of them would\nhave adequate capital even if the economy went through another extreme downturn.\nAs financial institutions have regained their footing, access to credit has improved.\nNevertheless, we haven’t returned to normal. Many small businesses and consumers still\nstruggle to get loans. For example, to get a mortgage, a borrower must have a top-notch credit\nrating and the cash to make a substantial down payment.\nUncertainty is a second factor holding back the recovery. Businesses, investors, and\nhouseholds remain skittish, even in the face of better economic news. Many of my business\ncontacts say they remain cautious about expanding because they’re unsure about future\nconditions. Ordinary Americans worry about job prospects and future income. Everybody is\nunsettled by the highly charged political environment.\nFinancial turmoil in Europe has added another dimension to the unease here. The\nimminent threat of European financial meltdown has diminished. But the underlying problem of\ncountries with unsustainable debt has not been resolved. Over the next few years, the total debt\nload among countries that use the euro will grow larger. I’ve heard Europe’s policy described as\n5\n\nkicking the can down the road. But the risk is that Europe might be rolling an ever-growing\nsnowball down a hill.\nGovernment cutbacks are a third obstacle to growth. Typically, government spending\nrises when the economy turns down. That’s because the cost of safety net programs, such as\nunemployment insurance, go up. And sometimes governments deliberately boost spending to\nstimulate the economy. But the federal government’s long-term budget problems loom large.\nAnd state and local government finances are reeling from the economic downturn. As a result,\ngovernment stimulus has been unusually limited.\nFigure 5 compares recent inflation-adjusted spending by state and local governments with\npast periods. The red line represents the most recent recession and recovery. The shaded region\nportrays the range of outcomes over the eight previous recessions and recoveries, with the\naverage displayed in black. During the current period, the housing bust has cut into the revenue\nof state and local governments, forcing them to slash spending.6 That contrasts with comparable\nperiods in the past, when such spending typically increased.\nI don’t see government spending turning around soon. Indeed, spending at the federal\nlevel is set to contract sharply at the end of this year as several temporary programs end. Some\nof those programs may be extended. But, overall, we can expect federal spending trends to\nweigh on near-term economic growth.\nHowever, things are getting better as far as tight credit and uncertainty are concerned.\nImprovements in credit, and rises in business and consumer confidence, have helped the\neconomy gain real traction. We can see the improvement in the data. Consumer spending hasn’t\nbeen growing fast, but it’s been growing steadily. Car sales have surged and nearly reached pre-\n6 Feroli et al. (2012).\n6\n\nrecession levels in February. The rebound in car sales and strong exports of other goods have\nhelped U.S. manufacturers create jobs at the fastest pace since the mid-1990s.\nReal gross domestic product measures the nation’s total output of goods and services\nadjusted for inflation. During the first half of 2011, real GDP expanded at just under a 1 percent\nannual rate. Then, in the second half, it shifted into higher gear, rising at nearly a 2½ percent\npace. My forecast calls for GDP growth to pick up further to about 2½ percent this year and 2¾\npercent in 2013. That’s not overdrive, but it does represent improvement.\nAs I said earlier, the news from the labor market has been heartening. The jobless rate\nhas fallen about three-quarters of a percentage point since August and is now at its lowest level\nin three years. Unfortunately, the kind of moderate economic growth I expect won’t sustain such\nrapid progress. The February unemployment rate held steady at 8.3 percent. I expect\nunemployment rates to remain around 8 percent through year-end. And we’re still likely to be\naround 7 percent at the end of 2014. We haven’t had such a long period of high unemployment\nin the United States since the Great Depression. And this phenomenon is widespread.\nCompared with December 2007, when the recession began, the unemployment rate is up in all 50\nstates. That’s true even in North Dakota and Alaska, the two states where total employment\ngrew during the recession.\nEconomists have been debating why unemployment has been so high during this\nrecovery. Broadly speaking, they fall into two camps. One group argues that changes in the\nstructure of the economy are pushing up the unemployment rate. The other group maintains that\nhigh unemployment is the result of a severe downturn, which significantly cut demand for goods\nand services.\n7\n\nThose who favor a structural explanation point out that many job seekers lack the skills\nemployers need. For example, computer industry employers are having a hard time finding\nqualified workers. But they’re not likely to find such employees in the ranks of jobless\nconstruction workers. If such labor market mismatches are widespread, they could be boosting\nthe unemployment rate.\nTo put this in perspective, I’m going to introduce the concept of the natural rate of\nunemployment. The natural rate is basically an equilibrium jobless rate that pushes inflation\nneither up, nor down. Before the recession, most economists thought this rate was around 5\npercent. Today though, economists in the structural camp argue that the natural rate has risen\nsubstantially, largely because of the labor market mismatches I described. The idea is that a lot\nof people are unemployed not because jobs are lacking, but because those jobs require skills\nunemployed workers don’t have. If this were correct, then our 8.3 percent unemployment rate\nmight not be that far above the natural unemployment rate. In other words, we might not really\nbe so far from the Fed’s goal of maximum sustainable employment.\nI’m not convinced. Research at the San Francisco and New York Feds suggests that job\nmismatches are limited in scope. The difficulty some Silicon Valley companies find hiring\nsoftware engineers is not enough to fundamentally transform the labor market. Now, other\nfactors besides skill mismatches may also have helped push up the natural unemployment rate.\nOver the longer term, mismatches and other labor market inefficiencies may have raised the\nnatural unemployment rate from about 5 percent to around 6 to 6½ percent.7 So, in my view, the\nnation remains far from the Fed’s goal of maximum sustainable employment.\n7 See, for example, Daly et al. (2012) and Weidner and Williams (2011).\n8\n\nThe Fed’s other goal is to keep prices stable. I would say that we’ve succeeded pretty\nwell on that score. Inflation overall has been well-contained. Taking a long view, over the past\n15 years, the overall inflation rate has averaged almost exactly 2 percent, which is the Fed’s\ntarget rate of inflation. The same is true of the past five years, a tumultuous period of crisis,\nrecession, and recovery.\nNow, it’s true that inflation picked up to 2½ percent last year as the prices of oil and other\ncommodities surged in the face of strong global demand. Oil prices have run up again recently\nin response to geopolitical concerns. But other commodity prices have not generally followed\nsuit. I expect inflation to be near our 2 percent target this year and edge down a bit toabout 1½\npercent in 2013.\nLet me summarize where the Fed stands in terms of achieving its congressionally\nmandated goals. We are far below maximum employment and are likely to remain there for\nsome time. The housing bust and financial crisis set in motion an extraordinarily harsh\nrecession, which has held down consumer, businesses, and government spending. By contrast,\ninflation is contained and may even fall next year below our 2 percent target.\nUnder these circumstances, it’s essential that we keep strong monetary stimulus in place.\nThe recovery has been sluggish nationwide, not just in states hit hard by the housing bust. High\nunemployment, restrained demand, and idle production capacity are national in scope. These are\njust the sorts of problems monetary policy can address. And we don’t need to worry that our\nstimulative monetary policy could fuel regional imbalances.\nMonetary policy works by raising and lowering interest rates. The Fed’s policymaking\nbody is the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. In December 2008, when the\nrecession’s full force hit, the FOMC slashed its benchmark interest rate close to zero. It’s been\n9\n\nthere since. Standard monetary policy guidelines tell us this rate should have gone deep into\nnegative territory. But that’s not possible.8\nSo the Fed has had to find other ways to stimulate the economy. One measure we’ve\nadopted has been to buy large quantities of longer-term securities issued by the U.S. government\nand mortgage agencies. Our purchases have raised demand for these securities, lowering their\nyields. And that has put downward pressure on other longer-term interest rates, making it\ncheaper for households, businesses, and governments to borrow.\nThese policy actions have been effective. For example, recent gains in automobile sales\nhave a lot to do with cheap financing. And our securities purchases have helped drive longer-\nterm interest rates near to post-World War II lows. In particular, our purchases of mortgage-\nrelated securities appear to have lowered home loan rates significantly.9 Low mortgage rates\nhave been crucial in stabilizing home sales and construction.\nI should emphasize that our unusually stimulative monetary policy won’t last forever.\nEventually, as recovery picks up, we will trim our securities holdings and raise our interest rate\ntarget. We’ve planned in detail for this, and we’re confident we can do it in a timely and\neffective fashion.10 But, that time is still well off in the future.\nWe’ve passed through extraordinary economic times that have required extraordinary\nresponses from the Fed. We’re not miracle workers. Lower interest rates alone can’t instantly\nput the economy right. But things would be much worse if we hadn’t acted so forcefully. We\n8 See Rudebusch (2009) and Chung et al. (2012) for discussion of the effects of the zero bound on interest\nrate policy in the recession, and Swanson and Williams (2012) for estimates of the effects of constrained\nmonetary policy.\n9 Hancock and Passmore (2011) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) find significant effects\nof mortgage-backed securities purchases. Stroebel and Taylor (2009), by contrast, do not.\n10 See, for example, the discussion of exit strategy in the minutes for the June 2011 FOMC meeting\n(Board of Governors 2011).\n10\n\nwere vigilant in 2008 and 2009 when the economy was in dire straits. We remain vigilant now,\nwhen the economy is showing real signs of improvement, sharply focused on our goals of\nmaximum sustainable employment and price stability.

    "text": "Presentation to the Financial Women’s Association of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 15, 2012\nThe Economy, Fiscal Policy, and Monetary Policy1\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to speak to the Financial Women’s Association of San\nFrancisco. My subject is how the U.S. economy is doing and where it’s heading. I’ll highlight\nwhere things are improving as well as some of the things that are holding us back. In doing so,\nI’ll take both a short-term and long-term look at the impact of fiscal policy on the economy. I’ll\nfinish by going over measures we at the Federal Reserve recently announced aimed at boosting\ngrowth and getting us closer to our goals of maximum employment and price stability. As\nalways, my remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThe events of the past five years have been tumultuous. We’ve lived through the worst\nfinancial crisis and recession in our country since the Great Depression. We still bear the scars\nof those events, but there’s no doubt our economy is on the mend.2 Private-sector payrolls have\nclimbed for 31 consecutive months, adding nearly 4¾ million jobs.3 That’s more than half what\nwe lost in the recession. After reaching a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, unemployment\nhas declined by more than two percentage points to 7.8 percent. That’s real progress. But we’re\nstill a long way from where we should be.\n1 I want to thank John Fernald and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 See Williams (2012a) for a discussion of the financial roots of the crisis and how they have affected the pace of\nrecovery.\n3 The employment gains since the recession are likely to be revised up, according to a preliminary announcement by\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, the BLS estimates that their upcoming benchmark revisions will add\n453,000 private-sector jobs as of March 2012. The revisions will be implemented with the release of the January\n2013 employment report. See BLS (2012).\n1\n\nAs for credit conditions, they’re much improved from a few years ago. For many\nborrowers, interest rates are at or near historic lows. And lenders seem more willing to extend\ncredit. Consumer and business demand pent up during the recession is reviving. We can see\nthat, for example, in car sales, which collapsed during the recession. Now, with auto financing\nrates at rock bottom and more people working, motor vehicle sales have climbed over 60 percent\nfrom their recession lows.\nAnother encouraging development is that housing is once more showing signs of life.\nMortgage rates are at historically low levels and homes are extraordinarily affordable. Sales are\nrising, inventories have come down, and we’ve started working off the huge backlog of\nforeclosed properties. Nationally, home prices are starting to rise. Here in San Francisco, we\ncan even say that the housing market is heating up.\nThe housing recovery includes a rebound in home construction, something particularly\nimportant for the health of the overall economy. Housing starts collapsed during the downturn,\nplummeting from a seasonally adjusted annual pace of over 2 million new units during the boom\nto around half a million in the depths of the recession. Such a dearth of homebuilding couldn’t\ncontinue if we were to have enough homes for a growing population. The latest data show\nhousing starts rising to an annual rate of 750,000 units. That’s a big increase, but still well short\nof the longer-run trend of about 1.5 million units. Over the next few years, an ongoing recovery\nin housing construction should be one of the key drivers of economic growth.\nI’ve highlighted a few sectors—autos and housing—that were hard hit during the\nrecession, but are on their way back. Why then are we unable to shift into a higher gear of\ngrowth? Three reasons stand out: the European crisis, the budget squeeze at all levels of\ngovernment in the United States, and a pervasive sense of uncertainty.\n2\n\nEurope’s problems have been a dark cloud hanging over global financial markets and our\nown economy for the past two years. What started as a financial problem in several European\ncountries has morphed into a general economic downturn—and the shock waves are hitting us.\nU.S. companies are seeing lower demand for their products. The same is true for other countries\nthat sell to Europe, such as China.\nRecently, the European Central Bank announced a bold plan to stabilize the markets for\ngovernment debt of countries under stress. Hopefully, this will buy enough time for European\ngovernments to put in place more comprehensive solutions for their banking and sovereign debt\nproblems. But it is far from certain that European leaders will succeed in doing so. One\nchallenge is that, in exchange for aid, authorities have demanded austerity measures, including\ntax increases and deep spending cuts. In the longer term, these measures are needed to put\ngovernment budgets on sustainable paths. But, in the near term, austerity has held down\neconomic growth further, prolonging economic downturns and making it tougher to trim budget\ndeficits.\nEurope is by no means the only thing pressing on the U.S. economy now. In our country,\ntax cuts and spending increases gave the economy a badly needed boost in the depths of the\nrecession and early in the recovery. But these stimulus measures have been expiring. At the\nsame time, states and localities have cut spending and raised taxes as they struggle to balance\ntheir budgets. As a result, fiscal policy in the United States has shifted from the accelerator to\nthe brakes as far as growth is concerned.4\nThe numbers tell the story. Government consumption expenditures and investment have\ndeclined 5.3 percent over the past two years, adjusted for inflation. That’s equivalent to more\n4 See Lucking and Wilson (2012).\n3\n\nthan a 1 percent reduction in gross domestic product. Meanwhile, state, local, and federal\ngovernment employment has fallen by 570,000 jobs, or 2½ percent, over the past four years.\nIncluding these cuts, federal, state, and local government employment now make up\nabout 16½ percent of all employment. Let me put that number in perspective. Figure 1 shows\nthe trends in government employment as a share of total employment since 1955. The current\ngovernment share is roughly the same as the average of the past 20 years, and well below the\npeak reached in the 1970s. Interestingly, federal employees constitute only about 2 percent of\ntotal employment today. That figure is less than half of what it was in the early 1960s.5\nOf course, the elephant in the room in terms of fiscal policy are the huge federal deficits\nwe’ve been amassing. Figure 2 shows federal deficits as a share of gross domestic product\nstarting in 1930 and including projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for\nthe next 10 years based on current law. In recent years, taxes as a share of GDP fell to their\nlowest level since the early 1950s, while spending rose to its highest level. The result has been\nthe widest deficits of the post–World War II era—over 10 percent of GDP in 2009 and projected\nstill at 7 percent in 2012—requiring the government to borrow over a trillion dollars in that fiscal\nyear.\nThis huge deficit is in part a product of the recession and slow recovery. As businesses\nclosed and jobs disappeared, tax revenue fell. Meanwhile, spending soared as more people\nqualified for programs such as unemployment insurance. In addition, Congress and the White\nHouse boosted spending and cut taxes to stimulate the economy. Finally, unrelated to the\ndownturn, tax rates put in place early in the past decade cut into federal revenue.\n5 Data are for federal civilian employment. Uniformed military is currently about half the level of federal civilian\nemployment. From 1960 to the late 1990s, military employment fell 45 percent and it’s been fairly constant since\nthen.\n4\n\nThe drag on the economy could turn dramatically worse at the beginning of 2013. You\nmay have heard the expression “fiscal cliff.” It refers to large federal tax increases and spending\ncuts that will automatically take place under current legislation. These include ending the\ntemporary payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits. Caps on some federal outlays\nand sharp cuts in others are also set to go into effect. In addition, the Bush-era tax cuts are\nscheduled to expire. In Figure 2, you can see the fiscal cliff in the dramatic reduction in the\nfederal deficit that would take place over the next few years under current law.\nNow, I don’t expect all these tax hikes and spending cuts to take place as scheduled. For\nexample, it’s likely that the Bush tax cuts will be extended temporarily and that some spending\ncuts will be deferred. Still, there’s little doubt that some austerity measures will hit, and that is\nlikely to slow our economy’s progress.\nIf my prediction is wrong though, and the entire range of fiscal cliff measures stays in\nplace, the effects on the economy next year would be much more severe. The Congressional\nBudget Office estimates that the complete fiscal cliff package would knock 2¼ percentage points\noff growth in 2013 and push unemployment up a percentage point compared with the less\ndraconian scenario I expect. If that happens, the economy could find itself on the brink of\nrecession.\nOf course, fiscal policy is not the Fed’s responsibility. Under our system of government,\nCongress and the White House set the budget. Still, the Fed has a compelling interest because\nfiscal policy has such an important impact on the economy. Europe shows dramatically how\ngovernment budget problems can wreak havoc with the economy.\nI’ve been talking about fiscal issues in the context of our economy today and in the\nperiod just ahead. I’d like to take a moment to discuss the longer-term budget picture. Figure 3\n5\n\nshows publicly held federal debt as a fraction of the economy. Publicly held debt has jumped\nfrom 36 percent of GDP in 2007 to a projected 73 percent this year. This can’t go on. One\nlesson from Europe is that there are limits to how big government debt can grow. If our debt\ngets too big, a crisis of confidence could erupt.\nWhat happens depends on the choices we make. Figure 3 also shows two Congressional\nBudget Office projections for the federal debt.6 The baseline scenario assumes that all the fiscal\ncliff measures take place.7 What’s striking is that federal debt steadily declines as a share of\nGDP over coming decades. Compare that with the CBO’s alternative scenario, in which the\nBush tax cuts are extended indefinitely and some spending cuts are suspended.8 Federal debt\nliterally shoots off the chart, reaching 200 percent of GDP in a few decades.\nThis chart paints a scary picture. But it’s important to keep in mind that many\ncombinations of spending and taxes could put us on a sustainable path. The fiscal cliff scenario\nis only one—and not the most desirable one, because of the damage it would do to the recovery.\nBut as the nation moves toward a sustainable budget, we need to make wise choices about how\nto spend our money. And we must make sure we have the revenue to pay for this spending.\nHow we tax and spend will affect economic growth and our standard of living. Let me sketch\nout some things we should keep in mind.\nIn the long run, economic growth depends not only on an expanding population, but also\non how productive our people and businesses are. That productivity depends on our investments\n6 The figure shows the most commonly used measure, which is known as debt in the hands of the public. That’s\ndebt owned by individuals, corporations, state and local government, or foreigners. It excludes claims of one part of\nthe federal government on the rest of the federal government.\n7 The CBO baseline includes other assumptions, including that tax brackets and alternative minimum tax limits are\nnever adjusted for inflation.\n8 There are a number of other technical differences between the two projections. See CBO (2012a, b) for details.\n6\n\nin factories and offices, equipment and technology, and worker skills. It also depends on our\nnew ideas and innovations.\nFigure 4 estimates how important each of these factors has been for economic growth.\nOver the past 40 years, total business output climbed nearly 3 percent per year on average. A\nlittle over a third of that reflects more hours of work as the labor force grew. But productivity\nhas also risen because of our investments in, first, physical capital, including workplaces and\nequipment; and, second, education and skills training. A third factor, innovation and government\ninvestment, has also been vitally important.9\nThe private sector makes the most important contributions to these three productivity-\nenhancing factors. Businesses decide how much to invest in research and development, and\nplants and equipment. Private individuals decide what kind of training or education they want.\nBut government plays a crucial role too. State, local, and the federal government spend around a\ntrillion dollars annually on transportation and education. Education makes our workforce more\nproductive. Public infrastructure, such as highways, ports, and airports, complements private\nbusiness investment.10 And spending on national defense at the federal level and public safety at\nthe state and local levels provide the security and protection of property rights necessary for our\nfree market system to function.\nNot least of all, the federal government funds about 30 percent of research and\ndevelopment. Plenty of R&D doesn’t produce quick returns for business, but contributes real\nvalue to society by laying the groundwork for future private-sector initiatives. Knowledge is by\n9 The data come from Fernald (2012). The contribution of physical capital is capital’s share of income multiplied by\nthe growth in the capital–hours ratio. The contribution of skills is measured as labor’s share of income times an\nindex of labor quality. Broad innovation and government investment is a measure known as total factor\nproductivity.\n10 See, for example, Fernald (1999) and Leduc and Wilson (2012). Conceptually, the contribution of infrastructure\nbelongs in the contribution of physical capital. However, the measure plotted in Figure 4 shows the contribution of\nnongovernment capital. For the period since 1972, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that infrastructure\ncould plausibly explain about one-tenth of what has been labeled innovation, or total factor productivity.\n7\n\nits nature a public good. Once it is gained, it can be reproduced at relatively little cost. As a\nresult, the private sector tends to underinvest in creating new knowledge because businesses\ndon’t take into account the full benefits to society. Instead, they are focused on the direct profits\nit produces.11 There’s no better example of a public good that sparked the development of a new\nindustry than the Internet. It was a government and academic communication channel for years\nbefore it exploded into commercial success. Indeed, many of the technologies we take for\ngranted today originated in government-funded basic research.\nWhat all this means is that we must get our fiscal house in order. But, in doing so, we\nmust continue to make the investments needed to make our economy more productive and\ncompetitive. Infrastructure, research, and education are three areas that must not be sacrificed as\nwe fix our budget problems. That is, we must continue to plant the seeds for our future and not\neat our seed corn.\nWe face a devilishly complicated balancing act. In the short run, we don’t want to\njeopardize the recovery by moving too fast to slash spending and raise taxes. But, in the longer\nrun, we must get spending and revenue aligned, trim the deficit, and keep the national debt from\nballooning. At the same time, we should continue investing in areas that spur improvements in\nour standard of living.\nOf course, these are contentious issues that must be resolved through political processes\nat all levels of government. This takes time, and can be disruptive and unsettling. It brings me\nto a third factor holding back the recovery—uncertainty. The crisis in Europe, the fiscal cliff,\nand, more generally, the tumultuous events of the past five years have made people unsure about\nthe future and undermined the economic confidence that spurs spending and investment. Greater\nuncertainty causes households and businesses to boost saving out of fear over what lies ahead.\n11 See Romer (1990) and Jones and Williams (1998).\n8\n\nWith everyone hunkering down and preparing for the worst, businesses see a drop-off in demand\nfor their goods and services. That in turn damps economic growth and drives up\nunemployment.12 Just about everyone I talk with stresses that uncertainty is holding back hiring\nand investment. Indeed, uncertainty about the economy—including federal fiscal policy—\nappears to have all but paralyzed some businesses, prompting them to postpone capital spending\nand payroll expansion.\nI’d like now to offer my economic outlook and talk about what the Federal Reserve is\ndoing to help keep our economy on the road of recovery, while keeping inflation low. Congress\nassigned the Fed two goals in setting monetary policy: maximum employment and price stability.\nI estimate that, right now, an unemployment rate of about 6 percent would be consistent with the\nFed’s goal of maximum employment.13 In terms of the Fed’s other statutory goal—price\nstability—our monetary policy body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, has\nspecified that a 2 percent inflation rate is most consistent with our dual mandate.\nSo, how are we doing? The current 7.8 percent unemployment rate is well above 6\npercent. And progress on reducing unemployment has been uneven over the past year. As for\nprice stability, inflation has averaged 1½ percent over the past year, below our 2 percent target.\nGiven this situation, it was essential that we at the Fed provide the stimulus needed to\nkeep our economy moving toward maximum employment and price stability. So, at our policy\nmeeting in September, we took two strong measures aimed at achieving this goal.14 First, we\nannounced a new program to purchase $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month.\nThis is in addition to our ongoing program to expand our holdings of longer-term Treasury\n12 See Bloom (2009) and Leduc and Liu (2012).\n13 See Daly et al. (2012), Lazear and Spletzer (2012), and Williams (2012b).\n14 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n9\n\nsecurities by $45 billion a month. Second, we announced that we expect to maintain\nexceptionally low levels of our benchmark federal funds rate at least through mid-2015.\nThese actions work the same way monetary policy always does—by lowering borrowing\ncosts and improving broader financial conditions.15 For example, low interest rates cut the cost\nof borrowing to buy a car, making people more willing to make the purchase. And, as car sales\nincrease, automakers need to produce more cars and more parts, which leads them to hire\nadditional factory workers and sales personnel. This is exactly the kind of virtuous circle that\nprovides the oomph in a healthy economic recovery.\nThanks in part to the Fed’s recent policy actions, I anticipate the economy will gain\nmomentum over the next few years. I expect real gross domestic product to expand at a modest\npace of about 1¾ percent this year, but improve to 2½ percent growth next year and 3¼ percent\nin 2014. As Figure 5 shows, I see the unemployment rate gradually declining to about 7¼\npercent by the end of 2014. And, as indicated in Figure 6, I expect inflation to remain slightly\nbelow 2 percent for the next few years as increases in labor costs remain subdued and public\ninflation expectations stay at low levels.\nI should stress that our recently announced purchase program is intended to be flexible\nand adjust to changing circumstances. Unlike our past asset purchase programs, this one doesn’t\nhave a preset expiration date. Instead, it is explicitly linked to what happens with the economy.\nIn particular, we will continue buying mortgage-backed securities until the job market looks\nsubstantially healthier. We said we might even expand our purchases to include other assets.\nBut, if we find that our policies aren’t doing what we want or are causing significant economic\nproblems, we will adjust or end them as appropriate.\n15 See Williams (2011).\n10\n\nThese policy actions are designed to help us achieve both our maximum employment and\nprice stability goals. In no way has our commitment to price stability wavered. Over the past\nfour years, the inflation rate has averaged a mere 1.3 percent, close to the lowest rate recorded\nover a four-year period since the mid-1960s. The Fed’s recently announced actions should help\nmove inflation up a bit closer to our 2 percent long-run goal.\nMonetary policy cannot solve all our economic problems. But it can help speed the pace\nof recovery and get our country back on track sooner. Our policy actions are completely\nconsistent with the statement of longer-term goals and policy strategy the FOMC released in\nJanuary.16 I’m convinced they represent the best course to move us closer to those goals. Thank\nyou very much.\n16 For more information, see Board of Governors (2012a).\n11\n\nReferences\nBloom, Nicholas. 2009. “The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks.” Econometrica 77(3), pp. 623–685.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012a. “Press Release.” January 25.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012b. “Press Release.” September 13.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\nBureau of Labor Statistics. 2012. “Current Employment Statistics: CES Preliminary Benchmark\nAnnouncement.” September 27. http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesprelbmk.htm\nCongressional Budget Office. 2012a. “The 2012 Long-Term Budget Outlook.” June 5.\nhttp://www.cbo.gov/publication/43288\nCongressional Budget Office. 2012b. “An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years\n2012 to 2022.” August 22. http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43539\nDaly, Mary C., Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert Valletta. 2012. “A Search and Matching\nApproach to Labor Markets: Did the Natural Rate of Unemployment Rise?” Journal of Economic\nPerspectives 26(3, Summer), pp. 3–26.\nFernald, John G. 2012. “A Quarterly, Utilization-Adjusted Series on Total Factor Productivity.” Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper 2012-19.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2012/wp12-19bk.pdf\nFernald, John G. 1999. “Roads to Prosperity?

    "text": "Presentation to the Hayek Group, Reno, Nevada\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 6, 2016\nWhither Inflation Targeting?\nGood evening; it’s a pleasure to be here to discuss the economy and monetary policy with\nthe Hayek Group. I’ll start with a quick overview of the U.S. economic outlook and what it\nmeans for monetary policy. Spoiler alert: The punch line is that the economy has climbed back to\nfull strength, and it therefore makes sense to move monetary policy gradually back to normal.\nThat brings me to the second topic of my talk: What is “normal” monetary policy? After nearly\neight years of very low or even negative interest rates and massive doses of quantitative easing\naround the world, it’s not clear that we can, or should, go back to the old ways of doing things.\nAt this point I need to emphasize that the views I express here today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe economic outlook viewed through the lens of the dual mandate\nAs is well known, the Fed’s dual mandate is maximum employment and price stability.\nAs a Fed policymaker, I see virtually everything through the lens of these two objectives: What\ndoes it mean for jobs, for inflation?\nI’ll start with maximum employment. Our goal is not to have an unemployment rate of\nzero. Instead, it’s to be near the “natural rate” of unemployment: That’s the rate we can expect in\na healthy economy. It’s impossible to know exactly what that number is, but economists\n1\n\ngenerally put it between 4¾ and 5 percent today.1 With the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent,\nwe’re right on target. Of course, the unemployment rate isn’t the only measure of labor market\nhealth, and it’s reassuring that a range of indicators have been improving and are sending similar\nsignals. In particular, one measure of the labor market that I look to is what regular people—by\nthat, I mean not just economists—say when they are asked how hard it is to find a job. Those\nresponses are right in line with the signal we’re getting from the unemployment rate.2\nThat’s the good news about where we are, and I expect things will get even better. So far\nthis year, we’re on pace to add nearly 2¼ million jobs, which is over twice the number that we\nneed to keep up with the trend increase in the size of the labor force. Labor force growth depends\non things like the number of people retiring this year or graduating from school and entering the\nworkforce. I put the trend at somewhere around 1 million jobs per year.3 With job gains far\noutpacing labor force growth, I expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down over the\nnext year, bottoming out near 4.5 percent—a very strong labor market by any standard.\nTurning to the other side of the ledger, the Fed’s monetary policy committee—the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short—has set a long-run goal of 2 percent\ninflation.4 Inflation has been running persistently below that goal for several years. Over the past\ncouple of years, the strengthening of the dollar and declines in energy prices have pushed\ninflation down, but these influences should fade over time. To cut through some of the noise, it’s\nuseful to look at measures of inflation that strip out volatile prices and provide a clearer view of\n1 In the June 2016 Summary of Economic Projections, the central tendency of estimates of the long-run level of the\nunemployment rate ranged between 4.7 and 5 percent (Board of Governors 2016a). The Congressional Budget\nOffice estimates the natural rate to be 4¾ percent as of August (CBO 2016). The median estimate from the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters in August 2016 was 4.8 percent (https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/2016/survq316). The Blue Chip Economic Indicators\nestimate is 4.9 percent as of March 2016.\n2 Data are from the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey (https://www.conference-\nboard.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm). See Weidner and Williams (2011).\n3 Estimates range from 600,000 to 1.2 million. See, for example, Aaronson, Brave, and Kelley (2016).\n4 Board of Governors (2016b).\n2\n\nthe underlying trend. These suggest that underlying inflation is in the 1½ to 1¾ percent range.\nWe’re not quite at our target yet, but the combination of fading transitory factors and a strong\neconomy should help us get back to our 2 percent goal in the next year or two.\nTo sum up, I remain confident about the road we are on. Consumer spending is strong,\nthe labor market is running apace, and household balance sheets are improving. All in all, I see a\nsolid domestic economy with good momentum going forward.\nWhat it means for interest rates\nSo, what does this mean for interest rates? In the context of a strong economy with good\nmomentum, it makes sense to get back to a pace of gradual rate increases, preferably sooner\nrather than later. Let me be clear: In arguing for an increase in interest rates, I’m not trying to\nstall the economic expansion. It’s just the opposite: My aim is to keep it on a sound footing so it\ncan be sustained for a long time.5\nHistory teaches us that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate\nimbalances, potentially leading to excessive inflation, asset market bubbles, and ultimately\neconomic correction and recession. A gradual process of raising rates reduces the risks of such\nan outcome. It also allows a smoother, more calibrated process of normalization that gives us\nspace to adjust our responses to any surprise changes in economic conditions. If we wait too long\nto remove monetary accommodation, we hazard allowing imbalances to grow, requiring us to\nplay catch-up, and not leaving much room to maneuver. Not to mention, a sudden reversal of\npolicy could be disruptive and slow the economy in unintended ways.\nWhat is normal monetary policy?\nAlthough the U.S. economy has managed to recover from the global financial crisis and\nsubsequent events, it has been a painfully long and hard struggle, necessitating extraordinary\n5 See Williams (2016a) for further discussion.\n3\n\nmonetary policy actions. Many other countries have not been as fortunate and are still in the\nmidst of prolonged economic challenges, calling forth even more aggressive policies, including\nnegative interest rates and expanded quantitative easing programs.\nEven after the present problems are overcome, new realities pose significant challenges\nfor the conduct of monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere. Foremost is the\nsignificant decline in the natural rate of interest, or r* (r-star), over the past quarter-century to\nhistorically low levels. The natural interest rate is the short-term real (inflation-adjusted) interest\nrate that balances monetary policy so that it is neither accommodative nor contractionary in\nterms of growth and inflation. While a central bank sets its short-term interest rate, r-star is a\nfunction of factors beyond its influence.\nThe daunting challenge for central banks is how to deliver stable inflation in a low r-star\nworld. This conundrum shares some characteristics and common roots with the theory of secular\nstagnation; in both scenarios, interest rates, growth, and inflation are persistently low.6\nHow low can rates stay?\nA variety of economic factors have pushed natural interest rates very low and they appear\npoised to stay that way.7 This is the case not just for the United States but for other economies as\nwell. In a recent paper, Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and I estimated the inflation-adjusted\nnatural rate for four major economies: the United States, Canada, the euro area, and the United\nKingdom.8 In 1990, estimates ranged from about 2½ to 3½ percent. By 2007, on the eve of the\nglobal financial crisis, these had all declined to between 2 and 2½ percent. By 2015, all four\n6 Summers (2015).\n7 See Williams (2015), Hamilton et al. (2015), Kiley (2015), Lubik and Matthes (2015), and Laubach and Williams\n(2016).\n8 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016). Estimates are available at: http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/economists/jwilliams/Holston_Laubach_Williams_estimates.xlsx\n4\n\nestimates had dropped sharply, to 1½ percent for Canada and the United Kingdom, nearly zero\nfor the United States, and below zero for the euro area.\nThe underlying determinants for these declines are related to the global supply and\ndemand for funds, including shifting demographics, slower trend productivity and economic\ngrowth, emerging markets seeking large reserves of safe assets, and a more general global\nsavings glut.9 The key takeaway from these global trends is that interest rates are going to stay\nlower than we’ve come to expect in the past. This does not mean they will be zero, but when\njuxtaposed with pre-recession normal short-term interest rates of, say, 4 to 4½ percent, it may be\njarring to see the underlying r-star guiding us towards a new normal of 3 to 3½ percent—or even\nlower. Importantly, this future of low interest rates is not due to easy monetary policy; instead, it\nis the rate expected to prevail when the economy is at full strength and the stance of monetary\npolicy is neutral.\nThe critical implication of a lower natural rate of interest is that conventional monetary\npolicy has less room to stimulate the economy during an economic downturn, owing to a lower\nbound on how low interest rates can go. This will necessitate a greater reliance on\nunconventional tools like central bank balance sheets, forward guidance, and potentially even\nnegative policy rates.10 In this new normal, recessions will tend to be longer and deeper,\nrecoveries slower, and the risks of unacceptably low inflation and the ultimate loss of the\nnominal anchor will be higher.11 We have already gotten a first taste of the effects of a low r-star,\n9 Council of Economic Advisers (2015), International Monetary Fund (2014), Rachel and Smith (2015), and\nCaballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2016).\n10 Some commentators advocate trying to eliminate or significantly reduce the lower bound on interest rates by\neliminating paper currency or effectively making currency bear a negative interest rate at times. See Marvin\nGoodfriend (2016) and references therein. In my remarks, I assume that paper currency and other considerations\ncontinue to put a lower limit on interest rates.\n11 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and Chung et al. (2012) for discussions of the effects of the lower bound.\nReifschneider (2016) provides an assessment of the ability of unconventional monetary policies to mitigate the\neffects of the lower bound in the future. Cœuré (2016) discusses these issues in the European context.\n5\n\nwith uncomfortably low inflation and growth despite very low interest rates. Unfortunately, if the\nstatus quo endures, the future is likely to hold more of the same—with the possibility of even\nmore severe challenges to maintaining price stability and full employment.\nLow r-star and strategies for mitigation\nThere are actions that central banks and governments can undertake to avoid this fate.\nThese include fiscal and other policies aimed at raising the natural interest rate, as well as\nalternative monetary, fiscal, and other policies that are more likely to succeed in maintaining a\nstrong economy and stable inflation in the face of a low natural rate. In these remarks, I will\nfocus on options related to monetary policy.12\nSome historical context is in order. The inflation wars of the 1970s and 1980s led to a\nbroad consensus regarding monetary policy among academics and policymakers that central\nbanks are responsible and accountable for price stability. This was often acknowledged through\nthe formal adoption of an inflation targeting framework with an explicit numerical inflation\ngoal.13 Over the past 25 years, over two dozen central banks around the world have adopted a\nvariant of inflation targeting. Although inflation targeting central banks that aimed for a low\ninflation rate generally have been successful at stabilizing inflation in the past, such an approach\nis not as well-suited for a low r-star era. There simply may not be enough room for central banks\nto cut interest rates in response to an economic downturn when both natural rates and inflation\nare very low.\nGiven this reality, central banks and governments should critically reevaluate their\nmonetary policy frameworks to identify potential improvements in the context of a low r-star.\n12 See Williams (2016b) for further discussion of the roles of fiscal and other policies to affect the level of r-star and\nits effects on the economy.\n13 See Williams (2014) and references therein.\n6\n\nAlthough there are many potential alternative approaches to consider, I will focus here on two,\nwhich can be considered together or in isolation to address this issue.\nThe most direct attack on low r-star would be for central banks to pursue a somewhat\nhigher inflation target. This would imply a higher average level of interest rates and thereby give\nmonetary policy more room to maneuver.14 The logic of this approach argues that a 1 percentage\npoint increase in the inflation target would offset the deleterious effects of an equal-sized decline\nin r-star. Note that raising the inflation target by 1 or even 2 percentage points would not imply a\nreturn to the high rates of inflation of the 1970s. Instead, it would be a return to inflation rates\nthat prevailed in the early 1980s through the early 1990s, when inflation tended to run between 3\nand 4 percent in the United States. Of course, consideration of this approach would need to\nbalance these benefits against the costs and challenges of achieving and maintaining a somewhat\nhigher inflation rate.\nA second alternative would be to replace the inflation target with a flexible price-level or\nnominal GDP target, where the central bank targets a steadily growing level of prices or nominal\nGDP, rather than the rate of inflation. These approaches have a number of potential advantages\nover standard inflation targeting. For one, they may be better suited to periods when the lower\nbound constrains interest rates because they automatically deliver the “lower for longer” policy\nprescription the situation calls for.15 Because they provide a clear metric by which to judge\nwhether the economy is above or below the stipulated goal, they may help improve the\nsystematic conduct of policy and its communication and public understanding, especially when\ninterest rates are constrained by the lower bound.\n14 Williams (2009), Blanchard, Dell’Arricia, and Mauro (2010), Ball (2014).\n15 Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n7\n\nIn addition, these alternative approaches are better designed for a world where r-star\nchanges over time. For example, in a nominal GDP targeting regime, a decline in r-star caused\nby slower trend real GDP growth is offset by higher average inflation, mitigating the effect on\nthe interest rate buffer available to respond to economic downturns. More generally, these\napproaches appear to be more robust to unpredictable and hard-to-measure movements in r-\nstar.16\nFinally, price and nominal GDP targeting have a built-in protection against debt\ndeflation.17 These approaches aim to return prices or nominal GDP to a predictable, steadily\ngrowing path, meaning that borrowers have more assurance about the value of the dollars they\npay back. Of course, like a higher inflation target, these approaches also have potential\ndisadvantages that must be carefully scrutinized when considering their relative costs and\nbenefits.\nConclusion\nAlthough it has been a long, hard road back from the recession, the American economy is\nfinally back in good shape and headed in the right direction. We’re at full employment, and\ninflation is well within sight of and on track to reach our target. Given the progress we have\nmade and signs of continued solid momentum in the economy, and consistent with our agreed-\nupon monetary policy approach, it makes sense for the Fed to gradually move interest rates\ntoward more normal levels.\nLooking toward the future, I have stressed the need to study and consider new approaches\nto monetary policy better suited for a low r-star world. Any shift in monetary policy strategy\nrequires extensive analysis, consideration, and debate. But, time is not on our side. We have\n16 See Orphanides and Williams (2002).\n17 Koenig (2013), Sheedy (2014).\n8\n\nwitnessed the extreme difficulties of achieving price stability and full employment with a low r-\nstar. I firmly believe that now is the time for experts and policymakers around the world to\nactively study and assess the pros and cons of alternative proposals, so that we are better\nprepared for the challenges related to persistently low natural real rates of interest.\nFinally, thoroughly reviewing the key aspects of inflation targeting is certainly necessary,\nand could go a long way towards mitigating the obstructions posed by low r-star. But that is\nwhere monetary policy meets the boundaries of its influence. We’ve come to the point on the\npath where central banks must share responsibilities. There are limits to what monetary policy\ncan and, indeed, should do. The burden must also fall on fiscal and other policies to do their part\nto help create conditions conducive to economic stability. Thank you.\n9\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Scott A.

    "text": "Presentation to Town Hall Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 18, 2016\nThe Right Profile: Economic Drivers and the Outlook\nGood afternoon, it’s a pleasure to be here. I gave my first public speech as President of\nthe San Francisco Fed at Town Hall Los Angeles nearly five years ago. I always enjoy coming\nback. In fact, my last Town Hall event was memorable—the room lost power and I gave my\nspeech in the dark, except for the glow sticks an enterprising staff member ran to the drugstore to\nget. I still have mine as a memento of that day.\nI’ll start out by stating something you all know. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate:\nmaximum employment and price stability. We want everyone who wants a job to be able to find\none and for inflation to average 2 percent per year.\nI mention this because there are aspects of the current discussion—and worry—about the\neconomy and monetary policy that should be seen in context. The narrative of the punditry can\nsound alarming, and can give a false impression of what motivates monetary policymakers.\nSince I’m about to talk about motivations, it’s probably a good time to inject the standard\ndisclaimer that the views expressed today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nWith that out of the way, today I’d like to talk about where we are on each of those goals,\nwhere I see the economy headed, and put some of those concerns in context. Call it MythBusters:\nMonetary Policy Edition.\nEmployment: Career opportunities\nI first want to address employment, where things are looking good. “Groovy times” as\nthey said back in the day. We use a variety of measures to gauge the health of the labor market,\n1\n\nbut the most widely discussed, and most frequently used, is the unemployment rate.\nUnemployment will never be zero, because in any well-functioning economy, people leave jobs\nand new people enter the workforce. Economists use the term “natural rate of unemployment” to\ndescribe the optimal rate for an economy at full health. It’s hard to know exactly what the\nnumber is, but I put the natural rate at about 5 percent.\nWe dipped just below that, to 4.9 percent, in January. I expect the unemployment rate to\ncontinue to come down a bit further, reaching the mid-4s later this year. This is a reflection of\nsteady improvement in a labor market that has fully recovered from the recession and its\naftermath, when we saw a peak of 10 percent.\nThere are other indicators—workers who are part-time for economic reasons or the labor\nforce participation rate, for example—that have been the focus of continued concern. But\ndigging into the data, we’ve actually come quite far on both of those. In fact, while part-time\nemployment for economic reasons looks like it’s still somewhat elevated relative to historical\nnorms, the labor force participation rate now appears to be consistent with its longer-term trend.1\nA further sign of the health of the labor market is that more people are quitting their\njobs—indicating they feel confident that they’ll find another—and they’re probably right: Job\nvacancies are at the highest levels since they started collecting the data in 2000. We added more\nthan 2½ million jobs in 2015. All in all, we have reached or are close to maximum employment\nacross a broad range of markers.\nInflation: Pressure drop?\nOn the inflation side, we’re not quite where I’d like us to be, but we’re on course to reach\nour goal.\n1 Aaronson et al. (2014).\n2\n\nThe Fed sets a target of 2 percent average inflation. You’ll generally hear policy wonks\nand commentators talk about the Fed’s “2 percent inflation target”—I do it frequently myself.\nBut I want to emphasize that I just included the word “average.” Sometimes we get so caught up\nin economic shorthand that we forget not everyone is speaking the same language. I don’t want\nto leave the impression that inflation should be exactly 2 percent all the time or that small\nmovements in either direction should lead to alarm. Sometimes we’ll be a little lower, sometimes\na little higher; this isn’t about complete control. What I want—on average, in the medium term—\nis for inflation to be about 2 percent. Worry should only set in if it’s persistently above or below\nthat number.\nI’d also like to stress the “above or below” part. Many people think that Fed\npolicymakers’ concern lies disproportionately with inflation that’s too high. They think we view\ninflation lower than 2 percent as sort of “not great,” but see inflation above 2 percent as\ncatastrophic. That’s not the case. In my view, inflation somewhat above 2 percent is just as bad\nas the same amount below. And here’s the one place I actually am speaking for others in the\nFederal Reserve System—the most recent FOMC statement explicitly addressed this issue. 2\nWith that proviso firmly in place, I will note that inflation currently is too low. Over the\n12 months of last year, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption\nexpenditures price index, stands at around half a percentage point while core inflation, which\nstrips out volatile components like food and energy, is about 1½ percent. Now, Fed policymakers\nare often accused of not eating or driving, because we focus more on measures like the latter. It’s\nnot that we don’t understand that gas and groceries are important parts of people’s household\nbudgets. It’s just that for policy, we need to look at the underlying trends, and if we got lost in\nthe supermarket or oil fields, we’d miss what the data are telling us about the medium term.\n2 Board of Governors (2016).\n3\n\nIn any event, I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent over the next two years.\nCurrent U.S. inflation pressures are playing tug-of-war. On one side, falling prices for\nenergy and most goods are pulling us down, reflecting the strong U.S. dollar and other\ninternational developments. On the other, rising prices for domestic services are mostly trying to\nyank us to the 2 percent line. When you look at the parts of the U.S. economy that are not traded\nglobally, like housing, we’re seeing prices increase in a way that reflects a stronger, tightening\neconomy. While it might not be music to renters’ ears, the steep increase in rental prices is a\nreflection of the nation’s economic strength. In services more generally, we’re seeing inflation\nrunning close to our target.3 There are also increasing signs that wage growth is picking up—\nwhich, again, may not sound great to employers, but is actually something we’ve been waiting\nfor. It’s a sign of the economy really powering back, and it will help boost household incomes\nand prompt even more growth in consumption spending. By at least one commonly cited\nmeasure, wage growth has picked up from 2 to 2½ percent in recent months.\nIt’s also worth noting that wages in the aftermath of the recession may be acting out of\ncharacter. During the recession, wage growth didn’t slow as much as might have been expected.\nThen, during the recovery, wage growth stagnated, even as the labor market made solid gains.\nRecent research by my staff suggests that this puzzle may be in part because of who was entering\nand leaving the workforce.4 During the recession and early in the recovery, wages stayed higher\nthan expected because most of the people who lost their jobs were the ones making less. More\nrecently, as the labor market has strengthened, the pattern has reversed. Many workers who were\neither on the sidelines or working part-time started finding full-time jobs. Because they’re new,\nthe vast majority of these workers earn less than other employees, which pushes down the overall\n3 Glick (2015).\n4 Daly and Hobijn (2016).\n4\n\naverage. Once you adjust for this factor, upward wage pressures are even stronger than the\nheadline numbers suggest.\nSo if we look at the domestic market in isolation, it shows strong growth. We’re just\ncontending with outside forces. As the price of oil dropped by some 70 percent and the value of\nthe dollar increased by over 20 percent, it naturally influenced near-term inflation. But the effects\nshould peter out. One reason economists can comfortably say that these factors are transitory, or\nat least stabilizing, is that it’s incredibly unlikely that oil will fall another 70 percent. There is a\nbasement on how low energy prices can go. That’s why I’m confident that we’re on track to\nreach our inflation goal.\nMixed signals and the equalizer\nAnother area of mixed signals is that certain sectors are slowing down at the same time\nthe overall economy keeps chugging ahead. Sectors that are directly affected by the strong dollar,\nweak foreign demand, and falling energy and commodity prices have underperformed recently.\nBut the hardest-hit sectors—manufacturing, drilling and mining, and agriculture—account for a\nrelatively small share of employment and GDP. By contrast, the large domestic services sector—\nincluding restaurants, health care, and business services—is doing quite well, and makes up the\nhuge majority of American jobs. In last year’s impressive jobs growth, 93 percent were in\nservices, including government.\nRisks and concerns—lightning strikes?\nStill, as endless column inches have been dedicated to chronicling, and as the Fed itself\nmentioned in the last FOMC statement, there are areas of economic concern. In particular,\neconomic developments abroad and market volatility have taken center stage in discussions of\nthe U.S. economic outlook.\n5\n\nOf course, I am aware of, and closely monitoring, potential risks. But I want to be clear\nwhat that means. It’s often said that the economy isn’t the stock market and the stock market\nisn’t the economy. That’s very true. Short-term fluctuations or even daily dives aren’t accurate\nreflections of the state of the vast, intricate, multilayered U.S. economy. And they shouldn’t be\nviewed as the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Remember, the expansion of the 1980s wasn’t\nderailed by the crash of ’87, and we sailed through the Asian financial crisis a decade later. I say\n“remember”—some of you here will actually remember and others will remember it from your\nhigh school history class.\nFrom a policymaker’s perspective, my concern isn’t as simple as whether markets are up\nor down. Watching a stock ticker isn’t the way to gauge America’s economic health. As Paul\nSamuelson famously said, the stock market has predicted nine out of the past five recessions.\nWhat’s important is how it impacts jobs and inflation in the U.S.\nAt the risk of puncturing some of the more colorful theories about what drives the Fed, I\nlay before you the cold, hard truth: Fed policymakers are even more boring than you think.\nBecause all we see is our mandate. How does this affect American jobs and growth? What does\nthis mean for households’ buying power?\nThe same holds true for international developments. Of course we are closely watching\nsituations abroad. But not because we should act in response to, say, financial volatility in China.\nWe monitor developments in China, Brazil, South Africa, and more because we’re on alert for\nhow spillovers could affect our goals at home. We live in a global economy, not an inoculated\ncity. What happens in China or Brazil isn’t contained by national borders; the rest of the world\nnecessarily feels the effects and they easily breach the gates of the West. But others’ economic\nfates do not spell our own. Yes, global markets affect U.S. growth; but we are also powered by\n6\n\ndomestic demand and have the ability to make our own monetary policy. With the policy tools at\nour disposal, we can continue to achieve our employment and inflation goals. Ultimately,\nmonetary policy has been supporting the expansion of the U.S. economy, allowing it to become\nstronger and stronger, and the domestic demand we’re seeing reflects its underlying might.\nDespite recent financial volatility, my overall outlook for the U.S. and the global\neconomy remains unchanged. There is plenty of concern about China’s slower pace, but as I said\nlast year, this largely reflects a pivot from a manufacturing-based economy to one driven by\ndomestic consumption and services—the exact engines that are currently powering U.S. growth.5\nMonetary policy: Data dependent\nSo what does all this say about monetary policy? A lot of people make jokes about\neconomists having the only job in the world where you can constantly change your answer and\nnot get fired—my mother, by the way, is one of them. But what we actually do is adjust our\nforecasts as we get more data. A few years ago, for instance, I viewed the natural rate of\nunemployment as about 5½ percent. As more data came in and as we learned more about the\nshape of the recovery, I reassessed. This is just to put into context that when I look at my\nDecember forecast and compare it with my outlook for unemployment and core inflation today,\nthere’s virtually no change. The shifts in my forecast amount to just one-tenth of a percentage\npoint.\nI therefore continue to see a gradual pace of policy normalization as being the best\ncourse. My preferred route is a gradual path of increases. This reflects the fact that the economy\nstill needs a gentle shove forward from monetary policy, as we continue to navigate the\nheadwinds from weakness abroad and their effects on the dollar and commodity prices.\n5 Williams (2015).\n7\n\nI want to emphasize, of course, that I don’t have this on remote control; the path of policy\nremains data dependent. Anyone who knows me knows that data-dependency is the irresistible\nforce of my policymaking decisions—I literally made T-shirts about it. As I get more data and\nother information, I’ll adjust my views of the outlook for employment, inflation, and the\nappropriate path for monetary policy accordingly.\nConclusion\nDespite the Sturm und Drang of international and market developments, the U.S.\neconomy is, all in all, looking pretty good. I still expect to see U.S. GDP growth of about 2¼\npercent for 2016. I still expect unemployment to edge down to about 4½ percent by late in the\nyear. And I still see inflation edging up to our 2 percent goal within the next two years. So I’m\nnot down—it all looks good to me.\n8\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William\nWascher. 2014. “Labor Force Participation: Recent Developments and Future Prospects.” Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197–255.\nhttp://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/fall-2014/fall2014bpea_aaronson_et_al.pdf\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2016. “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and\nMonetary Policy Strategy.” Amended January 26.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals_20160126.pdf\nDaly, Mary, and Bart Hobijn. 2016. “The Intensive and Extensive Margins of Real Wage Adjustment.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper 2016-04. http://www.frbsf.org/economic-\nresearch/files/wp2016-04.pdf\nGlick, Reuven. “FedViews.” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, October 8.\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/fedviews/2015/october/october-08-2015/\nWilliams, John C. 2015. “China, Rates, and the Outlook: May the (Economic) Force Be with You.”\nPresentation to the Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century: An agenda for\nChina and the United States, September 19. http://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-\nspeeches/williams-speeches/2015/september/china-rates-outlook-building-the-financial-system/\n9",

    "text": "Presentation to the 2012 Santa Barbara County Economic Summit\nSanta Barbara, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 3, 2012\nThe Slow Recovery: Causes and Monetary Policy Implications\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to participate in the 2012 Santa Barbara County Economic\nSummit. It’s especially nice for my Fed colleagues from other parts of the country to experience\nfirsthand the beautiful scenery and wonderful weather that we Californians get to enjoy every\nday. In my presentation today, I’m going to sketch out the key factors shaping the economic\nrecovery. I’ll then comment on the implications of these events for monetary policy. Before I\nget running, I should note that my remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nOur economy is still feeling the aftereffects of the worst financial crisis and economic\ndownturn since the Great Depression. Economists have pointed out that recoveries from\nfinancial crises are typically very slow and drawn out.1 This one has been no exception. We are\nnow nearly three years into the recovery phase, as measured by the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch. The economy is steadily improving and the outlook is for continued moderate growth.\nNonetheless, we have nearly four-and-a-half million fewer jobs today than five years ago and the\nunemployment rate remains very high at 8.2 percent.\nA number of forces are holding back the economy. The foremost is the massive fallout\nfrom the housing crash.2 The scale of the housing meltdown is breathtaking. From their peak in\n1 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2011). See Williams (2012a,b) for fuller\ndiscussions of recent economic developments.\n2 Feroli et al. (2012).\n1\n\n2006, house prices have fallen by about a third nationally. The destruction of net worth from\nhousing equaled more than 40 percent of the value of annual U.S. production. About a quarter of\nborrowers found themselves under water, owing more than their homes were worth. Millions of\nfamilies have lost their homes to foreclosure. And millions more are currently in foreclosure or\nare severely delinquent on their mortgages.\nWhen a debt-fueled bubble bursts, the economic effects are severe. During the boom,\nhigher house prices helped fuel consumption as people tapped home equity to buy cars, boats,\nvacations, and the like. When house prices did a U-turn, households—deep in debt and feeling\nmuch poorer—hunkered down. They cut spending and salted away more savings to rebuild lost\nwealth. And that wasn’t the housing bust’s only depressing effect. By early 2009, home\nconstruction had plunged by over 75 percent from its 2006 high. It’s edged up somewhat since\nthen, but remains at very depressed levels. That’s kept millions of carpenters, plumbers, and\nothers in construction and real estate out of work.\nIn addition to the collapse of housing, other powerful forces have kept us stuck in a slow\ngrowth pattern. I’ll highlight three: tight credit, government contraction, and uncertainty.\nTight credit was clearly a by-product of the housing bust. But it took on a life of its own\nwhen the fallout from the mortgage meltdown nearly brought down the global financial system\nin 2008. The repercussions of those dramatic events remain with us today. Many banks are still\nfeeling the effects of the huge housing-related losses they experienced. As a result, credit has\nbeen harder to come by for many. For example, to get a mortgage, a borrower must have a top-\nnotch credit rating and the cash to make a substantial down payment.\n2\n\nGovernment cutbacks are a second obstacle to growth. Typically, state and local\ngovernment spending increases during an economic recovery. This time around, the housing\nbust has cut into the revenue of state and local governments, forcing them to slash spending.3 I\ndon’t see government spending turning around soon. Indeed, spending at the federal level is set\nto contract sharply at the end of this year as several temporary programs expire, and taxes are set\nto rise sharply. Some of those programs may be extended. But, overall, we can expect federal\nspending trends to weigh on near-term economic growth.\nUncertainty is a third factor holding back the recovery. Businesses, investors, and\nhouseholds remain skittish, even in the face of better economic news. Many of my business\ncontacts say they remain cautious about expanding because they’re unsure about future\nconditions. Ordinary Americans worry about job prospects and future income. The political\nenvironment remains highly charged. Among other things, that makes it harder to predict how\nabrupt future tax and spending changes will be. The financial turmoil in Europe has added\nanother dimension to the unease here.\nThese forces explain why we have not seen a V-shaped recovery typical of past post-\nWorld War II deep recessions. Instead, the pattern is more reminiscent of recoveries from\nprevious financial crises. The stubbornly slow recovery and high unemployment also explain\nwhy the Federal Reserve has instituted such aggressive and sustained monetary stimulus aimed\nat boosting economic growth and bringing down unemployment.\nCongress assigned the Fed two goals in conducting monetary policy: maximum\nemployment and price stability. Over the past few decades, we’ve done pretty well on our price\n3 Feroli et al. (2012).\n3\n\nstability objective. Indeed, despite the turmoil of the past five years, inflation has averaged\nalmost exactly the 2 percent rate that the Federal Open Market Committee designated as our\nmedium-run target. However, we are still very far from our maximum employment mandate.\nDespite recent progress in the labor market, the unemployment rate remains far too high.\nThe events of the past several years have caused some to ask whether the forces holding\nback growth are primarily structural in nature, rather than cyclical. In a nutshell, they argue that\nthe lackluster growth reflects fundamental forces in the supply side of the economy, not a\nshortfall in demand. If this conjecture is right, then monetary policy should not be used so\naggressively to try to boost demand. Instead, it needs to be recalibrated to reflect the reality of\nthis supposed “new normal” for the economy.\nThis debate is often couched in terms of the unemployment rate. Broadly speaking,\neconomists fall into two camps. One group argues that changes in the structure of the economy\nare pushing up the unemployment rate. The other group maintains that high unemployment is\nthe result of a severe downturn, which significantly cut demand for goods and services, rather\nthan a shortage of supply.\nThose who favor a structural explanation argue that many jobseekers lack the skills\nemployers need. For example, computer industry employers are having a hard time finding\nqualified workers. But they’re not likely to find such employees in the ranks of jobless\nconstruction workers. If such labor market mismatches are widespread, they could be boosting\nthe unemployment rate.\nTo explore this further, I’m going to introduce the concept of the natural rate of\nunemployment. The natural rate is basically an equilibrium jobless rate that pushes inflation\n4\n\nneither up, nor down. Before the recession, most economists thought this rate was around 5\npercent or a bit less. Today though, economists in the structural camp argue that the natural rate\nhas risen substantially, largely because of the labor market mismatches I described. The idea is\nthat a lot of people are unemployed not because jobs are lacking, but because those jobs require\nskills unemployed workers don’t have. If this were correct, then our 8.2 percent unemployment\nrate might not be that far above the natural unemployment rate. In other words, we might not\nreally be so far from the Fed’s goal of maximum sustainable employment.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to know exactly what the natural rate of unemployment is.\nIt’s not a number you can look up in a statistical table. In fact, the natural rate is the subject of\nintensive economic research and debate. Economists estimate it using a variety of economic and\nstatistical models, and no two estimates agree. In addition, because it fluctuates over time due to\nchanges in labor force demographics and other factors, economists must regularly refine these\nestimates as new data come in. In the final analysis, which camp is right is an empirical\nquestion.\nA key finding of this research is that mismatch and other factors may have indeed\nboosted the natural rate of unemployment a bit. But this explains only a small portion of the rise\nin the unemployment rate during the recession and recovery. In particular, research by my\ncolleagues across the Federal Reserve System suggests that job mismatches are relatively limited\nin scope.4 The difficulty some Silicon Valley companies find hiring software engineers is not\nenough to fundamentally transform the labor market. Other factors besides skill mismatches\nmay have helped push up the natural unemployment rate. One temporary factor may be the\n4 See Barnichon and Figura (2010, 2011), Valletta and Kuang (2010b), Barlevy (2011), and Neumark and Valletta\n(2012) for further discussion and analysis on the quantitative role of mismatch in increasing unemployment during\nthe past few years.\n5\n\nextension of unemployment insurance payments from the usual 26 weeks to as long as 99\nweeks.5\nBased on this research, I conclude that mismatches and other labor market inefficiencies\nhave raised the natural unemployment rate from about 5 percent before the recession to between\n6 to 6½ percent today.6 Most of these factors should recede over the next few years. The effects\nof the temporary extension of unemployment insurance benefits will fade. And mismatches\nshould diminish as workers retrain, and construction and other hard-hit industries recover. Once\nthese adjustments have occurred, I expect the natural rate of unemployment to settle at 5½\npercent.\nThe important point is that today’s unemployment rate is about 2 percentage points above\nmy estimate of the natural rate. That is, the elevated rate of unemployment is primarily due to a\nshortage of demand, not to structural changes in the labor market. The factors I mentioned\nearlier—tight credit, government contraction, and uncertainty—all work to reduce desired\nspending by households, businesses, and government below the level consistent with full\nemployment. My forecast is that the economy will continue on a path of moderate growth over\nthe next few years. As a result, the unemployment rate will gradually decline, reaching about 7\npercent at the end of 2014. Given this forecast, the unemployment rate will remain above the\nnatural rate for several more years.\nTo reiterate, the nation remains far from the Fed’s assigned goal of maximum sustainable\nemployment. Under these circumstances, and with inflation close to our 2 percent target and\n5 See Valletta and Kuang (2010a).\n6 For other estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, see Weidner and Williams (2011), Daly et al. (2011), and\nthe Congressional Budget Office (2012).\n6\n\nwell under control, it’s essential that we keep strong monetary stimulus in place for quite some\ntime.

    "text": "Presentation to the Chicago Booth Graduate School of Business Alumni Club of San Francisco\nSan Francisco, California\nBy John C. Williams\nExecutive Vice President and Director of Research\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 22, 2011\nWill the Financial Crisis Have a Lasting Effect on Unemployment?1\nThank you very much for this opportunity to speak to the Booth School San Francisco\nalumni club and the CFA Society. To those of you who attended the University of Chicago, I\nwant to note two proofs of your brilliance. First, you went to one of the very best schools in the\nUnited States for studying business and economics. And, second, in light of the images we’ve\nseen of snowbound cars on Lake Shore Drive, you had the good judgment to move to my home\nstate of California, where we trade off the occasional earthquake for balmy winters.\nThis evening I’m going to offer my thoughts about the economy and talk about Federal\nReserve policy during this period of recovery. I will also address several topics that have made it\nparticularly challenging for monetary policy at this juncture. These include the question of\nwhether the current very high level of unemployment is primarily cyclical or structural. That is,\ndoes the current 9 percent unemployment rate mostly reflect weak demand in the economy or,\nalternatively, strong labor-market frictions that make it harder than usual to match jobs and\nworkers. The answer to that question is vital in determining the noninflationary level of\nunemployment. I should stress that these remarks represent my own views and not necessarily\nthose of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nLet me start by noting that the economic news has been quite encouraging. The nation’s\noutput of goods and services is now growing at a respectable pace, which is a great relief given\n1 I would like to thank Mary Daly, Rob Valletta, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nthat we are less than two years away from the worst financial crisis and recession of the post-\nWorld War II era. Inflation-adjusted real gross domestic product grew at a 3.2 percent annual\nrate in the final quarter of 2010, up from a 2.6 percent pace in the preceding period. Our forecast\nat the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank is that the expansion will continue to gain steam, with\nreal GDP growing about 4 percent this year and 4½ percent in 2012. We appear to be in a period\nof sustained recovery in contrast with the on-again, off-again expansion we experienced for more\nthan a year after the recession ended in the summer of 2009. What’s more, the expansion is now\nbeing led primarily by solid growth of private-sector demand rather than government stimulus.\nHousehold spending is on the rise, reflecting growing consumer confidence,\nimprovements in credit availability, and the rebound in wealth brought by a resurgent stock\nmarket. Real personal consumption expenditures rose at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the fourth\nquarter of 2010, the fastest growth in five years. The upward trend is visible in sales of autos and\nlight trucks, which were up 17 percent in January from a year before. Consumer spending\nrepresents about 70 percent of GDP, so the return of shoppers to the malls and showrooms is\ncritical to the recovery of the broader economy.\nIn addition, businesses have stepped up their outlays for equipment and software.\nInflation-adjusted spending in this category rose more than 16 percent last year. The rise in\nconsumer and business spending has given a big boost to the manufacturing sector, where output\nrebounded in January by nearly 13 percent from its low in June 2009. Still, despite these large\ngains, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate was 74 percent in January, well below its\nlonger-run trend value of around 80 percent. That’s testimony to the depth of the hole that this\nsector fell into at the low point of the recession and how far we have yet to go to fill that hole.\n2\n\nHowever, some sectors are not rebounding at all. Construction remains dormant, with\nneither residential nor nonresidential building showing any signs of life. Single-family housing\nstarts are running at just above a 400,000 annual rate, one-third the pace that prevailed before the\nhousing boom of the 2000s. Vacancies of all kinds of structures—homes, retail, offices, and\nindustrial—remain elevated. Given the massive overbuilding in these sectors during the boom\nyears and the financial problems still plaguing real estate, I expect it will be many years before\nwe see a full recovery in construction. Meanwhile, we are unlikely to get much of a boost to\ngrowth for the next few years from government spending. The impetus to economic activity from\nfederal fiscal stimulus will wane over the next few years. And state and local governments are\ncutting back spending and raising taxes, which restrains the economic recovery.\nGiven how far we fell, it will take several years before the economy returns to full health.\nNowhere is that more evident than in the labor market. A staggering 8.7 million payroll jobs\nwere lost during the recession and early stages of the recovery. So far, we’ve managed to gain\nback only about 1 million jobs. The 9 percent January unemployment rate was down just over a\npercentage point from its recent peak. We project that from here it will creep down in a\ndisappointingly slow fashion to about 7½ percent toward the end of 2012. We don’t expect a\nreturn to full employment until around 2014.\nThis brings me to the question of inflation. It seems that every day there is a new story\nabout rising prices, whether for copper, corn, or oil. There’s no question that it costs a lot more to\nfill the gas tank than it did a year ago. According to the U.S. Labor Department, gas prices rose\nover 13 percent in the 12 months ending in January of this year. Many other commodity prices\nhave soared. That sort of thing may prompt you to raise your eyebrows when Fed officials like\nme say we don’t see an inflationary surge on the horizon. It’s not that we’re unaware of the rise\n3\n\nin commodity prices. We eat and buy gas just like everyone else. We know very well that those\nhigher prices reduce the discretionary spending of households, especially those with limited\nincomes, and can slow overall economic growth. Still, the fact remains that, despite higher\ncommodity prices, inflation remains very low and I expect it to stay low for the next few years.\nOver the past year, overall inflation was around 1.2 percent as measured by the personal\nconsumption expenditures price index. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices,\nwas around 0.7 percent, its lowest level in many decades.\nHow can I reconcile this apparent contradiction? Recall that inflation measures the rate of\nchange of prices. For inflation to stay high, there must be a general and persistent tendency of\nprices to rise rapidly, not just a one-time increase. Commodity prices tend to fluctuate up and\ndown depending on supply and demand, and in that sense the changes are typically neither\ngeneral nor persistent. We saw that when the huge jump in oil and other commodity prices in\n2007–08 reversed in 2009. Today, strong growth in Asia and bad harvests in various parts of the\nworld are driving up prices of many foodstuffs. And turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa\nhas driven up the price of oil, as well as market expectations regarding oil prices over the next\nfew years. But supply and demand will adjust, and I don’t expect rapid increases in food and\nenergy prices to continue year after year. This view is supported by prices in futures markets\nwhich suggest that, with regard to oil, market participants see prices increasing this year, but\nflattening in 2012.\nThere has been speculation that rising commodity prices will fuel a surge in the cost of\nfinished goods. But it’s important to remember that labor compensation, not raw commodities, is\nby far the largest cost category for businesses. While it’s true that rising agricultural prices drive\nup the cost of food and rising oil prices drive up the cost of energy, the effects on other consumer\n4\n\nprices are relatively muted. Raw materials and energy account for a relatively small and\ndeclining share of the total cost of providing goods and services in the U.S. economy. A careful\naccounting shows that agricultural commodities comprised only 1.3 percent of costs of personal\nconsumption expenditures in 2010. And fuel commodities accounted for 3.8 percent of personal\nconsumer expenditures.2 Why are these shares so low? One reason is that purchases of services,\nwhich use relatively little in the way of commodity inputs, make up two-thirds of consumption\nspending. And in the manufacturing sector, most of the “value added” in the U.S. economy\ncomes from using technology, capital, and labor to transform raw commodities into highly\nvaluable final products, such as aircraft, automobiles, and computers.\nSo, then, what’s happening with labor costs? With the weak economy and very high\nlevels of unemployment, wage growth has been tepid. Last year, for workers in the nonfarm\nbusiness sector, compensation per hour, including benefits, rose 1½ percent. Productivity rose\nslightly faster, so unit labor costs actually fell a bit in 2010 after plummeting 3½ percent in 2009.\nGiven the enormous slack in labor and product markets, we forecast that labor costs will grow\nonly modestly and that inflation will continue to be low. Specifically, we see higher energy\nprices boosting the overall personal consumption expenditures price index inflation rate to about\n1.5 percent this year. But then, with energy prices expected to rise only modestly next year, we\nexpect the overall inflation rate to settle down to about 1 percent in 2012, as continued slack in\nlabor and goods markets offsets the pass-through effects of higher commodity prices onto core\nprices. Importantly, unlike the 1970s, when run-ups in food and energy prices fueled a wage-\nprice spiral of rising inflation, inflation expectations today remain well anchored and we see no\nsigns of such “second-round” effects of higher commodity prices on wages and prices.\n2 See Hobijn (2008).\n5\n\nTo understand Fed policy at this point, you have to look at this whole picture. We have\ngood GDP growth, but a yawning shortfall of employment and output from potential levels.\nCongress has charged the Fed with dual objectives: maximum employment and stable prices. We\nare far from the first, as I shall explain in some detail. Regarding the second, most participants in\nthe Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking body, see inflation of 2 percent as\nbeing most consistent with price stability.3 The territory we’re in now is well below that 2\npercent figure. So, we are far off on our price stability objective as well.\nIn response to the worsening economy and the financial crisis, the FOMC pushed its\nmain policy rate, the federal funds rate, essentially to zero late in 2008. Interest rates can’t go\nbelow zero, something economists refer to as the zero lower bound. So the Fed has turned to\nanother option to add additional stimulus—the purchase of longer-term securities. From late\n2008 through early 2010, the Fed bought $1.7 trillion in longer-term Treasury securities, and\ndebt and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. In\nNovember last year, we announced our intention to purchase an additional $600 billion in\nlonger-term Treasury securities by the middle of 2011, which we are proceeding to do.\nSome commentators have suggested that the large-scale asset purchase program\nrepresents some kind of radical departure for the Fed. But the fact is that the program is the\npursuit of monetary policy by other means. The fed funds rate is the interest rate banks charge\neach other for overnight loans. The level of fed funds ripples through the financial system and\naffects medium- and longer-term interest rates, other asset prices, and ultimately the economy.\nThe Fed’s purchases of longer-term securities have similar and, in some ways, even more direct\neffects. By boosting demand for longer-term securities, Fed purchases push down rates at the\n3 In January 2011, 12 of the 18 FOMC participants indicated a longer-run PCE price index inflation rate projection\nof 1.9–2.0 percent, while the remaining six participants indicated projections between 1.5 and 1.8 percent. See\nFigure 2C, Federal Open Market Committee (2011).\n6\n\nlonger end of the yield curve compared with where they would be otherwise. And those lower\nrates help ease overall credit conditions, boost asset prices, and stimulate economic activity.\nRecent research estimates that these lower rates will raise the level of real GDP almost 3 percent\nand create an extra 3 million jobs by the second half of 2012 relative to what would happen if the\nFed hadn’t launched this program.4 These estimates are subject to a great deal of uncertainty, but\nI think it’s pretty clear that the asset purchases have helped speed the recovery and reduce the\nrisk of sustained deflation.\nI promised earlier to explain how the Fed thinks about the question of “maximum\nemployment.” So, what exactly does this phrase mean? Maximum employment doesn’t mean the\nsituation that prevails when the highest possible number of workers is holding jobs. Instead,\neconomists think of maximum employment in terms of the level of unemployment that creates\nneither upward nor downward pressure on inflation—in other words, an equilibrium\nunemployment rate. The phrase “natural rate of unemployment” is sometimes used to refer to\nthis supposedly “ideal” unemployment rate. The concept of natural rate is similar to an acronym\nsome of you may remember from your econ classes, the NAIRU, which stands for the non-\naccelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\nBefore the recent recession, a typical estimate of the natural rate was 5 percent. Now\nsome economists argue that today’s 9 percent unemployment rate may be close to the natural\nrate, what you might call the “new normal.” Those who hold this view believe that recent shocks\nto the economy have altered the job market in such a way that higher rates of unemployment are\nstructural rather than cyclical in nature. Proponents of the structural argument reject the idea that\ntoday’s high unemployment stems from a shortfall of demand for labor associated with an\nunusually severe business cycle downturn. If that were true, then we would already be at\n4 See Chung et al. (2011a, b).\n7\n\nmaximum employment and the Fed would not be falling short on its maximum employment\nobjective. It would also follow that there would be no downward pressure on inflation from slack\nin labor markets.\nI think it’s correct that a number of factors associated with the crisis and recession have\ntemporarily boosted the natural rate of unemployment somewhat. But, I don’t agree that the\nnatural rate is currently anything near 9 percent. In fact, I think that today’s unemployment rate\nis far above the natural rate.\nEconomists at the San Francisco Fed have examined this question closely and have\nconcluded that the “normal” or “natural” rate of unemployment likely has increased, but much\nless than the rise in the actual unemployment rate. Our estimate is that, since 2007, the natural\nrate has climbed as much as 1.7 percentage points to 6.7 percent.5 We further conclude that much\nof this increase is temporary. Here’s the relevance of this research for monetary policy: Even\nwith this temporarily elevated natural rate, the current unemployment rate, and unemployment\nrates forecast for the short and medium term, imply that the labor market will have considerable\nslack for years. As I noted earlier, we don’t see a return to full employment until 2014. And that\nmeans we think there won’t be upward pressure on wages and prices from tight labor and goods\nmarkets for some time.\nThe level of the natural rate of unemployment is important, so I’d like to explain how we\narrived at our view. Of course, the natural rate is not directly observable. In a survey, you can ask\nsomeone if they have a job or if they’ve searched for work. But you can’t ask them whether they\nare structurally unemployed. So economists rely on other information to infer the natural rate’s\nlevel and whether it is shifting. An important source of information is movement in a relationship\neconomists call the Beveridge curve. The Beveridge curve represents the usually negative\n5 See Weidner and Williams (2011).\n8\n\ncorrelation between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate. This relationship is not\nsurprising—unemployment generally falls as employers step up recruiting efforts. During 2010,\njob vacancies did indeed rise, indicating an improving labor market. But, the increase was not\nmatched by the normal decline in the unemployment rate. That suggests that the Beveridge curve\nmight have shifted in such a way that a given level of job vacancies is now associated with a\nhigher unemployment rate. That kind of shift is consistent with greater labor market friction so\nthat there is less efficiency in matching workers with jobs. In turn, greater difficulty matching\nworkers and jobs would suggest that the natural rate of unemployment has risen and that there\nisn’t so much slack in the labor market.\nSan Francisco Fed researchers have recently examined other labor market indicators,\nsuch as worker and employer perceptions of how hard it is to find or fill jobs, and the willingness\nof workers to quit jobs.6 Like the job vacancy data, these also imply less labor market slack than\none would expect based on the unemployment rate.\nThese unusual patterns in the Beveridge curve and other labor market indicators raise the\npossibility of a pronounced shift from previous labor market norms. However, although these\ndata provide tantalizing clues, we can’t definitively use them to calculate how much the natural\nrate of unemployment has increased. History shows that the Beveridge curve is prone to shifts\nthat don’t necessarily imply a similarly sized increase in the natural rate. The Beveridge curve\nshifted rightward about 4 percentage points between the 1960s and the 1980s and then shifted\nback 2.5 percentage points between 1984 and 1989. Based on other evidence, the variation in the\nnatural rate over this period was much smaller than these movements in the Beveridge curve\nwould suggest. Ultimately, figuring out the factors driving movements in the Beveridge curve\nand their likely impact on the natural rate are empirical problems.\n6 See Daly et al. (2011).\n9\n\nSo, let’s roll up our sleeves and get empirical. Economists have cited three possible\nreasons why the natural rate of unemployment may have risen since the start of the recession.\nBeginning in mid-2008, eligibility for unemployment benefits was extended in several\nincrements above the normal 26 weeks, reaching a potential maximum of 99 weeks by late 2009.\nThis program has helped buttress consumer spending and it certainly has eased the hardship of\njoblessness for many households. At the same time, extended benefits have reduced the incentive\nof eligible workers to look for work or accept job offers, which may raise the unemployment\nrate. Research suggests that these extensions have boosted the natural rate of unemployment by\nabout three-quarters of a percentage point, an effect that will go away after the extended benefits\nprogram expires.\nA second explanation for a higher natural rate is that the degree of mismatch between job\nseekers and potential employers has increased. The mismatch argument is predicated on\nimbalances in labor supply and demand across industry sectors, geographic areas, or skill groups.\nThus, unemployed construction workers may not qualify for available jobs in health and\neducation. Or unemployed individuals in Nevada may be underwater on their mortgages and\nunable to sell their homes, which might keep them from taking jobs in Utah. One way to assess\nsuch imbalances in the labor market is to compare employment growth, unemployment rates, the\nrate at which job vacancies are filled, and employee quit rates across industries and geographic\nareas. But when we do this, we find more similarities than differences across industry sectors and\nregions. That suggests labor market mismatch has had only modest effects on measured\nunemployment.\nThe best way to assess whether some sectors or regions face meaningful labor shortages\nis to look at wages, which according to supply and demand should rise more rapidly in tight\n10\n\nsectors. But there is little evidence indicating that wages are growing faster in fast-expanding\nindustry sectors than in stagnant or shrinking sectors. In fact, wage growth is modest across the\nboard, even for newly minted college graduates, whose adaptability and geographic mobility\nreduce their exposure to structural imbalances.\nA third explanation for a higher natural rate is related to the big increase in long-term\nunemployment over the past few years. Workers who are unemployed for extended periods often\nexperience higher future rates of unemployment as their skills deteriorate and their attachment to\nthe labor market frays. This phenomenon, known as hysteresis, has been a problem in European\ncountries with very generous unemployment benefits. But research shows that it has been far less\nof an issue in the United States. What’s more, hysteresis probably reflects factors we’ve already\ntaken into account—extended unemployment benefits and job mismatches—and may not be an\nindependent contributing factor.\nAdding all this up suggests that the natural rate of unemployment has risen from\nsomething around 5 percent in 2007 to perhaps as high as 6.7 percent now. About half of that 1.7\npercentage point rise appears to be associated with the extension of unemployment insurance,\nwhich will go away when extended benefits expire. The remainder is probably associated with\nthe severe shocks that hit certain areas of the labor market, such as construction. Those effects\nare likely to take several years to dissipate. It is important to stress that all of these measures are\nuncertain and economists will need to keep adjusting estimates.\nThat brings me back to monetary policy. If the natural rate of unemployment is\nsomething like 6.7 percent, then we are about 2.3 percentage points above the level of\nunemployment at which the labor market would start to overheat and push inflation too high.\nBased on our forecast, it will probably take quite some time before we can put all those people to\n11\n\nwork and before we see wage and price pressures emerging from tight labor and product\nmarkets. With inflation low and considerable slack in labor markets, monetary policy will likely\nremain accommodative for an extended period, as reiterated in the most recent FOMC statement.\nHowever, it’s important to recognize that even the best forecasts can be wrong. The\nFOMC regularly reviews its forecasts and policy actions in light of new information. I want to\nemphasize that, when the right time comes, the Fed will reduce monetary stimulus. A great deal\nof thought has gone into designing the proper ways to unwind the measures now in place.

    "text": "Presentation to the Seattle Community Development Roundtable\nSeattle, WA\nBy John C. Williams\nExecutive Vice President and Director of Research\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 15, 2010, 12:30 p.m. PST\nThe Economic Outlook\nThank you very much for your invitation to speak today. I’m going to offer my thoughts\nabout the economy—where I think it’s going and what the Federal Reserve is doing to promote\neconomic recovery and price stability. The sluggish pace of growth that we’ve seen over the\npast year or so has been deeply frustrating to all of us. Nevertheless, I have some encouraging\nnews to report. We at the San Francisco Fed found a striking new indicator that is sending an\nunambiguous signal that the economy could surge next year. It comes from a field that is even\nmore obsessed with statistics than economics is. I’m referring, of course, to baseball.\nYou know how excited we in the San Francisco Bay Area were about the Giants World\nSeries win. It turns out that what was exciting for us was also good for the nation. In our\nresearch at the Fed, we found that inflation-adjusted gross domestic product—GDP, the most\nfundamental measure of the overall performance of the economy—grew by a phenomenal 10.2\npercent average in the years immediately following a Giants Series victory. That’s more than\nfive times faster than the estimated 2 percent GDP growth rate registered in this year’s third\nquarter. In fact, over the past 100 years or so, the slowest growth recorded after a Giants World\nSeries win was a very robust 6 percent. I’m only sorry that we’ve had to wait since 1954 for this\nparticular indicator to turn positive. And one other thing: Thanks for sending us Tim Lincecum.\n1\n\nUnfortunately, in my career following the economy, I’ve learned not to rely too much on\none indicator, even one as important as the World Series. Instead, I’m going to base the rest of\nmy remarks on more traditional and mundane tools of economic analysis, and they present a\ndecidedly more mixed picture. I should stress that my comments represent my own views and\nnot necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nI’ll lay out some key points regarding the economy’s current performance and I’ll present\nour forecast for the next few years. I will focus in particular on what I think is one of the most\nimportant headwinds keeping the recovery from taking off—that is the lackluster growth of\nconsumer spending. I’ll then spend a little time talking about the current low level of inflation\nand the remote risk of a period of Japanese-style deflation, in which wages and prices actually\nfall. Finally, I’ll explain how the Fed is responding and describe the reasoning behind the\nprogram of Treasury securities purchases announced two weeks ago.\nIn trying to understand the economy’s performance, the central question is why the pace\nof recovery is still so slow. The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, the group that calls when recessions begin and end, determined that the\nrecession ended in June 2009. By some measures, this was the worst recession since the Great\nDepression. During the recession, the economy shed over 7 million jobs, inflation-adjusted GDP\nfell by over 4 percent, and household net worth declined by 13.7 trillion—that’s trillion with a\n“T”—dollars.\nIt’s now nearly a year and a half since the economy started expanding again, but, in many\nrespects, it feels like we’re still mired in recession. After an initial surge out of the starting gate,\nthe economy lost momentum and now seems stalled at a growth rate of about 2 percent. The\n2\n\nstatement released after the Fed policy meeting November 3 described this performance as\n“disappointingly slow.” It’s below our estimate of the growth of potential output and it’s well\noff the pace of typical recoveries after bad recessions, when growth tended to be 5 percent or\nbetter. This is not just a matter of dry statistics, either. With such a subpar recovery, job growth\nhas proceeded at a snail’s pace and the unemployment rate has been stuck at about 9.6 percent all\nyear. Indeed, according to a September CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll, more than 70\npercent of those surveyed thought the economy was still in recession.\nThat said, it’s important to stress that the economy is recovering. Employers added over\n150,000 jobs in October. Consumer spending and business investment are rising, and the\nmanufacturing sector has been on a solid uptrend. The information technology sector has been\ndoing quite well and Internet businesses are posting strong gains, as those of you who follow\nMicrosoft and Amazon well know.\nAs we look ahead, we expect that the recovery will gradually pick up speed, although it\nwill continue to be a long, drawn-out affair. Neither consumers nor businesses seem to be in\nposition to power rapid growth. Meanwhile, federal fiscal stimulus is winding down, while state\nand local governments are cutting budgets. In other words, there’s no sector of the economy—\nnot consumers, not business, and not government—that’s waiting to surge ahead and drive a\nstrong recovery. Instead, I expect spending by consumers and businesses to gain momentum\nonly gradually over the next few years as we put the financial crisis behind us and confidence\nreturns.\nIn terms of hard numbers, I expect real GDP growth to rise from this year’s 2½ percent\npace to about 3½ percent next year and 4½ percent in 2012. The unemployment rate will\n3\n\nprobably still be around 9 percent at the end of 2011 and won’t reach 8 percent until late in 2012.\nI don’t expect the unemployment rate to get back to a normal level of between 5 and 6 percent\nfor at least four more years.\nThis disappointing performance can be traced back to the forces that triggered the\nrecession in the first place. The recession was the result of the most catastrophic banking and\nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression. An excess of risky lending and investing—especially\nin the housing market—led to the near collapse of the financial system, which sowed fear and\nstarved the economy of credit. Research shows that when recessions are caused by financial\ncrises, recoveries are weaker and slower.1 That’s because it takes time for the financial system to\nheal and for households and businesses to repair their finances, which were damaged by the\ncrisis.\nThis bears directly on one of my main themes this afternoon—the tepid growth of\nconsumer spending, which represents about 70 percent of the nation’s economic activity.\nRecoveries are typically supported by stronger growth in consumption as households regain both\nthe will and the wherewithal to spend. But, in the aftermath of the burst credit and housing\nbubbles, consumers don’t have much of either of those things. They’ve been hit hard by a\nnumber of factors that have prompted them to tighten their purse strings.\nFirst, the crash of housing and the stock market’s retreat destroyed trillions of dollars of\nhousehold wealth, as I noted. The loss of wealth causes people to save more in order to rebuild\ntheir retirement and college fund nest eggs. The first figure shows the ratio of net wealth to\n1 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) for discussions of the\nevidence on banking and financial crises in history.\n4\n\ndisposable personal income. At\nFigure 1\nThe Bubble Decades\nthe peak of the housing bubble, it\nRatio of Net Worth to Disposable Personal Income\nHouseholds andNonprofit Organizations\nreached nearly 6.4. We’re now Ratio\n6.4\nback to a historically typical\n6\nvalue for this ratio of about 4¾. 5.6\nAverage from\n5.2 1952-1995\nAccording to standard estimates\n4.8\nof the so-called wealth effect,\n4.4\nwhich is the tendency of\n4\n50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 00 05 10\naccumulated assets to encourage\nconsumption, the decline in net worth since the start of the recession will reduce consumer\nspending by about $430 billion, or 4½ percent, relative to its pre-recession level.\nSecond, adding insult to\nFigure 2\nHousehold Debt Hangover\ninjury, consumer debt reached\nRatio of Debt to Disposable Personal Income\nRatio Households andNonprofit Organizations\nunsustainable levels during the\n1.4\nbubble years. The second figure 1.2\n1\nshows the ratio of household debt\n0.8\nto disposable personal income.\n0.6\nYou can see a clear upward trend\n0.4\nin this ratio over the second half\n0.2\n50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 00 05 10\nof the 20th century. But, what is\n\\\neven more striking is the explosion during the housing boom, when households piled on debt,\nbringing the debt-to-income ratio to an all-time high of 1.3. Well, the party is over and we are in\n5\n\nthe midst of a long hangover. Families are paring back spending in an effort to get out from\nunder this mountain of debt.2\nThird, the easy credit of a few years ago has given way to an environment in which it’s\ntougher to get a revolving credit line, a mortgage, or other loans. Certainly it’s hard to use home\nequity to fund consumption when the value of your home is flat or declining. The ATM called\nhome just won’t give out cash any more. Fourth, slow income growth is also limiting the ability\nof households to spend more.\nFinally, high unemployment, stagnant wages, and a fragile economy have sapped\nconsumer confidence and made people cautious about spending. If you’re uncertain whether\nyou’ll have a job next month, you think twice about buying a house or car.\nPut it all together and you have a recipe for consumer spending growth significantly\nbelow what is typically seen in recoveries. Growth in consumer spending has been running at\nabout trend for the past few quarters. I don’t see anything on the horizon that will dramatically\nchange this picture in the near term. And the housing market is likely to remain in the doldrums\nfor even longer.\nI’d like to turn now to inflation, or, I should say, the lack of inflation. The measure of\ninflation we follow most closely is the core personal consumption expenditures price index.\nThese prices have been rising at a 0.9 percent rate so far this year. This is the lowest nine-month\ninflation rate recorded in the over 50 years that this statistic has been compiled. Our forecast is\nthat inflation will come in about 1 percent for the year as a whole and stay at that rate next year.\n2 See Glick and Lansing (2010) for a discussion of the accumulation of debt, housing bubbles,\nand subsequent declines in consumption in several countries.\n6\n\nThat’s about 1½ percentage points below where it was at the start of the recession and well\nbelow the level of around 2 percent that most Fed policymakers have said is consistent with\nstable prices.\nIt’s hardly a surprise that inflation is so tame. There is a great deal of slack in the\neconomy and workers are in no position to demand sizable wage increases. And both consumers\nand businesses have learned to wait for bargains before making purchases. Our retail contacts\nspeak of a brutal sales environment in which heavy discounting has become the norm and\nholiday sales start around Halloween.\nTo me, the danger is that weak demand and excess productive capacity could cause\ninflation to fall further, taking us perilously close to deflation. That’s what happened to Japan in\nthe 1990s, a painful period for them characterized by slowly sinking prices and alternate bouts of\nslow growth and recession. I\nFigure 3\nRising Risk of Deflation\nwant to show you a sobering\nCore Inflationin the US and Japan\nCPI ex. food and energy; Percent change from twelve months earlier\nchart that overlays the recent U.S.\n4%\ncore consumer price index\n3\ninflation trend line with that from US\n2\nSept.2010\nJapan’s lost decade. Although\n1\nthere are many differences\n0\nJapan\nbetween the economies of the\n-1\nUS\n-2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nJapan\ntwo countries, there are some\nimportant parallels between Japan’s situation then and that of the United States today. Japan was\nalso mired in an extended period of subpar growth. Like in the U.S.A., Japanese consumers and\nbusinesses were reluctant to spend.\n7\n\nFew of us have experienced an extended period of deflation, but it’s not pretty. The New\nYork Times recently ran an article about how ordinary Japanese citizens coped with deflation. It\ndescribed how people stopped buying homes, cars, and other discretionary items because they\ncould be had for a cheaper price in the future. Businesses postponed investments because the\nreturns from holding cash were better than what they could reliably expect to earn by expanding\noperations. The article conveyed a pall of gloom that hung over the Japanese economy, sapping\nconfidence and further fueling a deflationary hesitance to spend.\nThe good news is that I firmly believe that we can avoid a pernicious bout of deflation\nhere. I described the similarities of our situation with Japan’s, but there are also some critical\ndifferences, which makes the chances of prolonged U.S. deflation quite low. One of the most\nimportant of these concerns financial conditions. When Japan’s banks found themselves with\nenormous portfolios of bad real estate and commercial loans, regulators allowed the banks to\nkick the can down the road. So-called zombie banks were incapable of lending on the scale\nneeded to revive Japan’s economy. By contrast, U.S. policymakers shut down failing institutions\nand forced remaining banks to recapitalize. While lending hasn’t fully recovered, there’s no\nquestion that U.S. financial institutions are far healthier today than Japan’s were in the 1990s.\nIn addition, following the Fed’s successful reduction of inflation starting in 1979,\nresearch shows that Americans have come to expect that inflation will be low, but positive. In\neconomics jargon, inflation expectations are well anchored. That means that people expect the\nFed to take action to keep inflation low and stable, and do everything in its power to prevent\ndeflation. The anchoring of expectations helps us avoid the onset of a deflationary mindset that\ncould create conditions for a downward spiral in wages and prices that would be highly\ndamaging to the economy.\n8\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, we’re also different from Japan in monetary\npolicy. One lesson from Japan's experience is the need to act aggressively before deflation\nbecomes firmly entrenched. In contrast with Japan, the Fed has adopted proactive measures to\nhead off a deflationary spiral before it can take root. This brings me to current Fed policy and, in\nparticular, the recently announced program to purchase Treasury securities.\nBy way of background, it’s important to understand that by law Congress has charged the\nFed with two objectives: maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the Fed is falling\nshort on both counts. Unemployment obviously is unacceptably high. And, as I’ve explained,\ninflation is somewhat below the level that is consistent over the long run with stable prices. In\nother words, the Fed would like to kick the recovery into a higher gear and nudge inflation up a\nbit, avoiding further disinflation.\nThe Fed’s traditional policy tool is the federal funds rate, which is the overnight interest\nrate banks charge each other for loans. We’ve had our federal funds target set near zero for\nalmost two years now and obviously that’s as low as it can go. So, to provide additional stimulus\nto the economy, we’ve used unconventional policy tools, most notably beginning nearly two\nyears ago a program to purchase up to $1.75 trillion in Treasury securities and agency mortgage-\nbacked securities and debt. This program has helped push down mortgage and other long-term\ninterest rates, thereby supporting the housing market and the economy overall at a time when it\ndesperately needed a boost. The Fed’s latest program involves purchases of a further $600 billion\nof longer-term Treasury securities, which will be carried out at a pace of about $75 billion per\nmonth. The idea is the same as before–to push medium and longer-term interest rates down\nfurther, giving added support to economic activity. So far, the responses in financial markets\nshow that this program is working.\n9\n\nLike all monetary policy decisions, there are risks associated with this action. I would\nlike to talk about the concern that we may see a return of high inflation because of the large\namount of monetary stimulus. Although I take this concern very seriously, I see the risk of high\ninflation as remote. First, there are no signs of the kind of overheated economic activity that\ntriggers inflation. Indeed, all measures of slack I know of show the economy is running well\nbelow its potential and inflation is trending down, not up. Second, the inflation expectations of\nhouseholds, investors, and economists point to low, not high, inflation in years to come. In the\n1970s, the last time we saw runaway inflation, inflation expectations had clearly become\nunmoored. Third, the Federal Reserve has the means and, most importantly, the will to reduce\nmonetary stimulus when appropriate. As it has for the past three decades, and as it affirmed in\nthe November 3 policy statement, it will monitor the economy carefully and adjust the stance of\nmonetary policy to preserve price stability.\nIn summary, although I wish the Giants win portended a quick acceleration of growth, I\nthink we need to realize that the economy is digging itself out of a very deep hole and will take\nquite a while to get back to “normal.” This disappointing performance in large part stems from\nthe nature of the housing crash and financial crisis. Monetary policy is doing what it can to\npromote recovery and price stability, and I am confident that with time we will once again attain\nmaximum sustainable employment with low stable inflation.\nThank you very much.\n10\n\nReferences\nGlick, Reuven, and Kevin J.

    "text": "Presentation to Community Leaders\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nBy John C. Williams, president and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 2, 2012 at 11:25am Pacific, 12:25pm Mountain, 2:25pm Eastern\nThe Role of Monetary Policy in Bolstering Economic Growth1\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in Salt Lake City. Today, I will talk about the\neconomy, noting some of the welcome improvements we’ve seen lately, as well as some serious\nthreats to the recovery. I’ll have a few words to say about the ongoing European financial crisis\nand our own budgetary challenges. And I’ll present my forecast for the economy. I’ll end my\nremarks by discussing the steps the Federal Reserve has taken to bolster economic growth and\nmove our economy towards our congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and\nprice stability. In particular, I want to explain the moves the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) made in September to step up our purchases of longer-term securities and extend the\ntime frame for low short-term interest rates. I hope to make it clear that, even as we focus on\nsolidifying the recovery, our commitment to keeping inflation low hasn’t wavered. I should\nemphasize that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nLet me start by noting that we are now in the fourth year of the economic recovery. That\nin itself is a significant accomplishment, given how close our financial system came to\ncollapsing in late 2008. The recession then already under way worsened, turning into the longest\nand deepest downturn since the Great Depression. The economy shrank more than 4½ percent\nand the unemployment rate eventually peaked at 10 percent.\n1 I want to thank John Fernald and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nThanks in part to emergency first aid by the Fed, financial conditions stabilized and\nbegan to recover. By mid-2009, the economy was growing again. However, progress has been\nstubbornly slow, and production of goods and services didn’t return to its pre-recession peak\nuntil a year ago. The recovery in jobs has been frustratingly slow as well. To be sure, private-\nsector payrolls have risen for over 2½ years now, adding nearly 4¾ million jobs.2 But, despite\nthese gains, the unemployment rate remains a very high 7.9 percent.\nPerhaps the most encouraging signs of a turnaround have been the improvements in two\nkey sectors of the economy: autos and housing. Car sales have bounced back 60 percent from\ntheir recession lows, thanks to pent-up demand and fabulous rates on auto loans. And housing\nhas finally come off the mat. Fewer homes are going into foreclosure. Credit is still tight for\nmany potential homebuyers, but the market has firmed and home sales are off their lows. With a\nlimited stock of homes to choose from, house prices are rising in many parts of the country. This\nis setting the stage for more homebuilding. Housing starts are still only a little more than a third\nof their peak levels during the boom. But they are up sharply from where they were a year ago.\nAs welcome as this progress is, the recovery has lacked the spark of past rebounds.\nThat’s not surprising when you consider what we went through in 2007 and 2008. Families are\nburied in debt accumulated during the housing boom, and many now find their homes are worth\nless than what they paid for them. Millions of homeowners are behind on their mortgages or\nhave already lost their homes. And lenders, burned from their past mistakes, are tightfisted with\ncredit. All these are explanations for the gradual pace of economic recovery.\n2 The employment gains since the recession are likely to be revised up, according to a preliminary announcement by\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, the BLS estimates that their upcoming benchmark revisions will add\n453,000 private-sector jobs as of March 2012. The revisions will be implemented with the release of the January\n2013 employment report. See BLS (2012).\n2\n\nWhen I look at the economic landscape ahead, I see three additional factors continuing to\nhold us back: the European crisis, budget challenges here at home, and widespread uncertainty\nabout where the economy is going. All three factors are legacies of the financial crisis and\nrecession, which devastated public-sector budgets at home and abroad, and fueled economic\nanxiety.\nLet’s consider Europe’s problems first. The global financial crisis exposed weaknesses in\nthe housing markets, financial systems, and public-sector finances of several countries that use\nthe euro as their currency. By 2010, private investors were fleeing the riskier countries, such as\nGreece, driving government borrowing costs through the roof. The situation has snowballed into\na much broader financial and debt crisis, and a persistent European recession. And that hurts us,\ntoo. U.S. exports to Europe have begun to tail off after a period when manufacturing in our\ncountry was making real forward strides. And Europe’s woes have led to weaker exports from\nplaces such as China, leading to slower global growth.\nA second factor weighing on the economy is the budget picture in our own country. In\nthe depths of the recession, fiscal stimulus in the form of federal tax cuts and spending programs\nwas enacted to offset, at least in part, the collapse of private-sector demand. The package\nincluded subsidies that prevented some state and local cutbacks from taking place. At the same\ntime, safety net programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps ramped up as\nmillions more people qualified for benefits. All this federal fiscal expansion cushioned the blow\nof the downturn.\nBut the stimulus measures put in place a few years ago have been rolling off. Now we’re\nshifting to austerity in fiscal policy. And the economic drag from the public sector will get even\n3\n\nworse at the beginning of 2013. Under current legislation, we face what’s come to be called the\n“fiscal cliff.” That refers to the huge federal tax hikes and spending cuts that will take place\nautomatically at the beginning of next year. If they all occurred at once, we could find ourselves\non the brink of a recession again. Fortunately, I don’t think that’s going to happen. I expect\nCongress will keep us away from the cliff by extending some tax reductions and deferring some\nspending cutbacks. All the same, significant reductions in federal spending and increases in\ntaxes are likely to go through, deepening the drag on the economy.\nThis brings me to a third factor holding back the recovery—uncertainty. We don’t know\nwhat’s going to happen in Europe. And we don’t know what’s going to happen with the federal\nbudget. These are not trivial matters. They’ll have a tremendous effect on the economic and\nbusiness climate in the months and years ahead. That makes it hard for businesses and\nhouseholds to plan for the future. Add to that the general sense of unease that stems from the\nrocky course of the economy over the past five years, and it’s no wonder people are skittish. Just\nabout every businessperson I meet tells me that economic uncertainty and fears about the future\nmake them hesitant to break ground on new projects or boost their payrolls.\nSo what are we at the Fed doing in these circumstances? Let’s start by considering the\ngoals Congress has assigned us: maximum employment and price stability. Economists debate\nwhat unemployment rate is consistent with maximum employment. Typical estimates are\nbetween 5 and 6 percent. Thus, by almost any credible measure, the current 7.9 percent rate is\nmuch higher than we would get at maximum employment.3 As for price stability, Fed\npolicymakers have specified that a 2 percent inflation rate is most consistent with our mandate\n3 See Daly et al. (2012), Lazear and Spletzer (2012), and Williams (2012).\n4\n\nfrom Congress.4 Inflation has averaged only 1.7 percent over the past year, below this 2 percent\ntarget.\nThis means we’re falling short of both of our goals, especially the maximum employment\nmandate. What’s more, the recovery faces threats from Europe and the fiscal cliff. This is a\nsituation that demands Fed action to keep our economy on track towards maximum employment\nand price stability. So let’s look at our options. Our usual method of stimulating the economy is\nto reduce short-term interest rates. But we pushed those rates down close to zero almost four\nyears ago. That route simply isn’t available to us.\nInstead, we have had to find other ways to stimulate the economy. One form of monetary\nstimulus we’ve turned to is known as large-scale asset purchases. In late 2008 and 2009, the Fed\npurchased over $1.7 trillion of longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, a\nprogram often referred to as QE1, for quantitative easing. Then, in November 2010, the FOMC\nannounced an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities purchases—QE2. A\nlittle over a year ago, we launched a third asset purchase program, sometimes called Operation\nTwist. In Operation Twist, which is scheduled to end in December, we haven’t increased the\noverall size of our securities holdings as we did with QE1 and 2. Rather, we’ve changed the\ncomposition of our securities holdings by selling $45 billion in short-term Treasury securities\neach month and buying an equal amount of longer-term Treasury securities.\nThese large-scale asset purchase programs work by raising demand for longer-term\nTreasury securities. As demand goes up, the prices of those securities rise and yields come\n4 For more information, see the statement of longer-term goals and policy strategy released by the FOMC in January\n(Board of Governors 2012a).\n5\n\ndown. The effects extend to other longer-term securities, pushing down longer-term interest\nrates across the board.5\nA second form of monetary stimulus we’ve used has been to issue public statements\nabout the likely future path of the federal funds rate, the short-term benchmark interest rate we\nlowered close to zero in 2008. In central banking language, such public statements are known as\nforward guidance. Starting in August of last year, we have indicated in our monetary policy\nstatements that we expect to hold the federal funds rate at very low levels at least through a\nspecified date. This guidance regarding future policy actions lets the public know that short-term\nrates are likely to stay low for years to come, which puts downward pressure on longer-term\ninterest rates. The evidence suggests that forward guidance has effectively influenced financial\nconditions this way.6\nAt our meeting in September, the FOMC took two new actions aimed at strengthening the\nrecovery.7 First, we announced a new large-scale asset purchase program to buy $40 billion in\nmortgage-backed securities each month. This purchase program is intended to be flexible and\nadjust to changing circumstances. Unlike our past asset purchase programs, this one doesn’t\nhave a preset expiration date. Instead, its duration will depend on what happens with the\neconomy. Specifically, we’ve said we’ll continue buying mortgage-backed securities until the\njob market shows substantial improvement. We also said we may expand our purchases to\ninclude other assets. But, if we find that our policies aren’t doing what they’re supposed to do or\nare causing significant economic problems, we’ll adjust or end them.\n5 See Williams (2011).\n6 See Swanson and Williams (2012).\n7 See Board of Governors (2012b).\n6\n\nThe second step we took was to announce that we expect to keep the federal funds rate\nexceptionally low at least through mid-2015. That announcement extended out in time forward\nguidance we had previously given on how long we expected to keep our benchmark\nexceptionally low. We also said we’d maintain low rates “for a considerable time after the\neconomic recovery strengthens.” In other words, we intend to keep short-term rates low even as\nthe economy improves to make sure this recovery takes hold.\nOur policy measures are having the desired effects. Take mortgage interest rates. Our\npurchases of mortgage-backed and Treasury securities have helped push conventional 30-year\nmortgage rates to historically low levels under 3½ percent.8 And low mortgage rates are a great\nway to pep up the economy. They make owning a home more affordable, which increases\ndemand for housing. Higher demand puts upward pressure on house prices, making it easier for\nexisting homeowners to refinance or sell their homes. The happy result is a virtuous circle of\ngrowing confidence and improving fundamentals in the housing market. And, over the next few\nyears, a homebuilding rebound should be a key driver of economic growth, employing more\nconstruction workers, furniture salespeople, real estate agents, and the like.\nThanks in part to our actions, I anticipate the economy will gain momentum over the next\nfew years. I expect real gross domestic product, that is, the nation’s total output of goods and\nservices, to expand at a modest pace of about 1¾ percent this year, but improve to about 2½\npercent next year and about 3½ percent in 2014. I see the unemployment rate remaining above 7\npercent through at least the end of 2014. I expect inflation to remain slightly below 2 percent for\nthe next few years as labor costs and import prices remain subdued.\n8 Hancock and Passmore (2011) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) find significant effects of\nmortgage-backed securities purchases on mortgage rates. See Stroebel and Taylor (2012) for a contrary view.\n7\n\nOf course, with our latest policy measures, we find ourselves in waters that haven’t been\nextensively charted. That raises questions about unintended consequences. The concern I hear\nmost often is that our securities purchases might ignite a bout of inflation. In my view, that\nworry isn’t warranted. The fact is, the economy isn’t operating at full speed. We have lots of\nspare economic capacity and an abnormally high number of workers who can’t find jobs. That\nkeeps inflation in check by making it hard for businesses to raise prices or for workers to press\nfor higher pay. As I noted earlier, inflation has been tame, averaging 1¾ percent since the\nrecession started in late 2007. That’s happened despite the fact that our holdings of mortgage-\nbacked and Treasury securities have climbed by over 200 percent, to about $2½ trillion. In short,\nwe have substantial scope to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy without creating too\nmuch upward pressure on prices.\nI want to emphasize that we certainly don’t take this view on inflation for granted. We\nwatch how prices are behaving with the utmost attention. In addition, we always keep an eye on\nthe public’s expectations of inflation in the future. Specifically, we closely follow inflation\nexpectations measured in surveys of households and professional forecasters. We also monitor\nfinancial market indicators of inflation expectations. I’ve been reassured to see that our stimulus\nmeasures have not caused an undesirable increase in longer-term inflation expectations.\nIn closing, I’d like to make a point about the Fed’s dual mandate. We are unusual among\ncentral banks in that, since the 1970s, we’ve been charged with both employment and inflation\ngoals. Both aspects of the mandate are important. But which is the most pressing concern has\nchanged over time. From the late 1960s through the early 1990s, inflation was consistently\n8\n\nrunning well above 2 percent. Naturally, during that period, much of the discussion about\nmonetary policy centered on inflation and how to bring it down.\nToday the situation is very different. Since the early 1990s, inflation has been\nconsistently low, averaging right around 2 percent, and, most recently, even less than that. At the\nsame time, the unemployment rate has remained far above the maximum employment level for\nover four years straight. Thus, unemployment is—and should be—a central focus of monetary\npolicy right now. This concentration on getting unemployment down in no way represents a\nlessening of the importance of price stability. Quite the opposite. Consider that, if the recovery\nloses steam, inflation could fall too low—well below our 2 percent goal.\nThe steps the Fed has taken to boost the economy won’t quickly return our economy to\nfull strength. I know that. But they can help speed the recovery and make it more secure. I’m\nconvinced they represent the best course to move us toward maximum employment and price\nstability. Thank you very much.\n9\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012a. “Press Release.” January 25. http://\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012b. “Press Release.” September 13.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm\nBureau of Labor Statistics. 2012. “Current Employment Statistics: CES Preliminary Benchmark\nAnnouncement.” September 27. http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesprelbmk.htm\nDaly, Mary C., Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert Valletta. 2012. “A Search and Matching\nApproach to Labor Markets: Did the Natural Rate of Unemployment Rise?” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives 26(3, Summer), pp. 3–26.\nHancock, Diana, and Wayne Passmore. 2011. “Did the Federal Reserve’s MBS Purchase\nProgram Lower Mortgage Rates?” Journal of Monetary Economics 58(5, July), pp. 498–\n514.\nKrishnamurthy, Arvind, and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen. 2011. “The Effects of Quantitative\nEasing on Interest Rates: Channels and Implications for Policy.” Brookings Papers on\nEconomic Activity 43(2, Fall), pp. 215–287.\nLazear, Edward P., and James R.

    "text": "The Future Fortunes of R-star: Are\nThey Really Rising?\nRemarks by\nJ C. W\nOHN ILLIAMS\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nTo the\nEconomic Club of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nMay 15, 2018\nAS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon, and thank you for the kind introduction. I know that here, at the\nEconomic Club of Minnesota, you regularly host Fed presidents, so you’re no\nstrangers to speeches on interest rates and monetary policy. Today I’m going to take\nadvantage of that fact and take a step back. Today I’m going to talk about where I see\nPage 1 of 11\n\ninterest rates going, not just over the next few months, but over the next several years,\nand discuss the economic fundamentals driving the changes taking place.\nOne of the key factors that influences my thinking on monetary policy is something\ncalled r-star. Today I hope you’ll indulge me while I describe what r-star is, where it’s\nheaded, and how that affects the direction of interest rates.\nNow, I’ve already referred to interest rates and monetary policy several times. So\nbefore I go any further I should give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express\nare mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else at the Minneapolis\nFed, the San Francisco Fed, the New York Fed, or the Federal Reserve System as a\nwhole!\nR-star and the new normal\nSo what is this r-star I keep referring to, and why is it so important when it comes to\nthinking about interest rates?\nR-star is what economists call the natural rate of interest; it’s the real interest rate\nexpected to prevail when the economy is at full strength. While a central bank like the\nFed sets short-term interest rates, r-star is a result of longer-term economic factors\nbeyond the influence of central banks and monetary policy.1\nSuch is my fascination with interest rates, that r-star is an area I’ve researched\nextensively. If by the end of this speech you share just a tenth of my passion for r-star,\nI’ll feel like I’ve done my job!\n1 Consistent with this definition, my discussion will focus on the longer-term r-star that will prevail over the next decade,\nin contrast to a shorter-run concept that may fluctuate from year to year depending on economic developments.\nPage 2 of 11\n\nMy own view is that r-star today is around 0.5 percent. Assuming inflation is running\nat our goal of 2 percent, that means the typical, or normal short-term interest rate is\n2.5 percent.2 When put into a historical context, r-star stands at an incredibly low\nlevel—in fact, a full 2 percentage points below what a normal interest rate looked like\njust 20 years ago. This trend is not unique to the United States: Averaging across\nCanada, the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom, a measure of global r-star is a\nbit below 0.5 percent.3\nR-star matters a great deal, because it anchors where short-term interest rates will tend\nto be in the future. In a world of low r-star, policymakers, banks, businesses, and\nhouseholds all need to plan for lower interest rates than they’ve experienced in\ndecades past.\nRecently some economists and central bankers have pointed to signs that the fortunes\nof r-star are set to rise. I wish I could join in this optimism, but I don’t yet see\nconvincing evidence of such a shift. The longer-run drivers still point to a “new\nnormal” of a low r-star and relatively low interest rates.\n2 For comparison, the median longer-run value of the federal funds rate in the Federal Open Market Committee’s\n(FOMC’s) most recent economic projections is 2.875 percent (Board of Governors 2018b).\n3 Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017) and Fujiwara et al. (2016).\nPage 3 of 11\n\nWhat drives the fortunes of r-star?\nI’ve already mentioned that r-star is driven by longer-run structural factors, beyond\nthe influence of central banks. But what are those factors, and how do they influence\nthe fortunes of r-star?\nThree key global developments have caused r-star to come down in a number of\ndeveloped economies over the past two decades: changes in demographics, a\nslowdown in productivity growth, and heightened demand for safe assets.4\nChanges in demographics affect r-star on a number of levels. We are living longer:\nOver the past three decades, life expectancy in developed economies has risen by\nnearly five years and is expected to keep rising.5 When people expect to live longer,\nthey tend to save more for retirement, and this increased saving puts downward\npressure on interest rates.6\nDespite the fact that we’re living longer, labor force growth in the United States has\nactually slowed, largely due to baby boomers retiring and a lower fertility rate. In fact,\nthe labor force is forecast to grow just ½ percent per year over the next decade, well\nbelow past trends.7 Fewer people joining the labor force means fewer people working,\nproducing, and consuming things, which leads to slower growth and less investment,\nwhich in turn drives r-star down.\nThe same thing is true of productivity growth, which has also slowed compared with\nearlier decades.8 In the 1990s and early 2000s, the explosion of the internet and\n4 See Williams (2016, 2017) and references therein.\n5 Data are from the United Nations (2017).\n6 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2016) and Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2016).\n7 Congressional Budget Office (2018).\n8 Fernald (2016).\nPage 4 of 11\n\ncomputing power led to annual productivity gains averaging 2 to 3 percent.\nProductivity gains since the recession have generally hovered around 1 percent. I have\na sneaking suspicion it’s because we’re using all that technology to play Candy Crush,\ninstead of increasing productivity! But I don’t have the data to back that up.\nIn all seriousness, productivity growth is influenced by technological innovation,\nwhich is notoriously hard to predict. In my home state of California, the world\nappears to be reinvented every week, but if we look at data from the OECD, there’s\nno indication that we can expect a leap in productivity growth on an international\nscale. While I can hope we’re on the brink of another game-changing invention like the\ninternet, for the moment, the data indicate productivity growth is still stuck in low\ngear.\nThe third and final factor holding down r-star is the high global demand for safe\nassets we’ve seen develop over the past two decades. This has driven down the\nreturns on Treasury securities and safe short-term loans relative to those on riskier\nassets like corporate bonds and equities, and thereby depressed r-star.9\nA positive outlook\nAll this doom and gloom caused by demographics, productivity growth, and the\ndemand for safe assets may come as a surprise. We’re now in the second-longest\nexpansion in U.S. history, and like most people I feel very positive about the\neconomic outlook, here and abroad.\n9 Bernanke (2015) and Del Negro et al. (2017).\nPage 5 of 11\n\nU.S. GDP increased about 2.5 percent last year, the unemployment rate is the lowest\nwe’ve seen in 18 years, and inflation is nearing the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nThe latest inflation data show that the drop in inflation we saw in 2017 was\ntemporary. It is very reassuring to me, as I spent the latter part of last year making\npredictions that inflation would start to rise this year. And it’s always a relief when one\nof your predictions comes true!\nLooking ahead, I expect the expansion to continue, with growth averaging around 2.5\npercent over this year and the next.\nThere are a few tailwinds that account for this solid economic performance. These\ninclude strong financial conditions, solid global growth, and the fiscal stimulus. In\nfact, the International Monetary Fund recently reported that global growth registered\nan impressive 3.8 percent in 2017, and they expect it to be near 4 percent this year and\nnext.10\nThe optimism about r-star is (sadly) misplaced\nIt’s these strong tailwinds that are leading some people to believe that we’ll see r-star\nmove back up. But, as I said, this optimism is, sadly, misplaced.\nIt’s time to return to our trio of demographics, productivity growth, and the global\ndemand for safe assets.\n10 International Monetary Fund (2018).\nPage 6 of 11\n\nWhen it comes to demographics, the thing I hear discussed is that the baby boomer\ngeneration is a peculiarity that will slowly work its way out of the data. That’s a polite\nway of saying that, once my generation has retired, labor force growth will return to\nthe speed of recent decades. But research by my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed\nreveals that our increased longevity and propensity to save are the key demographic\ndrivers keeping r-star low, and they’re not about to reverse.11\nPeople living longer and saving more are two trends I would like to see continue! But\nthey do both spell bad news for the fortunes of r-star.\nThe second thing I hear discussed is that there’s more cause for optimism around\nproductivity growth because of the fiscal stimulus and, more specifically, the tax cuts.\nIn principle, if businesses have a smaller tax burden, they’ll have a greater incentive to\ninvest in capital equipment and research and development, which will drive\nproductivity growth.\nAlthough I agree that lower tax rates on businesses should spur greater investment\nand productivity, the resulting effect on r-star is likely to be relatively modest. By my\nown calculations, we can expect the fiscal stimulus to increase r-star over the next\ndecade by no more than 0.25 percentage point. This modest effect is in part because\nthe tax cuts are front-loaded—that is, they have a larger effect on growth in the next\nfew years than in later ones.12\nIn addition, it’s important to remember that r-star is affected by global economic\nconditions and not just those in the United States. A bump in U.S. growth improves\n11 Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio (2017).\n12 Mertens (2018).\nPage 7 of 11\n\nglobal growth, but if other countries don’t follow suit, the effect on r-star will be\nrelatively modest.\nThe third leading factor in terms of a rising r-star is the demand for safe assets. The\ntheoretical argument that, with such strong economic conditions, we should see the\nappetite for riskier investments increase, pushing up interest rates overall, makes\nsense. But that’s not what’s played out in the data, at least so far.\nThese three issues—demographics, productivity growth, and the demand for safe\nassets—all point to an r-star that’s set to hold its position low in the sky for quite\nsome time.\nMonetary policy\nIf you’re not as passionate as I am about r-star at this point, listen up, because things\nare about to get more interesting. I’m going to discuss what all this means for\nmonetary policy and the path of interest rates.\nFollowing the global financial crisis, the Fed cut interest rates and kept them low to\nstimulate the economy and get it back on its feet. Now that the expansion is well\nunder way, we’re in the process of normalizing monetary policy and bringing interest\nrates back up. Based on the center of the distribution of projections from our March\nmeeting, the Federal Open Market Committee has indicated a total of three to four\nPage 8 of 11\n\nrate increases this year and further gradual rate increases over the next two years will\nbe appropriate.13 I view this to be the right direction for monetary policy.\nAt our most recent meeting at the beginning of May we decided not to change the\nfederal funds rate, consistent with our gradual pace of policy normalization.14\nBut even as we raise rates, I’m conscious that the fundamental drivers that govern r-\nstar are lower than we’ve seen in the past. With a new normal for short-term rates of\naround 2½ percent, interest rates are likely to remain low relative to historical\nexperience.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it’s important to distinguish between the current strong economic\nconditions and the key longer-run drivers underpinning interest rates. I am always\nkeeping a close eye on both the short-term economic outlook and the longer-term\nfactors that define the more fundamental changes taking place. I don’t have a crystal\nball, so it’s always the numbers that inform my opinion. For the moment, r-star\ncontinues to shine brightly, guiding monetary policy, but hold steady, low on the\nhorizon.\n13 Board of Governors (2018b).\n14 Board of Governors (2018a)\nPage 9 of 11\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 2015. “Why Are Interest Rates So Low, Part 3: The Global Savings Glut.” Ben\nBernanke’s Blog, Brookings, April 1. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-\nbernanke/2015/04/01/why-are-interest-rates-so-low-part-3-the-global-savings-glut/\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018a. “Federal Reserve issues FOMC\nstatement.” Press release, May 2.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180502a.htm\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018b. “FOMC Projections materials,\naccessible version.” March 21.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20180321.htm\nCarvalho, Carlos, Andrea Ferrero, and Fernanda Nechio. 2016. “Demographics and Real Interest\nRates: Inspecting the Mechanism.” European Economic Review 88, pp. 208–226.\nCarvalho, Carlos, Andrea Ferrero, and Fernanda Nechio. 2017. “Demographic Transition and Low\nU.S. Interest Rates.” FRBSF Economic Letter 2017-27 (September 25).\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2017/september/demographic-transition-and-low-us-interest-rates/\nCongressional Budget Office. 2018. “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028.” Report,\nApril. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53651\nDel Negro, Marco, Domenico Giannone, Marc P.

    "text": "Presentation to the SPUR Business Breakfast Series\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on April 4, 2012\nPresident Williams presented similar remarks to the University of San Diego School of Business\nAdministration in San Diego, California, on April 3, 2012.\nMonetary Policy and the Slow Recovery: It’s Not Just About Housing\nThank you. It’s a particular pleasure to be with you this morning. We live in a rapidly\nchanging and ever-more-competitive global economy. It’s vital that every region understand and\nleverage its special attributes and competitive advantages. SPUR has long been on the forefront\nof thinking about these questions for San Francisco. We’re very lucky to have such a far-sighted\ngroup working to keep our city successful.\nOf course, it’s not possible to make sense of what happens in the Bay Area without\nconsidering the larger economic environment in which we are situated. So this morning, I’m\ngoing to talk about that broader economic context. I’ll start with a look at the national economy,\nfocusing on why the recent recession was so severe and why the recovery has been relatively\nanemic. I’ll then talk about prospects for growth, employment, and inflation. Finally, I’ll\ndiscuss what the Federal Reserve is doing to bolster the recovery. My remarks represent my own\nviews and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me begin by saying that I’m encouraged by recent signs of a stronger, self-sustaining\nrecovery. I’m especially glad to see that the economy is adding jobs at a pretty decent clip. Still,\nwe have a long way to go. The Fed’s mandate from Congress is to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices.1 Inflation generally has been subdued over the past few years.\n1 Williams (2012b).\n1\n\nBut, more than four years after the recession began, the unemployment rate is still 8.3 percent,\nleaving us far short of our employment goal. The Fed has acted vigorously to boost the\neconomy. It’s critical that we keep doing so in order to achieve our statutory mandate.\nI’d like to start with a little bit of history. We are in the aftermath of the worst financial\ncrisis and economic downturn since the Great Depression. The downturn came in the wake of an\nunprecedented run-up in housing prices, followed by a traumatic collapse. Although the\nrecession started with this burst housing bubble, the economy’s problems over the past few years\nhave extended well beyond housing. In the broad sense, what we’ve seen has been a sharp fall in\nhousehold and business demand for goods and services. That has caused the economy to\nperform well below its potential.\nLet’s look at this in more detail. The housing boom was a classic financial bubble, fueled\nby speculative excess. Buyers kept bidding up prices, convinced they could sell for more than\nthey paid. Lenders enabled this behavior by offering excessively easy terms. The growth in\nhouse prices outstripped anything that could be supported by market fundamentals, such as\nhousehold incomes or rental rates on comparable properties.\nThe inevitable crash landed with a resounding thud. Beginning in 2006, home prices\nplummeted. Eventually they fell by about a third nationally. About a quarter of borrowers found\nthemselves under water, owing more than their homes were worth. Large chunks of the wealth\nof tens of millions of Americans vanished. Overall, the destruction of net worth from housing\nequaled more than 40 percent of the value of annual U.S. production.\nWhen wealth is destroyed on such a vast scale, the economic effects are severe. During\nthe boom, higher house prices helped fuel consumption as people tapped home equity to buy\ncars, boats, vacations, and the like. When house prices did a U-turn, households hunkered down.\n2\n\nThey cut spending and salted away more savings to rebuild lost wealth. And that wasn’t the\nhousing bust’s only depressing effect. By early 2009, home construction had plunged by over 75\npercent from its 2006 high. It’s remained near historical lows since. That’s put a lid on demand\nfor construction materials and home furnishings. And it’s kept millions of carpenters, plumbers,\nand others in construction and real estate out of work.\nIt’s impossible to understand the economy of the past few years without taking into\naccount these housing effects.2 Consider the difference in economic performance between states\nhit hard by the housing bust and states that got off relatively lightly. Figure 1 shows price\ndeclines by state. The hardest hit states, including Nevada, Arizona, California, and Florida, are\nshown in red. Prices in these states plunged by 40 percent or more from their peaks. By\ncontrast, the states shown in green posted price declines of less than 15 percent. In one green\nstate, North Dakota, prices actually increased.\nFigure 2 shows the drop in employment during the downturn by state, using the same\ncolor coding as Figure 1. For example, in the hard-hit states, shown in red here, employment fell\nby 8 percent or more. The overlap with the pattern of house price declines is striking. The states\nwhere home prices fell most were generally among those that suffered the worst job losses\nduring the recession. In states where prices fell less, employment declined less.3\nTo be sure, this overlap was not perfect. Employment fell in all but North Dakota and\nAlaska, with sharp declines registered even in some states where the housing bust wasn’t harsh.\nExamples include Indiana, Ohio, and South Carolina. One reason this happened is the tight web\nthat binds economic activity in far-flung places in the modern world.4 When under water\n2 See, for example, Mian and Sufi (2011), Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011), and Feroli et al. (2012).\n3 Williams (2012a).\n4 Mian and Sufi (2011).\n3\n\nhomeowners in the Central Valley put off buying new cars, auto workers in Indiana may lose\ntheir jobs.\nBut, what is fascinating, and perhaps surprising, is this: The close relationship between\nthe fall in home prices and state economic activity has largely disappeared during the recovery.5\nFigure 3 shows state employment gains during the rebound. There’s almost no systematic\nrelationship between employment growth and home price declines.\nFigure 4 reinforces this. The blue line measures the gap in employment growth rates\nbetween states where the job market has been relatively stronger and states where it has been\nweaker. This gap grew sharply during the recession, reflecting in part the uneven effects of the\nhousing bust. But, during the recovery, the gap has been smaller than at any time since the mid-\n1970s. In other words, across the country, state-level employment growth has become quite\nbalanced.\nThese comparisons indicate that the economy faces obstacles that are national in scope.\nThe slow pace of expansion has affected all regions of the country. During the recovery, states\nwhere house price declines have been relatively mild have not done noticeably better than states\nwhere housing got hammered. Powerful forces have kept us stuck in a slow-growth pattern.\nSome of those forces reflect the direct effects of the housing collapse on household finances.\nThe connection with housing is less direct for other forces holding back the economy. I’ll\nhighlight three of those forces: tight credit, uncertainty, and government contraction.\nTight credit was clearly a product of the housing bust. But it took on a life of its own\nwhen fallout from housing almost brought down the global financial system in 2008. The\n5 Williams (2012a).\n4\n\nrepercussions of those dramatic events still affect markets today. Let me explain how this played\nout.\nWhen home prices crashed, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures surged. Exposure\nto risky U.S. subprime mortgages was spread globally through investments held by financial\ninstitutions. Those mortgages had been repackaged to create financial instruments of mind-\nbending complexity. When the music stopped, it was hard to tell who was left with all those\ntoxic assets. Financial institutions became afraid to lend money to anybody, including other\nfinancial institutions. The result was a massive credit crunch that choked off the flow of funds\nfinancial institutions and nonfinancial businesses depend on for their day-to-day operations.\nMany financial institutions that had placed big bets on housing posted massive losses. Some of\nthem failed.\nThankfully, central banks and governments around the world stepped in to provide\nemergency loans and other support. Those interventions prevented complete financial collapse.\nIn the United States, the financial system has healed to a very considerable extent. The Fed\nrecently conducted a series of tests on the largest U.S. banks. We found that most of them would\nhave adequate capital even if the economy went through another extreme downturn.\nAs financial institutions have regained their footing, access to credit has improved.\nNevertheless, we haven’t returned to normal. Many small businesses and consumers still\nstruggle to get loans. For example, to get a mortgage, a borrower must have a top-notch credit\nrating and the cash to make a substantial down payment.\nUncertainty is a second factor holding back the recovery. Businesses, investors, and\nhouseholds remain skittish, even in the face of better economic news. Many of my business\ncontacts say they remain cautious about expanding because they’re unsure about future\n5\n\nconditions. Ordinary Americans worry about job prospects and future income. Everybody is\nunsettled by the highly charged political environment.\nFinancial turmoil in Europe has added another dimension to the unease here. The\nimminent threat of European financial meltdown has diminished. But the underlying problem of\ncountries with unsustainable debt has not been resolved. Over the next few years, the total debt\nload among countries that use the euro will grow larger. I’ve heard Europe’s policy described as\nkicking the can down the road. But the risk is that Europe might be rolling an ever-growing\nsnowball down a hill.\nGovernment cutbacks are a third obstacle to growth. Typically, government spending\nrises when the economy turns down. That’s because the cost of safety net programs, such as\nunemployment insurance, go up. And sometimes governments deliberately boost spending to\nstimulate the economy. But the federal government’s long-term budget problems loom large.\nAnd state and local government finances are reeling from the economic downturn. As a result,\ngovernment stimulus has been unusually limited.\nFigure 5 compares recent inflation-adjusted spending by state and local governments with\npast periods. The red line represents the most recent recession and recovery. The shaded region\nportrays the range of outcomes over the eight previous recessions and recoveries, with the\naverage displayed in black. During the current period, the housing bust has cut into the revenue\nof state and local governments, forcing them to slash spending.6 That contrasts with comparable\nperiods in the past, when such spending typically increased.\nI don’t see government spending turning around soon. Indeed, spending at the federal\nlevel is set to contract sharply at the end of this year as several temporary programs end. Some\n6 Feroli et al. (2012).\n6\n\nof those programs may be extended. But, overall, we can expect federal spending trends to\nweigh on near-term economic growth.\nHowever, things are getting better as far as tight credit and uncertainty are concerned.\nImprovements in credit, and rises in business and consumer confidence, have helped the\neconomy gain real traction. We can see the improvement in the data. Consumer spending hasn’t\nbeen growing fast, but it’s been growing steadily. Car sales have surged and nearly reached pre-\nrecession levels in February. The rebound in car sales and strong exports of other goods have\nhelped U.S. manufacturers create jobs at the fastest pace since the mid-1990s.\nReal gross domestic product measures the nation’s total output of goods and services\nadjusted for inflation. During the first half of 2011, real GDP expanded at just under a 1 percent\nannual rate. Then, in the second half, it shifted into higher gear, rising at nearly a 2½ percent\npace. My forecast calls for GDP growth to pick up further to about 2½ percent this year and 2¾\npercent in 2013. That’s not overdrive, but it does represent improvement.\nAs I said earlier, the news from the labor market has been heartening. The jobless rate\nhas fallen about three-quarters of a percentage point since August and is now at its lowest level\nin three years. Unfortunately, the kind of moderate economic growth I expect won’t sustain such\nrapid progress. The February unemployment rate held steady at 8.3 percent. I expect\nunemployment rates to remain around 8 percent through year-end. And we’re still likely to be\naround 7 percent at the end of 2014. We haven’t had such a long period of high unemployment\nin the United States since the Great Depression. And this phenomenon is widespread.\nCompared with December 2007, when the recession began, the unemployment rate is up in all 50\nstates. That’s true even in North Dakota and Alaska, the two states where total employment\ngrew during the recession.\n7\n\nEconomists have been debating why unemployment has been so high during this\nrecovery. Broadly speaking, they fall into two camps. One group argues that changes in the\nstructure of the economy are pushing up the unemployment rate. The other group maintains that\nhigh unemployment is the result of a severe downturn, which significantly cut demand for goods\nand services.\nThose who favor a structural explanation point out that many job seekers lack the skills\nemployers need. For example, computer industry employers are having a hard time finding\nqualified workers. But they’re not likely to find such employees in the ranks of jobless\nconstruction workers. If such labor market mismatches are widespread, they could be boosting\nthe unemployment rate.\nTo put this in perspective, I’m going to introduce the concept of the natural rate of\nunemployment. The natural rate is basically an equilibrium jobless rate that pushes inflation\nneither up, nor down. Before the recession, most economists thought this rate was around 5\npercent. Today though, economists in the structural camp argue that the natural rate has risen\nsubstantially, largely because of the labor market mismatches I described. The idea is that a lot\nof people are unemployed not because jobs are lacking, but because those jobs require skills\nunemployed workers don’t have. If this were correct, then our 8.3 percent unemployment rate\nmight not be that far above the natural unemployment rate. In other words, we might not really\nbe so far from the Fed’s goal of maximum sustainable employment.\nI’m not convinced. Research at the San Francisco and New York Feds suggests that job\nmismatches are limited in scope. The difficulty some Silicon Valley companies find hiring\nsoftware engineers is not enough to fundamentally transform the labor market. Now, other\nfactors besides skill mismatches may also have helped push up the natural unemployment rate.\n8\n\nOver the longer term, mismatches and other labor market inefficiencies may have raised the\nnatural unemployment rate from about 5 percent to around 6 to 6½ percent.7 So, in my view, the\nnation remains far from the Fed’s goal of maximum sustainable employment.\nThe Fed’s other goal is to keep prices stable. I would say that we’ve succeeded pretty\nwell on that score. Inflation overall has been well-contained. Taking a long view, over the past\n15 years, the overall inflation rate has averaged almost exactly 2 percent, which is the Fed’s\ntarget rate of inflation. The same is true of the past five years, a tumultuous period of crisis,\nrecession, and recovery.\nNow, it’s true that inflation picked up to 2½ percent last year as the prices of oil and other\ncommodities surged in the face of strong global demand. Oil prices have run up again recently\nin response to geopolitical concerns. But other commodity prices have not generally followed\nsuit. I expect inflation to be near our 2 percent target this year and edge down a bit to about 1½\npercent in 2013.\nLet me summarize where the Fed stands in terms of achieving its congressionally\nmandated goals. We are far below maximum employment and are likely to remain there for\nsome time. The housing bust and financial crisis set in motion an extraordinarily harsh\nrecession, which has held down consumer, businesses, and government spending. By contrast,\ninflation is contained and may even fall next year below our 2 percent target.\nUnder these circumstances, it’s essential that we keep strong monetary stimulus in place.\nThe recovery has been sluggish nationwide, not just in states hit hard by the housing bust. High\nunemployment, restrained demand, and idle production capacity are national in scope. These are\n7 See, for example, Daly et al. (2012) and Weidner and Williams (2011).\n9\n\njust the sorts of problems monetary policy can address. And we don’t need to worry that our\nstimulative monetary policy could fuel regional imbalances.\nMonetary policy works by raising and lowering interest rates. The Fed’s policymaking\nbody is the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. In December 2008, when the\nrecession’s full force hit, the FOMC slashed its benchmark interest rate close to zero. It’s been\nthere since. Standard monetary policy guidelines tell us this rate should have gone deep into\nnegative territory. But that’s not possible.8\nSo the Fed has had to find other ways to stimulate the economy. One measure we’ve\nadopted has been to buy large quantities of longer-term securities issued by the U.S. government\nand mortgage agencies. Our purchases have raised demand for these securities, lowering their\nyields. And that has put downward pressure on other longer-term interest rates, making it\ncheaper for households, businesses, and governments to borrow.\nThese policy actions have been effective. For example, recent gains in automobile sales\nhave a lot to do with cheap financing. And our securities purchases have helped drive longer-\nterm interest rates near to post-World War II lows. In particular, our purchases of mortgage-\nrelated securities appear to have lowered home loan rates significantly.9 Low mortgage rates\nhave been crucial in stabilizing home sales and construction.\nI should emphasize that our unusually stimulative monetary policy won’t last forever.\nEventually, as recovery picks up, we will trim our securities holdings and raise our interest rate\n8 See Rudebusch (2009) and Chung et al. (2012) for discussion of the effects of the zero bound on interest\nrate policy in the recession, and Swanson and Williams (2012) for estimates of the effects of constrained\nmonetary policy.\n9 Hancock and Passmore (2011) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) find significant effects\nof mortgage-backed securities purchases. Stroebel and Taylor (2009), by contrast, do not.\n10\n\ntarget. We’ve planned in detail for this, and we’re confident we can do it in a timely and\neffective fashion.10 But, that time is still well off in the future.\nWe’ve passed through extraordinary economic times that have required extraordinary\nresponses from the Fed. We’re not miracle workers. Lower interest rates alone can’t instantly\nput the economy right. But things would be much worse if we hadn’t acted so forcefully. We\nwere vigilant in 2008 and 2009 when the economy was in dire straits. We remain vigilant now,\nwhen the economy is showing real signs of improvement, sharply focused on our goals of\nmaximum sustainable employment and price stability.

    "text": "Presentation at U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, NY\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 26, 2016\nDiscussion of “Language after Liftoff: Fed Communication Away from the Zero Lower Bound”\nHistorically central bankers have been a taciturn lot, especially when it comes to the\nsubject of the future direction of monetary policy. This reluctance to opine on monetary policy\nhas changed dramatically over the past decade, to the point where some exasperated\ncommentators exclaim they wish central bankers would just be quiet! An important aspect of this\nnew openness is “forward guidance,” that is, central banks’ efforts to describe the likely future\ndirection of monetary policy through words or policy projections. The Feroli et al. (2016) paper\nreexamines the roles and effects of Federal Reserve forward guidance and draws a number of\nconclusions and policy prescriptions for the use of forward guidance in the future. I should note\nthat my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal\nReserve System.\nTheir paper evaluates the Fed’s use of forward guidance from a number of perspectives:\neconomic theory, empirical evidence, and assessments from market participants. Although it is\nimpossible to do justice to all aspects of a 90-plus page paper in a few sentences, a few key\ntakeaways stand out.\nFirst, they conclude that time-based forward guidance is generally a bad idea, especially\nwhen policy is not constrained by the lower bound on interest rates. They argue that it is\ninconsistent with the profession’s understanding that best-practice monetary policy reacts to\n\nchanging economic conditions. It may also artificially reduce uncertainty about future policy,\nleading to excessive risk-taking and risks to financial stability. And it potentially locks in policy\ndecisions in advance, restricting freedom to react to changing circumstances.\nSecond, they conclude that well-designed data-based forward guidance can be a useful\ntool to help guide the public’s understanding of the central bank’s reaction function. They make\na number of suggestions of how the Federal Reserve—and, presumably, other central banks—\ncould improve their communication toward that end by emphasizing the data dependency of\npolicy decisions and the resulting uncertainty about the future path of policy.\nThird, they present empirical evidence regarding the effects of various types of forward\nguidance and relate these findings to the desirable characteristics of monetary policy. This is\nwhere the rubber hits the road in terms of the debates about the costs and benefits of forward\nguidance in its various guises. I will devote the bulk of my comments to aspects of the evidence\nand present some new results of my own.\nIn considering the empirical evidence on the effects of forward guidance, one is\nimmediately confronted by the quandary that, in our standard textbook theories, forward\nguidance is superfluous and should leave no imprint on the data. Under rational expectations and\ncomplete knowledge, the public already knows everything they need to about monetary policy\nand make decisions accordingly. They don’t need to read policy statements or listen to press\nconferences or speeches.\nTo think that policy guidance matters, you need to relax some assumptions about the\npublic’s information set. For example, they may not possess a complete understanding of the\npolicy regime, as in Rudebusch and Williams (2008), or there may be a break in the regime that\n\nthe public is unaware of, or the central bank may be trying to reinforce commitment to a strategy,\nas in Woodford (2013). These issues are likely to be particularly salient when policy is\nconstrained by the lower bound on interest rates and data dependency in policy actions is\ncurtailed.1\nThus, any discussion about the costs and benefits of forward guidance must take place in\nthe context of the situation in which it is being used. This brings me to my first case study, the\nFed’s use of explicit time-based guidance starting on August 9, 2011. Despite extraordinary\nmonetary stimulus—over 2½ years of near-zero short-term interest rates and QE1 and QE2—the\nunemployment rate had come down only 1 percentage point from its recession peak, to 9 percent,\nand the economic recovery remained tepid. Given the weakness in the economy, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) repeatedly stated that it intended to keep rates exceptionally\nlow “for an extended period.” Nonetheless, public expectations were glued to the idea that the\nFed would start to raise rates in about a year (Figure 1).\nIt was against that backdrop that the FOMC decided to take dramatic action to shift\npublic expectations using time-based forward guidance. The August 2011 FOMC statement said\n“The Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of resource\nutilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant\nexceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.”2 Three comments\nare in order. First, this statement, as well as subsequent FOMC statements that used forward\nguidance, clearly put the economic outlook front and center as the determinant of policy. The\noutlook defines the guidance. Second, it was the lower bound that tied the hands of\npolicymakers, not the introduction of date-based guidance. Third, this action was taken after\n1 See Williams (2006), Woodford (2013), and Swanson and Williams (2014a, b).\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011).\n\nweighing the concerns around the costs of time-based guidance discussed in Feroli et al. (2016);\nthe conclusion then was that the benefits from stimulating the economy outweighed the potential\ncost.\nThe evidence bears out this judgment. The issuance of the statement dramatically shifted\npublic expectations of future Fed policy. This is seen in private economists’ forecasts of the\nlength of time until the Fed would raise rates, which jumped following the statement (Figure 1).\nCompared to the gentle taps of the hammer of previous FOMC verbal guidance that appeared to\nhave little effect on expectations, the time-based guidance was like a sledgehammer.\nThe impact of the introduction of time-based guidance is also seen in the Treasury\nmarket, where the yield on a 2-year Treasury note dropped by 10 basis points after the\nannouncement (Figure 2). Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell by over 20 basis points. A\nsimilar pattern is seen after the FOMC extended the date-based guidance in January and\nSeptember of 2012 (Figure 2). Clearly, time-based forward guidance proved a powerful tool at a\ntime when the FOMC wanted to shift public expectations of future policy. That said, it also\nproved a very blunt instrument in that all the conditioning statements and caveats around the\nguidance tended to get drowned out in favor of the date itself. With the work of shifting\nexpectations done, the FOMC moved to more data-based guidance in December 2012.\nThe lesson I draw from this experience is that the usefulness of explicit time-based\nforward guidance depends critically on the circumstances at hand. Therefore, one cannot\novergeneralize to say it is “good” or “bad.” Although I do not see explicit forward guidance of\n\nthis type as being beneficial away from the lower bound, it has definitely proven its value in case\nwe find ourselves again constrained by the lower bound and in a similar predicament.3\nSo far I have been talking about the benefits of forward guidance. What about the costs?\nFeroli et al. (2016) enumerate various potential costs, but I will focus on the one for which we\nhave the most evidence: the effect of forward guidance on market behavior regarding\nexpectations of future interest rates. They claim that time-based forward guidance artificially\ndampens the public’s perceptions of future volatility in policy rates and makes expectations of\nfuture rates less sensitive to news. In other words, it creates excessive certainty about the future\npath of rates relative to what is implied by truly data-dependent policy. Whether this reduction in\nvolatility is a good thing or a bad thing when rates are constrained by the lower bound is an open\nquestion I’ll leave aside. Instead, I’ll focus on the empirical evidence regarding the effects of\nguidance on market behavior.\nThe authors’ theory that time-based guidance causes these market phenomena faces a\nthorny identification problem because the presence of the lower bound by itself will tend to mute\nperceptions of volatility of future interest rates and bond rate responsiveness to news.4 And, most\nuses of forward guidance have occurred when policy is constrained by the lower bound. Thus,\nthe dilemma: If we see evidence of depressed responsiveness to news, is it because of the lower\nbound or because of forward guidance?\nThe authors aim to distinguish between these alternative explanations in two ways. First,\nthe Fed used forward guidance in the early 2000s when the funds rate was well above zero, so\n3 See Williams (2013b).\n4 See Swanson and Williams (2014a, b) for a lengthy discussion of this issue.\n\nthat provides some independent variation in the data.5 Second, they try to get additional variation\nin the data by distinguishing between different types of guidance over time. Using these\napproaches, they find that time-based forward guidance depressed bond market responsiveness to\nnews and implied volatility, beyond what would occur owing to the lower bound.\nI am not convinced by this evidence. First, the confidence bands on these estimates,\nalthough not reported in the paper, must be wide. Second, in practice it’s hard to make clear\ndistinctions between types of guidance and such attempts are subject to considerable judgment\nand measurement error. Of course, the FOMC hasn’t made this any easier, tending to mix data-\nand date-based guidance together. For this analysis to be more convincing, one needs more data.\nFortunately, we do have more data if we look at the international evidence. The Federal\nReserve is not the only country to have been constrained at the lower bound and used forward\nguidance. The Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, the European Central Bank\n(ECB), and others have used various forms of forward guidance at different times while at the\nlower bound.6 Comparing their experiences to the Fed’s provides independent information on the\nconnections between forward guidance, the lower bound, and market behavior.\nConsider the cases of the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the ECB. The U.S.\nand U.K. examples are particularly interesting because both countries reached the lower bound at\nabout the same time and had been expected to exit the lower bound in 2015 or 2016. The big\ndifference between the two is that the Fed has employed a variety of types of forward guidance\nsince 2008—including explicit date-based guidance, and issuing interest rate projections starting\nin 2012 (the “dot plots”)—while the Bank of England came to use forward guidance late in the\n5 See Rudebusch and Williams (2008) for a detailed discussion of the FOMC’s use of forward guidance before the\nfinancial crisis.\n6 See Carney (2012), Bank of England (2016), European Central Bank (2014), and Shirai (2013).\n\ngame in 2013 and has made limited use of forward guidance since 2014.7 Therefore, if forward\nguidance on its own has a big effect, we should see a sizable difference between market behavior\nin the U.S. and U.K.\nI look at two pieces of evidence regarding public expectations of future policy rates,\nfollowing the methodology of Swanson and Williams (2014a, b). First, I examine how the\nresponse of the yield on a zero-coupon two-year government bond to economic news changes\nover time in each country. Second, I look at the perceived volatility of short-term interest rates\nimplied by options on 12-month-ahead short-term interest rates in the U.S. and U.K.\nThe first finding is that, despite significant differences in forward guidance in the U.S.\nand U.K., bond market responsiveness to news has been very similar in the two countries since\n2012 (Figures 3 and 4). Although not shown here, the same pattern is evident in one-year yields.\nThis similarity in the face of different policies is reinforced by the evidence from implied\nvolatility of future short-term rates: There is no discernible difference in the pattern in market\nperceptions of future variability in short-term interest rates between the two countries (Figure 5).\nThe second finding is that both countries have seen a sizable increase in market\nresponsiveness and implied volatility over the past year as expectations of liftoff came nearer.\nAlthough these measures are still somewhat below their respective historical norms, the return to\ndata dependence in market behavior is clear.8 The differences in forward guidance across these\ntwo countries is exerting no discernible imprint on these measures of market behavior across the\ntwo economies.\n7 The Bank of England’s main two uses of forward guidance were the introduction of a short-lived 7 percent\nunemployment threshold in August 2013, and the replacement of that in February 2014 with a description of the\nlikely eventual rise in rates as “gradual.”\n8 The “normal” level shown in each figure refers to a benchmark period in which the zero bound was not a concern\nfor that country.\n\nFinally, market responsiveness to news remains very low in Germany, reflecting\nexpectations of being stuck at the lower bound for quite some time (Figure 6). In this regard, the\nECB provides another interesting example in that their use of forward guidance has been limited\nto saying since July 2013 that it “expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower\nlevels for an extended period of time.”9 Nonetheless, market responses to news are negligible,\nand there is no evidence of a return to data dependency in market behavior, unlike in the U.S.\nand U.K.\nTaken together, this international evidence suggests that being stuck at the lower bound is\nthe primary driver of the muted responsiveness of the bond market to news and implied volatility\nof future short-term rates. Although forward guidance undoubtedly can affect market\nexpectations of future policy, it appears to do so by affecting expectations of being constrained\nby the lower bound, rather than the behavior of rates away from the lower bound.\nIn conclusion, we have learned a lot from the experience of forward guidance, both in the\nUnited States and across the globe. One practical lesson is that it is most effective when it’s both\nsimple and explicit. Vague hints about future policy seem to be ineffective. Although it’s\nunderstandable to want to communicate a comprehensive view of monetary policy with all of its\nincumbent uncertainties, the public has only so much bandwidth dedicated to central bank\nmessaging. Intricate and conditional messages tend to be ignored as well. So, like a\nsledgehammer, strongly worded forward guidance can be a powerful tool when it’s needed. But,\nlike a sledgehammer, care needs to be taken when and where it is used.\n9 See European Central Bank (2014) for further discussion of the ECB’s use of forward guidance.\n\nReferences\nBank of England. 2016. “Forward Guidance.” Bank of England website.\nhttp://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pages/forwardguidance.aspx\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2011. “Press Release.” August 9.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110809a.htm\nCarney, Mark. 2012. “Guidance.” Remarks to the CFA Society Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, December 11.\nhttp://www.bankofcanada.ca/2012/12/guidance/\nEuropean Central Bank. 2014. “The ECB’s Forward Guidance.” ECB Monthly Bulletin, April, pp. 65–73.\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/mobu/mb201404en.pdf\nFeroli, Michael, David Greenlaw, Peter Hooper, Frederic Mishkin, and Amir Sufi. 2016. “Language after\nLiftoff: Fed Communication Away from the Zero Lower Bound.” Paper prepared for the 2016 U.S.\nMonetary Policy Forum, February 26.\nRudebusch, Glenn D., and John C.

    "text": "Welcoming Remarks to the Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on September 9, 2011\nRisk Management and Macroprudential Supervisory Policies\nWelcome to the San Francisco Fed and our beautiful city by the Bay. I want to extend a\nspecial greeting to those of you who have come all the way from Asia to join us. I’m sorry that\nother commitments kept me from joining you yesterday. I’m sure though that Mohamed El-\nErian’s keynote address set a strong tone for this conference, which is convening at a time of\nheightened financial uncertainty around the world.\nThis is the San Francisco Fed’s fifth Asian Banking Conference & Symposium. These\nevents are designed to encourage conversation and dialog. Our aim is to provide a forum for a\nwide range of opinions and to promote the cross-fertilization of ideas by taking advantage of the\ndiversity represented here. Conference participants include financial professionals, financial\ninstitution supervisors, consultants, and academics from the United States and Asia. The varied\nviews represented here are particularly helpful to those of us in the Federal Reserve System as\nwe weigh supervisory and monetary policy decisions. Taking part in the debates and discussion\nat these conferences sharpens our own sense of the issues and helps us make better policy\ndecisions.\nThese events are also valuable because they provide opportunities for regulators and\nbanking industry leaders to talk in a neutral setting outside the supervisory framework. In that\nway, the conference can foster the kind of give-and-take on vital financial and policy issues that\ncan’t be duplicated within the supervisory relationship itself. The global financial system is\n1\n\nexperiencing great stress as it adapts to the new, post-crisis rules of the game. Those new rules\nare both explicit and implicit. They call for more capital, reduced leverage, lower risk appetites,\nmore thorough supervision, and stronger regulation, at both the systemic and individual\ninstitution levels. In this environment, open dialog is all the more important as we collectively\nreach a common understanding of how the new rules should work in practice.\nThis year’s symposium focuses on risk management in a financial and regulatory\nlandscape transformed by crisis. All of us have been busy digesting the lessons of the crisis of\n2007–09. The challenge we now face is to make sure the global financial system is strong\nenough to weather periods of extreme stress and volatility. On both the public and private-sector\nside, we have much work to do to restore confidence in the financial system and reassure the\npublic that financial crises can be contained.\nLet me take a few minutes to outline some key supervisory policy challenges related to\ntoday’s more robust enhanced prudential supervision standards. Yesterday you discussed the\nevolution of regulation in Asia. Of course, Asia is one of the world’s most rapidly growing\nfinancial markets. Like the United States, it needs regulatory policies that keep up with rapid\nchanges in bank practices and financial markets.\nGlobally, one of the more contentious areas of regulation concerns new proposed capital\nrequirements aimed at containing systemic financial risk. The key rules in this area apply to\nsystemically important financial institutions—SIFIs— whose failure could harm the broader\neconomy. For these institutions, we must set capital requirements high enough to ensure that\nfailure is extremely unlikely while still allowing enough leverage for banks to provide reasonable\nreturns to shareholders. Another reason for this “SIFI surcharge” is to eliminate the advantage\n2\n\nsuch institutions enjoy in their funding costs by being perceived as too big to fail. The surcharge\nmakes the playing field between SIFIs and smaller organizations more even. And it provides\ndisincentives for firms to become extremely large, increasing their systemic footprint.\nNonetheless, setting an appropriate surcharge is a tough balancing act and these standards are\nsure to provoke pointed discussion on the part of bankers and supervisors alike.\nLet’s look at this issue more deeply. How will SIFI managements adjust their business\nmodels in the face of higher capital requirements? Either expectations will shift regarding\nappropriate levels of risk and reward, or business practices will change in ways that\naccommodate the additional capital charge. For their part, supervisors will have to judge\nwhether such changes are consistent with microprudential standards of safety and soundness for\nindividual institutions and macroprudential standards for containing systemic risk.\nRelated to these matters is the question of the economic effects of heightened risk\nmanagement standards and higher capital and liquidity requirements. Although we have\nthousands of banking organizations in the United States, the U.S. banking sector is highly\nconcentrated in a small group of large and complex financial institutions. As a central banker, I\nam keenly interested in the potential economic impact of regulatory policy and supervisory\nactions. Will lower risk tolerance and higher capital and liquidity requirements for SIFIs slow\neconomic growth? How do we balance any such lost growth against the economic damage of a\nfinancial crisis? We know economic activity is hurt when credit is hard to get. To what extent\nwill the new rules of the game make credit less available, especially from SIFIs? Will any\npossible declines in SIFI lending be offset by financing from other sources? The Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision has concluded that the expected long-term economic impact\nof stronger capital and liquidity requirements will be relatively small due to the lengthy phase-in\n3\n\nperiod and the continuation of current return-on-equity expectations.1 Still, many variables could\npotentially alter this outcome, and further analysis is needed to sort out the economic\ncrosscurrents stemming from the forthcoming stricter risk management standards.\nManaging systemic financial risk is a challenge of the first order for regulators. By their\nvery nature, the decisions we make as macroprudential supervisors will be hard to get right. I\nhave a great deal of confidence in the experience, judgment, and talent of our supervisors.\nNonetheless, systemic supervision is a new endeavor that requires new ways of thinking, new\nforms of analysis, and new supervisory practices. We will have to make judgments and take\naction to head off systemic events that are very difficult to see in advance. Bank regulators and\neconomists around the world are working hard on this problem and some promising analytical\ntools are being developed. For example, regulators are looking at how to determine at what point\nexcess credit flows and relaxed underwriting standards become dangerous. Still, decisions\nresulting from this macroprudential supervisory framework will be based in part on preventing\nfuture events that are inherently uncertain. These decisions will probably be met with criticism\nnot only from the industry, but also from political, business, investor, and consumer quarters.\nAnd this process will have effects that won’t be fenced off in a single country. With today’s\ninterconnected global markets, macroprudential supervisory action in the United States will have\nrepercussions in financial markets around the world.\nI’m convinced that timely communication about these policies and practices is critical if\nwe are to get things right. We must explain to the financial sector and the public in clear\nlanguage when we believe an unsafe situation is developing and how it could potentially lead to\na crisis. This implies speaking plainly about the economic costs and benefits of macroprudential\n1See Bank for International Settlements (2010).\n4\n\nsupervision. We now know the extraordinary cost of allowing residential real estate\nunderwriting standards to get too loose during the housing boom years. But the steps taken to\ntighten lending standards also have a cost. Some borrowers can’t qualify for loans, which is one\nof the factors reducing demand for housing and holding down house prices. It’s important to talk\nabout both sides of the coin—the threat represented by a buildup of systemic risk and the cost of\npolicies and practices that contain that risk. The challenge is to design a regime of\nmacroprudential supervision that maintains financial stability and maximizes long-term\neconomic growth.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to working with other financial supervisory agencies\nin the new Financial Stability Oversight Council and with the financial industry to make the\nmacroprudential regime successful. Discussions and dialog at symposiums such as this are part\nof the process of building a new supervisory approach. This is a new endeavor and we need you\nto be actively engaged in thinking, talking, and writing about the issues raised by our efforts to\nstabilize the financial system. So, as you take part in the discussions here, know that you are\ncontributing to the development of a better system of supervision. I am sure that the expertise\nand talent in this room will contribute to that effort. I hope you that you find your time here to\nbe informative and stimulating, and I hope that it helps you advance risk management disciplines\nat your institutions. Thank you very much.\nReference\nBank for International Settlements. 2010. “An Assessment of the Long-Term Economic Impact of\nStronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements.” Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, August.\nhttp://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs173.pdf\n5",

    "text": "Presentation to the Sonoma County Economic Development Board\nRohnert Park, California\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on June 28, 2013\nThe Economic Recovery: Past, Present, and Future1\nThank you. Given the size of the Federal Reserve district that I represent, I often travel\nquite a ways to give speeches. So it’s nice to be in a familiar place closer to home. Sonoma\nCounty is renowned for its natural beauty, and my family and I have visited often over the years.\nWith all its natural charms, it’s sometimes forgotten that the county also has a vibrant economy,\nled by agriculture and tourism. So I’m delighted to be with you.\nMy subject today is the nation’s economy and the steps the Federal Reserve has taken to\nbolster the recovery. I’ll start with a review of the state of the national economy. I’ll then offer\nmy forecast, which envisions economic growth moving into higher gear thanks to growing\nmomentum in the private sector. And I’ll close with a review of how the Fed is pursuing its\ncongressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. I should stress that\nmy remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nOur economy is well into a period of sustained growth. It’s now been four years since the\nrecession ended. Recessions are never pleasant, but this one was especially grim. Think back\nfour years to June 2009. The housing market had collapsed. The unemployment rate stood at\n1 I want to thank Bharat Trehan and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n9.5 percent and was still rising. Consumers and businesses were deeply shaken. And the stock\nmarket had plunged nearly 40 percent.\nThankfully, we’ve come a long way since then. From a peak of 10 percent, the\nunemployment rate has dropped to 7.6 percent. Households and businesses have regained much\nof their lost confidence. And finally, the housing market is springing back to life.\nAlthough things have improved quite a bit, the economy has not rebounded from this\nrecession as fast as we hoped. Growth has proceeded in fits and starts, and the overall pace of\nrecovery has been moderate at best. Let me put the recent recession and recovery in historical\ncontext. Figure 1 illustrates this in terms of gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the\nnation’s total output of goods and services. The solid red line shows that real GDP per person,\nwhich is GDP adjusted for both inflation and population growth, had fallen a little over 5 percent\nby the second year of the recession, an extremely sharp drop by historical standards. Five years\nafter the recession’s onset, real GDP per person had still not returned to where it had been before\nthe recession.\nI can put this in perspective by comparing the recovery with data from recessions and\nrecoveries in 17 advanced economies over the past century and a half. In the figure, the solid\nblack line shows a projection based on this data of the average path real GDP per person takes in\nrecessions and recoveries.2 Ninety-five percent of the time, GDP lies within the shaded region\nshown in the figure. As you can see, the most recent U.S. recession was one of the worst. To a\nconsiderable extent, that was because we went through a financial crisis of historic proportions.\n2 Staff calculations based on model in Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011).\n2\n\nResearch has shown that, when a financial crisis hits, the accompanying downturn tends to be\nunusually harsh. So the sharp plunge in GDP during the first two years of the recession may not\nbe that surprising.\nThe surprise, it turns out, is the strength of the subsequent recovery. Now you may not\nassociate the word “strength” with this recovery. So let me explain. Figure 2 adds to Figure 1 a\nforecast of real GDP per person for the five years following the start of the recession. This\nforecast, shown as the dashed red line, is based on an economic model that aims to describe past\nrecessions and recoveries based on a few key factors.3 According to the model, the enormous\nboom in private-sector credit before the recession—when credit was cheap and easy to get—was\na major reason why the recession ended up being so deep. The model also predicts that the\neconomy should have been virtually stagnant in terms of real GDP per person through 2012. In\nother words, the recovery has actually been stronger than might be expected given the extent of\nthe prior credit buildup.\nSo why has the economy done better than the model predicts after such a destructive\nfinancial crisis and credit collapse? One big reason is that economic policies put in place during\nand after the recession, including extraordinary measures taken by the Federal Reserve, lent\ncritical support to the recovery. These policies pulled us out of the recession much faster and\nmade the recovery stronger than would have happened otherwise. To be sure, the recovery has\nbeen weaker than we wanted. But the fact that we’ve made as much progress as we have is due\nto a great extent to these timely policy actions. Absent these actions, I fear that we could have\nexperienced the stagnant economy the model predicts.\n3 Staff forecast based on Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (forthcoming).\n3\n\nRecent data show this improvement is continuing. This is easiest to see in housing,\nwhich is now in a broad-based expansion after years of depressed activity. Across the country,\nsales of new and existing homes have risen substantially over the past year, and prices are up 10\nto 15 percent. Homebuilders have responded by stepping up construction.\nThe housing rebound is a powerful tonic for the economy. Homebuyers often want new\ncarpeting, drapes, furniture, and appliances. Meanwhile, rising home prices allow more people\nto refinance mortgages at lower rates, giving them hundreds or thousands of extra dollars to\nspend each year. What’s more, rising home prices make people feel wealthier, giving them\nconfidence to reach for their wallets. And homes are not the only assets going up in value.\nStock prices have risen considerably over the past year, adding significantly to household wealth.\nRising wealth makes consumers more willing to spend. My staff estimates that the increase in\nwealth registered just in the first quarter of this year will raise consumer spending by roughly\n$90 billion.\nThis higher wealth has offset the effects of the increase in taxes at the beginning of the\nyear, allowing consumer spending to grow at a healthy pace. That seems likely to continue. Two\nmajor surveys show consumer sentiment in recent months has been higher than at any time over\nthe past five years and that people are more upbeat about prospects for economic growth and\njobs.4\nOne factor weighing on the recovery has been household and business uncertainty about\nthe economy and economic policy. Some signs suggest that this too is dissipating. Economists\n4 The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers (2013) and the Conference Board Consumer\nConfidence Survey (2013).\n4\n\nhave created an index that measures uncertainty about economic policy by tracking the content\nof newspaper articles.5 By early June, this uncertainty index had fallen to levels not seen since\nlate 2007. Meanwhile, my business contacts confirm that uncertainty appears to have eased this\nyear, in part because the decibel level of congressional wrangling over taxes and spending has\ndropped.\nOf course, not every sector of the economy is robust, which is what you would expect\nwhen overall growth is only moderate. Business investment has been expanding only modestly\nand recent data on orders for capital equipment suggest that investment growth will continue to\nbe tepid for a while. Overall though, the private economy has been expanding quite reasonably.\nThe thing that’s holding the recovery back is the public sector. Government budgets have turned\ninto a significant drag on growth.\nDuring the recession and early in the recovery, the federal government threw a critical\nlifeline to the economy. Congress and the White House boosted spending substantially and cut\ntaxes for households and businesses, which partly offset the collapse of the private economy.\nThe $800 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 was a huge help.6 But this has turned on its\nhead. That stimulus has wound down. And, at the beginning of 2013, tax rates rose for upper-\nincome households and the Social Security payroll tax cut ended. More recently, the\nsequestration process has forced major cuts in federal spending.\nBy contrast, fiscal policy at the state and local government level has been a drag on the\neconomy since the beginning of the recession. Unlike Uncle Sam, state and local governments\n5 See Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013).\n6 See Lucking and Wilson (2012).\n5\n\ntypically must balance their budgets each year. As revenues plunged, they cut spending and\nemployment deeply and, in some cases, raised taxes. Thankfully, that painful process may be\ndrawing to a close. Recent data show state and local government revenue is climbing again,\nsomething we’re certainly happy to see in California. Still, expenditures and employment\nremain well below pre-recession levels.\nHere is a way to appreciate how big the swing in the role of government has been: In the\ntwo years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, spending at all levels of government, adjusted\nfor inflation, increased more than 6½ percent, while private-sector spending fell nearly 6 percent.\nBut, since the end of 2009, government spending has fallen nearly 7½ percent and private\nspending has risen more than 10½ percent. Employment data paint a similar picture. Since the\nend of 2009, governments have shed more than 600,000 jobs. At the same time, private\nemployers outside the farm sector have added 6.9 million jobs. Clearly, government austerity is\none factor holding back economic growth.\nIn the job market, private-sector hiring has actually picked up. Over the past six months,\nnonfarm private payrolls have grown by just under 200,000 jobs per month compared with an\naverage of about 160,000 in the previous six months. The unemployment rate has fallen six-\ntenths of a percentage point over the past 12 months.\nWhat about the future? San Francisco Fed researchers have identified indicators that\nprovide information about how the labor market is likely to fare over the next six months. These\ninclude data you may be familiar with, such as initial unemployment claims, and less well-\n6\n\nknown data, such as the percentage of people who say in surveys that it’s hard to find a job.\nThese indicators suggest that the labor market will continue to strengthen.\nHere then is my forecast. I expect the unemployment rate to fall to roughly 7¼ percent at\nthe end of this year and drop to about 6¾ percent by the end of 2014. Economic growth is likely\nto be sluggish in the current and next quarter, reflecting federal spending and employment cuts\nrelated to sequestration. It should pick up later in the year. For 2013 as a whole, I see inflation-\nadjusted GDP growing about 2¼ percent and picking up to around 3¼ percent in 2014.\nI’d like to say a few words about inflation. Our mandate from Congress calls on us to\npursue both maximum employment and stable prices. High unemployment is certainly the\nbiggest problem we’re facing these days. But we must also pay close attention to inflation.\nHistory tells us that severe financial crises are often associated with deflation, that is, falling\nprices, which are very dangerous for the economy. We’ve managed to avoid deflation, not least\nbecause of the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy. The policies we’ve followed have restored\ngrowth and generally kept inflation from falling too low. Similarly, the Fed’s announcement of a\n2 percent longer-run inflation target has helped keep public inflation expectations stable.\nIt’s true that inflation has come in under our target recently and below what I was\nexpecting. This partly reflects temporary factors, such as a decline in Medicare reimbursement\nprices forced by sequestration. Inflation will probably remain relatively low for a while, but\nshould gradually rise toward our 2 percent target over the next few years as the economy\ncontinues to improve and unemployment comes down. I expect our preferred inflation measure\n7\n\nwill gradually climb from less than 1½ percent in the second half of 2013 to roughly 1¾ percent\nin 2015.\nOf course, economic progress could fall short of my forecast. One risk is that battles over\nthe federal budget could make households and businesses more uncertain about the economy,\ncrimping their spending. Europe represents another risk. Financial markets there have calmed\nconsiderably. But many European economies are still mired in recession and remain extremely\nfragile. If Europe’s economies falter, that will affect us in the United States since countries there\nare a major market for American products.\nLet me now turn to Federal Reserve policy. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, the Fed\nresponded vigorously. In our role as lender of last resort, we took a number of unprecedented\nsteps to shore up a financial system that was on the verge of collapse. When markets seized up\nand banks stopped lending to one another, we provided emergency financing. We intervened in\nseveral specialized markets, such as the corporate short-term borrowing market and the markets\nfor consumer and small business loans, to make sure they kept functioning. Our policy\ncommittee, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, pushed our benchmark short-term\ninterest rate close to zero. These measures brought the financial system back from the brink and\nmay well have headed off a depression.\nStill, at the end of 2008, the economy was shrinking at an alarming rate and hundreds of\nthousands of jobs were disappearing each month. More needed to be done. In essence,\nconsumer and business demand for goods and services was evaporating. The Fed had pushed\n8\n\nshort-term interest rates as low as they could go. To provide additional stimulus, we put in place\nunconventional programs designed to put downward pressure on longer-term rates.\nOur unconventional programs have come in two forms. The first is known as forward\nguidance. Under forward guidance, the FOMC communicates to the public what Fed policy is\nlikely to be in the future. Our forward guidance explicitly links future policy to the performance\nof the economy. Specifically, we’ve stated that the current exceptionally low level of the federal\nfunds rate is likely to remain appropriate at least as long as, one, the unemployment rate remains\nabove 6½ percent; two, inflation one to two years out is forecast to be no more than half a\npercentage point above the FOMC’s 2 percent target; and, three, inflation expectations remain in\ncheck. And because financial market participants know that short-term interest rates will\nprobably stay low for a long time, longer-term interest rates are likely to stay relatively low as\nwell.\nOur second type of unconventional program involves large-scale purchases of longer-\nterm U.S. Treasury and mortgage-related securities. Under the current program, we are\npurchasing $85 billion in securities each month. Our purchases increase demand for these\nsecurities, pushing up their prices and pushing down their yields. That in turn drives down other\nlonger-term interest rates. We have said we will continue this program until the outlook for the\nlabor market improves substantially in a context of price stability.\nOur forward guidance and securities purchases have significantly reduced longer-term\nrates, and that benefits the economy greatly. For example, at the low point of the recession, the\n30-year conventional mortgage was about 5½ percent. Buying a $300,000 home with a 20\n9\n\npercent down payment required a monthly payment of around $1,360. Today, despite the recent\nrun-up in interest costs, mortgage rates are roughly 1 percentage point lower. The same size\nmortgage now carries a monthly payment of about $1,220. That’s an annual reduction of around\n$1,700, which could be saved or spent. Alternatively, a homebuyer willing to pay $1,360 per\nmonth could buy a house worth more than $335,000, boosting demand for homes.\nThe housing market is by no means the only part of the economy benefiting from lower\nrates. Motor vehicle sales have been running at an annual rate of over 15 million this year, a\nhuge jump from the recession low of just over 9 million. Output from the manufacturing sector\nfell nearly 20 percent in the recession. Today, thanks to sales of autos and other big-ticket items,\nthe durable goods component of manufacturing is back to its pre-recession peak. By contrast,\nthe nondurable goods component, which doesn’t benefit as much from low interest rates, is still\nabout 10 percent below its peak.\nOf course, the economy’s increased momentum has raised questions about when the Fed\nwill cut back, and eventually end, its asset purchase program. So, is it time to act? My answer is\nthat it’s still too early. For one thing, we need to be sure that the economy can maintain its\nmomentum in the face of ongoing fiscal contraction. And it is also prudent to wait a bit and\nmake sure that inflation doesn’t keep coming in below expectations, possibly signaling a more\npersistent decline in inflation.\nMy forecast assumes that federal fiscal retrenchment has largely temporary effects on\neconomic growth and that inflation will resume its gradual rise toward 2 percent. Looking\n10\n\nahead, if this forecast holds true, then at some point it will be appropriate to scale back our\npurchase program and eventually end it.\nFollowing our meeting last week, Chairman Bernanke spelled out the FOMC’s current\nthinking regarding potential adjustments to our asset purchases over the next year. He said that if\nthe economy develops broadly as the FOMC expects, then it “would be appropriate to moderate\nthe monthly pace of purchases later this year” and “to reduce the pace of purchases in measured\nsteps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear.”7 He noted that, if\nthings evolve as expected, then when the program is ended, the unemployment rate would be\naround 7 percent, with solid growth supporting further improvement in the labor market.\nI would like to emphasize three points regarding the potential timeline for adjusting our\nasset purchase program. First and foremost, any adjustments to our purchase program will\ndepend on the new economic data that come in. In other words, we will modify our plans as\nappropriate if economic developments turn out differently than we currently expect.\nSecond, reducing or even ending our purchases does not mean the Fed will be tightening\nmonetary policy. Not at all. The amount of stimulus our purchase program creates depends on\nthe size of our securities holdings, not the amount we buy each month. Even if we start reducing\nour purchases later this year, our balance sheet will continue to grow, providing an increasing\namount of stimulus. That is, as long as we are adding to our holdings of assets, we are adding\nmonetary stimulus to the economy.\n7 Bernanke (2013).\n11\n\nThird, future adjustments to our asset purchases in no way alter or undermine our\napproach of maintaining the current very low federal funds rate at least as long as the\nunemployment rate is above 6½ percent and the other conditions regarding inflation and inflation\nexpectations are met. Indeed, as the FOMC projections released last week show, a large majority\nof Committee participants don’t expect the first increase in the federal funds rate to occur until\n2015 or later. And the median projected value of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015 is only\n1 percent.\nAs I emphasized at the start, I am convinced that our extraordinary policies during the\nrecession and recovery, including our current asset purchase program, have been hugely\nbeneficial for the economy. The good news is that the economy is on the mend. The time will\ncome when we will no longer need to keep adding monetary stimulus. When that time comes, I\nam confident that we can make this change without jeopardizing the recovery, while working\ntoward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. Thank you very much.\n12\n\n13\n\nReferences\nBaker, Scott R., Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J.

    "text": "Speech to Seattle University Albers School of Business\nSeattle, Washington\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on 5 March 2014\nThe Federal Reserve:\nInside Monetary Policy\nIntroduction\nThank you, Dean Phillips, it’s a pleasure to be here. A while back, I was asked to speak\nto a group of educators about the messages to get across to their students about the Federal\nReserve. I naturally assumed that textbooks were updated about as frequently as when I was in\ncollege—in fact, that they might still be using the same ones.\nThis was important, because while economic principles haven’t changed, the discussion\nabout the Fed and our role has; with the events of the past seven years, we’re not talking about\nreserve requirements anymore.1 We’re talking about over a dozen emergency lending programs,\na 4 trillion—that’s trillion with a “t”—dollar balance sheet, and a newfound openness to\ndiscussing our future policy decisions. We’re talking about breaking new ground in monetary\npolicy.\nThe good news is that college textbooks have been pretty well updated, and cover a lot of\nthese new developments. But even so, I thought there were broader questions about the Fed’s\nrole in the economy and society that got lost in the details.\nI was left with the question: what are the important take-aways about the Fed? The\nanswers are pertinent to anyone studying business or economics today. So with that in mind, I’d\nlike to talk about three fundamental questions regarding the Federal Reserve. First, what’s\n1 Williams (2011).\n1\n\nspecial about the Fed that makes it so important? Second, what does the Fed actually do? And\nthird, why do the Fed’s policy decisions matter for the economy?\nWhat makes the Fed so important?\nBefore I proceed, I am obligated to mention that my comments reflect my own views and\nnot necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. With that disclaimer out of\nthe way, let me turn to the first question, what makes the Fed so important? Let’s first establish\nthat it actually is, or at least is viewed by many as being so. [Figure 1] I’ll bet most everyone in\nthis room recognizes both Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, which I think makes the point.\nWhenever the Fed decides—or doesn’t decide—to do something, it’s there in the newspaper,\nabove the fold, main headline.\nWhen there’s a new Chair appointed, when there’s speculation about who that will be, it\noccupies a front-and-center place in the news cycle, as we saw last year. You all know who the\nFed Chair is, but do you know who heads the other financial regulatory agencies? These are\nimportant institutions, with critical roles in overseeing our banking system, but few Americans\ncan name their heads, and none moves markets with a single sentence.\nWhat’s different about the Fed? Well, obviously we are unique in that we—and we\nalone—set monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—gets together\nevery six weeks or so to discuss, debate, and make policy decisions that are incredibly important\nfor the U.S. economy and, by extension, the global economy. But more than that, we’re a unique\ninstitution in the federal government, both in function and in structure.\nOne key difference between us and the Congress, or the President, or a state legislature\nfor that matter, is that we’re not elected. We don’t have to get House or Senate approval for\nwhat we do; we don’t have to run it by the President; there’s no one from the Treasury\n2\n\nDepartment at our meetings. This gives us a great deal of autonomy in making monetary policy.\nCompare that to the process of changing the tax code, which must pass both houses of the\nCongress and be approved by the President.\nNow, obviously we’re overseen by the Congress, and, as a sidebar for those who may\nhave heard otherwise, we are audited! If tomorrow Congress decided to abolish the Fed, they\ncould do that, assuming they got presidential assent. Which I hope they don’t. In part, because I\nlike my job, but mostly because this arrangement allows us to make what we think are the best\npolicy decisions. We don’t have partisan battles to win or the distraction of election cycles,\nwhich means we can avoid the short-termism that can interfere with decision-making. Over our\nhistory we’ve built an institution staffed with highly experienced, non-partisan experts\ncommitted to our public purpose. We’re free to focus not just on immediate results, but on\nmedium- and longer-term outcomes that we truly believe are in the best interests of the country.\nWhen I sit with my colleagues at the boardroom on Constitution Avenue in Washington,\nD.C., there’s no discussion of politics at all, except to the extent that they shape the federal\npolicies and the economic environment in which we operate. That room is almost a bubble—an\noasis of political neutrality in what most people view as the most partisan place in the country.\nWe just discuss the best research and analysis, look at all the information we can gather, and try\nto come to the best decision.\nSo my answer to that first question is that what makes the Fed so important is its ability\nto regularly make decisions that affect the economy…but moreover that it has the freedom to do\nso by virtue of the unique role bestowed on us by our democratically elected government. That\ncarries a lot of accountability and a need for transparency. The license the American people\n3\n\nhave given us holds us to a very high standard, and we take that trust and responsibility very\nseriously.2\nWhat does the Fed do?\nOn to the second question: what does the Fed actually do?\nI don’t want this to sound condescending—if you’ve voluntarily shown up for a talk\nabout the Fed, you’ve probably read all about us in your textbooks and in the news. If you’re\nhere under duress, it means the professor who forced you to come uses those same textbooks.\nYou know that the Fed makes cash available across the country, runs key parts of our payments\nsystems, conducts oversight and regulation of banks and other financial institutions, and, of\ncourse, makes monetary policy.\nHowever, despite what you may hear from some commentators, we don’t actually print\nmoney. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing in the Treasury does that. So, if we’re not\nprinting money, what does monetary policy do? And why is there that confusion? Well, the\nsimple answer is that we buy and sell securities. In ordinary times, those are mostly short-term\nTreasury bills. Post-financial crisis, however, has constituted extraordinary times. We shifted to\npurchasing long-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities—you know this as “quantitative\neasing” or “QE.”\nHow do we pay for these securities that we are buying? If you look at this slide here\n[Figure 2], it shows the asset and liability sides of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. I’ll start\nwith how the balance sheet appeared in July 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis. At that time,\nwe owned a little over $850 billion of assets. As you can see, our asset holdings of Treasury\nsecurities are largely balanced out on the liability side of the ledger by the amount of currency in\ncirculation, which is treated as a liability of the Federal Reserve. In addition, there’s a relatively\n2 Williams (2011).\n4\n\nsmall amount of reserves, which are deposits that banks keep in their accounts at the Fed. As\nthings go, that’s all pretty boring.\nIn normal times, monetary policy is conducted by making small changes to the amount of\nreserves that banks hold with us by buying or selling some of our Treasury bills. This shift in the\nsupply of reserves affects the interest rate that banks pay each other. Thus, we “set” short-term\ninterest rates by making small changes in the supply of reserves.\nWith the financial crisis, however, our balance sheet got a lot more interesting…and a lot\nbigger. Early on, we increased reserves to drive short-term interest rates close to zero. But we\ndidn’t stop there. Take our asset purchase program, for example. When we buy these Treasury\nand mortgage-backed securities, what we’re doing is purchasing them on the open market and\nthen crediting the bank accounts of the institutions we bought them from with reserves in their\nFed accounts. But those reserves did not exist a moment before we made that transaction. A\nrudimentary analogy would be: your personal bank account is at zero, but you go into a store\nanyway, and at checkout, you have the power to say, “The money has been paid.”\nThe Federal Reserve has a monopoly on this ability to generate bank reserves out of thin\nair. Likewise, we can extinguish them when we wish. We have the unique capability to conduct\nopen-market operations and fundamentally change the amount of liquidity in the financial\nsystem. This, in turn, affects the prices of assets, which affects financial conditions, which\naffects the economy.\nI said earlier that a lot of the discussion has changed because of the current environment,\nand this is one area that’s very different from its historical precedent. Because we’re making\nthese asset purchases, we’ve added colossally to both sides of our balance sheet. When we make\npurchases that enlarge the asset side, the additional reserves we create for financial institutions\n5\n\nexpands the liability side. You can see this in the second set of bars in Figure 2. In normal\ntimes, our balance sheet doesn’t change much, because moving assets by a few billion dollars\nhad a sizable effect on interest rates. Since the recession, it’s been a different story. The first\ntwo rounds of asset purchases expanded our balance sheet to about $2.8 trillion, as of September\n2012. Since then, the QE3 program has expanded it to just over $4 trillion. Which demonstrates\nthe extent to which these last several years have been extraordinary times for monetary policy.\nSo the answer to the second question, what does the Fed actually do, is that, yes, we\nmove cash around, we oversee and regulate financial institutions; but what’s truly special is that\nwe have this incredible ability to generate reserves in the banking system, thereby affecting\ninterest rates.\nWhy do the Fed’s policy decisions matter for the economy?\nThat leads directly to the third question, why does the Fed matter for the economy? And\nthough it wasn’t by design, we did get two natural experiments that illustrated the power of\nmonetary policy in the past year.\nFinancial markets pay close attention to the public announcement that comes out after\neach FOMC meeting, because it contains important information about the future path of interest\nrates, the relative returns to investments in stocks and bonds, the likely value of the U.S. dollar,\nand so on. So the day of the FOMC statement can be a day of major movements in financial\nmarkets.\nLet’s look at a specific example of a market reaction to monetary policy. Figure 3 shows\nwhat happened after the June FOMC meeting last year. The black line shows the value of the\nU.S. dollar against the euro as the day progressed, the red line shows the level of the S&P 500\nstock market index, and the blue line is the yield on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note. Markets were\n6\n\npretty flat that day up until the FOMC announcement came out at 2 p.m. eastern time. At the\npress conference following the announcement, then-Chairman Bernanke expressed optimism\nabout economic conditions and said that QE could get scaled back, or “tapered,” later that year.\nThis set off what has been termed the “taper tantrum” that roiled financial markets. Investors\nhad clearly been expecting tapering to occur much later.\nWhat effect did this have? You can see that the statement had an immediate impact,\nalbeit a small one, if you look at 2 p.m. As the day progressed, the market response intensified.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield went up about 13 basis points that day, rising another 20 over the\nnext few days, which translates into higher mortgage rates and higher interest rates for longer-\nterm lending. So the market’s response brought long-term interest rates up substantially.\nEconomic theory tells us that if interest rates are higher, then the return on bonds is higher,\nwhich raises the opportunity costs of investing in the stock market… and, accordingly, the stock\nmarket fell, dropping about 1 ¼ percent by the end of the day and almost 5 percent by the\nfollowing Monday. Similarly, theory tells us that when the return to holding U.S. bonds rises, the\nforeign exchange value of the dollar should rise. That’s exactly what happened, with the dollar\nrising nearly 1 percent against the euro that afternoon.\nThe market reaction to the FOMC statement on September 18 is a direct contrast. This\nslide [Figure 4] shows a tick-by-tick—again, it’s all looking relatively normal, up until 2 p.m.\neastern time, when up on the Fed website pops the FOMC statement announcing that…\nnothing’s changing. For most organizations, saying it’s business as usual wouldn’t have much of\nan effect. But this time, many market participants thought we were going to start cutting back on\nour asset purchases. This is a real-life example of how important expectations of monetary\npolicy are, because this announcement—that things were staying the same—was news. Because\n7\n\nthey expected us to begin the taper, market participants saw not changing anything as essentially\nan easing of monetary policy.\nIf you look at the chart, you’ll see the response in the markets was immediate, and the\nreverse of what happened on June 19. The Treasury yield went down; the exchange rate\ndropped; and the S&P went up.\nBy the way, this is a great example of economic theory playing out in practice exactly as\nit’s supposed to. Economists like it when this happens because we can counter witticisms like,\n“An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday\ndidn’t happen today.” In this case, what happened was exactly what economists tell us monetary\npolicy should do.\nSo, how do these movements in asset prices affect the economy? The theory behind these\nreactions follows the basic logic you’ve all been taught in class: If the stock market is higher,\npeople feel wealthier and that makes them more willing to spend. Lower interest rates mean a\ngreater appetite for making long-term investments, whether it’s individuals buying cars or\nbusinesses investing. A weaker dollar, all else being equal, makes our exports cheaper and\nimports more expensive, which also helps increase spending on U.S. goods and services.\nThat’s the theory. How can an empirical economist say for certain that the Fed’s policies\nare working? We find that by looking at the areas of the economy that are doing the best. The\nanswer—along with the answer to the question: Why does the Fed matter to the economy?—is\nthat the rebounding sectors are the interest-sensitive ones. Auto sales are pretty close to where\nthey were before the financial crisis. Home sales and construction—though they’re nowhere\nnear as strong as right before the crash—are the areas of the economy that have improved most.\nIf you look at sectors that aren’t sensitive to interest rates, like services, or non-durable goods,\n8\n\nthey’re still relatively depressed. They’ve come back from the lows they hit, but haven’t\nrecovered in the same way as interest-sensitive sectors have.3\nThis gets to the heart of question three, why the Fed matters to the economy: because\nmonetary policy affects the way people behave—the way they spend and save and invest—from\nindividuals to corporations.\nConclusion\nTo sum up: the Federal Reserve has been given unique license by the government and the\nAmerican people to make critical public policy decisions. We make monetary policy to steer the\ncountry through both ordinary and extraordinary economic times, using the best tools at our\ndisposal. And the policy decisions we make fundamentally alter the way people and businesses\nmake decisions.\nThank you.\n3 See Williams (2014) and Cúrdia (2014) for evidence and discussion.\n9\n\nFigure 1\nWhat makes the Federal Reserve so important?\nFigure 2\nWhat does the Fed actually do?\nFederal Reserve Balance Sheet $, Trillions\n4.5\nJul. 25, 2007 Sep. 12, 2012\n4\n3.5\n3\nReserves\n2.5\n(Bank\nTreasury deposits\n2\nand heldat Fed)\nagency\n1.5\nsecurities\nCurrency 1\nTreasury\nCurrency 0.5\nsecurities\nOther Other\n0\nAssets Liabilities Assets Liabilities\nSource: Federal Reserve Board\n10\n\nFigure 2 (continued)\nWhat does the Fed actually do?\nFederal Reserve Balance Sheet $, Trillions\n4.5\nJul. 25, 2007 Feb. 26, 2014\n4\n3.5\n3\nReserves\n2.5\n(Bank\nTreasury deposits\n2\nand heldat Fed)\nagency\n1.5\nsecurities\nCurrency 1\nTreasury\nCurrency 0.5\nsecurities\nOther Other\n0\nAssets Liabilities Assets Liabilities\nSource: Federal Reserve Board\nFigure 3\nWhy does the Fed matter for the economy?\nMarket Reaction to 6/19/13 FOMC Announcement\nIndex, 12:00 PMET= 100 Percent\n102 2.4\n10-year Treasury yield\n(right scale)\n101 2.3\nUSD-EUR exchange rate\n(left scale)\n100 2.2\n99 2.1\nS&P 500\n(left scale)\n98 2.0\n12:00 PM 1:00 PM 2:00 PM 3:00 PM 4:00 PM\nSource: Bloomberg\n11\n\nFigure 4\nWhy does the Fed matter for the economy?\nMarket Reaction to 9/18/13 FOMC Announcement\nIndex, 12:00 PM ET = 100 Percent\n102 3.1\nS&P 500 3.0\n101 (left scale)\n2.9\n100\nUSD-EUR exchange rate 2.8\n(left scale)\n99\n2.7\n10-year Treasury yield\n(right scale)\n98 2.6\n12:00 PM 1:00 PM 2:00 PM 3:00 PM 4:00 PM\nSource: Bloomberg\n12\n\nReferences\nCúrdia, Vasco. 2014.

    "text": "Presentation to the Urban Land Institute, San Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 6, 2015\nPresident Williams presented similar remarks at the Community Leaders Luncheon in Salt Lake\nCity, Utah on October 1, 2015.\nThe Economic Outlook: Live Long and Prosper\nGood afternoon, and thank you.\nIt’s a pleasure to be here, particularly because the San Francisco Fed and the Urban Land\nInstitute actually have some overlap in our work. While most of what the Fed does is well\nknown—and well commented on—we’re also involved in community development. Our team\nworks with professionals across the built environment—from housing to transit to health—to\nhelp strengthen local economies. In fact, they’ve partnered with the ULI.\nToday I’d like to give an update on the outlook, monetary policy, and where I see us\nheaded. Before I get going, I should stress that the views expressed here today are mine alone\nand do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nI shouldn’t have to issue a spoiler alert before I say that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee decided to hold off on raising interest rates at our last meeting. I considered it a close\ncall, in part reflecting the conflicting signals we’re getting: On the one hand, the U.S. economy\ncontinues to strengthen and is closing in on full employment, while on the other, global\ndevelopments pose downside risks.\nThe unequivocally good news is that the economic expansion is entering its seventh year\nwith solid momentum. Over the past five years, real GDP growth has averaged a little over 2\npercent and the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly a percentage point per year. I expect that\npace of recovery to continue, despite strong global headwinds.\n1\n\nConsumer spending is powering the economy. We’ve seen real consumer spending\nincrease more than 3 percent over the past year and auto sales are on pace to exceed 17 million\nvehicles this year—the highest level seen since the early 2000s. Strong fundamentals point to\ncontinued solid gains going forward: Despite the recent declines in the stock market, the ratio of\nwealth to income is close to all-time highs, household debt burden has come down considerably,\nand real income growth—helped by the drop in energy prices—remains strong. Business\nspending is on an upswing as well. Overall, I see real GDP increasing at about a 2 percent annual\nrate on average over the second half of 2015 and next year.\nThe labor market continues to improve as well. We’re on pace to add about 2.4 million\njobs this year and job vacancies are the highest they’ve been since they started collecting the data\nback in 2000. Given the progress we’ve made and the momentum we’re seeing, we should reach\nor exceed full employment on a broad set of measures by the end of this year or early next year.\nIn particular, I expect the unemployment rate to fall below 5 percent either later this year or early\nnext year and remain there into 2017.\nThis brings me to the question of how to gauge what a healthy, full-employment labor\nmarket looks like. The most common metric is the “natural rate” of unemployment—the optimal\nrate we can expect in a fully functioning economy. Before the recession, it was generally thought\nto be around 5 percent.1 Since then, there has been a lot of research examining whether the\nevents of the past decade have pushed the natural rate up—say, due to an increasing skills\nmismatch between workers and jobs—or down, owing to changes in the demographic makeup of\nthe labor force—that is, a greater representation in the workforce of groups that tend to have\nlower unemployment rates.2 My assessment is that there has not been any lasting, significant\n1 Weidner and Williams (2011).\n2 Aaronson et al. (2015), Daly et al. (2012), and Lazear and Spletzer (2012).\n2\n\nshift in either direction. My estimate of the natural rate of unemployment today is 5 percent,\nconsistent with pre-recession estimates. With the current rate at 5.1 percent, we are very close.\nTurning to inflation: It is still lower than I’d like. Based on my favorite measure—the\ntrimmed mean—the underlying rate is 1.7 percent. To understand why inflation has remained\nlow despite an economy nearing full employment, we have to look beyond our shores. The rise\nof the dollar and the fall in oil prices over the past year have lowered import prices and pushed\nthe inflation rate down. Based on past experience, these effects should prove transitory. As they\ndissipate, and as the economy strengthens further over the next year, I see inflation moving back\nup to our 2 percent goal in the next two years.\nThere are upside risks to my forecast, specifically an even stronger and faster rebound in\nhousing and a more pronounced spending boom from lower energy prices. So far, lower oil\nprices haven’t caused much of a surge in consumption, but as people get used to paying less, that\ncould change. And there are, of course, the downside risks: There’s the threat of slowdowns and\nspillovers from abroad, and the dollar could appreciate further.\nOn raising rates\nThese domestic and global developments have implications for monetary policy. We’re\nbalancing a number of considerations, some of which argue for a little more patience in raising\nrates and others that argue for acting sooner rather than later. Our decisions reflect a careful\njudgment about the relative risks and merits of those factors.\nI’ll start with the arguments for being a bit more patient in removing monetary\naccommodation. For one, we are constrained by the zero lower bound in monetary policy and\nthis creates an asymmetry in our ability to respond to changing circumstances. That is, we can’t\n3\n\nmove rates much below zero if the economy slows or inflation declines even further. By contrast,\nif we delay, and growth or inflation pick up quickly, we can easily raise rates in response.3\nThis concern is exemplified by downside risks from abroad. Economic conditions and\npolicies from China to Europe to Brazil have contributed to a substantial increase in the dollar’s\nvalue. This has held back U.S. growth and inflation over the past year.4 Further bad news from\nabroad could add to these effects.\nInflation has been below our 2 percent target for more than three years now. This is not\nunique to the United States. Although we ultimately control our own inflation rate, there’s no\nquestion that globally low inflation, and the policy responses this has provoked, has contributed\nto downward pressure in the U.S. As I said, my forecast is that inflation will bounce back, but\nthis is just a forecast, and there is the risk that it could take longer than I expect. With inflation\npersistently running below our target, some argue that the need to start normalizing monetary\npolicy is not pressing.\nThose are some of the main arguments on the side of the ledger arguing for a little more\npatience. On the other side is the insight of Milton Friedman, who famously taught us that\nmonetary policy has long and variable lags.5 I like to use a car analogy to illustrate it. If you’re\nheaded towards a red light, you take your foot off the gas so you can get ready to stop. If you\ndon’t, you’re going to wind up slamming on the brakes and very possibly skidding into the\nintersection.\nIn addition, an earlier start to raising rates would allow us to engineer a smoother, more\ngradual process of policy normalization. That would give us space to fine-tune our responses to\nreact to economic conditions. In contrast, raising rates too late would force us into the position of\n3 Evans et al. (2015).\n4 See, for example, Amiti and Bodine-Smith (2015).\n5 Friedman (1961).\n4\n\na steeper and more abrupt path of rate hikes, which doesn’t leave much room for maneuver. Not\nto mention, it could roil financial markets and slow the economy in unintended ways.\nFinally, experience teaches us that an economy that runs beyond its potential for too long\ncan generate imbalances that ultimately lead to either excessive inflation or an economic\ncorrection and recession. Two recent examples are sobering. In the late-1990s, the expansion\nbecame increasingly fueled by the euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. In the first half of the 2000s, the economy\nbecame increasingly reliant on irrational exuberance over housing, resulting in house prices\nspiraling far beyond fundamentals and massive overbuilding. Of course, in both cases, those\nfantasies burst at great cost to our economy.\nI want to be clear that, in raising concerns about the potential for imbalances, I’m not\ntalking about fighting the last war. It is a more general point: When you have a high-pressure\neconomy, with unsustainably high levels of economic activity for a long period of time, people\nmay make decisions based on excessive optimism, rather than sound economic basics. That\nmentality can happen any time, but it’s emboldened by an economy that’s on a tear.\nI am starting to see signs of imbalances emerge in the form of high asset prices,\nespecially in real estate, and that trips the alert system. One lesson I have taken from past\nepisodes is that, once the imbalances have grown large, the options to deal with them are limited.\nI think back to the mid-2000s, when we faced the question of whether the Fed should raise rates\nand risk pricking the bubble or let things run full steam ahead and deal with the consequences\nlater. What stayed with me were not the relative merits of either case, but the fact that by then,\nwith the housing boom in full swing, it was already too late to avoid bad outcomes. Stopping the\nfallout would’ve required acting much earlier, when the problems were still manageable. I’m not\n5\n\nassigning blame by any means, and economic hindsight is always 20/20. But I am conscious that\ntoday, the house price-to-rent ratio is where it was in 2003, and house prices are rapidly rising. I\ndon’t think we’re at a tipping point yet—but I am looking at the path we’re on and looking out\nfor potential potholes.\nIn considering the FOMC’s monetary policy choices, it’s important to remember that\nwe’re in a very different place now than when we first instituted extremely accommodative\npolicy. The economy has come a long way since the dark days of late 2009. We’ve added over\n12½ million jobs, more than 3 million of them last year. Even better, most of those were full-\ntime. It’s been a tough journey back, and monetary policy has played a crucial role in healing a\nonce-ailing economy.6\nIn the past, I have found the arguments for greater patience to clearly outweigh those for\nraising rates. The labor market was still far from full strength and the risk to the recovery’s\nmomentum was very real. As the economy closed in on full employment, the other side of the\nledger started gaining greater weight and the arguments have moved into closer balance.\nLooking forward, I expect that we’ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the\nnear future and inflation will gradually move back to our 2 percent goal. In that context, it will\nmake sense to gradually move away from the extraordinary stimulus that got us here. We already\ntook a step in that direction when we ended QE3. And given the progress we’ve made and\ncontinue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates,\nmost likely starting sometime later this year. Of course, that view is not immutable and will\nrespond to economic developments over time.\nWhat to expect when you’re expecting a new normal\n6 See Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n6\n\nAs we make our way back to an economy that’s at full health, it’s important to consider\nwhat constitutes a realistic view of the way things will look. The pace of employment growth, as\nwell as the decline in the unemployment rate, has slowed a bit recently…but that’s to be\nexpected. When unemployment was at its 10 percent peak during the height of the Great\nRecession, and as it struggled to come down during the recovery, we needed rapid declines to get\nthe economy back on track. Now that we’re getting closer, the pace must start slowing to more\nnormal levels. Looking to the future, we’re going to need at most 100,000 new jobs each month.7\nIn the mindset of the recovery, that sounds like nothing; but in the context of a healthy economy,\nit’s what’s needed for stable growth.\nAs the next year unfolds, what we want to see is an economy that’s growing at a steady\npace of around 2 percent. If jobs and growth kept the same pace as last year, we would seriously\novershoot our mark. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and it’s\nactually desirable, that the pace is slowing.\nConclusion\nThe economy is on solid footing and a good trajectory. There are risks, as there always\nare in life. And there’s always the possibility of what British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan\nsaid when asked what worried him most: “Events, dear boy, events.” But all in all, things are\nlooking up, and if they stay on track, I see this as the year we start the process of monetary policy\nnormalization.\nThank you.\n7 Aaronson et al.

    "text": "Presentation to the Monetary Policy Forum\nNew York, N.Y.\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on February 24, 2012\nDiscussion of “Housing, Monetary Policy, and the Recovery”1\nIt’s a pleasure to participate in this year’s Monetary Policy Forum. I am particularly\npleased to be discussing today’s paper. The authors have done an excellent job of analyzing and\nilluminating a key sector that has had profound effects on the economy, effects that policymakers\nhave been wrestling with. I appreciate the opportunity to offer some thoughts on these issues.\nThe paper makes a compelling case that the housing boom and bust are central for\nunderstanding both the depth of the recession and the slow recovery. Indeed, the housing bust\nhas led to a persistent shortfall in aggregate demand, through a variety of channels.2 The authors\nalso argue that problems in housing have affected the transmission of monetary policy.\nIn my comments today, I will focus on two issues. First, I will argue that, although the\ncollapse in home prices and residential construction has been an important part of the story, it\nhas not been the only factor weighing on aggregate demand. In particular, the sluggish recovery\nhas not been limited to regions hard-hit by the housing downturn. Instead, fallout from the\nbroader financial crisis also reduced aggregate demand through a variety of nonhousing\nchannels. Second, the resulting large and persistent output gap is national in scope, which calls\n1 I would like to thank John Fernald, Fred Furlong, John Krainer, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in\nthe preparation of this presentation.\n2 See Williams (2012).\n1\n\nfor strong countercyclical monetary policy.3 After saying that, I should make clear that I am\nspeaking for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe title of the paper is “Housing, Monetary Policy, and the Recovery.” The discussion\nand figures in the first half of the paper are, indeed, focused on housing and the recovery. But\nthe authors then shift to quantifying that the downturn was more severe in states that had larger\ndeclines in home prices. This analysis, along with Amir Sufi’s work with Atif Mian and others,4\nsheds light on the important role of housing in exacerbating the downturn. But the authors do\nnot say much about the recovery phase, which has been anomalous compared with recoveries\nfrom past deep recessions.\nThis distinction matters. The link between house prices and regional economic activity is\nmuch clearer in the downturn than in the recovery. That point comes through in the next two\nfigures, one looking at house prices and employment, and the other housing starts. Figure 1\nshows the evolution of the cross-sectional correlation between state-level employment growth\nand changes in house prices. The blue line shows the monthly correlation across states between\nthe 12-month change in employment and the 36-month change in home prices. The red line also\nuses the 12-month change in employment, but measures the change in home prices relative to a\nfixed starting point at the end of 2005. Both lines tell the same story. States with larger declines\nin home prices also had larger declines in employment during the downturn. But this correlation\n3 One issue that I do not have time to cover is what caused the housing and associated credit bubble in the\nfirst place and what role monetary policy should have in combating bubbles. For further discussion of\nthese issues, see Williams (2011a, b).\n4 See, for example, Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011).\n2\n\nhas largely vanished during the recovery. In 2011, the pace of employment growth was similar\nfor states that had large home price declines and those that did not.\nWe see the same pattern in housing starts. The downturn was more severe in states that\nhad larger home price declines. But starts have been more similar during the recovery. The two\nbars on the left of Figure 2 show the states that had higher-than-average home price declines.\nThe blue bar shows the downturn, measured as the level of starts in the second quarter of 2009\nrelative to the fourth quarter of 2005; the red bar, the recovery, measured as starts in the fourth\nquarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2009. The right bars do the same for states\nwith smaller price declines, or, in a few cases, increases.\nDuring the recession, starts plunged everywhere. But the contraction was larger in high-\nprice-decline states, where starts fell by a factor of five. Moreover, from 2009 to 2011, there was\nonly limited recovery anywhere. In fact, the recovery was actually slightly stronger in the\nhardest-hit states. Thus, housing was important in explaining regional differences during the\ndownturn. But once the downward adjustments took place, the disappointing pace of recovery\nhas been similar across regions, suggesting broad-based factors have been at work.\nThis evidence supports the view that house-price declines were not the entire story\nbehind the deep recession and slow recovery. Following on that point, the analysis in this paper\nis best viewed in the context of the financial crisis more generally. Certainly, few would dispute\nthat the housing collapse was a critical factor in triggering the broader financial crisis. For\nexample, Gary Gorton and others have argued for the central role of concerns about the valuation\nof private-label MBS.5 And, housing-related losses at financial institutions impaired credit\n5 See Gorton (2008).\n3\n\navailability. But these and other dimensions of the financial crisis caused broad additional\neffects on aggregate demand. These effects went beyond those due simply to reduced spending\nby overleveraged households.\nThis point is illustrated by a careful examination of the timing of the downturn. Figure 3\nshows that house prices peaked in 2006 and had fallen about 20 percent by the time Lehman\nBrothers failed in September 2008. Housing starts had already fallen sharply, but effects on\nnonhousing indicators were relatively modest. The stock market, though off its highs, was still\nabout where it had been when home prices peaked. And the economy was bearing the housing\ncrash reasonably well. In many ways, it looked like a replay of the recession following the dot-\ncom bust.\nIn contrast, after Lehman, the stock market and the real economy both went into free fall.\nWe saw a massive flight to quality, increased demand for liquidity, greater uncertainty and\ncompensation for risk, and widespread impairment in financial market functioning. These\nfinancial market effects have been important factors in the economy’s performance during the\nrecession and recovery. And, of course, the current European crisis is certainly not the result of\noverleveraged U.S. households, at least not directly.\nIn this regard, it is interesting to look at analysis of the housing market presented to the\nFederal Open Market Committee back in June 2005.6 In my presentation at that meeting, I used\nthe Board of Governors FRB/US model to examine the effects of a 20 percent decline in home\nprices. The model did not explicitly incorporate the types of deleveraging and credit constraint\n6 See presentation materials by Williams (2005). See also Mishkin (2007) for a more detailed discussion\nof these issues and FRB/US model simulations.\n4\n\nchannels highlighted by the paper. However, I did include additional spillovers to aggregate\ndemand and bond premiums to get at some of the imbalances present at the time. The model\nsimulation implied that the downturn would be relatively modest, though requiring a sizeable\nmonetary response. For example, with a Taylor rule, the fed funds rate would fall about three\npercentage points and the unemployment rate would rise by about one percentage point\nfollowing the shock.\nUntil Lehman, the predictions of that model held up reasonably well. For example, in\nAugust 2008, home prices had fallen almost exactly 20 percent from their peak. The fed funds\nrate had been cut from 5¼ percent to 2 percent, and the unemployment rate had risen a little\nmore than one percentage point to 6.1 percent. According to this analysis, if the housing crash\nhad not ignited the financial crisis, the macroeconomic effects would not have been disastrous.\nThen came the financial crisis. The economy plunged into nearly the worst recession\nsince World War II. Of course, the model simulations did not foresee the global financial crisis,\nwith its demand for safety and liquidity, the seizing up of markets, and the effects of these\ndevelopments on confidence and aggregate demand. And it is the aftereffects of those events\nthat are playing a major role in restraining the recovery even today.\nIn looking at the relative role of the decline in house prices versus the broader downturn\nfollowing the financial crisis, it is important to note that the downturn was severe even in places\nwith smaller house-price declines. Housing starts and employment fell everywhere. Even today,\nthe unemployment rate in every state remains higher than it was before the Great Recession, as\nshown in Figure 4. The unemployment rate rose more in states with above-average house-price\ndeclines. But the increases were also substantial in most states that had smaller-than-average\nhouse-price declines.\n5\n\nNot only did almost every state suffer from the downturn, but the recovery has been fairly\nsimilar across regions. Figure 5 depicts a measure of dispersion from state coincident indexes of\neconomic activity.7 The red line shows that, in the Great Recession, the standard deviation\nacross states rose substantially. But, since the recovery began, the standard deviation has been\nrelatively low. Other indicators, such as employment growth, do not show unusual dispersion\nacross states. This evidence suggests that there hasn’t been a significant difference in growth\nbetween high- and low-price-decline states during the recovery. The slow pace of recovery since\n2009 has been widespread, which reflects common obstacles to growth across all states. Some\nof these headwinds are clearly related to housing and household balance sheets. Others are only\nindirectly related, including tight credit, pervasive economic uncertainty, and weak global\nconditions.\nWhat about monetary policy then? The paper’s executive summary notes that current\n“headwinds…may require a more aggressive monetary response than in normal downturns.” I\nentirely agree.\nA notable policy challenge is that the reduction in household and business demand has\npushed us to the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate. A range of monetary policy rules\nsuggest that the target nominal funds rate should have been substantially negative in recent\nyears.8 Another challenge is that the monetary transmission mechanism is partially clogged.\nCredit market frictions make refinancing and other housing activity less responsive to changes in\ninterest rates. Fortunately, the monetary transmission mechanism doesn’t work solely through its\n7 See Crone and Clayton-Matthews (2005) and Stock and Watson (1989).\n8 See, for example, Rudebusch (2009) and Chung et al. (2012).\n6\n\neffects on housing, or even through balance sheets and collateral constraints more generally.\nMonetary policy also affects the economy through wealth effects, household intertemporal\nsubstitution, the user cost of capital generally, and exchange rates, among other mechanisms.9\nBut suppose monetary policy is less powerful than usual. That suggests we need to move\nour monetary instruments even more than usual to achieve our employment and price-stability\nobjectives. The paper hints at a potential caveat to this argument: sector- or region-specific\ncapacity constraints. For example, because of the different housing markets, monetary policy\nmight be potent in Kansas, but less so in Nevada. By attacking a big output gap in one region,\nwe could be overheating other regions. This concern is largely hypothetical. It’s not the case\nthat some areas are overheating and others are languishing. Every region is facing substantial\ncommon headwinds.10\nNow, the partially clogged transmission mechanism could suggest that you don’t do more\nof everything across the board, but concentrate on policies that affect particular problem areas.\nFor example, purchases of mortgage-related securities appear to have reduced mortgage rates\nsignificantly, making them particularly useful given the weakness in the housing sector.11 In\naddition, as discussed in the paper, fiscal policies could directly address the housing-related\n9 See, for example, Reifschneider, Tetlow, and Williams (1999) and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010).\n10 Even conceptually, this concern doesn’t entirely vitiate the “do-more” conclusion. Suppose the central\nbank’s loss function is in terms of a weighted average of squared gaps across regions. If one area has a\nlarge negative gap then, when you square it, the loss is very costly. The central bank would then be\nwilling to tolerate the opening up of modestly positive gaps in other regions in exchange for decreasing\nthe very large negative gap.\n11 Hancock and Passmore (2011) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) find significant\neffects of MBS purchases. Stroebel and Taylor (2009), by contrast, do not.\n7\n\nheadwinds, potentially yielding two benefits—a stronger housing recovery and more powerful\neffects from the existing monetary stimulus.12\nTo conclude, housing is a major factor in the deep downturn and sluggish recovery we’ve\nexperienced in recent years. It’s not the only headwind. But it’s one of several factors weighing\non aggregate spending by consumers, businesses, and government. An aggregate-demand\nshortfall is something monetary policy can be, should be, and is addressing.

    "text": "Presentation to the California Bankers Association, 121st Annual Convention\nDana Point, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 4, 2012\nBank Regulation in the Post-Crisis World1\nGood morning. It’s a great pleasure to be with you at the 121st annual convention of the\nCalifornia Bankers Association. This is my first opportunity as president of the San Francisco\nFederal Reserve Bank to meet with the CBA. I look forward to continuing the productive\nrelationship we’ve built between our two organizations over the years. The Fed has been under\nquite a lot of scrutiny in recent years. One of my goals here is to help improve understanding of\nwhat we are doing, both as regulators and monetary policymakers.\nDuring the past 120 years, the banking industry has transformed dramatically. But one\nthing hasn’t changed. Banks rooted in local communities continue to play an essential role in the\nAmerican economy. Community bankers have detailed knowledge of the people and businesses\nin their towns, cities, and regions that can’t be duplicated by computer algorithms. That makes\ncommunity banks uniquely suited to serve customers who might otherwise fall through the\ncracks in the financial system.\nThe theme of my talk is how the recent housing boom and bust, and the financial crisis\nand severe recession that followed, continue to affect us. These events have shaped the\neconomic recovery and transformed the regulation of the financial system. I’ll start by looking at\nthe role the financial sector played in the crisis. I’ll then consider the regulatory response, which\n1 I want to thank Cynthia Course, John Fernald, Maureen O’Byrne, Mark Spiegel, and Sam Zuckerman for their help\nin preparing these remarks.\n1\n\nis aimed at avoiding another near-breakdown of the financial system. I’ll note some of the steps\nthe Fed has taken to help community banks navigate a shifting regulatory landscape. The crisis\nhas also shaped the monetary policy environment. So I’ll close by offering my outlook for the\neconomy and my perspective on monetary policy. As always, my remarks represent my own\nviews and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI am highlighting the financial crisis because it remains the backdrop for the way we at\nthe Fed do our job today. Not all recessions start with a financial crisis. But this one\nemphatically did. Its origins lay in the largest and most dangerous financial bubble of the post-\nWorld War II era. From subprime lenders, to Main Street mortgage bankers, to global\ninvestment banks, financial institutions got swept up in the euphoria of a housing market in\nwhich prices seemed to be on a nonstop ride upward. Many community banks got too deeply\ninvolved in construction and land development lending. Suffice it to say, the story ended badly.2\nOut of this debacle came an all-important lesson: Excesses in the financial system\nbrought us perilously close to economic catastrophe. It is no exaggeration to say that we were on\nthe brink of another Great Depression. Though we avoided the worst, the effects on the\neconomy were severe. Millions of people lost jobs or homes. Many thousands of businesses\nfailed. For the Fed, working the way we did before the crisis is simply not an option. To avoid\nanother disaster, more effective regulation of our financial system is essential.\nAt the Fed, the fundamental rethinking of bank regulation and supervision began while\nthe storm was still blowing at full strength. The crisis revealed a number of flaws in our system\nof financial regulation. Some were at the microprudential level—the oversight of individual\ninstitutions. But the most critical shortcomings were at the macroprudential level. We didn’t\npay sufficient attention to the stability of the financial system as a whole. Nor did we fully\n2 For more on the financial crisis and the economy, see Williams (2012).\n2\n\ncomprehend the degree to which turmoil in the financial system could wreak havoc on the\neconomy.\nWe faced the crisis with a regulatory framework left over from the Great Depression,\nbuilt on a foundation of deposit insurance and Federal Reserve lender-of-last-resort protection.\nThe goal was to indemnify depositors and prevent runs. With this safety net in place, the key\nrole of supervision and regulation was microprudential, that is, to ensure the soundness of banks.\nThe idea was that the stability brought by the safety net and effective microprudential\nsupervision of each institution would protect the financial system as a whole.\nUnfortunately our concentration on the safety and soundness of individual depository\ninstitutions was wholly inadequate in an age of global interdependency, and when transactions\nhandled by nonbanks dwarfed those in the highly regulated banking system. Gaping holes in\nregulatory coverage allowed systemically important companies in the shadow banking system to\nescape oversight. The disasters at Lehman Brothers and AIG demonstrated that we needed a\nnew approach. Specifically, we had to find ways of addressing the problems caused by financial\ninstitutions that were “too big to fail,” that is, institutions whose failure could have unacceptable\nsystemic consequences. The result, Chairman Bernanke recently said, is that the Fed “reoriented\nitself from being ... primarily a supervisor of a specific set of financial institutions toward being\nan agency with a broader focus on systemic stability as well.”3\nI would cite several key lessons learned from the crisis in this regard. First, we needed to\nidentify and apply tougher regulatory treatment to institutions whose failure could jeopardize the\nfinancial system as a whole, whether they are banks or nonbanks. Second, truly addressing too\nbig to fail required a credible mechanism to liquidate troubled systemically important institutions\n3 Bernanke (2012).\n3\n\nin a way that didn’t endanger financial stability. Third, and more generally, we needed to be\nforward-looking in identifying and responding to emerging threats.\nOn the first point, during the crisis, fear of failure of some of our largest financial\ninstitutions had catastrophic effects on the financial system and the economy. In crafting a\nmacroprudential regime, we concentrated on the nation’s large, systemically important financial\ninstitutions—SIFIs in the new regulatory lexicon. Many of these institutions were so tightly\nconnected with other institutions that their failures would have implications far beyond their\nindividual resolution costs. In this way, individual failures could amplify the effects of shocks\nand potentially become systemic events. For example, if an institution is sufficiently large and\ninterconnected, its failure can trigger abrupt deleveraging by its creditors and counterparties.\nSuch an event can cause widespread declines in asset values. Those in turn can touch off a new\nround of deleveraging. Financial institutions that seemed to have solid balance sheets may\nsuddenly become vulnerable.\nA key milestone came early in 2009 when the Fed and other agencies conducted the first\nround of stress tests on 19 of the largest banking companies. We examined whether they had\nenough capital to withstand an even more severe recession than the one then under way. These\nwere mainly microprudential exercises, but they included some macroprudential elements. For\nexample, we assessed whether these institutions would have the capital they needed not just to\nsurvive, but to remain effective providers of financial services.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, codified the most important elements of systemic\nsupervision. It creates incentives for systemically important institutions to reduce their size,\ncomplexity, and interconnectedness. Bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in\n4\n\nassets are subject to requirements that include tougher capital and liquidity standards, limits on\nincentive compensation, and development of living wills that provide for orderly liquidation.\nDodd-Frank also created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, including the Fed and\nother agencies, in part to coordinate the regulation of systemically important nonbank\ninstitutions. Last month, the Council issued a rule spelling out how it will identify nonbanks that\ncould potentially threaten U.S. financial stability. It will take into account characteristics such as\nsize, interconnectedness, leverage, and reliance on short-term funding. The new law also helps\naddress the too-big-to-fail problem by allowing troubled systemically important financial\ninstitutions to be shuttered. It gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation “orderly\nliquidation authority” to close such institutions in a way that minimizes spillovers into the\nfinancial system.\nAnother integral part of all financial regulation is the need to be forward-looking. At the\nmicroprudential level, book value capital ratios are often lagging indicators of a bank’s\ncondition.4 An adequate assessment of a bank’s vulnerabilities must consider not only current\ncapitalization, but also asset concentrations, trading activities, exposures to other institutions, and\nability to withstand financial and economic shocks.\nThe crisis taught us that macroprudential regulation must also be forward-looking in\nidentifying emerging threats to the system. Part of the Oversight Council’s charter is to watch\nfor red flags in the financial system, such as excessive growth in credit, leverage, and asset\nprices. Moreover, a forward-looking macroprudential approach must consider how the financial\nsystem is likely to evolve over time. For example, what systemic issues are raised by new\nfinancial products, such as complex derivatives?\n4 Tarullo (2012).\n5\n\nThe key point about regulation in the post-crisis era is that we need a distinct regime for\nsystemically important institutions. For such institutions, the main public interest is preventing\neconomically damaging financial crises.\nOf course, issues such as systemic risk and too big to fail don’t apply to community\nbanks. Supervision of smaller financial institutions remains focused on microprudential issues.\nDodd-Frank appropriately exempts smaller banks from most of the tests and requirements\napplied to bigger banks. For example, the Dodd-Frank stress testing requirements only cover\ninstitutions with more than $10 billion in assets.\nThat said, it’s important that all of us keep in mind the microprudential lessons of the\nfinancial crisis. Bankers and regulators alike need to be forward-looking in evaluating risk,\nwhich means asking the kinds of what-if questions that come up in stress tests. For example, in\ntoday’s low-rate environment, it’s very important that all banks evaluate their sensitivity to\nchanges in interest rates. And scenario planning is especially appropriate for community banks\nwith concentrations in particular asset classes, such as commercial real estate. It’s particularly\nimportant to think through these risks when a bank is considering a capital redemption or return\nof capital to shareholders.\nAt community banks, these exercises don’t have to rely on complex econometric models.\nIn many cases, a simple spreadsheet will do. The point is that supervisors are looking for\ncommunity bankers to think along these lines as a regular part of risk management.\nI fully recognize that there are costs to increased regulation. In its design and\nimplementation, Dodd-Frank has tried to reduce those costs by focusing on institutions whose\noperations bear most critically on the stability of the financial system as a whole. However, we\nunderstand there could be spillovers and unintended consequences that affect financial\n6\n\ninstitutions of all sizes. The truth is, there’s plenty of uncertainty for all of us about how recent\nreforms will play out. For that reason, we believe it’s essential to clarify supervisory\nexpectations as they take shape. Moreover, we recognize how vital it is for the Fed to consider\nyour views on proposed policies.\nThat brings me to a critical point: The Fed has always had a two-way dialog with the\nbanking industry. Now, in this period of heightened regulatory scrutiny, it’s all the more\nimportant that we take full advantage of our lines of communication. Listening to bankers\nattentively and clearly explaining our supervisory policies help minimize unintended regulatory\nburdens.\nWith this in mind, we’ve taken a number of steps to broaden and deepen our dialog with\nthe industry, particularly the community banking sector. In 2010, the Fed created Community\nDepository Institutions Advisory Councils, or CDIAC, for each of the 12 Reserve Banks and the\nFederal Reserve Board. The Councils provide a forum for representatives from smaller banks,\ncredit unions, and savings associations to tell us what’s on their minds—not only about local\nmarket conditions, but also about supervisory policies. Hearing from bankers makes us better\nsupervisors and helps us understand what’s happening on the economy’s front lines. Such\nconversations complement the other information and data I look at in formulating my views\nabout the economy and the policy recommendations I make in the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nAt the San Francisco Fed, we have several long-standing programs that allow us to meet\nwith bankers outside the supervisory context. In our Community Perspectives program, Reserve\nBank officers visit senior managers of District financial institutions. The Banker Forum program\nconducts meetings with small groups of bank CEOs and directors.\n7\n\nIncreasingly, we rely on technology to help bankers understand the changing regulatory\nlandscape and emerging supervisory policies. At the national and Reserve Bank levels, we have\nseveral telephone and Internet offerings in which officers and examiners discuss supervisory\ninitiatives, sound practices, and red flags they’re seeing in the field. Nationally, our most\npopular programs are Ask the Fed conference calls and the Outlook Live webinar series.\nFor example, last month, a San Francisco Fed examiner and other Fed experts took part\nin a discussion of real estate lending in Lexington, Kentucky, before a live and nationwide\ntelephone audience of 1,200 bankers. The discussion covered market conditions and supervisory\npolicies, including debt restructurings, appraisal reviews, and allowances for loan and lease\nlosses.\nOf course, the legacy of the financial crisis is much more than a regulatory matter. The\ncrisis has had a profound effect on the economy over the past few years. Monetary policymakers\nare still dealing with its aftereffects. Let me briefly outline how this is playing out.\nCongress assigned the Fed two key goals in conducting monetary policy: maximum\nemployment and price stability. We’ve done pretty well on our price stability objective. Despite\nthe turmoil of the past five years, inflation has averaged almost exactly the 2 percent rate that the\nFOMC designated as our medium-run target.\nWe are still very far from our maximum employment mandate, but things are clearly\nimproving. We have now regained about 40 percent of the 8.8 million jobs lost during the\ndownturn. All the same, the unemployment rate remains far too high.\nI am increasingly hopeful that the recovery has entered a phase of self-sustaining growth.\nConsumer confidence and spending have improved. The manufacturing sector has revived\nnotably, thanks to demand from businesses, households, and overseas customers.\n8\n\nOverall though, the expansion has lacked the vigor of many past recoveries. This is not\nsurprising. Recessions associated with financial crises tend to be more severe and last longer\nthan other downturns, and recoveries from them tend to be weaker.5 The economy faces\nsignificant risks as well. I’ll mention two: global economic stresses, especially the European\nsovereign debt situation, and budget trends at all levels of government in the United States.\nAs far as global risk is concerned, the euro area’s trouble with the debt of many member\nnations is my biggest worry. Already, the crisis has taken a serious economic toll in Europe.\nMoreover, events last year showed that financial turmoil in Europe could quickly spread to\nmarkets here. European leaders have managed to avoid a blowup for now. But the underlying\nproblem of unsustainable debt hasn’t been solved. Even if Europe staves off a renewed financial\ncrisis, the region’s economies are likely to struggle for a long while as they carry out wrenching\nstructural reforms and aggressive fiscal austerity measures. This will cut into demand for U.S.\nexports for some time.\nSecond, in our own country, budgetary troubles have forced state and local governments\nto sharply cut spending. At the national level, a number of spending cuts and tax increases are\nscheduled to kick in at the end of the year, including an end to the payroll tax holiday and\nexpiration of the Bush-Obama tax rate reductions. These abrupt changes, if they occur, could\nmake it harder for the recovery to gain further momentum.\nThese risks weigh on the economy even if the worst doesn’t happen. They cause\nbusinesses and consumers to feel uncertain about the economy’s prospects. Such uncertainty\nmay prompt entrepreneurs to shy away from hiring and investing, and may make households\nwary of spending.\n5 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011).\n9\n\nIn sum, the economy is doing much better, but is still fragile. On balance, I expect the\neconomy’s moderate growth pace to continue. My forecast calls for real gross domestic product\nto expand about 2½ percent this year and 2¾ percent next year. The unemployment rate is likely\nto be around 8 percent through the end of the year and a little below that next year. Inflation\nshould be close to our 2 percent target for 2012 as a whole, and somewhat below that in 2013\nand 2014, as still-subdued labor compensation growth damps inflationary pressures.\nBanking conditions reflect this mixed economic picture. Clearly though, the recovering\neconomy has benefited the industry. Across the nation, banks are returning to health. Stress\ntests of the nation’s largest banking organizations were completed earlier this year. They\nshowed that capital levels at most of these banks would still be adequate, even if the economy\nwent through an extreme, and highly unlikely, downturn.\nSmaller banks are in better shape too. Here, in California, where the recession was\nferocious, community banks are slowly improving. Many have strengthened asset quality,\nliquidity, and capital. This is very encouraging.\nLoan demand has been weak, but it appears to be picking up as the recovery gains\ntraction. While businesses continue to invest in productivity improvements, they remain\ncautious about taking on big capital projects. But that may be changing. The aggregate volume\nof new commercial and industrial loans has been rising slowly, which bodes well for earnings.\nAt the Fed, of course, we want banks to make soundly underwritten loans. In the 12th\nDistrict, financially healthy banks with solid balance sheets are generally extending credit in a\nway that’s good for the economy. In the fourth quarter of 2011, loans grew at an annual rate of\nalmost 8 percent among the District’s strongest banks—those with a regulatory rating of 1 or 2\n10\n\non the 5-point CAMELS scale. It’s the weaker banks with financial problems left over from the\ncrisis that aren’t in a position to expand lending.\nWhat about monetary policy? In terms of the Fed’s dual mandate, I expect us to be in\nline with, or slightly below, our inflation target over the next few years. We’re making progress\non the employment part of our mandate, but we have a long way to go. Substantial risks remain\nthat could cause the economy to perform worse than I expect. Under these circumstances, it’s\ncrucial that we continue our highly accommodative monetary policy.\nOf course, very low interest rates won’t last forever. As the economy picks up, the Fed\nwill reduce accommodation and begin to raise interest rates. In addition, we will unwind the\nunconventional monetary policies, which have involved purchases of Treasury and mortgage\nagency securities.6 But, that day is still far off.\nI realize that low interest rates create a tough operating environment for banks. However,\nin setting monetary policy, our mandate from Congress is to focus on the economic goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability. Clearly, a solid economic recovery is in the best\ninterest of the banking system as well.\nLet me close by reiterating that the economic health of our country depends on strong and\nvibrant community banks. Close communication with community banks and others in the\nfinancial industry will make us better supervisors and better monetary policymakers. If we do\nour job right, then you are in a better position to do your job right. And doing our job right\nmeans that we don’t wait to interact until examination time. We hope that you take advantage of\nour educational and training opportunities, and forums for communication. We need your ideas,\nsuggestions, and constructive criticism. We value our continuing dialog with you.\nThank you very much.\n6 Board of Governors (2011).\n11\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 2012. “Fostering Financial Stability.” Speech at the 2012 Federal Reserve Bank of\nAtlanta Financial Markets Conference, Stone Mountain, GA, April 9.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120409a.htm\nBoard of Governors. 2011. “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,” June 21–22.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20110622.pdf\nJordà, Òscar, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M.

    "text": "Presentation to the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation\nAnchorage, Alaska\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on August 18, 2016\nLongview: The Economic Outlook\nGood afternoon and welcome; it’s a pleasure to be here. This is my first time in Alaska\nand I am looking forward to learning a lot about the local economy during my visit here.\nToday I’ll give an overview of the national economy and where I see things going, as\nwell as talk about the subject back at the forefront of everyone’s Fed conversations: interest\nrates. This is becoming an annual ritual: In August everyone keeps asking what the Fed will do\nin September. I’m asked enough about it to just wish that someone would wake me up when\nSeptember ends. Of course, then they’d start the next annual ritual, asking about December, so\nthere’s no avoiding it.\nAll that talk about September and December reminds me that I should have already\nissued the standard disclaimer, so here goes: The views expressed here today are mine alone and\ndo not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nA broad economy\nWith that out of the way, I’ll turn to the Fed’s dual mandate, which is maximum\nemployment and price stability.\nI know everyone here understands what the Fed does, but I often find myself returning to\nthe basics these days, as discussions of America’s economy and the role of monetary policy take\n1\n\ncenter stage. So please forgive me if it seems I’m just roaming for the moment, but it’s important\nto remember who does what and why. The Fed makes monetary policy, which has a powerful\ninfluence on the economy, but it also has its limits: It operates in a relatively constricted area and\nuses a restricted set of tools. Most importantly, we don’t deal with taxes or spending, debts or\ndeficits; instead, we deal primarily with the quantity of money and the rates at which it is lent.\nAs a Fed policymaker, I see virtually everything through the lens of our dual mandate:\nWhat does it mean for jobs? For inflation?\nI represent the largest Federal Reserve district, made up of the nine western states, which\ncomprises roughly 20 percent of the U.S. economy, and about 36 percent of its geography, with\nthe gap between the two numbers largely explained by the great expanse of land here in Alaska.\nWith such a large and diverse region, it may not be surprising that when I listen to people from\naround the district talk about conditions in their areas, it can sometimes sound like they live in\ncompletely different countries. There’s an old adage about the ocean being merely a collection of\nbillions and billions of drops of water. In the same vein, the overall American economy is a\ncollection of multiple smaller economies. So perceptions of economic health vary, as do\nreactions to economic changes—welcome to a new kind of tension. Lower gas prices may be\ngreat for people in Idaho, for instance, because they put more money in people’s pockets, which\nthen gets spent in the local economy. In Alaska and other oil-producing states, they have the\n2\n\nopposite effect—depressing tax revenue, hiring, investment, and spending. So I understand that,\nin some ways, the economy can appear to be a walking contradiction.\nPart of what makes the Fed System effective is that, while we’re making national policy,\nwe’re actively gathering input and information from regions all over the country. I don’t just see\nthe blistering hot markets like Seattle and San Francisco, I also see areas negatively affected by\nthe drop in oil prices, like Anchorage, or that were hit harder by the housing crisis than their\nneighbors, like Las Vegas and Phoenix.\nSo I listen to all areas of my district, and they feed into my overall policy perspective.\nBut, despite this wide range of economic experience and the ups and downs in the western states,\non a macro level things are pretty good, and the American economy is strong.\nEmployment\nWith that in mind, I’d like to turn first to national employment.\nOur goal is not to have an unemployment rate of zero, instead, it’s to be near the “natural\nrate” of unemployment: That’s the rate we can expect in a healthy economy. I see that number as\nabout 5 percent, which means that with the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent, we’re right on\ntarget. The unemployment rate is obviously not the only measure of labor market health, but the\nmultiple indicators tend to move together and are sending similar signals, with almost universal\nimprovements across them all. Even the metric many people have been worried about, the labor\nforce participation rate, is not the 21st century breakdown some people have feared; in fact, it’s\n3\n\nback pretty close to what I see as normal. The participation rate takes the labor force and divides\nit by everyone in the United States over the age of 16, which covers a lot of people who aren’t\nworking or looking for a job for perfectly normal reasons; overall, the low participation rate can\nbe explained by demographic factors and longer-term trends, such as baby boomers retiring and\nyoung people staying longer in school.1\nThe numbers are actually so positive, it’s time to adjust the way we talk and think about\nthem. I should know better by now, but even if I change the channels for an hour or two, I’m\nconstantly surprised by the commentary that seems to miss the larger playing field. In a robust\nlabor market, we simply don’t need to create as many jobs as we did when we were trying to\nclimb out of the hole dug for us by the recession. Over the past few years, we’ve seen\noutstanding numbers—in 2014 and 2015 the economy added nearly 3 million jobs a year, and\n2016 is on track to deliver about another 2¼ million jobs.\nThat’s great news, but the fact is we won’t need as much job growth going forward.\nWe’re pretty much at full employment now, so the future is less about meeting a goal and more\nabout maintaining a result. That means creating enough new jobs to keep up with the increase in\nthe size of the labor force. That number depends on things like the number of people retiring this\nyear or graduating from school and entering the workforce. The current pace of job gains is well\n1 Aaronson et al. (2014).\n4\n\nabove what we need, which I put to be somewhere around 80,000 a month, although estimates\nrange from 50,000 to around 100,000.2\nSo this year’s pace of 186,000 jobs a month is over twice as fast as we need to keep up\nwith labor force growth, and, quite honestly, is unsustainable in the long run. We should expect\nthe pace of job gains to slow, and no one should be alarmed when it does—we should only be\nalarmed, frankly, if we don’t see that necessary slowdown.\nWhile we’re on the subject of employment, I’d like to issue a plea to my friends in the\ncommentariat to not fixate on each individual data point, even an important one like the jobs\nnumber. And here’s where I get to trot out my most overused line: I and the rest of the Fed\npolicymakers love saying we’re “data dependent.” It’s a constant refrain and it’s absolutely true.\nBut there’s a difference between being data dependent and being data-point dependent, as one of\nmy colleagues put it. No one should get caught up on a particularly bad—or a particularly\ngood—jobs report. Or a month’s inflation numbers. Or even quarterly GDP growth. All the\nindicators should be examined in their entirety to tell us the state of the economy and where it’s\nlikely headed.\nIndividual reports, and even short-term trends, can give a false perception. There are a\nfew things to keep in mind when looking at the data. One is the standard disclaimer that gets lost\nin the headlines, that the first round of numbers is preliminary and can be very noisy. Another is\n2 See for example Aaronson, Brave, and Kelley (2016) from the Chicago Fed.\n5\n\nthat getting caught up in monthly or even quarterly changes is unhelpful—one good jobs report\ndoesn’t spell instant success, just as one bad inflation report doesn’t make us an economic basket\ncase. We should, instead, try to understand and parse these sorts of month-to-month movements.\nInstead of simply labeling them as noisy, we look for the source of the cacophony.\nThere’s a lot of analysis involved in getting to the bottom of some of it. Which answers\none of life’s great mysteries: Why do economists exist? We’re here to dig through the data and\nuncover hidden trends. Doing that, we can see external forces at work—for example, even after\ntwo revisions, the May jobs report showed just 24,000 new jobs, causing speculation that the\neconomy might be walking down the boulevard of broken dreams. But that report was\ninordinately affected by special factors, including the Verizon strike and the effects of weather.\nAfter adjusting for these, job gains remained solidly above trend, so the report was less shocking\nthan some commentators made it out to be.\nInflation\nTurning to the other side of the ledger, inflation is on course to meet our 2 percent goal.\nAlthough it’s been persistently below target over the past several years, recent data look more\nfavorable. Over the past year, the strengthening of the dollar and falling energy prices have\npushed inflation down, but these influences should fade over time. To cut through some of the\nnoise, it’s useful to look at measures of inflation that strip out volatile prices and provide a\nclearer view of the underlying trend. Those measures suggest that underlying inflation is in the\n6\n\n1½ to 1¾ percent range. We’re not quite at our target, but the strength of the labor market should\nhelp us along.\nThe outlook\nOne of the reasons I’m confident in our progress is that my U.S. forecast today is not\nmuch different than it was a month ago, or, frankly, than it was in December when we first raised\nrates. I continue to see evidence that, overall, the economic expansion remains on track.\nConsumer spending is strong, the labor market is running apace, and household balance sheets\nare improving. All in all, I see a strong domestic economy.\nInternationally, Brexit has been dominating the headlines, and people have been worried\nthat it might push the U.K. into recession and how it might weigh on Europe. But there’s no sign\nthat it will have enough of an impact to knock our economy off course. In fact, from a global\nstandpoint, the discussion about the effects of Brexit is a reminder that we’re doing a lot better\nthan most of the rest of the world.\nEveryone’s favorite topic: Rate hikes\nNow is when I come around to the subject of interest rates. In the context of a strong\ndomestic economy with good momentum, it makes sense to get back to a pace of gradual rate\nincreases, preferably sooner rather than later. I have a few reasons for saying that.\n7\n\nFirst, Milton Friedman famously taught us that monetary policy has long and variable\nlags.3 Research shows it takes at least a year or two for it to have its full effect.4 So the decisions\nwe make today must take aim at where we’re going, not where we are. I liken it to a car: When\nyou’re nearing the intersection, you ease off the gas so you can be ready to stop. You don’t wait\nuntil you get right in front of the red light; that would force you to slam on the brakes, and might\npropel you into the middle of the intersection. Likewise, if we wait until we see the whites of\ninflation’s eyes, we don’t just risk having to slam on the monetary policy brakes, we risk having\nto throw the economy into reverse to undo the damage of overshooting the mark. And that\ncreates its own risks of a hard landing or even a recession.\nSecond, experience shows that an economy that runs too hot for too long can generate\nimbalances, ultimately leading to either excessive inflation or an economic correction and\nrecession. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was runaway inflation. In the late 1990s, the expansion\nbecame increasingly fueled by euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. And in the first half of the 2000s, irrational\nexuberance over housing sent prices spiraling far beyond fundamentals and led to massive\noverbuilding. If we wait too long to remove monetary accommodation, we hazard allowing these\nimbalances to grow, at great cost to our economy.\n3 Friedman (1961).\n4 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n8\n\nFinally, an earlier start to raising rates would allow a smoother, more gradual process of\nnormalization. This gives us space to fine-tune our responses to any surprise changes in\neconomic conditions. If we wait too long, the need to play catch-up wouldn’t leave much room\nfor maneuver. Not to mention, it could roil financial markets and slow the economy in\nunintended ways.\nMonetary policy has absolutely played a crucial role in getting us back on track.5 We’ve\nachieved our mandate of full employment and we’re heading towards 2 percent inflation. But,\nit’s important to recognize what monetary policy can and can’t do—not to mention what it\nshould and shouldn’t. The job of monetary policy is to get the economy to full strength with\nmaximum employment and steady 2 percent inflation, using the tools available to us. As I said\nearlier, that’s a relatively limited kit and is restricted largely to money in the system and the rates\nat which it is lent. How the economy develops and performs in the long run depends on a host of\nother factors that are outside our purview and ability to influence.\nWhat comes next is addressing long-run trends in productivity and the quality of the labor\nforce, and those are determined by the investments we make in technology and education, by tax\npolicies and long-term fiscal decisions.6 That’s what’s going to shape the economy over the next\ndecade, and that conversation extends far beyond the Federal Open Market Committee meeting\nroom.\n5 Williams (2014).\n6 See Fernald and Jones (2014) regarding technology and education; see also Williams (2016).\n9\n\nNew normal\nAs we look to the future, we should be aware of what economic strength will look like.\nSome might ask, if accommodative policy helps the economy so much, why don’t we just keep\nrates low forever? The answer is that it’s not economically healthy and it’s not sustainable. The\nFed can’t deliver, say, 3 or 4 percent growth for the next 10 years just because of easy monetary\npolicy. We have to operate within the established economic environment and foster growth\nwithin those parameters.\nAs I said earlier, we’re only going to need somewhere around 80,000 new jobs a month\nto keep up with the growing labor force. Some may call this disappointing, and it was when we\nwere climbing out of the hole the recession left. But this is the new normal, as is trend growth of\na little over 1½ percent going forward. If we want to bend the curve, it’s not going to be through\nmonetary policy. It’s going to be through legislative policies that have a chance at fundamentally\nchanging the direction of growth—like longer-term investments in human and physical capital\nlike education and infrastructure.\nConclusion\nThe Cliff’s Notes version is this: Despite the very real struggles that some parts of the\ncountry, including Alaska, are facing, the broader national economy is in good shape: We’re at\nfull employment, and inflation is well within sight of, and on track to reach, our target. Under\nthese conditions, it makes sense for the Fed to gradually move interest rates toward more normal\nlevels.\n10\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Scott A.

    "text": "Presentation to the New York Association for Business Economics, New York, NY\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on May 12, 2015\nLooking Forward, Forward Looking: The Path for Monetary Policy\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here. New York is obviously one of the greatest\ncities in the world, so that’s easy to say. But I have to be honest: If I’d had to come here during\nthe winter you just had…well, I still would have said it, but I would have just been being polite.\nSpringtime in New York, however, is no hardship, so, aside from being delighted to address this\nparticular audience, I’m very happy to be back.\nI’d like to give an overview of the economy today and where I see us going. I’ll address\nsome of the questions I’ve been hearing most frequently, and talk about the trajectory of\nmonetary policy going forward. As usual, my comments are my views alone, and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nDisappointing first quarter\nThere are two questions I’m asked on an almost daily basis right now, so I’ll preempt the\nQ&A and get to them right off the bat. One of them is: Given first-quarter weakness, am I\nrevising my outlook for the year? So far, I’ve been relatively upbeat about the economic outlook\nand the direction we’re heading. The answer leads me to something I say frequently: We need to\nlook at data over the longer term. We can’t get distracted by blips and temporary downs—or ups\nfor that matter.\nThe data I’m looking at convince me that we’re still on solid footing. Yes, in recent\nmonths, spending and employment numbers have come in a little weaker than we had\nanticipated. However, for the past four years, first-quarter real GDP growth has averaged more\n1\n\nthan 2 percentage points lower than during the rest of the year. While there is no single culprit,\nweather has definitely been a villain. It affected huge swaths of the country, even where the\nwinter itself wasn’t debilitating. A business contact of mine in the trucking industry told me that,\nwhile this winter was not as bad as the previous one, it was still one of the worst on record for\ndelayed and cancelled shipments. We were also affected by the West Coast port slowdown,\nwhich slowed economic activity.\nWith that in mind, and looking at the past several years, I expect that 2015 will match the\npattern that’s emerged: After a disappointing first quarter, we should see above-trend growth for\nthe rest of the year. Further data to support this forecast can be found in a new measure of\neconomic activity that may paint a better economic picture than GDP alone, called GDP Plus.1\nIt’s a measure that factors in both GDP and GDI, or gross domestic income, and filters out some\nof the noise. GDP Plus grew at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the first quarter and averaged 3\npercent growth over the past four quarters.\nSomething I really want to stress is that it’s important that we don’t jump to\nconclusions—or policy decisions—based on noisy data. As more information comes in, we’ll\nhave a better picture of where the economy is headed. We’ll have two additional months of data\ngoing into the next FOMC meeting, which should paint a more complete picture than we have\nnow. Either way, there’s no pressure to decide on the future path of policy today, so I am in\n“wait and see mode,” with a keen eye on the data.\nMy bottom line on the economy is: The fundamentals are sound. The underlying\nmomentum in job growth remains solid. I expect wage growth to continue to rise and consumer\n1 For more information on GDP Plus, see Aruoba et al. (2013) and http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/real-time-center/gdpplus/.\n2\n\nconfidence to continue to pick up steam. Monetary policy will remain highly accommodative—\nregardless of what may or may not happen with rates this year—which will spur spending.\nBeing based in San Francisco means I’m seeing evidence of the positives all around;\nsome sectors aren’t so much hot as akin to the sun’s surface. A tech executive recently told me\nthat competition for talent is so fierce that some firms are offering raises of 20 percent or more,\nalong with perks including housing…which is no small amenity in the Bay Area. I think New\nYorkers can feel our pain, since San Francisco only recently took the title of “most expensive\nrental market” in the U.S.—while this is great for property owners, I can say with confidence\nthat the renting population of San Francisco would be delighted if you’d take the title back…\nCommercial real estate is booming as well, with financing readily available on generous terms.\nAll in all, things continue to look good.\nEmployment\nThey’re looking very good on the jobs front as well. When we talk about maximum\nemployment, one half of the Fed’s mandate, we’re generally referring to the natural rate of\nunemployment—the lowest rate we consider normal in a healthy economy. Economists typically\nput it somewhere between 5 and 5½ percent; my own view is that 5.2 percent is the right\nnumber. We’re obviously nearing that goal, and I think that we’ll get to, or even below, 5 percent\nby the end of the year. Which, considering the peak of 10 percent during the worst of the\nrecession, is remarkable progress.\nBut I do see more slack in the labor market than the standard unemployment rate alone\nindicates. Taking into account the other measures of labor market health—people who are part-\ntime but want full-time work, people who want a job but stopped looking—I think that even\nwhen we hit my estimation of the natural rate, there will be some lingering bruises. Thankfully,\n3\n\nif my growth forecast comes to pass, we’ll see those workers come back into the fold and reach\nwhat I consider to be full employment across multiple indicators by next year.\nInflation\nThat’s the unambiguously positive news—or as unambiguous as policymakers are wont\nto get, as anyone who’s read an FOMC statement can attest to. That does not mean, however,\nthat there aren’t areas that warrant close attention.\nI said I’m currently hearing two questions quite persistently and the second one is: Why\nam I confident that inflation will move back up towards the Fed’s 2 percent goal? Given that\nwage and price pressures have been persistently low, given inflation’s further drop, given low\ninflation abroad, why would I be optimistic?\nThere are a few factors that convince me. First, recent low inflation numbers are\nconsistent with an economy that, while rebounding, is still not operating on all cylinders. That is,\nwe’re not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Wage growth in particular has been sluggish.\nThere’s been some upward movement, but not what one would consider representative of a fully\nrecovered economy.\nThere are a few reasons for that.\nMy research staff has been studying a feature of the last recession with the imaginative\nname “downward nominal wage rigidity.” Put simply, employers were loath to cut pay during\nand after the Great Recession. As a result, wages remained stagnant to make up for the pay cuts\nthat never came, but businesses wanted to impose.2 As the economy picks up, these pent-up\nwage cuts will dissipate, the gap will close, and we should see wages start to rise more strongly.\n2 Daly and Hobijn (2015).\n4\n\nThis lagging effect of economic recovery on wage growth is a recurring pattern.3 We’ve\nseen in prior recessions that wage growth doesn’t tend to really pick up until the economy nears\nfull employment. I’m therefore not particularly surprised that the acceleration in wage growth\nhas been slow to materialize.\nAnother thing to consider is that wage growth doesn’t really dictate inflation’s path.\nWhen dealing with something as vast and varied as the U.S. economy, it’s important to mine\nprior experience. To some extent, economics is an active example of William Faulkner’s famous\ndictum that “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” History has shown that wage growth has\nnot been a strong indicator of where inflation is going or when it will arrive—even though theory\nsays it should.\nObviously, rising wages are healthy for the economy. They’re a positive sign for the\nrecovery and the country. But looking at patterns in prior recessions and the history of monetary\npolicy, they’re not an indicator of overall inflation one way or another. That means that I’m not\nsurprised by their slowness to rebound and I’d be disinclined to lose sleep were they to rebound\nsharply—at least inasmuch as relates to their contribution to inflation.\nThe second factor to consider is that the past drops in import and oil prices have been\nholding inflation down, but these effects will dissipate, assuming import and oil prices stay\nrelatively stable.\nU.S. import prices have been depressed because growth and inflation have generally been\nlow in Europe, China, and Japan, the biggest economies outside the United States. That has led\nboth central banks and governments abroad to take strong policy actions to stimulate their\neconomies. Of course, the textbooks tell us that one result of this will be weakened currency,\nwhich means the dollar gains strength in comparison. This is a standard function of monetary\n3 Daly and Hobijn (2014).\n5\n\npolicy. However, it also means that, as the dollar’s value has risen, it has lowered the prices we\npay for imported goods and services, which in turn has pushed down the U.S. inflation rate.\nEnergy prices have also dropped dramatically, as every American well knows. The fall in\noil prices is having an enormous impact because energy is a significant part of the average\nconsumer’s spending basket. As prices for oil and gas have come down, they’ve also taken\ninflation with them.\nAnyone who knows me, or has listened to my speeches, will notice three recurring\nthemes. The first, and foremost, is that monetary policy is data-driven. I am so data-focused that\nI literally had a T-shirt made to express my personal policy mantra. The second is that I think\npatterns and history are important indicators of our economic present and future—they are,\nfrankly, just another form of data to be mined. As is the case with the effect that wages have on\noverall inflation, sometimes the theory doesn’t play out in practice, and history is an eloquent\nteacher. The third is that I believe policymakers have to be very careful about not reacting to\nblips. This again is an extension of the “data, data, data” view: We have to look at what’s\nhappening in the economy not just today, not just this month, but over the medium term,\nanalyzing trends and looking at multiple indicators.\nThat’s why we should be very circumspect about reacting to short-term fluctuations in\ncommodity or other import prices. Just as the Fed didn’t immediately intervene in the spring of\n2011, when inflationary pressures from oil and import prices were going up, we shouldn’t jump\nthe gun now that they’ve gone down. I take a perspective that looks one or two years ahead,\nwhich research shows is the minimum amount of time it takes for monetary policy to have its full\neffect.4 What I’m considering is what impact those factors that are currently unfolding—\nmovements in the U.S. economy, weakness abroad, oil prices—will have not next week or next\n4 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n6\n\nmonth, but later this year and the year after that and the year after that. My goal is policy that\nmeets the needs of the path we’re on, not where we’re standing this second.\nWith that in mind, history and experience show that energy price swings leave an imprint\non inflation in the short term, but don’t affect underlying inflation rates over the medium term.5\nThe same holds true for movements in the exchange value of the dollar: They obviously affect\ninflation in the short run, but they don’t have much of an impact further down the road.6\nI’m therefore looking at underlying rates of inflation. Fed economists are frequently\naccused of neither eating nor driving, because we prefer to measure “core” inflation, which\nexcludes food and energy prices. For the average consumer, those matter a lot—you can’t talk\nabout what a dollar can buy if you don’t look at those products. But for economic trends, and for\nguiding monetary policy, measures of inflation that remove the most volatile components, like\ncore or “trimmed mean” inflation, give a better lay of the land.7\nWhat I see when I look at the data that strip out the short-term volatility is an economy\nwith good momentum, that’s nearing full employment, with an inflation trend that’s running\nabout 1½ percent. As things continue to get better, I see the strengthening domestic economy\ndriving inflation gradually back to 2 percent.\nThe third factor I want to highlight is that the vicissitudes of foreign economies do not\ncontrol America’s fate. What happens abroad is clearly important to our economy, and effects\ncan and do easily cross borders. But the current international situation is not unique to this\nrecovery. We’ve seen time and time again that the U.S. can use monetary policy to meet its\ninflation goals regardless of the direction inflation takes elsewhere around the globe. Given\n5 Evans and Fisher (2011) and Liu and Weidner (2011).\n6 Gust, Leduc, and Vigfusson (2010).\n7 See http://www.dallasfed.org/research/pce/index.cfm.\n7\n\nhistorical precedent, I’m confident that we can control inflation through monetary policy actions\nnow as well.\nImpact on monetary policy\nWhat everyone wants to know, of course, is when we’ll begin liftoff. As I have made\npossibly overly clear, the exact timing will be driven by the data. They may push us a little in\none direction or the other, and there will be a lot of discussion and debate. Every FOMC meeting\nis on the table. That’s what it means to be data dependent.\nTo be able to even entertain such a move is a tremendously positive sign: It highlights\nhow much the economy’s improved, that unemployment has come way down, and that we may\nbe able to start cutting back on accommodation because of that strength. I recognize that not\neveryone shares my rosy view, or even thinks that 2015 is a good year to take action. There are a\nnumber of people who think we should wait until inflation is very close to, or has crossed, the\nfinish line. Their overarching concern is that a premature rate hike would allow inflation to fall\nfurther and possibly derail the recovery. They’re wondering what the rush is.\nThe first thing to point out is that when the Fed raises rates, it will not be instituting tight\npolicy, merely easing back on exceptionally accommodative policy. We’ve had over six years of\nthis stance, and accommodation will continue to characterize monetary policy for some time.\nRate rises will likely be gradual, and the Fed’s $4 trillion-plus balance sheet will continue to\nprovide substantial stimulus. We’re not pulling the rug out from underneath the economy.\nSecond is the factor I mentioned previously: Monetary policy, as Milton Friedman\nfamously wrote, has long and variable lags.8 As I said, it usually takes a year or two for policy to\nhave its full effect, so decisions need to be made with that in mind. It’s like driving a car: You\ntake your foot off the gas when approaching an intersection. The data convince me that inflation\n8 Friedman (1961).\n8\n\nwill move back up to our target as the economy strengthens and we close in on full employment.\nBy waiting until we’re face-to-face with 2 percent inflation, we could need to slam on the brakes\nor even skid through the intersection. Overshooting the mark would force us into a much more\ndramatic rate hike to reverse course, which could have a destabilizing effect on the markets and\npossibly damage the economic recovery. The decision to raise rates is actually three decisions:\nNot just when, but how quickly and how high. I see a safer course in a gradual increase, and that\ncalls for starting a bit earlier.\nConclusion\nThe Fed has a lot of decisions ahead, and people have a lot of opinions about those\ndecisions. But the outlook is positive. We’re nearing full employment and inflation is on track to\nreturn to our 2 percent goal. We’re not out of the tunnel yet, but we can definitely see the light at\nthe end. And, in case you missed it, policy will be data dependent.\nThank you.\n9\n\nReferences\nDaly, Mary C., and Bart Hobijn. 2014. “Downward Nominal Wage Rigidities Bend the Phillips Curve.”\nJournal of Money, Credit, and Banking 46(s2), pp. 51–93.\nDaly, Mary C., and Bart Hobijn. 2015. “Why Is Wage Growth So Slow?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2015-\n01 (January 5). http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-\nletter/2015/january/unemployment-wages-labor-market-recession/\nAruoba, S.

    "text": "Presentation at the Central Bank of Chile,\nFourth Summit Meeting of Central Banks on Inflation Targeting\nSantiago, Chile\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on November 18, 2011\nSwimming Upstream: Monetary Policy Following the Financial Crisis\nWe are now nearly two-and-a-half years into the recovery from the worst U.S. recession\nin decades. The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions during the past four years to\nstem what could have been a meltdown of the financial system and a horrific depression. These\nactions included several lender-of-last-resort programs aimed at alleviating liquidity shortfalls in\nthe financial system. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) undertook a\nseries of aggressive monetary policy actions aimed at stimulating the economy and avoiding\ndeflation. It lowered the target federal funds rate nearly to zero in December 2008 and\nsubsequently carried out purchases of Treasury and agency, or GSE, securities that expanded the\nFed’s holdings by about $2 trillion, as shown in Figure 1.\nThese monetary policy actions have brought Treasury, mortgage, and corporate bond\nrates down to their lowest levels in decades, as seen in Figure 2.1 Indeed, financial conditions in\nthe nonfinancial corporate sector, whether measured by corporate bond rates or stock prices,\nhave improved markedly since the crisis.\nThese bold and decisive actions succeeded in forestalling economic disaster. But they\nhave not been enough to deliver a robust recovery. Instead, my outlook is for the unemployment\nrate to remain above 7 percent for three more years. I don’t expect the rate to reach levels\nconsistent with the Fed’s mandate of maximum employment until 2016. And inflation is\nexpected to remain very low.\n1 See Williams (2011) for a further discussion of the effects of the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy actions.\n1\n\nIn the remainder of my talk, I will address the question: Why hasn’t aggressive monetary\naccommodation fueled a rapid recovery in economic activity? I will focus on three powerful\ncurrents that have slowed the pace of recovery. The first is the massive destruction of wealth\nfrom the crisis brought about by the declines in house and stock prices. The second is the severe\ntightening of credit resulting from the financial accelerator mechanism, triggered by the decline\nin real estate prices and the upsurge in residential foreclosures. The third is heightened\nuncertainty regarding European sovereigns and the overall health of the financial system. These\nrenewed concerns about the financial system have diminished the appetite for risk and sent\ninvestors fleeing to safe assets, such as U.S. Treasuries.\nThe Fed’s substantial monetary accommodation has worked hard to swim upstream\nagainst these currents, but progress has been frustratingly slow and halting. I should note here\nthat these remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal\nReserve System.\nThe natural starting point for any discussion of the U.S. economy today is housing. The\ndramatic boom and bust of the housing market over the past decade has been at the heart of the\nslow recovery. Figure 3 shows the ratio of house prices to a measure of home rents in the United\nStates over the past two decades. This price-to-rent ratio is analogous to the price-to-earnings\nratio for stocks. In this figure, the numbers have been normalized so that the historical average\nof this ratio equals one. According to this metric, house prices were about 70 percent overvalued\nat their peak in 2006. Since then, house prices have fallen by about 30 percent and rents have\nrisen, bringing the price-to-rent ratio roughly in line with its long-run average.\nThe sharp decline in house prices has had profound effects on the economy. It directly\nreduced the wealth of households by six-and-a-half trillion dollars. In addition, the housing\n2\n\ncrash and ensuing financial crisis caused stock prices to plummet. This stock market collapse in\npart reflected expected losses to financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-\nrelated securities. Figure 4 traces a broad measure of inflation-adjusted U.S. equity prices since\n1995. At its worst point in early 2009, stock market wealth had plunged 50 percent. That equals\na decline of 11 trillion dollars in household wealth relative to its pre-crisis peak. As the crisis\nhas receded and nonfinancial corporate profits have strengthened, the stock market has recovered\na good portion of these losses.\nWhat has been the effect of the massive wealth destruction represented by the sharp\ndeclines in housing and stock prices? If we apply a standard marginal propensity to consume out\nof wealth of four cents on the dollar, then the decline in real household wealth since late 2006\ntranslates into about a 4½ percent sustained reduction in consumer spending. And, in fact, the\ntheoretical relationship between wealth and consumer spending is borne out in the data. Figure 5\nplots household net worth against the personal saving rate. As seen in the figure, the saving rate\nhas been much higher since the start of the recession. Thus, the wealth effect on consumer\nspending is the first strong current holding back a robust recovery.2\nBut the wealth effect is only the beginning of the story. The decline in housing wealth\nalso wiped out the home equity of millions of mortgage borrowers. Indeed, it’s estimated that\nnearly 30 percent of mortgages—about 16½ million in total—are currently “underwater,”\nmeaning that borrowers owe more than their homes are worth. Millions more are “above water,”\nbut have less than the 20 percent equity typically needed to refinance. This evaporation of home\nequity has had severe repercussions for the economy.\nWidespread negative equity has contributed to a dramatic rise in mortgage delinquencies\nand foreclosures. The combined mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rate soared to nearly 10\n2 See Glick and Lansing (2011) and Mian and Sufi (2011).\n3\n\npercent in 2009 and remains elevated, as seen in Figure 6. The spike in foreclosures and\ndelinquencies was at the center of the financial crisis. As borrowers failed to make payments,\nmortgage lenders posted massive losses. Some major financial institutions failed due to\nmortgage-related losses, which undermined confidence in the solvency of other institutions. It\nculminated in an enormous panic that nearly brought down the financial system.\nFortunately, calamity was averted. Nonetheless, the housing market has not bounced\nback. Today, three years after the financial crisis reached a climax, we still see millions of\nhomes in foreclosure and millions more on the verge. The foreclosure crisis entails massive\ndeadweight costs to society and brings with it a cloud of uncertainty regarding the liabilities of\nfinancial institutions and prospects for house values.\nStung by massive mortgage and other loan losses, lenders tightened credit standards\nsharply. Figure 7 shows the results from the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion\nSurvey.3 The survey responses indicate that lenders systematically tightened standards on\nmortgage loans between 2007 and 2009. Since then, standards have changed little, indicating\nthat credit has remained tight. Indeed, anecdotal reports indicate that mortgages are available\nonly to those with excellent credit and the ability to make hefty down payments.\nFigure 8 shows the loan officer survey results for commercial and industrial loans.\nBusiness lending standards also tightened sharply following the crisis and have relaxed only a bit\nsince then.\nAs I noted earlier, the prevalence of negative home equity means that many homeowners\nhave little or none of the collateral needed to borrow or to refinance existing loans. The same\napplies for small and medium-size businesses, which do not have access to capital markets the\nway big corporations do. Small businesses frequently rely on collateral from their homes or\n3 Federal Reserve Board (2011).\n4\n\ncommercial real estate to get credit. With real estate prices slumping, they are essentially shut\nout of the market.4 Thus, this combination of tighter credit standards and borrowers without\ncollateral has led to a broad-based credit crunch that is restraining both consumer and business\nspending. This is the second current holding back the recovery.\nThe third major current holding back the recovery is uncertainty. One standard measure\nof financial market uncertainty is the VIX for the S&P 500, shown in Figure 9. The VIX has\nspiked three times in the past few years in response to financial and economic developments. It\nis currently at very high levels. More generally, the tumultuous events of the financial crisis, the\nhousehold debt overhang, and the U.S. and European fiscal crises have sapped confidence and\ndiminished people’s willingness to take on risk. In this environment, investors flock to the safe\nhavens of U.S. government securities and the highest-rated private securities. Risk spreads on\nlower-rated securities are elevated.\nThe lack of risk appetite is also seen in securitization markets. Securitization of\ncommercial real estate mortgages has largely been dormant, as seen in Figure 10. And\nsecuritization of non-agency private residential mortgages is frozen. Despite very low interest\nrates, investors are extremely cautious about pulling the trigger on investment projects. Instead,\nthey prefer to hold on to the option value of waiting to see how the economic situation develops.\nIn summary, the Fed has been very aggressive in using monetary policy to lower interest\nrates to stimulate the economy. These policies have been effective at improving financial\nconditions in important ways, but they are swimming against strong countercurrents that impede\nrecovery.\n4 Wilcox (2011).\n5\n\nIn this environment, monetary policy alone would take a very long time to bring about\nthe desired outcome of maximum employment. Fiscal policy actions that reduce uncertainty and\nstimulate recovery are badly needed. What would be especially helpful at this juncture are fiscal\npolicy actions that work in tandem with monetary policy to stimulate the economy. One\nexample of such a policy is the recently announced U.S. government initiative to make it easier\nfor underwater homeowners to take advantage of very low rates and refinance their mortgages.\nThis will trim monthly payments for some households and could reduce foreclosure rates. And it\ncould also eventually provide a modest boost to consumer spending. Other actions that address\nthe continuing problems in the housing market could help spur recovery and enhance the\neffectiveness of monetary policy as well.

    "text": "Presentation to the Western Economic Association International\nSan Francisco, CA\nBy John C. Williams\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on July 2, 2012\nMonetary Policy, Money, and Inflation\nGood morning. I’m very pleased to be in such eminent company, especially that of my\nformer advisor at Stanford, John Taylor. And I’ll begin my presentation with a reference to\nanother pathbreaking monetary theorist. Milton Friedman famously said, “Inflation is always\nand everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a\nmore rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output.”1 We are currently engaged in a test\nof this proposition. Over the past four years, the Federal Reserve has more than tripled the\nmonetary base, a key determinant of money supply. Some commentators have sounded an alarm\nthat this massive expansion of the monetary base will inexorably lead to high inflation, à la\nFriedman.\nDespite these dire predictions, inflation in the United States has been the dog that didn’t\nbark. As Figure 1 shows, it has averaged less than 2 percent over the past four years. What’s\nmore, as the figure also shows, surveys of inflation expectations indicate that low inflation is\nanticipated for at least the next ten years.\nIn my remarks today, I will try to reconcile monetary theory with the recent performance\nof inflation. In my view, recent developments make a compelling case that traditional textbook\n1 Friedman (1970), p. 24.\n1\n\nviews of the connections between monetary policy, money, and inflation are outdated and need\nto be revised. As always, my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nI’ll start with two definitions. The monetary base is the sum of U.S. currency in\ncirculation and bank reserves held at the Federal Reserve. Figure 2 shows the key components\nof the monetary base since 2007. Up until late 2008, it consisted mostly of currency, with a\nsmall amount of bank reserves held mostly to meet regulatory requirements. Since then, the\nmonetary base has risen dramatically, primarily because of a $1.5 trillion increase in bank\nreserves. The money stock is a related concept. It is the total quantity of account balances at\nbanks and other financial institutions that can easily be accessed to make payments. A standard\nmeasure of the money stock is M2, which includes currency, and certain deposit and money\nmarket accounts.\nHere I should make an important point about something that often confuses the public.\nThe worry is not that the Fed is literally printing too much currency.2 The quantity of currency\nin circulation is entirely determined by demand from people and businesses. It’s not an\nindependent decision of monetary policy and, on its own, it has no implications for inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve meets demand for currency elastically. If people want to hold more\nof it, we freely exchange reserves for currency. If people want less, then we exchange it back.\nOf course, currency doesn’t pay interest. People hold it as a low-cost medium of exchange and a\nsafe store of value. In fact, over the past four years, U.S. currency holdings have risen about 35\npercent. This reflects low interest rates, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding currency.\n2 Technically, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing prints paper currency. The Federal Reserve is responsible for\nprocessing and distributing currency to the banking system. The Federal Reserve also distributes coins, which are\ndistinct from paper currency, to the banking system, but the amount of coins in circulation is comparatively small.\n2\n\nIt’s also due to worries about the economy and the health of the banking system, both here and\nabroad. In fact, nearly two-thirds of U.S. currency is held outside our borders.3 U.S. currency is\nwidely seen as a safe haven. When a country is going through economic or political turmoil,\npeople tend to convert some of their financial assets to U.S. currency. Such increased demand\nfor U.S. currency is taking place in Europe today.\nFor monetary policy, the relevant metric is bank reserves. The Federal Reserve controls\nthe quantity of bank reserves as it implements monetary policy. To keep things simple, I’ll start\nwith what happens when the Fed doesn’t pay interest on reserves, which was the case until late\n2008. I’ll return to the issue of interest on reserves toward the end of my talk.\nBefore interest on reserves, the opportunity cost for holding noninterest-bearing bank\nreserves was the nominal short-term interest rate, such as the federal funds rate. Demand for\nreserves is downward sloping. That is, when the federal funds rate is low, the quantity of\nreserves banks want to hold increases. Conventional monetary policy works by adjusting the\namount of reserves so that the federal funds rate equals a target level at which supply and\ndemand for reserves are in equilibrium. It is implemented by trading noninterest-bearing\nreserves for interest-bearing securities, typically short-term Treasury bills.\nNormally, banks have a strong incentive to put reserves to work by lending them out. If a\nbank were suddenly to find itself with a million dollars in excess reserves in its account, it would\nquickly try to find a creditworthy borrower and earn a return. If the banking system as a whole\nfound itself with excess reserves, then the system would increase the availability of credit in the\neconomy, drive private-sector borrowing rates lower, and spur economic activity. Precisely this\n3 See Goldberg (2010).\n3\n\nreasoning lies behind the classical monetary theories of multiple deposit creation and the money\nmultiplier, which hold that an increase in the monetary base should lead to a proportional rise in\nthe money stock.\nMoreover, if the economy were operating at its potential, then if the banking system held\nexcess reserves, too much “money” would chase too few goods, leading to higher inflation.\nFriedman’s maxim would be confirmed. Here’s the conundrum then: How could the Fed have\ntripled the monetary base since 2008 without the money stock ballooning, triggering big jumps\nin spending and inflation? What’s wrong with our tried-and-true theory?\nA critical explanation is that banks would rather hold reserves safely at the Fed instead of\nlending them out in a struggling economy loaded with risk. The opportunity cost of holding\nreserves is low, while the risks in lending or investing in other assets seem high. Thus, at near-\nzero rates, demand for reserves can be extremely elastic. The same logic holds for households\nand businesses. Given the weak economy and heightened uncertainty, they are hoarding cash\ninstead of spending it. In a nutshell, the money multiplier has broken down.4\nThe numbers tell the story. Despite a 200 percent increase in the monetary base,\nmeasures of the money supply have grown only moderately. For example, M2 has increased\nonly 28 percent over the past four years.5 Figure 3 shows that the money multiplier—as\nmeasured by the ratio of M2 to the monetary base—plummeted in late 2008 and has not\nrecovered since. Nominal spending has been even less responsive, increasing a mere 8 percent\nover the past four years. As a result, the ratio of nominal gross domestic product, which\nmeasures the total amount spent in the economy, to the monetary base fell even more\n4 For a discussion of this, see Williams (2011a).\n5 Similarly, an alternative measure of the money stock, MZM, increased 26 percent over the past four years.\n4\n\nprecipitously, as the figure shows. This ratio also has not recovered, illustrating how profoundly\nthe linkage between the monetary base and the economy has broken.\nA natural question is, if those reserves aren’t circulating, why did the Fed boost them so\ndramatically in the first place? The most important reason has been a deliberate move to support\nfinancial markets and stimulate the economy. By mid-December 2008, the Fed had lowered the\nfederal funds rate essentially to zero. Yet the economy was still contracting very rapidly.\nStandard rules of thumb and a range of model simulations recommended setting the federal funds\nrate below zero starting in late 2008 or early 2009, something that was impossible to do.6\nInstead, the Fed provided additional stimulus by purchasing longer-term securities, paid for by\ncreating bank reserves. These purchases increased the demand for longer-term Treasuries and\nsimilar securities, which pushed up the prices of these assets, and thereby reduced longer-term\ninterest rates. In turn, lower interest rates have improved financial conditions and helped\nstimulate real economic activity.7\nThe important point is that the additional stimulus to the economy from our asset\npurchases is primarily a result of lower interest rates, rather than a textbook process of reserve\ncreation, leading to an increased money supply. It is through its effects on interest rates and\nother financial conditions that monetary policy affects the economy.\nBut, once the economy improves sufficiently, won’t banks start lending more actively,\ncausing the historical money multiplier to reassert itself? And can’t the resulting huge increase\nin the money supply overheat the economy, leading to higher inflation? The answer to these\n6 See Chung et al. (2011) and Rudebusch (2010).\n7 See Williams (2011b) for details.\n5\n\nquestions is no, and the reason is a profound, but largely unappreciated change in the inner\nworkings of monetary policy.\nThe change is that the Fed now pays interest on reserves. The opportunity cost of\nholding reserves is now the difference between the federal funds rate and the interest rate on\nreserves. The Fed will likely raise the interest rate on reserves as it raises the target federal funds\nrate.8 Therefore, for banks, reserves at the Fed are close substitutes for Treasury bills in terms of\nreturn and safety. A Fed exchange of bank reserves that pay interest for a T-bill that carries a\nvery similar interest rate has virtually no effect on the economy. Instead, what matters for the\neconomy is the level of interest rates, which are affected by monetary policy.\nThis means that the historical relationships between the amount of reserves, the money\nsupply, and the economy are unlikely to hold in the future. If banks are happy to hold excess\nreserves as an interest-bearing asset, then the marginal money multiplier on those reserves can be\nclose to zero. As a result, in a world where the Fed pays interest on bank reserves, traditional\ntheories that tell of a mechanical link between reserves, money supply, and, ultimately, inflation\nare no longer valid. In particular, the world changes if the Fed is willing to pay a high enough\ninterest rate on reserves. In that case, the quantity of reserves held by U.S. banks could be\nextremely large and have only small effects on, say, the money stock, bank lending, or inflation.\nAs I noted earlier, inflation and inflation expectations have been low for the past four\nyears, despite the huge increase in the monetary base. Of course, if the economy improved\nmarkedly, inflationary pressures could build. Under such circumstances, the Federal Reserve\nwould need to remove monetary accommodation to keep the economy from overheating and\n8 For details on the Fed’s planned exit strategy, see the minutes for the June 2011 FOMC meeting (Board of\nGovernors 2011).\n6\n\nexcessive inflation from emerging. It can do this in two ways: first, by raising the interest rate\npaid on reserves along with the target federal funds rate; and, second, by reducing its holdings of\nlonger-term securities, which would reverse the effects of the asset purchase programs on interest\nrates.\nIn thinking of exit strategy, the nature of the monetary policy problem the Fed will face is\nno different than in past recoveries when the Fed needed to “take away the punch bowl.” Of\ncourse, getting the timing just right to engineer a soft landing with low inflation is always\ndifficult. This time, it will be especially challenging, given the extraordinary depth and duration\nof the recession and recovery. The Federal Reserve is prepared to meet this challenge when that\ntime comes. Thank you.\n7\n\nReferences\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2011. “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.” June 21–22. http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20110622.htm\nChung, Hess, Jean-Philippe Laforte, David Reifschneider, and John C.

    "text": "Presentation to International Conference of Commercial Bank Economists, Los Angeles, CA\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on July 8, 2015\nThe Recovery’s Final Frontier?\nGood morning, it’s a pleasure to be here. I’d like to give you the “straight, no chaser”\nview today; my outlook on the economy, where we are, where we’re headed, and what that\nmeans for monetary policy going forward. While the headline is not quite “man bites dog,” I’m\nhappy to say that, overall, things are looking better and better—and are actually quite good. Our\nemployment goal is in sight, though there’s still some way to go until we can say the same for\ninflation. And that means these continue to be interesting times for monetary policy.\nAs always, my views are mine and mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of\nothers in the Federal Reserve System.\nInterpreting first-quarter growth\nA good deal of the recent commentary—and concern—has focused on the admittedly\nweak official reading of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), which was essentially flat.\nThere’s been a lot of speculation about what it all means: Is it an indication that the recovery is\nstalling? What does it mean for employment? At the risk of sounding like an apostate, it actually\ndoesn’t bother me too much. Because on closer inspection, and with alternative analysis, the\nnumbers were much better than they seemed.\nThe government agency that computes GDP and related economic statistics, the Bureau\nof Economic Analysis, uses a bottom-up method to account for seasonal adjustments to arrive at\nits overall numbers. They do this for a number of reasons that are appropriate for their purposes.\nBut for monetary policy, it’s preferable to have the most accurate reflection of the broader\n1\n\neconomy. Research at the San Francisco Fed and elsewhere has highlighted that even after the\nBEA’s seasonal adjustment, first-quarter GDP growth tends to come in well below that in other\nquarters.1 To get a measure that avoids seasonal patterns, SF Fed economists ran a second round\nof seasonal adjustment, not just on GDP, but on gross domestic income (GDI) and something\ncalled GDP Plus, a new measure of economy-wide activity that combines GDP and GDI and\nstrips out the extraneous noise.2\nAfter making this modification for recurring seasonal patterns, the data show GDP\nactually grew about 1½ percent in the first quarter. GDI and GDP Plus grew at about 3 and 2¾\npercent, respectively.\nBased on these revised numbers, and relative to trend growth of around 2 percent, the\nfirst quarter appears to have been more or less on track. More recent data on spending have also\nbeen encouraging, indicating the economy is still on a solid trajectory with a good deal of\nforward momentum. Looking forward, I expect growth to average about 2¾ percent for the\nremainder of the year, then slow to a more sustainable pace next year.\nInternational outlook\nSince I’m speaking to an organization that has “international” in its title, I suppose it\nwould be impossible to avoid the subject of risks from abroad, particularly as they’ve been\ndominating the headlines the past several weeks.\nA full global forecast would take up more time than I have—and more patience than you\nhave—so I’ll focus on the two countries everyone cares about most: China and Greece.\n1 Rudebusch, Wilson, and Mahedy (2015). See also Gilbert et al. (2015), Groen and Russo (2015), Liesman (2015),\nand Stark (2015).\n2 For more information on GDP Plus, see Aruoba et al. (2013) and http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-\ndata/real-time-center/gdpplus/.\n2\n\nI visited China recently, and I arrived fully cognizant of the concerns people highlight—\nslower growth, the unsustainability of the current export-driven model, debt buildup, bubbles in\nthe equity and housing markets, the risk of falling investment, and the overall international\nimplications of those risks. But I have to say that, after talking to officials and academics there, I\nwas a lot less concerned about China’s near-term economic outlook on my return flight than I\nwas heading over.\nThe Chinese government is again facing a tradeoff between their short-run growth goal\nand their longer-term reform agenda. But it’s clear that when the Chinese authorities see growth\nslowing, they take steps to keep it near their target level. Many of the issues that overseas\ncommentators are worried about can be addressed with fiscal and other policies, and China has\nshown that it has both the will and the leeway to take the necessary policy actions.\nThey are also realistic about what that target growth level should be. The days of double-\ndigit growth are behind China. Most economists and officials there understand that the number is\nlikely to move even lower than the current target of 7 percent, due to multiple factors including\ndemographics and the simple fact that years of economic success have moved China into a\nbracket in which there’s a lot less road to make up and therefore less growth required to power to\nthe top. They know they can’t aim for an outdated growth target.\nThe cost of taking this measured approach may be extending the horizon for some of\ntheir reforms. Nonetheless, it’s clear that they’ve continued to make progress on the reform\nagenda, including financial market liberalization, movements towards internationalization of the\nrenminbi, and a move to a more market-oriented economy.\nAs for Greece, an ultimate decision appears to be a moveable feast. What I can say is\nthis: Yes, there are risks, but I see them as unlikely to overturn the otherwise strong\n3\n\nfundamentals of the U.S. economy. The financial situation there is certainly precarious. And the\npossibility of a Greek exit from the euro is looming larger.\nIt is a tragedy for Greece that it finds itself on the brink of an even more severe financial\ncrisis and further economic turmoil. But it can perhaps be heard as a soothing chorus that the\ndirect exposure of foreign investors is relatively limited, and the European Central Bank appears\nto have the means and will to limit the financial fallout that could affect the rest of the euro area.\nWhile a worst-case scenario of a Greek exit from the euro leading to sizable financial and\neconomic impacts on the global economy cannot be ruled out, it remains an unlikely tail risk.\nEmployment\nReturning to the U.S., there were some concerns that the apparent slowdown in spending\ngrowth could spill over to employment, but the signs from the labor market have been\nconsistently resilient and positive. Not only has there been solid job growth, but the data show\nmost of those new jobs are full-time and higher paying. We have also seen a dramatic decline in\nlong-term unemployment over the past few years. In fact, a wide set of measures of labor market\nconditions have continued to show improvement across the board.\nMost importantly, our employment goal is in sight. Economists tend to think of full\nemployment as having reached the “natural rate” of unemployment, the rate we should expect in\na fully functioning economy. Most put it between 5 and 5.5 percent; my estimation, to be exact,\nis 5.2 percent. So, with the unemployment rate now at 5.3 percent, we are obviously tantalizingly\nclose. My forecast sees the unemployment rate continuing to edge down, falling to around 5\npercent by the end of this year, and even drifting slightly below 5 percent next year.\nOf course, there are other measures of labor market underutilization. As I said, we’re\nmaking good progress across a broad spectrum of indicators. For instance, people who’ve\n4\n\ndropped out of the labor force but still want to work. That figure has come way down and is now\nabout where you’d expect it to be given the overall state of the labor market.\nBut there are other areas that suggest there may be some lingering slack. One is the still\nlarge number of part-time workers who would rather be full time. So-called involuntary part-time\nwork soared during the recession and has remained unusually high during the recovery. The\nquestion we’re asking is: How much of that is due to an economy that still hasn’t reached full\nstrength and how much is due to more persistent influences? Recent research by SF Fed staff\nshows that most of the rise in involuntary part-time work was, in fact, related to the economic\ndownturn. But there is an outside component—largely reflecting changes in industry\nemployment shares and demographics—that may account for much, if not all, of the rest of it.3\nWe aren’t yet sure about the life span of these factors; they could dissipate over time, or they\ncould reflect a permanent shift—another “new normal” of the post-recession world. But when\nyou take them into account, they point to the current rate of involuntary part-time employment\nbeing more or less in proportion, slack-wise, to other indicators.\nSo, while I have the policymaker’s curse of approaching things with a certain amount of\ntrepidation, it looks like the labor market is bringing home a good report card in just about every\nclass.\nAnother positive sign is the recent increases in wages. For some time, there was concern\nthat wages were somehow immune to the recovery’s positive influences. In fact, the stagnation in\nwage growth wasn’t particularly surprising, because history and experience show us that wages\ndon’t usually start to pick up until the economy nears full employment.4 Now that wage growth\nis starting to take off, based on the most comprehensive indicators, it offers further confirmation\n3 Valletta and van der List (2015). See also Cajner et al. (2014).\n4 Daly and Hobijn (2014, 2015).\n5\n\nthat the labor market is nearly healed. While businesses aren’t always thrilled about the prospect\nof paying workers more, this pickup is a sign of a healthy economy. It’s good for the labor\nmarket, household income, and consumer spending, and is therefore good for business. In fact,\nwhat’s really been missing in this recovery is wage growth of around 3 or 3½ percent. That’s the\nrate I’d expect in a fully functioning economy with a 2 percent inflation rate. Now we’re starting\nto see that come to fruition, and it’s a good sign.\nThe employment side of our mandate has made tremendous progress over the past few\nyears, and taken together, all signs point to a labor market that is zeroing in on full employment.\nHowever, as we make our way back to an economy that’s at full health, it’s important to\nconsider what we should expect along the way. The pace of output and employment growth, as\nwell as the decline in the unemployment rate, have slowed recently…but that’s to be expected.\nLast year the economy added slightly more than 3 million jobs. So far this year, we’re on track to\nadd about 2.5 million, with a further slowdown likely. When unemployment was at its 10 percent\npeak during the height of the Great Recession, and as it struggled to come down during the\nrecovery, we needed a fast pace of decline. With the goal in sight, however, the urgency is not\nthe same. Then, we needed to create lots of jobs to get the economy back on track; now that\nwe’re getting closer, the pace of job gains needs to start slowing to more normal levels.\nLooking towards next year, what we really want to see is an economy that’s growing at a\nsteady pace of around 2 percent. If jobs and growth kept the same pace as last year, we would\nseriously overshoot our mark. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and\nit’s actually desirable, that the pace is slowing.\n6\n\nInflation\nOf course, nothing is perfect. I generally think of myself as an optimist, and as someone\nonce said, “Being an optimist after you’ve got everything you want doesn’t count.” Accordingly,\neven with the positive signs I’ve mentioned, I still don’t have everything I want: Inflation is still\nwell below our 2 percent goal. In fact, it has been virtually intransigent, stubbornly refusing to\nmeet our goal for over three years now.\nToday’s low rate is in part due to transitory factors like the past fall in energy prices and\nthe strength of the dollar.5 With oil prices having moved back up from past lows and the dollar\nretracing some of its past gains, their effects on inflation will recede. In addition, with the\neconomy nearing full strength, we should start seeing signs that underlying inflation trends are\ncoming back up.\nBut, so far, that remains a forecast, not a reality. Recent inflation readings are fine, to use\na technical economic term. But they haven’t yet shown convincing signs that the underlying\ntrend has bottomed out and is poised to start moving back up to 2 percent. In a nutshell: the\ninflation data haven’t been discouraging, but they haven’t been as encouraging as I would like,\neither.\nNonetheless, I still expect inflation to move back up to our target over the next couple of\nyears. With a strengthening economy, special factors dissipating, wages on the rise, inflation\nexpectations stable at 2 percent, and, importantly, full employment right around the corner, I see\nall the factors in place to meet our inflation goal by the end of next year.6 But the point of being\ndata dependent is that information drives your decisions; and while my forecast looks great, I am\nwary of acting before gathering more evidence that inflation’s trajectory is on the desired path.\n5 Williams (2015).\n6 See Nechio (2015) regarding inflation expectations.\n7\n\nImplications for monetary policy\nWhich leads to everyone’s favorite question: What does this mean for monetary policy?\nBy which, I obviously mean interest rates, which is apparently what most people care about.\nAs I say without fail, policy is data dependent. And the difficulty of being data dependent\nis that data can be all over the place. Until I have more confidence that inflation will be moving\nback to 2 percent, I’ll continue to be in wait-and-see mode. That doesn’t mean I’m changing my\nforecast; it means economic forecasting and the data-based assessments required to make\nimpactful policy decisions are two different things. I’ll be looking at the evidence, and, as I’ve\nsaid almost as much as I’ve uttered the phrase “data dependent,” every FOMC meeting is on the\ntable.\nI still believe this will be the year for liftoff, and I still believe that waiting too long to\nraise rates poses its own risks. I know not everyone agrees and there are those who believe we\nshould wait until we’re nipping at the heels of 2 percent. My reasons for advocating a rise before\nthat happens remain the same. Monetary policy has long and variable lags, as Milton Friedman\nfamously taught us.7 Specifically, research shows it takes at least a year or two to have its full\neffect.8 We’re therefore dealing with my favorite analogy: The car speeding towards a red light.\nIf you don’t ease up on the gas, you’ll have to slam on the brakes, possibly even skidding into\nthe intersection. Waiting until we’re close enough to dance with 2 percent means running the\nvery real risk of having to dramatically raise rates to reverse course, which could destabilize\nmarkets and potentially derail the recovery. I see a safer course in starting sooner and proceeding\nmore gradually.\n7 Friedman (1961).\n8 Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n8\n\nIt’s also important to remember that when we do raise rates, we will not be instituting\ntight policy; we’ll be easing back on extremely accommodative policy, and those are two very\ndifferent things. Policy will continue to be accommodative, and the Fed’s $4 trillion-plus balance\nsheet will continue to provide substantial stimulus. There’s no need to worry that we’re cutting\nthe legs out from underneath the economy.\nConclusion\nAll in all, things are looking good. I see growth on a solid trajectory, full employment\njust in front of us, wages on the rise, and inflation gradually moving back up to meet our goal. I\ncan’t tell you the date of liftoff, but I can say that it’s going to be an interesting rest of the year\nfor monetary policy, and the Fed in general. Thank you.\n9\n\nReferences\nAruoba, S.

    "text": "Presentation to Lambda Alpha International and Arizona Bankers Association\nPhoenix, Arizona\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on January 7, 2014\nHousing, Banking, and the Recovery: The Outlook\nThank you, Sheila, for that kind introduction. And thank you again for your years of\nservice to the San Francisco Fed. It’s great to be back in Phoenix again, and I’m pleased to start\nthe year off on a positive note.\nAfter years of fits and starts, the economy appears to be on a much stronger path than\nwe’ve seen in some time. It was only eighteen months ago that the satirical newspaper The\nOnion ran the headline, “Nation’s Economists Quietly Evacuating their Families.” That was\nthen. More recently, the economic data have been quite encouraging, and there’s reason to\nbelieve that this year, the economic recovery will gain further momentum.\nSince we’re being hosted by Lambda Alpha International and the Arizona Bankers\nAssociation, I’d like to talk to you today about the housing market and banking conditions. I’ll\nalso give an overview of where I see the economy and, of course, monetary policy, going. As\nusual, let me say here that the views expressed today are entirely mine and do not necessarily\nreflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\nHousing market\nSome of the good news has been coming from a sector many of you know well: housing.\nNationally, the housing market started its rebound in early 2012, and the recovery has been fairly\nsteady since.\nThis improvement has been propelled by several forces. First, the Fed’s very\naccommodative monetary policy supported historically low mortgage rates. Second, housing\nprices had seen a steep decline—and the cost of a new home is still much lower than at the\nmarket’s peak. Third, as the labor market improves, household incomes are rising. That is, with\nlow mortgage rates, cheaper houses and more money in Americans’ bank accounts, housing is\naffordable again and the market has seen a reversal. Sales and prices are up substantially. In\nfact, prices on existing homes have risen at double-digit rates nationwide over the past year.1\nThey are now up by about 20 percent from the lows reached in 2011.\nThis improvement in home prices and sales has created a virtuous cycle: The rebound in\nthe market has helped to reduce foreclosures, which are almost back to pre-crash levels. Fewer\nforeclosures means fewer distressed sales—which means fewer houses being sold at drastically\nreduced prices. Fewer distressed sales means less supply and fewer sellers willing to take a\nloss—which strengthens prices further. As prices strengthen and the market looks up, builders\n1 National house price numbers are based on the CoreLogic National Home Price Index (including distressed sales)\nunless otherwise indicated (data currently through October).\n2\n\nsee the increase in demand, which bolsters new home construction. That, of course, boosts\nbusinesses in related industries—like building materials, home furnishings and appliances—and\ncreates jobs, lots of jobs.\nOf course, there’s always a caveat. You’ve probably heard the story of Harry Truman\nwanting a one-handed economist, because he was tired of hearing, “On the other hand…” So,\n“on the other hand,” the recovery in the housing sector comes with concerns that prices might be\nrising too rapidly. I don’t think this should set off alarm bells, at least yet.\nFirst, there are important differences between circumstances now and what we saw\nleading into the crisis. Lending standards and financial oversight are much stricter, for one.2 For\nanother, recent price increases have in large part reversed an overreaction in the market during\nthe housing crash. That is, house prices don’t look that out of line with fundamentals overall. In\naddition, prices may be affected by the limited numbers of homes currently for sale. It looks as\nthough owners have been holding off putting their houses up for sale, waiting for the market to\nstrengthen even further.3 That would mean there are plenty of houses ready and waiting on the\nsidelines. I expect to see more of these houses come back on the market, and the resulting\nincrease in supply should help temper upward pressure on prices.\n2 Swanson (2013).\n3 Krainer and Hedberg (2013).\n3\n\nSecond, other factors are keeping the rebound in check. Mortgage rates rose last year,\nwhich dampened sales, slowing momentum in house prices. And while there’s been a sizable\nincrease in housing construction, it’s still low by historical standards. To put numbers to that: It\nlooks like about 600,000-plus single-family homes were started in 2013, based on the data\nthrough November. The longer-term annual average is about 1 million per year. So, we are\nnowhere near “boom” levels of housing construction.\nAs for Arizona specifically, I don’t have to tell anyone here that you felt the worst of the\ncrash. But you have also been home to one of the earliest and strongest recoveries. Home prices\nin Phoenix more than doubled between 2000 and mid-2006. By late 2009, the crisis had plunged\nvalues back to almost 2000 levels and foreclosures reached nearly double the national rate.\nToday, prices in Phoenix are up by about 45 percent over the worst lows, and Arizona’s\nforeclosures were actually below the national rate, according to the latest data. Although\nPhoenix housing indicators have moderated some in recent months, as they have nationwide, the\ntrends remain positive.\nDistrict banking sector\nThe banking recovery in the western states has also been improving. Just as an aside,\ntoday is a birthday of sorts for American banking. The country’s first commercial bank—the\nBank of North America—opened in Philadelphia on January 7th, 1782.\n4\n\nSo as an anniversary present, I’m pleased to say that banking conditions have improved\nsteadily across the Federal Reserve’s 12th District, which covers the nine westernmost states,\nincluding Arizona. This improvement reflects the recovery in the housing market and the overall\neconomy.\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve has an appraisal system for banks’ soundness\nthat we refer to as CAMELS ratings. For the uninitiated, the letters in CAMELS stand for\ncapital; asset quality; management capability; earnings; liquidity; and sensitivity to market risk.\nMany of the 12th District’s banks have seen improvement in all of these areas over the past few\nyears. Banks are generally better capitalized, with more liquid assets; earnings have improved;\nand new loans have increased while past-due ones have diminished.4\nLooking more closely at local conditions, Arizona’s increase in the pace of loans from\nlate-2012 to late-2013 was among the fastest in the nation, which is great. However, the damage\ndone by the recession is still evident in the high number of non-performing loans.5\nDespite signs of overall improvement in banking conditions, I recognize that District\nbanks face general challenges as well. There are two concerns I hear most often from bankers,\nparticularly those from smaller community banks. First, banks’ profits are being squeezed by\n4 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Banking Supervision and Regulation (2013a).\n5 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Banking Supervision and Regulation (2013b).\n5\n\nnarrow interest spreads. Second, there is a concern that some banks may be underestimating the\nrisks to their health posed by future increases in interest rates.\nFor the non-bankers out there: The FOMC has kept short-term interest rates near zero for\nthe past five years. That’s the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s monetary policy\ndecision-making body. We did this in order to lower interest costs to consumers and businesses\nand thereby increase spending to get the economy moving again.\nHowever, low short-term interest rates have helped to keep market interest rates low in\ngeneral. When interest rates are low, banks earn less money from the loans they’ve made. At\nthe same time, it’s hard to offset this by lowering the rate they pay on deposits. As a result, banks\nare worried about the gap between the return they make when they loan money and the rate they\npay on deposits. That is, the “narrow interest spreads.”\nThere’s no question that these narrow interest spreads have been depressing bank\nearnings. However, I expect slow but steady progress on earnings as banking conditions\ncontinue to improve. As the economy strengthens, banks will make more loans, increasing the\nincome they make.\nBanks are also concerned about the risks associated with rising interest rates. The\nreasoning is that the value of some assets—particularly longer-term ones, like bonds—falls when\ninterest rates rise.\n6\n\nThis is something we and other bank regulators are keeping a close eye on. Many banks\nin our District, especially smaller ones, have increased their longer-term asset holdings in a\n“reach for yield.” All else being equal, longer-term assets tend to deliver higher rates of return,\nand banks are looking to offset lower earnings from the narrow interest spread. There was a\nslight rise in longer-term interest rates seen during the second and third quarters of 2013.\nConsequently, the market value of longer-term securities held by banks fell. The balance sheets\nof community banks in our District, therefore, showed some unrealized losses on investment\nsecurities. These amounts are relatively small, so the risk remains very manageable for the time\nbeing. This is particularly true given the substantial increase in bank capital over the past few\nyears. However, our supervision and regulation group feels that a significant minority of banks\nin the District is unduly exposed to this risk. They have therefore increased both supervisory\noversight and resources available for bankers to manage that risk.6\nThe state of the economy today\nThe strengthening conditions in banking and housing are signs of overall economic\nimprovement. Economic growth picked up steadily during the first three quarters of 2013, and I\nexpect it to pick up further this year. As I mentioned, recovery in the housing sector has helped\ndrive consumer spending, particularly on items such as furniture and appliances. Manufacturing\n6 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Banking Supervision and Regulation (2013a).\n7\n\nhas also strengthened, spurred in part by a recovery in overseas demand and the resulting export\ngrowth.\nThis newfound momentum is partly due to an easing of headwinds that had been holding\nback growth over the past few years. One was the lingering effects of the financial crisis.7 A\nhealthier banking sector, and improving stock and house prices, are signs of that headwind\ndiminishing.\nAdditionally, government fiscal policy will be less of an issue. Further significant federal\nspending cuts appear to be off the table for now. State and local governments have seen\nsubstantial budgetary improvements, allowing them to hire and spend somewhat more freely. In\nfact, state and local government employment increased last year, showing gains for the first time\nin more than four years.\nFor a while, there was concern that the partisan bickering and brinkmanship in\nWashington would deal a knockout blow to business and consumer confidence. While the\ngovernment shutdown did cause confidence to plummet, it quickly rebounded once the fiscal\nstalemate was resolved.\nHiring continued as well: The economy added about 200,000 jobs a month from August\nthrough November, a small pickup from the pace over the past few years. It appears that\nbusinesses and households are getting used to—and therefore are less alarmed by—recurring\n7 Jordà et al. (2011).\n8\n\nbattles over Washington’s spending and the debt ceiling. Uncertainty—about the economy,\nfiscal policy, and myriad other concerns—has been a key factor holding back the recovery. The\nreturn of some semblance of calm in Washington, D.C., accompanied by the recent budget deal,\nis cause for hope that some of the hostilities are easing. This should temper at least one source of\nuncertainty.\nAs a result of these various positive developments, I see growth of real, that is, inflation-\nadjusted, gross domestic product picking up, from about 2½ percent in 2013 to about 3 percent\nthis year and next.\nLabor market conditions\nThe ongoing economic recovery has fostered a steady improvement in labor markets.\nThe unemployment rate is now down fully three percentage points from the worst days in 2009,\nwhen it hit 10 percent.\nThe unemployment rate is often seen as the best indicator of labor market health; it is\ntherefore a number we rely on heavily. However, there are also encouraging signs from the other\nmeasures of labor market conditions. We see a rising number of households that say they feel\njobs are abundant and available. More small businesses say they are having difficulty filling\nopen positions. And more people are quitting their jobs. That may not sound like good news,\nbut it is! People obviously don’t quit jobs if they’re not confident they can find other, better\nones. So we’re seeing a much more upbeat outlook from workers and employers.\n9\n\nThe one indicator that remains stubbornly low is the share of the population with a job.\nSince the recession ended, that number has been stuck near its lowest level in 30 years. This is\npartly because the economy has not fully recovered all the jobs it lost during the recession.8 But,\nimportantly, it is also because of longer-term factors that monetary policy cannot address. There\nis the ageing population, for one. For another, there is the rising number of working-age people\nreceiving permanent disability benefits. This has been a growing phenomenon as the labor\nmarket stayed stubbornly unfriendly to low-wage workers for a number of years.9 When we\nadjust for these factors, we actually see that the employment-to-population ratio is telling\nbasically the same story as the unemployment rate and other labor market indicators.\nMonetary policy\nAll these economic improvements affect how we set monetary policy. People often think\nof the Fed’s responsibility purely in terms of managing, or fighting, inflation. In fact, we have a\ndual mandate from Congress: stable prices, yes, but also maximum employment. In its simplest\nterms, there should be enough jobs for everyone and your paycheck should hold its value.\nAs you know, the FOMC recently scaled back on our bond purchases, moving from $85\nbillion a month to $75 billion. This bond-buying program is generally referred to as\n8 Between January 2008 and February 2010, the United States lost 8.7 million nonfarm payroll jobs. As of\nNovember 2013, 7.4 million have been regained (about 85 percent of the lost jobs).\n9 Autor and Duggan (2006).\n10\n\n“quantitative easing” or “QE” by people outside the Fed. Inside the Fed, it’s less elegantly\nreferred to as LSAPs. That stands for large-scale asset purchases.\nThis program was part of our response to the financial crisis and slow recovery. During\nthe worst days of the recession, the economy was struggling despite the fact that the Federal\nReserve had lowered short-term interest rates to near zero, in order to encourage spending.\nHowever, lowering the funds rate wasn’t enough to get the economy back on track. We couldn’t\nmove short-term interest rates lower, because interest rates can’t fall much below zero.\nWith the economy still sluggish, we turned to unconventional methods, including the\nlarge-scale asset purchases. This program of buying assets has proven to be a very useful\ncomplement to our conventional policy tool of setting short-term interest rates. By buying\nbonds, we pushed up the price of these assets. As a result, rates on longer-term loans like auto\nloans and home mortgages came down.\nWhen interest rates are low, people are more likely to make purchases—particularly more\nexpensive items that require loans. Cars and appliances, for instance, and working capital in the\ncase of businesses. As demand for goods and services goes up, businesses can expand,\npurchasing more supplies and hiring more workers. Businesses down the supply chain then\ngrow, newly hired workers have more money to spend, and it all gets money flowing back into\nthe economy. With the economy having improved so much and the future looking brighter, it\nwas time to start taking our foot off the accelerator and ease up on the monetary stimulus.\n11\n\nAssuming the economic recovery plays out as we expect, we will likely continue to\nreduce the pace of those purchases, and eventually eliminate them, over this year. This will be an\nimportant first step towards eventually bringing monetary policy back to a more normal setting.\nAs the FOMC has said repeatedly, these policy steps will depend on prevailing economic\nconditions and the economic outlook, rather than on some fixed date on the calendar. As far as\nthose conditions go: While there have been significant improvements, unemployment remains\nabove what we usually see in a sustained economic recovery. The current rate of 7 percent is\nwell above the typical estimate of the sustainable level of unemployment, which is between 5\nand 6 percent.\nThe other half of our mandate is price stability. Inflation has been too low for some time\nnow. I know that sounds odd to some people; high inflation is generally thought to be the\ndanger. Those of us who lived through the 1970s and early 1980s remember the havoc it can\nwreak: spiraling energy and food prices, incredibly high interest rates, and paychecks eaten up by\nthe ever-increasing cost of living.\nExcessively low inflation, however, is also a problem. The Fed defines price stability as\nan inflation rate of 2 percent.10 Both overall inflation and core inflation—which is the measure\nafter we strip out the volatile energy and food components—have been running below 2 percent\n10 See the statement of longer-term goals and policy strategy released by the FOMC in January 2012 (Board of\nGovernors 2012).\n12\n\nsince April of 2012. It does appear that inflation has finally bottomed out, and will move back to\nwhere we want it over the next few years. However, I expect it will take time for inflation to get\nback to 2 percent.\nIn a nutshell, the combination of too-high unemployment and too-low inflation calls for\ncontinued monetary accommodation. In this regard, I want to stress that scaling back on asset\npurchases is not a retreat from accommodative monetary policy. The federal funds rate will\nremain near zero for the foreseeable future. Specifically, as the FOMC put it, “well past the time\nthat the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent, especially if projected inflation continues\nto run below the committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.” That’s actually one of our shorter\npolicy sentences—the Fed isn’t known for its brevity. In other words, we’re starting to ease off\nthe gas, but we’re nowhere near hitting the brakes yet.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, things are definitely looking up. We’re still not where the economy should\nbe, but we’re well on the road to recovery, and I see things getting better in the year ahead.\nThank you.\n13\n\nReferences\nAutor, David H., and Mark G.

    "text": "Presentation at the Community Leaders Luncheon, Portland, OR\nBy John C. Williams\nExecutive Vice President and Director of Research, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor Delivery on July 28, 2010\nThe Economic Outlook: Moving Forward on a Bumpy Road\nThanks very much for coming today. The topic of my talk is the economic outlook. My remarks\nrepresent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. Recent\neconomic data have been disappointing and there’s no denying that the economy has hit a bit of a\nrough patch. Still, I believe that the recovery that has been in train for about a year is still on\ncourse, albeit at a more subdued pace. We economists keep a list of words we use to describe\neconomic growth. It’s very carefully calibrated from “torrid” at one end to “freefall” at the\nother. Unfortunately, after a period when it looked like the recovery was building up a head of\nsteam, we lost some of that momentum this spring. We’ve been moving down that list of words\nfrom “rapid” for a brief time late last year to “moderate.” And now we are getting close to\nmerely “modest.” The silver lining is that we’re still better than “meager” and “anemic.” And,\nthankfully, we are still several notches above “double dip recession.”\nAs I just mentioned, recent data have been less than stellar. The upward trend in\nspending and consumer confidence that had appeared to be steadily building has dissipated.\nConsumer spending had grown smartly—another word on our list—through the spring. But, it\nappears that this surge was just a short-lived bounce from the very steep spending plunge that\noccurred in the wake of the financial crisis. In May and June, retail sales fell. Consumer\nconfidence had likewise been on the mend. But bad news about the fiscal crisis in Europe, the\nvolatility in the stock market, and continued weakness in housing and employment have taken\ntheir toll.\nAuto sales are a telling barometer of households’ reluctance to open their pocketbooks.\nSales of motor vehicles have plateaued at about an 11.3-million-vehicle annual rate. That’s well\nup from the trough of about 9 million seen in early 2009, but about 30 percent below the over 16\nmillion we saw the previous decade. Perhaps not surprisingly, with unemployment and debt\nlevels still high, ordinary Americans are weighed down by worries about the future. The old car\nin the garage is still going, the old washer still gets the clothes clean, so they’re putting off big-\nticket purchases and limiting spending mainly to essentials.\nHousing, of course, was one of the main causes of our problems. So it was very\nencouraging many months ago when housing started showing signs of coming back. Sales\nvolume picked up, home prices stabilized, and the mood of panic abated. More recently, though,\nhousing has slipped back into the doldrums. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers provided a\nshot in the arm. But now that that program is winding down, sales have slid back to very low\nlevels. Not many houses are selling, despite rock-bottom interest rates, very favorable home\naffordability, and improvements in the availability of credit. Given this weak demand, new\nconstruction is nearly dormant. So the harsh reality is this: In the aftermath of the worst housing\n1\n\nbust in over 70 years, it may take a long time before buyers will be able to get out of their heads\nthe old rock-and-roll refrain “we won’t get fooled again.”\nFor commercial real estate, the situation is even worse. The weak economy has driven\nvacancies up. Nationally, the price of commercial real estate has fallen about 40 percent, greater\nthan the decline in home prices of about 30 percent.\nOne of the things that brought us back to growth was fiscal stimulus from the federal\ngovernment, which trimmed taxes and increased spending. That stimulus will play a smaller role\ngoing forward. On top of that, state and local government budgets across the country are under\nimmense strain. Spending by these government units accounts for about 12 percent of the\neconomy, and spending cuts and tax increases at these levels mean that this sector won’t\ncontribute to economic recovery for some time.\nNow, the ability of economists to forecast the economy is often compared—usually\nunfavorably—to the ability of meteorologists to forecast the weather. In our defense, economic\nforecasting faces hurdles meteorologists don’t have to deal with. As the Nobel prize-winning\nphysicist Murray Gell-Mann quipped: “Think how hard physics would be if particles could\nthink.” Well, in our field, the “particles”—men and women who work, shop, run businesses, and\ninvest—do think, though admittedly not always coolly and calmly. And, in this sense,\nperception can matter as much as hard numbers.\nHouseholds, businesses, and investors have endured painful economic and financial\ntrauma over the past few years. It will take considerable time for confidence and trust to heal.\nWe know from past experience here and around the world that recoveries from financial crises\ntake a lot longer than recoveries from “usual” recessions. Indeed, businesspeople and consumers\ntoday are extraordinarily cautious and averse to all kinds of perceived risks, whether from the\neconomy, financial markets, or government policies. This caution is manifesting itself in a\nreluctance to invest or hire unless absolutely necessary.\nThe fiscal crisis in Europe provides a case in point of how confidence can turn on a dime.\nFortunately, European governments and the International Monetary Fund appear to have acted\neffectively to stop the crisis from spreading. Therefore, I expect confidence to slowly rebuild\nafter the recent stumbles.\nOf course, eventually, housing, commercial real estate, and other hard-hit sectors will\nreturn. After all, the population of the United States grows by over 2½ million people a year and\nthose people need roofs over their heads. And all of those old cars and washing machines will\neventually start looking pretty creaky compared with the snazzy stuff in the showrooms. We’ve\nalready seen just this process take place in technology where both consumers and businesses\nhave overcome their hesitation to buy the latest gear. I don’t know how much confidence it takes\nto buy an iPad or an iPhone, but whatever it is, millions of people obviously have it.\nAlthough discouraging, the recent softness in the economic data looks much more like a\nbump in the road of what we already thought would be a gradual recovery, rather than a swerve\ninto the ditch. Importantly, monetary policy remains highly supportive of recovery. Interest\nrates are extraordinarily low. And we’ve seen a marked improvement in the willingness of\ninvestors to take on reasonable risks, as measured by interest rate spreads between corporate\n2\n\nsecurities and safe Treasury securities, as well as other metrics. At the same time, even though\nthe bank loan market hasn’t fully recovered, banks are somewhat more willing to extend credit.\nOur forecast at the San Francisco Fed is for GDP growth of about 2½ percent this year.\nWe expect growth to pick up steam next year to between 3½ and 4 percent. Such a growth\nforecast pales compared with past recoveries from deep recessions, for the reason I noted earlier:\nIt takes a long time to bounce back from financial crisis. Still, if the economy expands at this\npace, we should see some job growth over the next year and a half.\nBut that growth could be lackluster. Unless the economy picks up faster than I expect,\nunemployment will come down with agonizing slowness. The official June unemployment rate\nwas 9½ percent. That’s about half a percentage point below its recent peak, but still terribly\nhigh. And this figure masks how bad the problems really are. If you count all the people who\nwant jobs but have given up looking and all those who are working part time for economic\nreasons, this broader measure of unemployment is 16.5 percent—enormously high by historical\nstandards.\nAnd there’s more: The share of people who have been out of a job for more than six\nmonths has skyrocketed during the recession. In the past two recessions, this figure peaked at\nabout 23 percent. This time, it’s double that—46 percent. That’s right. Nearly half the people\nwe officially count as unemployed have been out of work for more than six months. Long-term\nunemployment is particularly troublesome because it erodes job skills and attachment to the\nlabor market, and places tremendous hardships on families. This rise in long-term\nunemployment is a measure of how deep and prolonged this recession has been, plus the fact that\nwe really have not seen much job creation yet. As the economy improves, most of the long-term\nunemployed are likely to find jobs in the industries in which they previously worked. However,\na significant fraction of the jobs lost in the recession may never come back. Some workers will\nneed to shift to other expanding sectors of the economy. That process will require retraining and\ntime, and it means the economy will take that much longer to return to its potential.\nIndeed, given the outlook for only modest growth through the end of the year, I expect\nunemployment to end 2010 at about its current level of 9½ percent. Once growth picks up to a\nmore robust pace, the unemployment rate should gradually decline, but only to about 8½ percent\nby the end of next year. I expect it will take several years before it returns to more normal levels.\nI’d like to switch now to a topic that’s been hotly debated in recent months—inflation.\nFor every expert who’s convinced we’re in danger of an episode of runaway prices, you can find\nanother expert just as convinced that we’re due for a sustained deflation, that is, continuously\nfalling prices. I think these outcomes are highly unlikely. I expect inflation to remain low,\ndipping to around 1 percent, but not get stuck in negative deflationary territory. Then inflation\nshould move gradually back to about 2 percent as the economy fully recovers.\nLet’s take a moment to examine the fear of higher inflation. Much of it is based on the\nview that the Fed has been creating huge amounts of money in recent years to boost the\neconomy—“printing money,” if you will. Now it’s true that the Fed has taken extraordinary\nsteps to get the economy moving. The monetary base—that is, the amount of currency in the\neconomy plus the reserves held by banks at the Fed—has jumped to about $2 trillion from about\n$830 billion two years ago. In normal times, such an increase in the money supply would be\n3\n\nhighly inflationary because too much money would be chasing too few goods, driving prices up.\nBut, these are not normal times. Not at all. Simply put, the vast majority of this “money” isn’t\ngetting out into the economy and circulating. Instead, it’s just sitting collecting electronic dust.\nIn fact, the standard measure of the money stock in use by households and businesses is called\nM2. It includes currency and various types of bank deposits. Despite a more-than-doubling of\nthe monetary base, this measure has risen only 11 percent over the past two years, significant,\nbut hardly alarming.\nWage and price data show that inflation has been trending lower, rather than higher. The\nconsumer price index, or CPI, has risen a little over 1 percent over the past 12 months. The most\nrecent monthly readings on CPI inflation are even lower. This very low level of inflation\nillustrates just how much slack there is in the economy and matches what businesspeople say: in\nthis weak economy, they have little pricing power. You can see it at many levels. Weak demand\nis reducing the ability of vendors to boost prices, which is lowering cost pressures on businesses.\nAt the same time, businesses have little ability to impose price increases on their own customers.\nWith unemployment so high, workers are happy to have jobs and not inclined to press for raises.\nOver the past year, private sector employee compensation has grown only about 1½ percent.\nWith the economy recovering slowly, I don’t see this picture changing anytime soon.\nGiven this widespread weakness, should we be worried about deflation instead? There is\na small risk of deflation, especially if it takes longer for the economy to recover than I expect.\nBut I view a sustained period of deflation as unlikely for a couple of reasons. First, price trends\naren’t nearly as sensitive to the state of the economy as they used to be. For example, core\ninflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was running at about an annual rate of\n2.6 percent at the onset of the recession, higher than the rate of about 2 percent that most\nmembers of the Fed’s policymaking committee have said is appropriate. That inflation rate has\ndipped to 1.3 percent today, two-and-a-half years into arguably the worst recession since the\nGreat Depression. In other words, despite such an awful downturn, we’re now only about as far\nbelow the desired rate as we were above it before the recession started.\nOne reason for the relatively muted response of inflation to the recession is expectations.\nThe public is pretty confident that the Fed will do what it takes to eventually return to and\nmaintain a low, positive rate of inflation. In the jargon of economists, inflation expectations are\nwell anchored. The Fed earned this credibility over decades during which it kept inflation low\nand stable. We see evidence of this anchoring in survey responses of the general public and\neconomic forecasters, as well as in the prices that financial market participants pay for securities\nthat protect against inflation. This anchoring of expectations helps tame inflationary swings,\nputting both a floor on how low inflation will go and a ceiling on any potential rise.\nWhat all of this means is that the economy is still on a recovery path, with moderate\ngrowth, and that inflation will remain very low. But we face significant risks to this outlook and\nneed to remain vigilant. Thank you very much.\n4",

    "text": "Presentation to Community Leaders Luncheon\nSalt Lake City, UT\nBy John C. Williams, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nFor delivery on October 1, 2015\nThe Economic Outlook: Live Long and Prosper\nGood afternoon, and thank you.\nIt’s a pleasure to be in Salt Lake City. I should extend my congratulations to the Utah\nUtes for their win over the Ducks last week—62–20! Of course, Oregon is also part of the Fed’s\n12th District, and as president, I try not to take sides on any games. Except Giants versus\nDodgers.\nA lot has happened, economically speaking, since I was last here a few years ago. So\ntoday I’d like to give an update on the outlook, monetary policy, and where I see us headed.\nBefore I get going, I should stress that the views expressed here today are mine alone and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic outlook\nI shouldn’t have to issue a spoiler alert before I say that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee decided to hold off on raising interest rates at our last meeting. I considered it a close\ncall, in part reflecting the conflicting signals we’re getting: On the one hand, the U.S. economy\ncontinues to strengthen and is closing in on full employment, while on the other, global\ndevelopments pose downside risks.\nThe unequivocally good news is that the economic expansion is entering its seventh year\nwith solid momentum. Over the past five years, real GDP growth has averaged a little over 2\npercent and the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly a percentage point per year. I expect that\npace of recovery to continue, despite strong global headwinds.\n1\n\nConsumer spending is powering the economy. We’ve seen real consumer spending\nincrease more than 3 percent over the past year and auto sales are on pace to reach 17 million\nvehicles this year—the highest level seen since the early 2000s. Strong fundamentals point to\ncontinued solid gains going forward: Despite the recent declines in the stock market, the ratio of\nwealth to income is close to all-time highs, household debt burden has come down considerably,\nand real income growth—helped by the drop in energy prices—remains strong. Business\nspending is on an upswing as well. Overall, I see real GDP increasing at a 2¼ percent annual rate\nin the second half of 2015, and GDP growth to be a little above 2 percent next year.\nThe labor market continues to improve as well. We’re on pace to add 2.5 million jobs this\nyear and job vacancies are the highest they’ve been since they started collecting the data back in\n2000. Given the progress we’ve made and the momentum we’re seeing, we should reach or\nexceed full employment on a broad set of measures by the end of this year or early next year. In\nparticular, I expect the unemployment rate to fall below 5 percent later this year and remain there\nthrough 2016.\nThis brings me to the question of how to gauge what a healthy, full-employment labor\nmarket looks like. The most common metric is the “natural rate” of unemployment—the optimal\nrate we can expect in a fully functioning economy. Before the recession, it was generally thought\nto be around 5 percent.1 Since then, there has been a lot of research examining whether the\nevents of the past decade have pushed the natural rate up—say, due to an increasing skills\nmismatch between workers and jobs—or down, owing to changes in the demographic makeup of\nthe labor force—that is, a greater representation in the workforce of groups that tend to have\nlower unemployment rates.2 My assessment is that there has not been any lasting, significant\n1 Weidner and Williams (2011).\n2 Aaronson et al. (2015), Daly et al. (2012), and Lazear and Spletzer (2012).\n2\n\nshift in either direction. My estimate of the natural rate of unemployment today is 5 percent,\nconsistent with pre-recession estimates. With the current rate at 5.1 percent, we are very close.\nTurning to inflation: It is still lower than I’d like. Based on my favorite measure—the\ntrimmed mean—the underlying rate is stable at just over 1½ percent. To understand why\ninflation has remained low despite an economy nearing full employment, we have to look\nbeyond our shores. The rise of the dollar and the fall in oil prices over the past year have lowered\nimport prices and pushed the inflation rate down. Based on past experience, these effects should\nprove transitory. As they dissipate, and as the economy strengthens further over the next year, I\nsee inflation moving back up to our 2 percent goal in the next two years.\nThere are upside risks to my forecast, specifically an even stronger and faster rebound in\nhousing and a more pronounced spending boom from lower energy prices. So far, lower oil\nprices haven’t caused much of a surge in consumption, but as people get used to paying less, that\ncould change. And there are, of course, the downside risks: There’s the threat of slowdowns and\nspillovers from abroad, and the dollar could appreciate further.\nOn raising rates\nThese domestic and global developments have implications for monetary policy. We’re\nbalancing a number of considerations, some of which argue for a little more patience in raising\nrates and others that argue for acting sooner rather than later. Our decisions reflect a careful\njudgment about the relative risks and merits of those factors.\nI’ll start with the arguments for being a bit more patient in removing monetary\naccommodation. For one, we are constrained by the zero lower bound in monetary policy and\nthis creates an asymmetry in our ability to respond to changing circumstances. That is, we can’t\n3\n\nmove rates much below zero if the economy slows or inflation declines even further. By contrast,\nif we delay, and growth or inflation pick up quickly, we can easily raise rates in response.3\nThis concern is exemplified by downside risks from abroad. Economic conditions and\npolicies from China to Europe to Brazil have contributed to a substantial increase in the dollar’s\nvalue. This has held back U.S. growth and inflation over the past year.4 Further bad news from\nabroad could add to these effects.\nInflation has been below our 2 percent target for more than three years now. This is not\nunique to the United States. Although we ultimately control our own inflation rate, there’s no\nquestion that globally low inflation, and the policy responses this has provoked, has contributed\nto downward pressure in the U.S. As I said, my forecast is that inflation will bounce back, but\nthis is just a forecast, and there is the risk that it could take longer than I expect. With inflation\npersistently running below our target, some argue that the need to start normalizing monetary\npolicy is not pressing.\nThose are some of the main arguments on the side of the ledger arguing for a little more\npatience. On the other side is the insight of Milton Friedman, who famously taught us that\nmonetary policy has long and variable lags.5 I like to use a car analogy to illustrate it. If you’re\nheaded towards a red light, you take your foot off the gas so you can get ready to stop. If you\ndon’t, you’re going to wind up slamming on the brakes and very possibly skidding into the\nintersection.\nIn addition, an earlier start to raising rates would allow us to engineer a smoother, more\ngradual process of policy normalization. That would give us space to fine-tune our responses to\nreact to economic conditions. In contrast, raising rates too late would force us into the position of\n3 Evans et al. (2015).\n4 See, for example, Amiti and Bodine-Smith (2015).\n5 Friedman (1961).\n4\n\na steeper and more abrupt path of rate hikes, which doesn’t leave much room for maneuver. Not\nto mention, it could roil financial markets and slow the economy in unintended ways.\nFinally, experience teaches us that an economy that runs beyond its potential for too long\ncan generate imbalances that ultimately lead to either excessive inflation or an economic\ncorrection and recession. Two recent examples are sobering. In the late-1990s, the expansion\nbecame increasingly fueled by the euphoria over the “new economy,” the dot-com bubble, and\nmassive overinvestment in tech-related industries. In the first half of the 2000s, the economy\nbecame increasingly reliant on irrational exuberance over housing, resulting in house prices\nspiraling far beyond fundamentals and massive overbuilding. Of course, in both cases, those\nfantasies burst at great cost to our economy.\nI want to be clear that, in raising concerns about the potential for imbalances, I’m not\ntalking about fighting the last war. It is a more general point: When you have a high-pressure\neconomy, with unsustainably high levels of economic activity for a long period of time, people\nmay make decisions based on excessive optimism, rather than sound economic basics. That\nmentality can happen any time, but it’s emboldened by an economy that’s on a tear.\nI am starting to see signs of imbalances emerge in the form of high asset prices,\nespecially in real estate, and that trips the alert system. One lesson I have taken from past\nepisodes is that, once the imbalances have grown large, the options to deal with them are limited.\nI think back to the mid-2000s, when we faced the question of whether the Fed should raise rates\nand risk pricking the bubble or let things run full steam ahead and deal with the consequences\nlater. What stayed with me were not the relative merits of either case, but the fact that by then,\nwith the housing boom in full swing, it was already too late to avoid bad outcomes. Stopping the\nfallout would’ve required acting much earlier, when the problems were still manageable. I’m not\n5\n\nassigning blame by any means, and economic hindsight is always 20/20. But I am conscious that\ntoday, the house price-to-rent ratio is where it was in 2003, and house prices are rapidly rising. I\ndon’t think we’re at a tipping point yet—but I am looking at the path we’re on and looking out\nfor potential potholes.\nIn considering the FOMC’s monetary policy choices, it’s important to remember that\nwe’re in a very different place now than when we first instituted extremely accommodative\npolicy. The economy has come a long way since the dark days of late 2009. We’ve added over\n12 million jobs, more than 3 million of them last year. Even better, most of those were full-time.\nIt’s been a tough journey back, and monetary policy has played a crucial role in healing a once-\nailing economy.6\nIn the past, I have found the arguments for greater patience to clearly outweigh those for\nraising rates. The labor market was still far from full strength and the risk to the recovery’s\nmomentum was very real. As the economy closed in on full employment, the other side of the\nledger started gaining greater weight and the arguments have moved into closer balance.\nLooking forward, I expect that we’ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the\nnear future and inflation will gradually move back to our 2 percent goal. In that context, it will\nmake sense to gradually move away from the extraordinary stimulus that got us here. We already\ntook a step in that direction when we ended QE3. And given the progress we’ve made and\ncontinue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates,\nmost likely starting sometime later this year. Of course, that view is not immutable and will\nrespond to economic developments over time.\nWhat to expect when you’re expecting a new normal\n6 See Swanson and Williams (2014) and Williams (2014).\n6\n\nAs we make our way back to an economy that’s at full health, it’s important to consider\nwhat constitutes a realistic view of the way things will look. The pace of employment growth, as\nwell as the decline in the unemployment rate, has slowed a bit recently…but that’s to be\nexpected. When unemployment was at its 10 percent peak during the height of the Great\nRecession, and as it struggled to come down during the recovery, we needed rapid declines to get\nthe economy back on track. Now that we’re getting closer, the pace must start slowing to more\nnormal levels. Looking to the future, we’re going to need at most 100,000 new jobs each month.7\nIn the mindset of the recovery, that sounds like nothing; but in the context of a healthy economy,\nit’s what’s needed for stable growth.\nAs the next year unfolds, what we want to see is an economy that’s growing at a steady\npace of around 2 percent. If jobs and growth kept the same pace as last year, we would seriously\novershoot our mark. I want to see continued improvement, but it’s not surprising, and it’s\nactually desirable, that the pace is slowing.\nConclusion\nThe economy is on solid footing and a good trajectory. There are risks, as there always\nare in life. And there’s always the possibility of what British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan\nsaid when asked what worried him most: “Events, dear boy, events.” But all in all, things are\nlooking up, and if they stay on track, I see this as the year we start the process of monetary policy\nnormalization.\nThank you.\n7 Aaronson et al.
