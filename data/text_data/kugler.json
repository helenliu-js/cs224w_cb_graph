Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nInternational Economic Symposium, cohosted by the\nNational Association for Business Economics\nand the Central Bank of Ireland\nDublin, Ireland\nMay 12, 2025\n\nThank you, Reamonn. It is an honor and a privilege to be asked to speak in the\nbeautiful country of Ireland and here at the Central Bank of Ireland. The histories of the\nU.S. and Ireland are intertwined. Our friendship is enduring, and our economies are\nclosely tied. The Irish economy and the Bank stand as examples of the benefits of being\nopen to international connections and the sharing of the best ideas and practices. I am\ndelighted to have the opportunity to meet with my counterparts here and continue this\ngreat friendship. It is also wonderful to see many members of the National Association\nfor Business Economics (NABE). NABE and its members have made many important\ncontributions to the field of economics; as such, I always enjoy speaking to this esteemed\ngroup.1\nI am particularly delighted to contribute to this conference on trade, technology,\nand policy. As an academic, part of my research has investigated the link between trade\nand productivity. And in my current role, I have highlighted these themes in several of\nmy recent speeches, including the role of recent advancements in technology, such as\nartificial intelligence, as well as the role of business formation in terms of boosting U.S.\nproductivity over the past few years.2 Today, I would like to focus my attention on the\ncurrent outlook for the U.S. economy and how I am thinking about the path of monetary\npolicy. Of course, given current developments, I will focus on the role played by trade\npolicy and how it may affect the economy and productivity going forward.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n2 See Adriana D. Kugler (2025), “Entrepreneurship and Aggregate Productivity,” speech delivered at the\n2025 Miami Economic Forum, Economic Club of Miami, Miami, Florida, February 7,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm. Also, see Adriana D. Kugler\n(2024), “A Year in Review: A Tale of Two Supply Shocks,” speech delivered at the Detroit Economic\nClub, Detroit, Michigan, December 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nWhile the latest data show a resilient economy, I expect growth this year to be\nslower than last. Labor market conditions have been mostly stable. Inflation remains\nabove the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent target, and further\nprogress on disinflation has been slow. Looking ahead, I am monitoring the effects of\nchanging trade policies, as I see them as likely having a significant effect on the U.S. and\nglobal economies in the near future.\nTrade policies are evolving and are likely to continue shifting, even as recently as\nthis morning. Still, they appear likely to generate significant economic effects even if\ntariffs stay close to the currently announced levels, and the uncertainty associated with\nthese tariffs has already generated effects on the economy through front-loading,\nsentiment, and expectations. Let me start by describing how I see current economic\nconditions.\nEconomic Activity\nRegarding overall economic activity, it is currently hard to judge the underlying\npace of growth of the U.S. economy, as the gross domestic product (GDP) release for the\nfirst quarter showed strong evidence of front-loading of imports ahead of tariffs. GDP\ncontracted at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter after expanding 2.5 percent\nduring 2024. However, the latest GDP figure likely overstates the deceleration in\nactivity, as a 41.3 percent surge in imports apparently did not get fully picked up in the\ninventory data or other components of spending. The size of the swings in imports may\nmake the measurement of activity more difficult.\nIt is helpful to look at private domestic final purchases (PDFP), a measure of\ndemand in the private sector: It rose at a rate of 3 percent in the first quarter—similar to\n\n- 3 -\nthe pace recorded last year. Still, the strength in PDFP also likely reflects some pull-\nforward of purchases by businesses and consumers to get ahead of tariffs.\nThe Federal Reserve’s April Beige Book and conversations with contacts also\npoint toward front-loading in auto sales or other high-end goods. However, the Beige\nBook and various indicators of consumer and business confidence also point to a\ndownbeat tone about underlying economic activity down the road. For instance, the\nBeige Book notes that several Districts see a deterioration in demand for travel and other\nnonfinancial services and indicates that businesses may put investments on hold moving\nforward. Several other economic indicators that I track suggest some signs of declining\neconomic activity in the future. For instance, the Institute for Supply Management’s\nmanufacturing purchasing managers index for April shows that new orders have been\ndeclining since February.\nLabor Market\nOn the employment side of our mandate, conditions seem to be mostly stable.\nThe most recent employment report showed that employers created 177,000 new jobs in\nApril, in line with the average of the previous six months. The unemployment rate was\n4.2 percent—still within the narrow and historically low range of 4 to 4.2 percent—where\nit has remained since May of 2024. In addition, the pace of layoffs remains modest.\nNew applications for unemployment benefits have remained relatively stable at\nhistorically low levels. However, I am carefully watching other sources of data for any\nsigns that the labor market could be shifting, given the broader uncertainty. Some\nforward-looking measures of layoffs have increased, such as the number of mentions of\nthe word “layoff” in the Beige Book.\n\n- 4 -\nIn terms of the demand for workers, the U.S. Labor Department’s Job Openings\nand Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that the vacancy rate—the number of\nvacant jobs as a percentage of total employment and vacant jobs—declined to 4.3 percent\nin March, the lowest in six months. The government data showed that the ratio of\nvacancies to the number of unemployed Americans was 1.0 in March, below its 2019\naverage of 1.2—also indicating the continuing easing of U.S. labor markets. Overall, job\ngrowth remains positive, and unemployment is still low, but I am watching a broad range\nof incoming readings carefully.\nInflation\nOn the other side of our dual mandate is inflation. After two years of notable\nprogress following U.S. inflation reaching its pandemic-era peak, progress on disinflation\nhas slowed since last summer. Inflation remains somewhat above the FOMC’s 2 percent\ngoal. At the Fed, the inflation reading we track most closely is the personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) price index. The March report, released on April 30, showed that the\n12-month change in the PCE price index was 2.3 percent; the core PCE price index—\nwhich excludes food and energy prices—rose 2.6 percent over the same period.\nTo help me judge the path of future inflation, I pay careful attention to two\nsubcategories of the index. One is core goods prices, which exclude volatile food and\nenergy prices. The second is nonhousing market-based services, which are based on\ntransactions such as car maintenance and haircuts, not imputed prices. Goods inflation\nwas negative for most of 2024—as was the norm for several years before the pandemic—\nbut it was positive early this year. In contrast, nonhousing market services inflation\nstayed elevated through March, coming in at 3.4 percent. That category often provides a\n\n- 5 -\ngood signal of inflationary pressures across all nonhousing services. Looking ahead, I\nfind it critical to monitor not only the most up-to-date data but also the changing\neconomic policies around the world.\nEconomic Effects of Global Policy Changes\nTo pause briefly, I would like to take a moment to discuss the Fed’s structure.\nThe Fed operates independently from the elected government in Washington. We make\nour policies to best achieve the goals given to us by Congress of maximum employment\nand price stability. As such, it is not my role to comment on the policies offered by the\nU.S. government or any government around the world. Rather, I make assessments of the\nlikely effects of these policies, observe the behavior of the U.S. and world economies,\nand develop views about the best U.S. monetary policy to achieve our dual-mandate\ngoals.\nThe U.S. is implementing policy changes in trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and\nregulation, and other economies are also changing their policies in the areas of trade and\nfiscal spending, particularly in defense, which could stimulate aggregate demand. But\ngiven that the most important changes have occurred so far in the area of trade policy,\ntoday I would like to discuss some important economic channels through which changes\nin tariffs may affect the U.S. economy.\nAlthough higher tariffs on U.S. imported goods may affect our macroeconomy\nthrough many channels, some of which I will describe next, I think they will primarily act\nas a negative supply shock, raising prices and decreasing economic activity. While\nuncertainty remains about the ultimate level of the average tariff rate, currently\nannounced average tariffs in the U.S. are still much higher than they were in the past\n\n- 6 -\nmany decades. If tariffs remain significantly larger relative to earlier in the year, the\nsame is likely to be true for the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and\nslower growth.\nHow do I expect this to play out? In the near term, higher import costs will raise\nprices for both consumer goods and inputs to production. On their own, imported goods\nrepresent about 11 percent of U.S. GDP. However, given that several intermediate\ngoods, such as aluminum and steel have been tariffed, and they affect costs in many\nsectors of the economy, prices of many goods and services are also likely to be affected.\nIn addition, in conversations with business contacts, I have heard that firms are paying\nattention to the price sensitivity of consumers across the entire catalog of items sold and\nmay spread price increases to less price-sensitive items to avoid reducing their profit\nmargins. A Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of Texas business executives found\nthat 55 percent of respondents expect to pass through most or all of the costs from higher\ntariffs to customers.3 Of those expecting to pass on costs, 26 percent expect to pass\nthrough the higher tariff cost upon the announcement of tariffs, and 64 percent expect this\npass-through to occur within the first three months after the tariffs take effect. That\nwould suggest that price increases may be observed soon.\nGiven these expected price increases, real incomes will fall, and operating costs\nwill rise, which will lead consumers to demand fewer final goods and services and firms\nto demand fewer inputs. Ultimately, I see the U.S. as likely to experience lower growth\nand higher inflation. Over time, there could also be significant effects on productivity.\nAs firms adjust to the higher input costs and lower demand, they may cut back on capital\n3 The special questions included in the survey of Texas business executives is available on the Federal\nReserve Bank of Dallas’ website at https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/tbos/2025/2504q#tab-all.\n\n- 7 -\ninvestment and shift to a less-efficient combination of inputs. Additionally, less-efficient\ndomestic firms may increase their market share.4 All of this may result in a decrease in\npotential output growth, lowering the underlying pace of economic activity in the U.S.\nIn addition to any direct effect from actual global policy changes, consumers,\nbusinesses, and market participants have reported high levels of uncertainty about which\npolicies may be ultimately chosen and how long they will remain in place. In fact, in\nrecent months, several measures of economic uncertainty have risen sharply.\nThere are several types of measures that quantify economic uncertainty, with two\ntypes having gained prominence among economists closely monitoring the U.S.\neconomic outlook.5 Some are based on financial market transactions, such as the\nChicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, popularly called the VIX. Others\nare based on the occurrence of certain keywords associated with the concept of\nuncertainty in newspapers of wide circulation, such as the economic policy uncertainty\nand trade policy uncertainty readings.6 These measures of uncertainty have reached\n4 For the effects of tariffs on productivity, see Marcela Eslava, John Haltiwanger, Adriana Kugler, and\nMaurice Kugler (2013), “Trade and Market Selection: Evidence from Manufacturing Plants in\nColombia,” Review of Economic Dynamics, vol. 16 (January), pp. 135–58; Marcela Eslava, John\nHaltiwanger, Adriana Kugler, and Maurice Kugler (2004), “The Effects of Structural Reforms on\nProductivity and Profitability Enhancing Reallocation: Evidence from Colombia,” Journal of Development\nEconomics, vol. 75 (December), pp. 333–71; and Davide Furceri, Swarnali A. Hannan, Jonathan D. Ostry,\nand Andrew K. Rose (2022), “The Macroeconomy after Tariffs,” World Bank Economic Review, vol. 36\n(May), pp. 361–81.\n5 For a literature review on quantifying uncertainty, see Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, Cisil Sarisoy, Juan M.\nLondono, Bo Sun, Deepa D. Datta, Thiago Ferreira, Olesya Grishchenko, Mohammad R.

Baker, Nicholas Bloom, and\nSteven J. Davis (2016), “Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol.\n131 (November), pp. 1593–1636. For more details on the trade policy uncertainty index, see Dario\nCaldara, Matteo Iacoviello, Patrick Molligo, Andrea Prestipino, and Andrea Raffo (2020), “The Economic\nEffects of Trade Policy Uncertainty,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 109 (January), pp. 38–59.\n\n- 8 -\nhistorical highs in recent months. Similarly, I also saw the word “uncertainty” being\nhighly cited in the Beige Book I reviewed before the FOMC’s policy meeting last week.7\nIn times of heightened uncertainty, businesses may delay investment decisions,\nand consumers may increase precautionary savings and postpone discretionary purchases.\nMoreover, the economic research literature has documented that these decisions from\nbusinesses and consumers reverberate through the economy, pushing down aggregate\ndemand. Firms, anticipating lower demand for their services and products, may post\nfewer job openings and cut back on investments to expand capacity. While the labor\nmarket has remained broadly resilient, the JOLTS data for March showed that job\nopenings fell. Workers, therefore, may have a more difficult time finding employment,\ndecreasing economy-wide income and aggregate demand.8 This lower aggregate demand\nmay then exert downward pressure on inflation, though probably not by enough to offset\nthe effect from the adverse supply shock that I previously mentioned. For example,\nrecent data show that prices for accommodations and airfares have fallen, consistent with\nan increasing number of anecdotal reports of weaker consumer demand for discretionary\ntravel services.\nI am also monitoring the effect of policy changes on another important channel:\ninflation expectations. For instance, consumers and businesses have reported tariffs as an\nimportant reason for having increased their near-term inflation expectations. Several\nsurveys, including those from the Conference Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of\n7 The April 2025 Beige Book is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202504-summary.htm.\n8 For studies documenting how uncertainty shocks may act as adverse aggregate demand shocks, see\nSylvain Leduc and Zheng Liu (2016), “Uncertainty Shocks Are Aggregate Demand Shocks,” Journal of\nMonetary Economics, vol. 82 (September), pp. 20–35, as well as Susanto Basu and Brent Bundick (2017),\n“Uncertainty Shocks in a Model of Effective Demand,” Econometrica, vol. 85 (May), pp. 937–58.\n\n- 9 -\nAtlanta and New York, have found that consumers and businesses expect higher inflation\none year from now. Another closely watched survey from the University of Michigan\nshowed that one-year-ahead inflation expectations in April were higher than in the\npandemic period. This increase in short-run expectations may give businesses more\nleeway to raise prices.\nMost longer-run measures, including those from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters and the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations,\nshow either stability or much smaller increases in inflation expectations, which does\nprovide some comfort to me. Additionally, inflation compensation, which is based on\nyields from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, has increased only for short-term\nmaturities, such as one year ahead, and has shown stability in maturities over the five\nyears starting five years from now. Still, I have taken note of the increase in longer-term\ninflation expectations from the Michigan survey, which reached the highest level since\nJune 1991. Given these developments, I am keeping a close watch on inflation, because\nas I have indicated in the past, I believe it is critical to keep long-term inflation\nexpectations very well anchored at 2 percent.\nLooking globally, international developments do not seem to be adding\ninflationary pressures to the U.S. Economic growth in most developed economies\nremains moderate, and domestic inflation in those countries has declined from elevated\nlevels. In Europe, activity data point to modest growth as the region deals with\nheadwinds stemming from past energy shocks and competitive pressures from elsewhere\nin the world. The New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index has been\n\n- 10 -\nrelatively stable since the beginning of the year. Oil prices have declined significantly\nsince January.\nMonetary Policy\nI have discussed a lot of data and developments with you today. To summarize,\nthe U.S. economy has remained resilient up until now, with a still-stable labor market.\nMeanwhile, the disinflationary process has slowed. This comes against a backdrop of\nheightened uncertainty as households, businesses, and, indeed, monetary policymakers\nprocess the changes to economic policies that are happening around the world. Going\nforward, I will continue to closely monitor the direct effects of global economic policies\non prices and employment, as well as the indirect economic effects from uncertainty,\ninflation expectations, and productivity.\nU.S. monetary policymakers on the FOMC met last week in Washington. At that\nmeeting, the Committee voted to maintain its policy rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Given\nthe upside risks to inflation and given that I still view our policy stance as somewhat\nrestrictive, I supported the decision to keep rates at that level. With inflation and\nemployment potentially moving in opposite directions down the road, I will closely\nmonitor developments as I consider the future path of policy.\nI view our current stance of monetary policy as well positioned for any changes in\nthe macroeconomic environment. I remain committed to achieving both of our dual-\nmandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\nThank you for your attention today—and thank you very much for inviting me to\nspeak to you here in Dublin. It has been an honor and a privilege. I look forward to your\nquestions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n6:00 p.m. EDT (5:00 p.m. CDT)\nApril 22, 2025\nTransmission of Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nAdriana D. Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nHeller-Hurwicz Economics Institute\nUniversity of Minnesota\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nApril 22, 2025\n\nThank you, Juan Pablo. I am delighted to be speaking at the University of\nMinnesota because, in many ways, this visit feels like a homecoming for me.1 I was born\nright here in Minneapolis, before I moved to Colombia as a young child. My parents told\nme so many wonderful stories about this area and the university. My father studied for\nhis Ph.D. here at the economics department. He studied under accomplished economists,\nincluding Anne Krueger, Leo Hurwicz, John Buttrick, and Ed Foster, the latter of whom\nis still here as an emeritus professor. The University of Minnesota has made many\ncontributions to the field of economics and has historically had a close relationship with\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. So you really are part of the Fed’s extended\nfamily, and it is an honor to speak with you.\nToday, I would like to speak with you about the transmission of the Fed’s\nmonetary policy. I will discuss how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy,\nthen touch on how I monitor its transmission, and, lastly, talk about two elements related\nto transmission that I evaluate when making monetary policy decisions. Those elements\nare the long and variable lags of monetary policy and whether its transmission is\nasymmetric and has changed over time. But before I delve into my primary topic, I\nwould like to start by offering my views on the economic outlook.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe U.S. economy has grown at a solid pace, with real gross domestic product\n(GDP) expanding 2.5 percent last year. Activity indicators in the first few months of this\nyear show healthy numbers. Last week, the March retail sales release showed resilient\nconsumption, with positive revisions for January and February numbers. However,\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nmeasures of household sentiment, such as surveys from the University of Michigan,\nConference Board, and Morning Consult, have shown signs of softness, albeit to varying\ndegrees. Many survey respondents report that their views reflect trade policy concerns,\nthough, as we have seen, the exact contours of those policies are still taking shape. Thus,\nGDP growth for the first quarter, which will be reported next week, may show some\nmoderation relative to what we saw in 2024, although this moderation may be offset by\nincreased purchases front-loading the implementation of tariffs. Financial markets have\nexperienced increased volatility in recent weeks. If financial conditions were to tighten\npersistently, that could weigh on growth in the future.\nThe labor market remains solid, but the pace of hiring has eased during this year.\nIn the first quarter, U.S. employers added 152,000 jobs per month, on average, compared\nwith a monthly pace of 168,000, on average, last year. The unemployment rate edged up\nlast month to 4.2 percent, but it is still low and has remained near its current level since\nlast summer. Moreover, initial jobless claims have remained stable at low levels. Those\nnumbers are consistent with other measures indicating that the labor market is broadly in\nbalance.\nWith respect to inflation, progress has slowed since last summer, and inflation\nremains above the 2 percent goal. Based on the consumer price index (CPI) and producer\nprice index (PPI) data, the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) price index was estimated to have been 2.3 percent last month and 2.6 percent for\nthe core categories, which exclude food and energy.\nI pay careful attention to two subcategories of inflation: first, core goods—which\nare goods outside of volatile food and energy products—and, second, nonhousing\n\n- 3 -\nmarket-based services, which are based on transactions and not imputed prices, such as\ncar maintenance and haircuts. Goods inflation was negative in most of 2024—as was the\nnorm for several years before the pandemic—but it increased to 0.4 percent in January\nand February. In March, the CPI and PPI releases pointed to goods inflation decreasing\nto a still-positive 0.1 percent, which is better news. By contrast, nonhousing market\nservices inflation stayed elevated through March, at an estimated 3.4 percent. That\ncategory often provides a good signal of inflationary pressures across all services. As we\nlook ahead, while the long-run level of tariffs is still to be determined, tariffs have moved\nsignificantly higher this year. That will likely put upward pressure on prices. For\ninstance, both survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation expectations\nhave moved up. Longer-term inflation expectations—those beyond the next few years—\nlargely remain well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, and I hope\nthey continue in that way.\nI am closely monitoring incoming data and the cumulative effects on both sides of\nour mandate from policies in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and\nregulation. I am also monitoring any risks to the outlook, especially upside risks on\ninflation or downside risks to employment. Still, I think our monetary policy is well\npositioned for changes in the macroeconomic environment. Thus, I will support\nmaintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue,\nwhile economic activity and employment remain stable. I remain committed to achieving\nboth of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\n\n- 4 -\nOverview of Monetary Policy Transmission\nNow turning to the primary topic of my speech, I will first discuss how monetary\npolicy is transmitted through the economy. In this section, I will give some examples\nfrom the recent past as a tool for explaining my arguments, but I am not intending to\ncomment further on the latest developments in the economy.\nUnderstanding the transmission of monetary policy starts with understanding how\nthe Federal Reserve uses its policy tools. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nadjusts the target range for the federal funds rate, or the rate that banks pay for overnight\nborrowing. Setting the federal funds rate is the primary means by which the Fed adjusts\nthe stance of monetary policy, among its range of monetary policy tools. In addition to\nthe FOMC directly adjusting the federal funds rate, Fed policymakers’ communications\nabout the future path of monetary policy may also result in changes to longer-term\ninterest rates because households’ and businesses’ expectations about future policy affect\nthe level of interest rates.\nAdjustments to the federal funds rate affect a multitude of financial conditions\nfaced by consumers and businesses. For example, changes to the federal funds rate filter\nthrough to the interest rates lenders charge for loans to businesses and households as well\nas to what financial institutions pay in interest on deposits. The current and expected\nfuture path of the federal funds rate also affects asset prices, as it changes the relative\nattractiveness of different investments, such as stocks and real estate. Fluctuations in\nboth interest rates and asset prices affect a household’s wealth and a corporation’s\n\n- 5 -\nbalance sheet, which can, in turn, affect the terms under which they can borrow.2 I have\ndiscussed some of the most common ways in which policy is transmitted. There are, of\ncourse, other important channels, such as exchange rates and international spillovers, that\nI will not discuss today. Research suggests that the channels of transmission are\nextensive and ever evolving.3\nConsumers and businesses make decisions based on financial conditions.4 For\nillustrative purposes, let’s consider a period when FOMC policymakers view it as\nappropriate to ease the restrictiveness of monetary policy by reducing the target range for\nthe federal funds rate over time. The resulting lower interest rates on consumer loans\nelicit greater spending on goods and services, particularly on durable goods that are often\nfinanced. Lower mortgage rates can encourage renters to buy a home by reducing the\nmonthly payment borrowers face and can encourage existing homeowners to refinance\ntheir mortgages to free up cash for other purchases. Lower interest rates can make\nholding equities more attractive, which raises stock prices and adds to wealth. Higher\nwealth tends to spur more spending, as households tend to consume at least a portion of\ntheir increased wealth. Investment projects that businesses previously believed would be\nmarginally unprofitable become attractive because of reduced financing costs,\n2 Such broader changes in credit conditions are called the “credit channel” of monetary policy,\ndiscussed in Ben S. Bernanke and Mark Gertler (1995), “Inside the Black Box: The Credit Channel of\nMonetary Policy Transmission,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 9 (Autumn), pp. 27–48.\n3 For evidence on how U.S. monetary policy affects exchange rates, see Martin Eichenbaum and Charles L.\nEvans (1995), “Some Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Shocks to Monetary Policy on Exchange\nRates,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 110 (November), pp. 975–1009. Additionally, U.S. monetary\npolicy also affects global financial conditions, as analyzed by Silvia Miranda-Agrippino and Hélène Rey\n(2020), “U.S. Monetary Policy and the Global Financial Cycle,” Review of Economic Studies, vol. 87\n(November), pp. 2754–76.\n4 For evidence that financial conditions are a crucial part of the transmission of monetary policy, see Mark\nGertler and Peter Karadi (2015), “Monetary Policy Surprises, Credit Costs, and Economic Activity,”\nAmerican Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 7 (January), pp. 44–76.\n\n- 6 -\nparticularly if businesses expect their sales to rise. Expecting a better macroeconomic\nenvironment and lower delinquency rates down the road, banks may loosen their lending\nstandards on approving loans for households and businesses. All these decisions support\naggregate demand and may put upward pressure on inflation.\nOf course, there are periods when policymakers see it as appropriate to increase\nthe level of restraint placed on the economy by raising the federal funds rate over time.\nThat may occur when policymakers are seeking to lower inflation. Then, the monetary\npolicy effects I just described would be reversed, putting downward pressure on\naggregate demand and inflation.\nDevelopments in Monetary Policy and Financial Conditions\nLet me now discuss how I view the transmission and the stance of monetary\npolicy during the past few quarters. To be clear, I will not discuss the developments in\nfinancial markets over the past few weeks.\nIn the second half of last year, I gained greater confidence that inflation was on a\nsustainable path toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. I also wanted to preserve the\nstrength I saw in the labor market. As a result, I supported the FOMC’s decision to\ndecrease the target range for the federal funds rate by a total of 1 percentage point during\nthe meetings from September through December. However, even before the Committee\nbegan to ease policy, some financial conditions started to ease. This easing can be seen\nin the Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth index.5 That index, developed by Federal\nReserve Board staff, showed easier financial conditions from March 2024. And through\n5 See Andrea Ajello, Michele Cavallo, Giovanni Favara, William B. Peterman, John Schindler, and Nitish\nR. Sinha (2023), “A New Index to Measure U.S. Financial Conditions” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 30), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3281.\n\n- 7 -\nJanuary, the demand for loans by households and businesses picked up.6 In the early\nmonths of the year, financial conditions, however, remained somewhat restrictive, as\nborrowing costs continued to be elevated and bank credit moderately tight. Through\nMarch, interest rates on short-term small business loans had only edged down since their\npost-pandemic peak.7 Banks stopped tightening lending standards after nine consecutive\nquarters, but they left standards unchanged in January.8 These financial conditions\nhelped to moderate aggregate demand and aid in moving inflation sustainably toward our\n2 percent target.\nDetails of Monetary Policy Transmission\nMonitoring the financial conditions I just described is one important way I\nevaluate how well the Fed’s monetary policy is being transmitted to the rest of the\neconomy. But it is not the only way. I also consider two other elements that play\nimportant roles in the transmission of our monetary policy.\nTiming Matters\nThe first element to evaluate is the timing with which monetary policy affects the\nmacroeconomy. The contemporary economics literature uses a variety of statistical\nmodels to estimate the effects of what are called monetary policy “shocks.” Those are\nmovements in the policy rate that are not explained by estimates of how monetary policy\nsystematically responds to incoming economic and financial data and are not anticipated\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), “The January 2025 Senior Loan Officer\nOpinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos-202501.htm.\n7 See survey data from the National Federation of Independent Business, available at William C.\nDunkelberg and Holly Wade (2025), “Small Business Economic Trends,” March,\nhttps://www.nfib.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NFIB-SBET-Report-March-2025.pdf.\n8 See Board of Governors, “The January 2025 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey” (note 6).\n\n- 8 -\nby the public.9 Focusing on the estimated effects of these shocks helps isolate the\nconsequences solely coming from monetary policy actions and communications. One\nlesson that emerges from this research is that, broadly speaking, it turns out that Milton\nFriedman’s “long and variable lags” concept still holds.10 A selection of key studies on\nthe topic estimates that it takes about one to two years for the maximum effects of policy\nto be observed in economic activity and inflation.11 These long lags in monetary policy\naffecting the economy point to why it is important for policymakers to anticipate\neconomic conditions as best as possible and try to be proactive about understanding the\neffects of different shocks to the economy, so they can act quickly when needed.\n9 For a literature review on the different ways of identifying monetary policy shocks, see V.A.

For example, credible evidence indicates that contractionary monetary shocks may\ngenerally decrease economic activity more strongly than expansionary shocks increase\nit.12 To understand these asymmetric effects, consider the following illustrative metaphor\nused by Marriner Eccles, who led the Fed back in the 1930s.\nImagine a string with monetary policy at one end and the economy at the other.\nEmploying tight monetary policy when inflation is rising is like pulling on the string to\nkeep the economy in check—it works fairly well. But attempting to stimulate the\neconomy with loose policy during a downturn is like trying to push on the string to move\nthe economy—a more difficult task.\nThere is evidence of this asymmetry in consumer spending on long-lasting\ndurable goods, such as vehicles and appliances. While an easier monetary policy may\nlower interest rates and thus stimulate spending on durable goods in the near term, the\neffects of that policy may be smaller over time, as households may have already\npurchased durable goods.13 If a family replaces their living room furniture when rates are\nlow, they are unlikely to need a new set of furniture a few years later and thus would not\n12 See, for instance, Silvana Tenreyro and Gregory Thwaites (2016), “Pushing on a String: US Monetary\nPolicy Is Less Powerful in Recessions,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 8 (October),\npp. 43–74; Joshua D. Angrist, Òscar Jordà, and Guido M. Kuersteiner (2018), “Semiparametric Estimates\nof Monetary Policy Effects: String Theory Revisited,” Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, vol. 36\n(July), pp. 371–87; and Regis Barnichon, Christian Matthes, and Tim Sablik (2017), “Are the Effects of\nMonetary Policy Asymmetric?” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Economic Brief, vol. 3 (March),\npp. 1–4, https://www.richmondfed.org/-\n/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_brief/2017/pdf/eb_17-03.pdf.\n13 See Alisdair McKay and Johannes F. Wieland (2021), “Lumpy Durable Consumption Demand and the\nLimited Ammunition of Monetary Policy,” Econometrica, vol. 89 (November), pp. 2717–49.\n\n- 10 -\nconsider how current rates would change their decisions. Thus, during an easing cycle, it\nis reasonable to suspect that the potency of monetary policy may be somewhat\ndiminished.\nAnother example of asymmetry can be seen in the transmission of monetary\npolicy to private lending. Board staff research documented strong growth in the period\nbetween the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic, fueled by structural factors, such\nas the attractiveness of the market to borrowers and investors due to its higher\ncustomization.14 One implication of this strong growth during this past policy tightening\nis that monetary policy transmission to private credit markets appeared more muted\nrelative to financing through public credit markets or bank commercial and industrial\nlending.\nBy contrast, other factors specific to the recent period likely decreased the\npotency of monetary policy during the tightening cycle but may increase it during the\neasing cycle. When the pandemic struck and social distancing was common, many\nhouseholds severely curtailed spending. In addition, a historic level of government\ntransfers boosted household income. This combination led the personal savings rate to\nsoar.15 Recent work by Board staff suggests that these excess savings accumulated\nduring the pandemic may have reduced the effects of tighter monetary policy over recent\n14 See Ahmet Degerli and Phillip J. Monin (2024), “Private Credit Growth and Monetary Policy\nTransmission,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 2),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3565.\n15 See, for instance, Aditya Aladangady, David Cho, Laura Feiveson, and Eugenio Pinto (2022), “Excess\nSavings during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, October 21), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3223; and Francois de Soyres, Dylan\nMoore, and Julio L. Ortiz (2023), “Accumulated Savings during the Pandemic: An International\nComparison with Historical Perspective,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, June 23), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3326.\n\n- 11 -\nyears.16 If households are flush with excess cash, they are less likely to respond to\nelevated interest rates by curtailing demand. Instead, they may have funds to avoid\nfinancing or may feel they are able to afford higher monthly payments.\nNow, some five years after the pandemic began, these excess savings are\nexhausted.17 This creates an environment in which monetary policy could be having its\naverage effects on the household sector, although we should consider that the financial\nhealth of borrowers with lower credit scores has deteriorated meaningfully in recent years\nand credit card and auto loan delinquencies are now above pre-pandemic levels. For\nthese households, easing monetary policy may have larger effects.\nI am closely monitoring all these possible changes in monetary policy\ntransmission across the economy. Also, I am humbly aware that it is difficult for\neconomists to judge the overall effect of monetary policy actions on the U.S. economy in\nreal time.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, I see inflation still running above the 2 percent target while the\nlabor market has remained stable. But the economy is facing heightened uncertainty,\nwith upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment. This month, we learned\nthat the tariff increases are significantly larger than previously expected. As a result, the\neconomic effects of tariffs and the associated uncertainty are also likely to be larger than\nanticipated. It is important for monetary policymakers to broadly examine all available\n16 See Thiago R.T. Ferreira, Nils Gornemann, and Julio L. Ortiz (forthcoming), “Household Excess Savings\nand the Transmission of Monetary Policy,” International Journal of Central Banking.\n17 See Hamza Abdelrahman and Luiz Edgard Oliveira (2024), “Pandemic Savings Are Gone: What’s Next\nfor U.S. Consumers?” SF Fed Blog, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, May 3,\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/blog/sf-fed-blog/2024/05/03/pandemic-savings-are-gone-\nwhats-next-for-us-consumers.\n\n- 12 -\ninformation, including market-based measures, surveys, and anecdotal reports, to\nunderstand what is happening in the economy as early as possible because, as I discussed,\nit takes time for policy to have an impact. As the direction of the economy changes, it is\ncritical to pay close attention to real-time data and to consider the lags and asymmetries\nof policy transmission to ensure we respond not only to the actual movements on both\nsides of the mandate, but also to the risks to the economic outlook.\nAs I observe the economy and consider the appropriate path of monetary policy, I\nam closely studying how the decisions the FOMC makes are transmitted through the\neconomy. We have learned much about how those transmission channels work and how\nthey may have changed in recent years, and there is much more to learn. I am confident\nsome of that research will be done right here at the University of Minnesota. Overall, of\ncourse, when setting policy, I am guided by how best to achieve the dual-mandate goals\nof maximum employment and stable prices given to us by Congress because that results\nin the best outcomes for all Americans.\nThank you again for such a warm welcome back to the Twin Cities.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2024 Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Economic Summit\nStanford University\nStanford, California\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nThank you, Mark, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of the discussions\ntoday.1 For more than 40 years, the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has\nassisted economic policymakers by producing sharp analysis and fostering the kind of\nconstructive dialogue reflected in today’s agenda.\nMy topic today is the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment\nand stable prices—and, specifically, the tradeoffs that sometimes arise when pursuing\nthese two objectives. I say “sometimes” because there have been times and certain\neconomic conditions in which such tradeoffs did not arise—or at least were not apparent.\nThis distinction is an important one, especially when considering the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC)’s recent progress in reducing high inflation while the labor\nmarket has remained strong. Better understanding the tradeoffs, or lack thereof, in\npursuing the dual mandate will help researchers and policymakers draw lessons from\nthese welcome recent developments.\nHistory of the Inflation–Unemployment Tradeoff\nIn 1977, Congress legislated the Federal Reserve’s “dual mandate,” under which\nthe FOMC is required to pursue both maximum employment and stable prices, with both\nobjectives on an equal footing.2 At the outset, it is worth stressing that these goals are\ngenerally complementary, and I will return to this point shortly. But when they are not\ncomplementary, one way to think of the policy problem is in terms of tradeoffs:\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Before 1977, the Federal Reserve viewed itself as having a dual mandate because it was covered by the\nEmployment Act of 1946, which gave the whole federal government a list of objectives that included\nmaximum employment and maximum “purchasing power.” The predominant interpretation of the latter\nobjective was that it corresponded to price stability.\n\n- 2 -\nMaximum employment is the highest level of employment that will not cause inflation to\nescalate significantly above levels consistent with price stability.\nBefore going into those tradeoffs, I want to emphasize that achieving the\nCommittee’s employment goal on an ongoing basis rests on achieving price stability.\nPrice stability enables long-lasting economic expansions, which strengthen the labor\nmarket and expand employment opportunities. This process particularly benefits families\nand communities that all too often have been left behind.3\nBut it is appropriate to recognize also that tradeoffs between the goals of\nmaximum employment and price stability can occur in the short term. Indeed, the\npotential shorter-term tradeoff between unemployment and inflation has long featured\nprominently among the economic considerations of policymakers. Government action to\nboost employment through fiscal or monetary stimulus has historically tended to increase\naggregate spending and inflation, too. On the contrary, actions to reduce inflation by\nshifting to contractionary fiscal or monetary policy have tended to slow economic activity\nand raise unemployment, or at least slow the pace of job creation.\nThe idea of a short-run tradeoff is reflected in the original specification of the\n“Phillips curve,” named after New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, who plotted\nhistorical values of the United Kingdom’s unemployment rate and growth in nominal\nwages between 1861 and 1957, showing an often inverse relationship between the two.\n3 López-Salido, Markowitz, and Nelson (2024) provide a longer-term perspective on how the Federal\nReserve has viewed price stability as necessary for achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis.\nSee David López-Salido, Emily Markowitz, and Edward Nelson (2024), “Continuity and Change in the\nFederal Reserve’s Perspective on Price Stability,” manuscript, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, Division of Monetary Affairs, January.\n\n- 3 -\nAlthough the Phillips curve was initially specified in terms of wages, later versions have\nmore typically compared unemployment with price inflation.\nTaken at face value, a tradeoff between keeping employment high and reducing\ninflation would seem to present policymakers with a dilemma. It suggests that when\ninflation is well above levels associated with price stability, policymakers must engineer\na significant increase in unemployment to bring inflation down. Disinflation can be\nespecially challenging when expectations of future inflation are high.4 We saw this in the\n1970s and 1980s. Convincing households and businesses that the FOMC was committed\nto reducing inflation required accepting a protracted, though ultimately temporary, period\nof high unemployment, as then Fed Chair Paul Volcker came to believe. Volcker is\nwidely credited with ending the “Great Inflation” experienced at the time through his\nwillingness to induce a punishing recession. He lowered inflation and kept it down, in\nsubstantial part by convincing the public that the Fed would keep inflation in check\nwhatever the cost, thereby lowering expectations of future inflation.5\nWhile long experience shows that there can be a tradeoff between policy actions\nto pursue maximum employment and stable prices, there are times and conditions when\nthis is not the case, or at least when there is little evidence of a tradeoff. For example, for\nmost of the decade after the Great Recession, FOMC policy was, by some measures at\n4 In the context of achieving disinflation, the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is sometimes\nreferred to as the “sacrifice ratio.” Estimates of the quantitative magnitude of this ratio vary widely,\ndepending on the period being studied and the nature of the macroeconomic model being used. Model-\nbased explorations do suggest that inflation expectations matter for the size of the ratio. For a helpful\ndiscussion and analysis, see Robert J. Tetlow (2022), “How Large Is the Output Cost of Disinflation?”\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-079 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, November), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022079pap.pdf.\n5 See David E. Lindsey, Athanasios Orphanides, and Robert H. Rasche (2005), “The Reform of October\n1979: How It Happened and Why,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Review, vol. 87 (March/April,\nPart 2), pp. 187-235, https://doi.org/10.20955/r.87.187-236.\n\n- 4 -\nleast, highly accommodative, yet inflation ran consistently below the Committee’s 2\npercent target. So when inflation is below target and employment is below maximum\nsustainable levels, accommodative policy can be used to pursue both sides of the\nmandate.\nAcademic economists have debated for decades about the circumstances in which\nthe tradeoff applies. One strand of the research literature proposes that a central bank can\nindeed achieve good economic outcomes by focusing on a single mandate, an inflation\ntarget, and that policies to promote stable prices can also secure low unemployment. In\nthis view, stabilization of inflation ensures that the economy performs at its optimal level,\nwith firms producing just the right amount such that no resources, including workers, are\nleft on the sidelines. This theory fits in a world in which the economy is driven by\ndemand—in such a case, shocks coming from the demand side of the economy can be\noffset by monetary policy, which works via aggregate demand.6\nBut in the real world—which is not so simple—demand shocks are not the only\nforces that can drive economic fluctuations. Supply shocks not only exist, but they can\nalso be large and persistent, as we have learned over the past several years. Adverse\nsupply shocks, just like higher inflation expectations, make managing the tradeoff\nbetween inflation and unemployment more difficult and costly. While a sharp reduction\nin demand reduces both economic activity and inflation, a sharp reduction in supply, such\nas a sudden loss of global oil supply, increases inflation and reduces economic activity.\n6 For discussion of the notion that inflation-targeting monetary policy can achieve both stable prices and\nmaximum employment, see Ben S. Bernanke, Thomas Laubach, Frederic S. Mishkin, and Adam S. Posen\n(1999), Inflation Targeting: Lessons from the International Experience (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton\nUniversity Press). More recently, this notion has been called the “divine coincidence” (see Olivier\nBlanchard and Jordi Galí (2007), “Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model,” Journal of\nMoney, Credit and Banking, vol. 39 (February), pp. 35–65).\n\n- 5 -\nTrying to combat inflation by raising interest rates would further reduce economic\nactivity and employment, while reducing interest rates to boost economic activity and\nemployment raises inflation even higher. Therefore, counteracting a persistent supply\nshock with monetary policy tools may help with one side of the mandate but create even\nlarger deviations from the other side of the mandate.\nInflation and Unemployment in the Pandemic and Its Aftermath\nLet me now turn to the pandemic experience. Inflation picked up in 2021, and by\nmid-2022, 12-month inflation, based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), hit\n7 percent, well above the FOMC’s 2 percent target. It was the most significant surge in\ninflation since the 1970s, prompting fears that it could raise expectations of future\ninflation and make getting inflation down again require a steep tradeoff—that is, much\nhigher unemployment.\nOne more specific concern was that a so-called wage–price spiral would emerge,\nas may have been the case for a time in the 1970s. In a tight labor market, expectations\nof continued high inflation can lead workers trying to maintain their living standards to\ndemand higher raises. In a context of strong aggregate demand, firms will likely grant\nthe wage increases to retain their workers—then pass through the resulting cost increase\nas higher prices. To avoid a continuing spiral, demand and supply in labor and product\nmarkets must be rebalanced—through lower aggregate demand, greater aggregate supply,\nor both.7 If achieving this balance requires a drastic reduction in aggregate demand, then\nsustainably taming inflation could require a high cost in terms of the employment\n7 For a discussion of wage–price spirals, see Ben S. Bernanke (2006), “The Benefits of Price Stability,”\nspeech delivered at the Center for Economic Policy Studies and on the occasion of the Seventy-Fifth\nAnniversary of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University,\nPrinceton, N.J., February 24, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nmandate. Fortunately, we appear to have avoided a wage–price spiral this time, as I will\ndiscuss later.\nAs inflation rose and began to appear persistent, the FOMC rightly focused on\nrestoring price stability, knowing that without price stability, the economy would not\nwork for anyone and that high inflation would ultimately undermine the strength of the\nlabor market. While interest rates rose rapidly, some feared that the cost of disinflation\nwould be persistently elevated unemployment. But over the past year or so, that tradeoff\nhas been much less evident than many feared. We have seen inflation cool significantly,\nfalling more rapidly than at any time since the 1980s. Yet unemployment remains near\nthe lowest levels seen only a few times since the 1960s.\nHow have we managed to avoid the familiar tradeoff during this period and see\nsuch welcome outcomes on both the inflation and employment fronts? I would propose a\nfew possible reasons. These center on the fact that the pandemic inflation featured both\nsupply and demand shocks. In the limited time that I have today, I don’t propose to get\ninto the debate about exactly how much of the recent inflation can be explained by supply\nas opposed to demand. But I will discuss how both demand and supply forces have been\nimportant in the rise and fall in the inflation rate.8\n8 Precisely quantifying the relative roles of supply and demand in the pandemic inflation will likely remain\na controversial pursuit for some time. One approach is to focus on relative movements of particular prices\nand of specific output categories in a “bottom up” manner, as illustrated, for example, by Adam Hale\nShapiro (2022), “Decomposing Supply and Demand Driven Inflation,” working paper, Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco, February. An alternative approach is to conduct a “top down” time-series analysis\nrelating aggregate data on wages, prices, labor market tightness, and various measures of goods supply\nconditions, as illustrated by Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S. Bernanke (2023), “What Caused the U.S.\nPandemic-Era Inflation?” NBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, June), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31417. The two approaches can complement\neach other by providing alternative, but mutually consistent, perspectives on the same problem.\n\n- 7 -\nThe pandemic caused a significant reduction in supply in some areas of the\neconomy. Limits on the supply of goods resulted from restricted output in many\nindustries. Consider a key U.S. manufacturing industry, auto production. In 2019, the\nU.S. manufactured 10½ million light vehicles. In 2020, production plunged to\n8½ million, with pandemic-related plant shutdowns followed by worldwide shortages of\ncomputer chips and other parts.9 It has taken the industry a long time to recover—auto\nproduction was less than 9 million in 2021 and a bit under 10 million in 2022.\nConstrained vehicle supply played a big role in boosting auto prices. And it wasn’t just\nmotor vehicles; for example, you might recall reports of food processing plant\nshutdowns, and many other goods-producing industries also suffered from “lost output.”\nU.S. industrial production dropped at the onset of the pandemic and then remained below\nits pre-pandemic level until early 2022 despite strong demand for physical goods; indeed,\nevidence shows that output was held down by insufficient supply of materials.10\n9 The auto industry’s experience during the pandemic is a good example of how many industries’\nproduction functions are, in economists’ terms, “Leontief,” meaning that shortages of even one key\ncomponent can restrict production even if other components are available. The prevalence of this kind of\nproduction in many industries made the broader supply chain particularly vulnerable to the extreme\npandemic supply shocks. A helpful discussion—which predates the pandemic and focuses on the 2011\nJapan earthquake—is Christoph E. Boehm, Aaron Flaaen, and Nitya Pandalai-Nayar (2019), “Input\nLinkages and the Transmission of Shocks: Firm-Level Evidence from the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake,”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, vol. 101 (March), pp. 60–75.\n10 Industrial production was low despite strong demand: New orders indexes from many sources were\nelevated throughout late 2020 and 2021. The Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity\nUtilization features questions on reasons for factory output being below capacity. “Insufficient supply of\nmaterials” and “insufficient supply of labor” both surged starting in late 2020 and remained near peak\nlevels from mid-2021 through mid-2022 before starting to move back down. Separately, the Institute for\nSupply Management’s Report on Business Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) features lists\nof items in short supply each month; the share of major manufacturing-sector input material groups\nreported as being in short supply surged to about 40 percent during 2021 and has since declined to below\n10 percent. For a more formal approach to measuring lost output in manufacturing industries, see Charles\nGilbert, Maria D. Tito, and Cynthia Doniger (2021), “Quantifying Bottlenecks in Manufacturing,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 19),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/quantifying-bottlenecks-in-manufacturing-\n20211119.html.\n\n- 8 -\nBut supply problems were not limited to goods; indeed, insufficient supply of\nlabor has also been widely cited by businesses as having held down output. Labor supply\nwas suddenly and severely limited early in the pandemic as workers voluntarily and, in\nsome cases, involuntarily stayed out of the workplace. The labor force did not recover to\npre-pandemic levels until mid-2022. Older workers, in particular, left the labor market in\nlarge numbers. But even many prime-age workers—those between the ages of 25 and\n54—withdrew because of school disruptions and health concerns, and prime-age labor\nforce participation remained below its pre-pandemic level until early 2023. A slowdown\nin immigration, likewise, deprived the economy of a customary source of labor supply\ngrowth, as did elevated mortality due to COVID-19.11\nFortunately, these supply shortages for both goods and labor have mostly\ndissipated. For example, auto production in 2023 nearly regained its 2019 level, and\nindustrial production as well as various goods supply indicators have returned closer to\ntheir pre-pandemic levels. Congestion in logistics and transportation networks eased, and\nfirms sometimes found alternative supply chain networks.\nIn the labor market, shortages directly related to the pandemic have eased, helping\nrestore labor force participation, likely in part because of the reopening of schools,\nprogress with the health situation, and help from childcare subsidies and other policies.\nIncreased capabilities for remote work, allowing for a decoupling between firm and\nworker location, expanded the pool of available workers and jobs. More broadly, strong\nlabor demand has enticed more workers into the labor market to the point that labor force\n11 Per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, the labor force level among\nforeign-born workers had a pre-pandemic peak about a year before the pandemic and did not fully recover\nto this peak until early 2022.\n\n- 9 -\nparticipation among prime-age workers is now above pre-pandemic levels. And\nimmigration has rebounded as well.\nAnother, more subtle source of labor market supply recovery has been\nimprovements in the quality of matches between firms and workers. At any time, a\ncrucial factor that affects labor supply is how well the skills of available workers fulfill\nthe needs of employers. With labor in many sectors in short supply and very high\nnumbers of job openings, many workers quit their jobs to move to new ones. Economists\ngenerally believe that increased labor turnover improves worker–firm matches—workers\nfind jobs that make better use of their skills, typically with higher pay, and firms find\nworkers that are better suited for their businesses and are more productive at their jobs.\nEconomic expansions, such as the one that has continued since April 2020, present more\nopportunities for workers to find a good match.12 And it appears that workers and firms\nwere pretty efficient at finding each other over the past couple of years, likely upgrading\nthe average quality of a job match in the process.13 Higher-quality job–worker matches\nimprove the productivity of workers, serving like a boost to labor supply.\nIf reductions in supply contributed to inflation, then recovery of that supply would\nhelp lower inflation, too. Supply improvements in the goods sector have helped ease\n12 Past research has found that job quality is higher in expansions; see Gadi Barlevy (2002), “The Sullying\nEffect of Recessions,” Review of Economic Studies, vol. 69 (January), pp. 65–96. In the pandemic\nspecifically, job-to-job flows appear to have featured strong wage growth; see David Autor, Arindrajit\nDube, and Annie McGrew (2023), “The Unexpected Compression: Competition at Work in the Low Wage\nLabor Market,” NBER Working Paper Series 31010 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, November), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31010.\n13 There are various ways to measure “matching efficiency.” One such measure shows an initial decline in\nmatching efficiency early in the pandemic, followed by a recovery to (roughly) pre-pandemic levels. See\nSimon Mongey and Jeff Horwich (2023), “Are Job Vacancies Still as Plentiful as They Appear?\nImplications for the ‘Soft Landing,’ ” Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, December 1,\nhttps://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/are-job-vacancies-still-as-plentiful-as-they-appear-\nimplications-for-the-soft-landing.\n\n- 10 -\ninflation starting in early 2022; for example, in January, the 12-month growth of new\nmotor vehicle prices was less than 1 percent, far slower than its peak pace above 13\npercent in the spring of 2022. More broadly, the overall price level for core PCE goods,\nwhich excludes food and energy, was fairly flat last year and has actually declined in\nrecent months.\nOn the labor side, supply recovery has likely contributed to disinflation by\nhelping to ease the pace of wage growth—especially in the labor-intensive services\nindustries.14 For private services as a whole, 12-month nominal wage growth, as\nmeasured by average hourly earnings, was 4.5 percent in January, down from its peak of\n5.9 percent in early 2022. And, sure enough, price inflation in services has also slowed:\nIn core PCE services—which accounts for roughly three-fourths of core PCE—12-month\ninflation was 4.1 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.8 percent early last year.15\nBut supply is not the only factor behind the slowing of inflation. Policies\naffecting aggregate demand have played a role as well. On the fiscal side, measures of\nthe impact of government spending on economic growth turned negative in 2021 after\nbeing strongly supportive in 2020.16 And in terms of monetary policy, the FOMC’s\nactions in late 2021 indicated a sooner-than-previously-anticipated start to policy rate\n14 In general, the most labor-intensive sectors (measured as labor costs’ share of value added) are mostly\nservices sectors. As of 2022, the labor cost share of value added was 83 percent in education and health\nservices, 75 percent in professional and business services, 64 percent in construction, and 59 percent in\nleisure and hospitality. See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2023), “Interactive Data,” tables on\ncomposition of gross output by industry,” December,\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&step=2&isuri=1&categories=gdpxind.\n15 The connection between wages and prices in services industries has been explored in the economics\nliterature and been found to be a likely contributor to the higher “stickiness” or persistence of services\nprices relative to goods prices. See Ekaterina Peneva (2011), “Some Evidence on Factor Intensity and\nPrice Rigidity,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 35 (October), pp. 1652–58.\n16 See, for example, the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure, which estimates the effect of government\ntax and spending policy on gross domestic product growth. The measure is available on the Brookings\nInstitution’s website at https://www.brookings.edu/articles/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure.\n\n- 11 -\nincreases, with the FOMC beginning to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in\nMarch 2022. After that, the Committee tightened its stance of policy expeditiously. The\nresult can be seen especially in areas of the economy that are sensitive to financial\nconditions. The housing sector saw a significant slowdown, with residential investment\ndeclining more than 15 percent in 2022 and remaining flat in 2023. Growth of\ninvestment in equipment was tepid last year, likely due in part to restrictive financial\nconditions, even as we have seen growth in manufacturing construction for\nsemiconductors and electric vehicle batteries that will help address remaining supply-side\nbottlenecks.\nAside from these examples of subdued spending in policy-sensitive sectors, we\ncan also see the imprint of monetary policy in the anchoring of inflation expectations.\nEven amid high inflation, households, businesses, and financial markets believed that\ninflation would eventually return to its target pace. These beliefs were guided by the\nFOMC’s actions: By raising policy rates expeditiously and communicating clearly, the\nCommittee demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and its commitment to\nthe price-stability mandate. Anchored inflation expectations are apparent, for example, in\nthe popular University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. Expectations of inflation for\nthe period covering the next 5 to 10 years have remained relatively stable over the\npandemic and close to levels seen before the pandemic. And shorter-term expectations\nrose in 2021 but have come back down recently.17 Anchored inflation expectations likely\nmatter for actual price setting. That is what modern theories of the Phillips curve\n17 Expected inflation in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations shows a similar pattern to\nthat seen in the Michigan survey. And expectations appear well anchored in surveys of forecasters and in\nmarket-based measures.\n\n- 12 -\nsuggest. And the relevance of that theoretical expectation has been suggested by surveys\nreported by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond staff: The data show a close relationship\nbetween firms’ expectations for overall inflation and those firms’ own price-setting\nplans.18 Crucially, by keeping inflation expectations anchored, the FOMC has likely\nforestalled the development of wage–price spiral dynamics of the kind I mentioned\nearlier, while also creating conditions in which inflation has been able to peak at a lower\nrate than would have been the case if the FOMC had not acted with credibility and clear\ncommunication. Real wage growth—that is, growth of wages after accounting for\ninflation—has turned positive, which means workers’ income is rising faster than the cost\nof living.\nA Couple of Final Observations about the Pandemic and Its Aftermath\nThese developments help bring us back to the inflation–unemployment tradeoff\nthat started my discussion. The pandemic experience has shown that the nature of that\ntradeoff changes with economic conditions, as does the steepness of the Phillips curve. I\nwill close by making two more general observations about the changes that we have seen\nduring the pandemic and its aftermath, with suggestions about open questions for\nresearchers moving forward.\nFirst, supply curves are, as economists say, “convex”: Their slope increases\nsharply after quantity supplied reaches a certain point, such that prices rise quickly. The\nsteep part of the supply curve can come into play when demand nears the limits of an\nindustry’s capacity. That could happen either because of an unusually large increase in\n18 See Felipe F. Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell (2024), “Inflation Expectations and Price\nSetting among Fifth District Firms,” Economic Brief 24-03 (Richmond, Va.: Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond, January), https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-03.\n\n- 13 -\ndemand or because of a temporary reduction in industry capacity—or both. Research has\nshown this is the case for individual industries, even in the pre-pandemic period.19\nDuring the pandemic, many industries experienced large demand shocks or supply\ncurtailment that contributed to inflation, as I have already discussed, and those same\nshocks also may have exacerbated the inflationary effects by pushing many industries up\nthe steep part of their supply curves.20\nEarly in the pandemic, the convexity or steepness of industry supply curves was\nquite costly in terms of our inflation mandate. But it has likely helped us more recently\nas we have apparently moved back down the steep part of the supply curve in many\nindustries, which has allowed for rapid disinflation.21 An open question in the longer\nterm is whether this process has helped firms learn more about supply chains and\ninventory management such that we might even be less likely to encounter the steep part\nof supply curves in the future.\nSecond, with regard to the Phillips curve specifically, I note that in a large class of\neconomic models, the steepness of the Phillips curve is partly a function of how\nfrequently firms adjust their prices, and that seems to be borne out by recent experience.22\n19 See Christoph E. Boehm and Nitya Pandalai-Nayar (2022), “Convex Supply Curves,” American\nEconomic Review, vol. 112 (December), pp. 3941–69.\n20 For an accessible discussion, see Deepa D. Datta, Laura Feiveson, Ekaterina Peneva, and Gisela Rua\n(2022), “Bottlenecks, Shortages, and Soaring Prices in the U.S. Economy,” FEDS Notes (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 24),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/bottlenecks-shortages-and-soaring-prices-in-the-\nus-economy-20220624.html.\n21 For a formal treatment of the notion that monetary policy can be particularly effective at lowering\ninflation without large output losses following supply and capacity issues, see Xiwen Bai, Jesús Fernández-\nVillaverde, Yiliang Li, and Francesco Zanetti (2024), “The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain\nDisruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory,” working paper, January, available on\nthe University of Pennsylvania website at\nhttps://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf.\n22 In a broad set of models on inaction and action in the face of uncertainty and “non-convex” adjustment\ncosts, firms may choose not to change prices even when faced with shocks, provided the shocks are small.\n\n- 14 -\nBefore the pandemic, the typical price tag lasted more than 10 months, and this figure\nwas reasonably stable for many years. But the pandemic seems to have moved firms into\na regime of more frequent price adjustment—that is, shorter price duration. By early\n2022, the typical price was lasting less than five months. Price adjustment frequency has\nsince slowed back down, with the latest data from the third quarter of last year suggesting\nprices were lasting nearly seven months.23 Continued slowing of price adjustment\nfrequency is an indicator that firms’ costs are rising less quickly and the economy is\nmoving back down the Phillips curve.24 Interestingly, though, in the workhorse academic\nmodels used for studying the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the frequency\nof price adjustment is often assumed to be constant. Of course, economists have thought\nabout this in the past; but a greater understanding of the relationship between the price\nadjustment decisions of individual firms and overall inflation is an important area for\nfurther academic research.25\nBut large shocks move firms out of their “inaction range” such that a series of large shocks can increase\nadjustment frequency. This can potentially explain reduced price “stickiness” in the pandemic. However,\nthis outcome was not necessarily inevitable, as higher uncertainty can reduce adjustment frequency (due to\nraising the “real option” value of waiting), and the pandemic environment has been uncertain in many\ndimensions.

    "text": "For release on delivery\nNoon EDT\nJune 5, 2025\nThe Economic Outlook and Appropriate Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nAdriana D. Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Economic Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nJune 5, 2025\n\nThank you, Barbara, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It is\nan honor to join other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) who\nhave addressed the Economic Club of New York over the years.1\nMy subject is the current state of the U.S. economy, the economic outlook, and\nthe implications for monetary policy. The short version is that the labor market appears\nresilient and stable and economic activity is continuing to grow, although at a more\nmoderate pace than in the second half of last year.\nWhile the labor market is currently at or near the FOMC’s goal of maximum\nemployment, there is the prospect that trade and other policy changes could raise the\nunemployment rate and push employment away from our objective. These policies,\nespecially higher import tariffs, could also raise inflation over the rest of this year. In\nfact, while progress toward the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent inflation has continued, we\nhave seen an escalation in goods inflation and data from surveys, and non-traditional\nsources point to some inflationary pressures as well.\nIn addition to increases in U.S. import tariffs and retaliatory increases in the\ntariffs foreign countries apply to U.S. exports, other policy changes, either proposed or\nalready underway relate to immigration, fiscal policy and regulation. Those policies\ncould affect economic conditions, and since it is the FOMC’s job to set monetary policy\nthat is best able to achieve our mandated goals of maximum employment and stable\nprices, we must consider the effects of these policies. So far, we are beginning to see the\nimpact only of higher tariffs on inflation. Still, thinking about the outlook requires\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nconsideration of how the economy could be affected by all these policy changes moving\nforward.\nIt remains difficult to judge the current strength of economic activity, based on\ndata through the first four months of 2025, primarily because of the front-loading of\nimports ahead of the implementation of tariffs. While real gross domestic product (GDP)\ndeclined slightly in the first quarter, that was largely because of a surge in imports ahead\nof anticipated tariff increases, a surge that will likely reverse. Putting aside fluctuations\nin trade and in inventories and focusing on the April data, personal income and\nconsumption point to a slight moderation in economic activity. While personal\ndisposable income increased at a healthy pace so far this year, consumption grew more\nslowly in April, which may indicate consumers are becoming more cautious. That said,\nthere is considerable uncertainty about imports in the second quarter and uncertainty\nabout the impact that higher prices will have on spending, so I will be looking for more\nevidence about economic activity in May ahead of the FOMC’s next meeting, June 17\nand 18.\nOne encouraging sign about economic activity is the resilience of the labor\nmarket. We will get the May employment report tomorrow, but the data in hand indicate\nthat employment has continued to grow and that labor supply and demand remain in\nrelative balance. In April, employers added 177,000 jobs, slightly higher than the\naverage for the previous six months. The unemployment rate was steady in April at 4.2\npercent, in the historically low range of 4 percent to 4.2 percent that it has remained in\nsince May 2024. Data on job openings and quits for April likewise point to a resilient but\nsomewhat looser labor market with a balance of supply and demand. The vacancy rate, a\n\n- 3 -\nmeasure of demand for workers, was 4.4 percent, down from a peak of 7.4 percent three\nyears ago and roughly the same level as just before the pandemic.2 The quits rate, an\nindicator of the confidence workers feel in finding a job, has been in the narrow range of\n1.9 to 2.2 percent since December 2023, and just a bit below the average level in 2019.3\nAhead of tomorrow’s employment report, other data that we have for May are\ngenerally consistent with this picture of the labor market but may suggest some cooling.\nThe average of private-sector forecasters’ predictions for total job creation is 130,000.4\nAlso, while the pace of job layoffs remained at historically low levels through the final\nweek of May, based on the number of new claims for unemployment benefits, other\nmeasures suggest modest increases in layoffs. For instance, Worker Adjustment and\nRetraining Notifications (WARN notices) of layoffs have ticked up since the beginning\nof the year, as have the mentions of layoffs in the Fed’s Beige Book survey and job cuts\ndata reported by Challenger, Gray and Christmas.\nThe other side of the FOMC’s dual mandate is price stability. Progress in\nlowering inflation toward the Committee’s 2 percent target has slowed some since last\nsummer, even if headline and core inflation have continued to decline. The FOMC’s\npreferred inflation gauge, based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), grew at a\n2.1 percent annual rate in April. While that is quite close to the FOMC’s target, it was\ndragged down by a decline in energy prices. Core inflation—which excludes volatile\nprices for food and energy and is a good guide to future inflation—came in at 2.5 percent,\n2 The vacancy rate is defined as the number of vacant jobs as a percentage of total employment.\n3 The quits rate is defined as the percentage of employees who voluntarily quit their jobs relative to total\nemployment.\n4 I report here the median of economists’ expectations for total nonfarm payrolls polled by Bloomberg.\n\n- 4 -\nso I do believe that our monetary policy stance, which I view as modestly restrictive, is\ncurrently appropriate to achieve and sustain 2 percent inflation over the longer term.\nSticking with core inflation, to help me judge ongoing progress toward price\nstability, I like to look at the 12-month change in each of the three main categories of\ncore inflation: housing services, services excluding housing, and goods. The PCE price\nindex for housing services has declined markedly in the past year, from 5.7 percent in\nApril 2024 to 4.2 percent in April this year, but it is still considerably above the level that\npersisted before the pandemic. Meanwhile, the PCE price index for core services\nexcluding housing, which makes up more than half of core PCE inflation, has declined\nfrom 3.6 percent in April last year to 3 percent in April 2025, still somewhat above the\nlevel that prevailed before the pandemic. And the third category is core goods inflation,\nwhich rose at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the 12 months through April, compared with\nApril 2024 when it had actually fallen 0.5 percent over the previous 12 months. In recent\ndecades, core goods prices have typically fallen over time, helping to keep a lid on\noverall inflation, so this is a meaningful reversal of the disinflationary process. To sum\nup, while core services inflation has fallen, it is still running above the rate before the\npandemic, and the progress on core goods inflation has reversed. I have been paying\nattention to this reversal for some time and how this could be exacerbated by the\nannounced and implemented tariffs.\nResearch published recently by Federal Reserve Board staff calculates the pass-\nthrough of tariffs enacted before April 2 to individual product categories tracked in\n\n- 5 -\npersonal consumption expenditures.5 Using PCE data from February through April, the\nauthors estimate that the 20 percentage point increase in tariffs on Chinese imports earlier\nin the year raised overall core PCE prices by two tenths of 1 percent. Since tariffs on\nChina are currently higher than 20 percent, and tariffs have increased for other countries,\nthese results tell me, first, that the pass-through of tariffs into prices is relatively quick,\nand, second, should elevated tariffs persist, even just in the short run, larger effects may\nbe coming soon. The import surge I mentioned earlier, ahead of sharp tariff increases,\nhas delayed the price effects associated with those tariffs, and the reversal in that surge\nthat I expect in the next few months will likely signal larger price increases.\nAn important feature of most of the data I have mentioned so far is that it is\nreleased with significant lags. For example, the initial estimate of GDP is released about\n30 days after the end of the quarter, and two later revisions mean that we may not get a\nclear idea of how output increased until nearly three months afterward. Monthly data on\njob openings are typically released with a one-month delay. The reasons for these lags\nare well known. For instance, statistical agencies can only survey households and\nbusinesses every so often, and it takes time to compile and publish high-quality statistics.\nStill, if policymakers solely rely on these traditional data to forecast what the economy\nwill do in the future, they end up focusing on the past, which is a little like driving down\nthe road by looking in a rearview mirror.\nAs I mentioned in my speech last year to the National Association for Business\nEconomics, there has been an explosion of nontraditional or soft data produced by the\n5 See Robert Minton and Mariano Somale (2025), “Detecting Tariff Effects on Consumer Prices in Real\nTime,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 9),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3786\n\n- 6 -\nprivate sector, giving us an opportunity to measure economic developments with greater\ntimeliness (sometimes even in real time), at a higher frequency, and with more\ngranularity.6 These data are released closer to the time of collection, such as several\nsurveys from the Federal Reserve Banks. Given today’s fast-changing and uncertain\nenvironment, soft and non-traditional data becomes all the more important.\nThat said, nontraditional data often face their own challenges, including issues\nwith representativeness, the lack of methodological consistency, and a short time-series\nhistory. And, to be clear, while some non-traditional data are indeed “soft data” in that\nthey capture sentiment or expectations, other data in this category are decidedly “hard,”\nsince they are based on actual decisions and actions by businesses and households. In\nevaluating both traditional and nontraditional data on the economy, I face a tradeoff\nbetween timeliness and precision, but both sources are essential for me in formulating an\noutlook.\nSo, in the context of hard data that has lately been providing a less-than-clear\nview of the economy, what are the nontraditional data telling me about meeting the\nFOMC’s two economic objectives? On the price-stability side, survey data from\nbusinesses suggest that price increases are coming. These surveys report diffusion\nindexes, which are calculated as the percentage of total respondents reporting increases in\nprices minus the percentage reporting declines. Surveys for May point to indexes for\ninputs and selling prices being elevated relative to the beginning of the year, probably\nreflecting effects from higher tariffs. Manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys\n6 See Adriana D. Kugler (2024), “The Challenges Facing Economic Measurement and Creative Solutions,”\nspeech delivered at the 21st Annual Economic Measurement Seminar, National Association for Business\nEconomics Foundation, Washington, June 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nfrom the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), as well as several surveys from the\nFederal Reserve Banks report increases in material prices and prices charged to\ncustomers, with many respondents volunteering that this is related to tariff increases.\nI believe expectations of future inflation are an important determinant of current\ninflation, and data for May continue to point to increases in measures of near-term\ninflation expectations. An average of private-sector economists published by the Survey\nof Professional Forecasters finds that expectations for core PCE inflation over the next\nyear moved up from 2.4 percent in April to 2.9 percent in May. Among data on inflation\nexpectations, the most dramatic increases have been seen in the University of Michigan\nSurveys of Consumers. While I take seriously the concern that recent methodological\nchanges in the survey may have made this measure less reliable, this survey is a\nlongstanding and important barometer of consumer sentiment, and I still monitor the\nsignals it is giving us closely. According to the Michigan survey, consumers expect\ninflation in the next year to average 6.6 percent and over the next 5 to 10 years to average\n4.2 percent. Tariffs continued to be an important issue in the Michigan survey, with\nnearly three-quarters of consumers mentioning them, up from almost 60 percent in April.\nFirms have also raised their inflation expectations, with a survey by the Cleveland Fed\nreporting an increase in one-year-ahead expectations from 3.2 percent in the first quarter\nto 3.9 percent in the second.\nHowever, I still see stability in most measures of longer-run inflation\nexpectations. Notably, expectations among professional forecasters for inflation 6 to 10\nyears ahead decreased from 2.1 percent in April to 2 percent in May. That provides me\n\n- 8 -\nsome comfort, as it points to confidence from the public in the Fed to bring inflation to\nour goal of 2 percent over the medium term.\nRecent developments and the data I have been monitoring have led me to consider\nat least three channels through which tariffs could have a persistent influence on inflation.\nFirst, as I have mentioned in some previous speeches, while it is true that short-run\ninflation expectations are influenced by short-term economic shocks, I value them\nbecause they often represent the horizon of decisionmaking for businesses and\nconsumers.7 The increase in short-run inflation expectations that I previously mentioned\nmay give businesses more leeway to raise prices, thus increasing the persistence of\ninflation. A second channel for tariffs influencing inflation could be opportunistic\npricing by firms, if they take advantage to increase prices of items not directly affected by\ntariffs. This, along with tariffs on intermediate goods, could generate second-round\neffects on inflation. And a third channel is that lower productivity may lead to upward\npressure on prices. As firms adjust to the higher input costs and lower demand, they may\ncut back on capital investment and shift to a less-efficient combination of inputs. While,\nso far, I have only seen anecdotal evidence for the opportunistic pricing among these\nthree channels, I am closely monitoring any signs of increased persistence on inflation.\nNontraditional data indicators of real activity suggest that the economy might be\nstarting to slow. Measures of household sentiment about economic conditions remain\ndownbeat, such as those from the University of Michigan or the Conference Board. As\nfor businesses, manufacturing surveys, such as the ISM, report a slowing in new orders.\n7 See Adriana D. Kugler (2025), “Inflation Expectations and Monetary Policymaking,” speech delivered at\nthe Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies and the Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and\nFinance, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., April 2,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250402a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nAdditionally, the May Beige Book reports that economic activity has declined slightly\nrelative to April. On the services side, representing the majority of businesses, the ISM\nPMI has trended down in the past few months and reached a level in May consistent with\nstagnation. Focusing on the ISM services new order component, it declined significantly\nin May to one of its lowest levels in recent years.\nIn summary, the nontraditional data on economic activity are consistent with my\noverall assessment that we might be seeing some moderation in the growth of economic\nactivity but not yet a significant slowdown. As policies on fiscal matters and\nimmigration take shape, I find it important to also account for their implications for the\nU.S. economic outlook. On the fiscal side, the omnibus bill passed by the House would\nadd stimulus to the economy.8 On the immigration side, we have seen inflows\nsubstantially down since last year, which decreases the labor supply and could add\nmeaningful upward pressure to inflation by the end of the year in sectors reliant on\nimmigrant labor such as agriculture, construction, food processing, and leisure and\nhospitality. That said, I have not yet seen much of an imprint on wages from these\ndevelopments.\nLet me conclude with the implications of all this for monetary policy. As\ninflation has declined over the past two years, due in part to tighter monetary policy, the\nU.S. economy has remained resilient, with stable labor markets and employment near its\nmaximum sustainable level. Disinflation has slowed, and we are already seeing the\neffects of higher tariffs, which I expect will continue to raise inflation over 2025. I see\ngreater upside risks to inflation at this juncture and potential downside risks to\n8 See Congressional Budget Office (2025), Preliminary Analysis of the Distributional Effects of the One\nBig Beautiful Bill Act (Washington: CBO, May), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61422.\n\n- 10 -\nemployment and output growth down the road, and this leads me to continue to support\nmaintaining the FOMC’s policy rate at its current setting if upside risks to inflation\nremain. I view our current stance of monetary policy as well-positioned for any changes\nin the macroeconomic environment.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and I look forward to what I\nexpect will be interesting questions.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nWomen in Economics Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nApril 4, 2024\n\nThank you, President Musalem, and many congratulations on the start of your\nnew position here at the St. Louis Fed. We are all so happy to have you as part of the\nFederal Reserve System, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak here today.1\nI will start with the issue that has brought us here—why it is so important for\nwomen to be a full and equitably represented part of the economics profession. There\nare, of course, moral reasons for economics to reflect the values of our democratic\nsociety—it is the right thing to do. But there are eminently practical reasons as well.\nEconomics favors the productive utilization of resources, and bringing more women into\nthe profession obviously makes better use of the talents and efforts of more than half of\nthe population. Greater diversity in a workforce yields better ideas and greater\nproductivity, and the field of economics has certainly been enriched by these\ncontributions.\nBut today, I would like to focus on the benefits of greater representation of\nwomen that accrue to economic research and policymaking—the way that you can make\neconomic analysis more constructive and relevant. In a broad sense, different\nexperiences and perspectives among those engaged in any social science should provide\nbetter insights about how people think and act. But I would like to take this point a step\nfurther and connect this issue of representation to the ways in which we approach\neconomic research. In particular, I will describe how my own personal experience has\nbeen an important tool for me to use, in combination with the more familiar and rigorous\ntools of the economist, in ways that I believe have strengthened my research. In doing\nso, I also hope to show that personal experience can be used by you and others in our\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nprofession to provide deeper insights about the questions we grapple with. If this is true,\nit would constitute another way in which greater representation of women—and others\nwith underrepresented backgrounds—will increase and enhance the valuable\ncontributions that economics makes to society.\nIn my discussion, I will refer to some of my own past research to illustrate my\ngeneral approach to economics. Importantly, though, my comments today are only\nillustrative of a general approach and are not commentary on any specific policy\nquestions.\nIn explaining how I let personal experience and rigorous economic methodology\ninform each other, I am going to employ, in a somewhat casual way, two words that you\nmay be familiar with. I think of a “deductive” approach as beginning with or relying on\ntheory or general observations and then using data or qualitative evidence to verify those\nideas in specific settings. For me, an “inductive” approach means beginning with\npersonal experience and specific evidence from a particular context and then moving to\nmore general lessons that we can draw on as economists about given issues or topics. In\nmy career, I have found it fruitful to employ both of these approaches at different times,\nand often in succession or in alternation, to move from the specific to the general,\ndeveloping a theory and then sometimes using specifics to test that theory.\nLet me start with a little personal background, since that helped form my\napproach to research. I was born in the U.S. but grew up in Colombia. While there, my\nparents and I traveled around the country, where I observed a broad range of social\nproblems: poverty, homelessness, child labor, and a lack of access to health care and\nother basic necessities. As a child, when you see suffering to this extent, you wonder\n\n- 3 -\nabout why and how it is occurring. Later, as an undergraduate, I found that economics\noffered tools that could help society understand and, I hoped, address some of these\nproblems. What I started to see, and then saw more over time, was that in many ways the\ndifferent social problems I observed were closely related to the opportunities people have\nto work and earn an income that reflects their effort and productivity as workers—in\nshort, issues at the heart of labor economics. It also turned out that the tools of\neconomics—for example, math and statistical analysis—were well suited to studying\nthese questions and helped ground my work in objective reality. So I developed these\nskills by pursuing a Ph.D. in economics. During my career, I have conducted research on\na range of topics, including labor markets, productivity, and social safety nets. And, as I\nwill show, I have employed both the inductive and the deductive approaches that I have\ndescribed here to formulate economic questions, rigorously examine data and evidence,\nand then test my conclusions.\nThe first example I want to share with you is a paper I wrote with Scott Imberman\nand Bruce Sacerdote on the relocation of families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and\nRita.2 In 2005, I was a professor of economics at the University of Houston, in a city that\nwas a major destination for people forced to evacuate from New Orleans and the\nsurrounding area because of the hurricanes that year. Of the million people displaced by\nthe hurricanes in 2005, Houston received 75,000 evacuees, many of them school-age\nchildren.\n2 See Scott A. Imberman, Adriana D. Kugler, and Bruce I. Sacerdote (2012), “Katrina’s Children:\nEvidence on the Structure of Peer Effects from Hurricane Evacuees,” American Economic Review, vol. 102\n(August), pp. 2048–82.\n\n- 4 -\nHouston was a fast-growing city with schools that already faced challenges, so\npeople had questions about what effect this influx of new students might have on our\nlocal schools—now stretched for resources—and the students already attending them. It\nmattered to me as a member of the community with my own children attending those\nschools. Fortunately, economics provided tools to explore this question.\nThe question we considered was about “peer effects”—does the performance of\nyour peers affect your own performance in school? How will students coming from other\nschools affect the outcomes for those already in Houston? The research literature showed\nsome evidence of an effect, but the results were mixed. It is easy to imagine some\nreasons why peers could matter. A key challenge was that, even if we could find a\nrelationship between the outcomes of the existing Houston students and their peers from\nLouisiana, that would not prove that the new students “caused” the outcomes of the\nexisting Houston students. Classmates in the same classes with similar backgrounds\ncould have similar outcomes for lots of reasons. But in this case, these new peers did not\nchoose to attend certain schools based on pre-existing trends but instead were assigned to\nschools based on their shelter location, which is basically a random assignment—highly\nconducive to estimating causal effects. And the magnitude of this particular event was\nlarge enough to provide lots of variation in the composition of peers. I consider the\napproach we took to designing this study a good example of the power of deductive\nreasoning—developing a hypothesis and then finding the data by which to test it.\nBut we didn’t just think about the data we started with. We had lots of\ndiscussions with school administrators and teachers. What they had to say about their\nexperiences led us to explore ways in which the new students were affecting the existing\n\n- 5 -\nones, beyond grades and test scores—for example, behavior in schools and absenteeism.\nAs any parent of school-age kids can tell you, these are obvious and significant factors in\nhow students learn, and these discussions resonated for me as a parent with kids in\nschool. My co-authors and I knew we had to make this part of our research.\nOur basic approach in this paper was to relate changes in student outcomes with\nthe prevalence of evacuee children in their district, controlling for a rich set of factors.\nOur conclusions were that in Houston, a large influx of evacuees did not generally have a\nlarge effect on test performance of local students. We did detect some negative effects in\nsome subgroups, particularly in math. Motivated by discussions with teachers and\nadministrators, we also found some small negative effects on attendance and behavior.\nUsing traditional methods in economics, we conducted a number of what economists call\n“robustness checks,” making sure that our assumption that the relocating families weren’t\npicking school districts based on pre-existing trends held up, trying different ways of\nmeasuring outcomes or specifying models, and attempting to exclude alternative\nexplanations, such as changes in teacher quality or educational resources.\nUsing these familiar methods, we had found that Houston schools were able to\nabsorb the new students with little aggregate effect on local students. But that finding\nsent us back to think about the theories we had developed at the start of the project and\nthe different reasons that make peers relevant to a student. In a sense, now that we had\nsome results, what had started as a deductive analysis turned into an inductive one. And\nby examining the data more thoroughly, we discovered that a crucial factor in\ndetermining the impact of peers on academic outcomes was the extent to which students\nare grouped and interact with classmates of a similar academic ability level. Adding this\n\n- 6 -\ndimension to our research, we found that peer effects were, in fact, stronger among\ncohorts of students with similar academic ability. It is a nuance to our overall finding of\nlittle significant effect and a result that I suspect would not have been attainable without\nthe personal experience that I brought to the project as a parent—one of the factors that\nhad motivated the work in the first place.\nLet me offer a second example of this “inductive” approach, based on personal\nexperience, and the interaction with a “deductive” approach that resulted in research that\nI am particularly proud of. As I said earlier, I taught at the University of Houston, a great\nschool that has a very diverse student body, with people from all walks of life and at\ndifferent stages of their lives. There were a lot of commuters, many still living at home\nwith parents. There were also a lot of actual parents in my classes and people who had to\nwork full-time jobs while completing their education. I once had a student who needed to\nreschedule a final exam because she had to go to court to fight for custody of her child. I\nhad students who struggled to secure childcare to attend class, others who struggled with\naccess to transportation to and from campus. The hurdles they often had to overcome\nwere daunting. And while many obtained loans and other tuition assistance, the\nchallenges they faced were multidimensional, and I often found myself thinking that their\neducation would be much more successful if they had support in other areas of their lives.\nI had written two papers on a training program in Colombia that included a\nstipend for workers.3 The stipend was intended to subsidize transportation for workers,\n3 See Adriana Kugler, Orazio Attanasio, and Costas Meghir (2011), “Subsidizing Vocational Training for\nDisadvantaged Youth in Colombia: Evidence from a Randomized Trial,” American Economic Journal:\nApplied Economics, vol. 3 (July), pp.188–220; and Adriana Kugler, Maurice Kugler, Juan E. Saavedra, and\nLuis Omar Herrera-Prada (2022), “Long-Term Educational Consequences of Vocational Training in\nColombia,” Journal of Human Resources, vol. 57 (January), pp. 178–216.\n\n- 7 -\nwith an extra amount for women that was intended to supplement their costs for\nchildcare. The results found a significant boost to wages and employment from the\ntraining program, especially for women, and we found that the gains stayed with those\nworkers for over a decade after the program. Moreover, we also found that the program\nencouraged workers and even their relatives to pursue more formal schooling—high\nschool and even college. But these papers didn’t allow me to explore the separate\ncontribution of the stipend to the wage, employment, and educational gains we found.\nMy own experience with students at the University of Houston suggested that this more\ncomprehensive support for the workers in training was important, so I decided to follow\nup on my research.\nSo I wrote another paper—jointly with Felipe Barrera-Osorio and Mikko\nSilliman—based on an experiment we conducted in collaboration with a training\nprogram.4 In this experiment, we randomly offered stipends to some but not all workers.\nStudents might use the stipend to pay for transportation to and from the program, or\nperhaps to help cover meals during the program, depending on what they saw as their\nmost pressing needs. I like to call this a form of “wraparound” support; the stipend wraps\naround the main program to make it easier for people to participate. Some workers\naccepted to the training program were put in a class that focused on technical skills, and\nothers in a class emphasizing social skills—again using random assignment. We found\nthat participants saw an increase in employment, hours worked, and wages relative to\nworkers who did not take the program, and the effects were greatest for women. Labor\n4 Felipe Barrera-Osorio, Adriana Kugler, and Mikko Silliman (2023), “Hard and Soft Skills in Vocational\nTraining: Experimental Evidence from Colombia,” World Bank Economic Review, vol. 37 (August), pp.\n409–36.\n\n- 8 -\nmarket outcomes improved more for those who received technical skills training, though\nthis difference diminished after less than a year. And, lastly, we found that the effects of\nthe program were indeed magnified by the stipend program. The “wraparound” support\nenhanced the value of the training program and likely helped mitigate the other labor\nmarket challenges faced by participants.\nThis paper again shows how insights gained from personal experience, combined\nwith the deductive methods and tools of economics, can be the basis for good research.\nAs I suspected from my experience with my University of Houston students, providing\neducation is more effective, and the returns are higher, when students have some\n“wraparound” support that makes their lives a bit easier. We took this inductive\napproach and demonstrated it using standard tools of economics—randomization in a\ncarefully designed experiment.\nAnd this approach continued in my past work as a policymaker. At the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor and at the World Bank, I confronted questions that resonated for me\nwith experiences I had had and earlier applied in my work as a researcher. At the Labor\nDepartment, I worked on workforce development issues, and we were able to include\naccess to more comprehensive “wraparound” services to promote strong take-up and\nretention in these programs. When I was advocating for this approach, I thought about\nmy students in Houston and those workers in Colombia, all of them trying to overcome\nbig challenges and build a better life. And I was grateful then, and I’m grateful now, for\nmy personal experiences, which didn’t come from a textbook or a lecture but helped open\nmy eyes to the answers to some of the important questions that economics strives to\nanswer.\n\n- 9 -\nThe research and policy work I have just described predate my time as a member\nof the Federal Reserve Board, and the policies I studied then are outside the purview of\nmy current role. But I continue to apply the general approach of bringing my own\nexperience, and the experiences I hear from others, together with the rigorous tools of\neconomics. I listen to people from a range of communities and backgrounds to better\nunderstand the economic data and the statistical analysis we perform while working to\nmake monetary policy decisions within the framework assigned to us by Congress that\nbenefit all Americans.\nSo I will close my remarks by urging all of you to find ways to bring your unique\nexperiences into your work in economics. I am a woman, a Latina, an immigrant, and a\nmother. As a person with this particular background, I have found that I have a unique\nperspective I can bring to the economics profession. By all means, build the technical\nskills you will need to prove your ideas; that is, indeed, critical in the economics\nprofession. But don’t be afraid to bring up your own perspective, based on your own\nexperiences, when discussing economic issues. I think this is especially important for\nwomen, whose perspectives are still underrepresented in the profession.\nWhether you decide to pursue a path in economics focused on research, policy,\nbusiness, or some combination of these, you will make the greatest contribution by\nbecoming a true expert on the issues you work on. You will accomplish this by refining\nyour technical skills and, importantly, by bringing your unique perspective to each\nproblem you seek to solve.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2025 U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Legislative Summit\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 25, 2025\n\nThank you, Ramiro, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with all of you\ntoday.1 Welcome to Washington, D.C.! Bienvenidos a la capital! I hope you have a\nproductive conference and an enjoyable visit. I am honored to speak with you today\nbecause I have long appreciated the efforts of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce\nin supporting Hispanic-owned businesses, especially small businesses and entrepreneurs.\nIt is also gratifying to speak to you today as the first Latin policymaker in the Federal\nReserve’s history.\nThe support and mentorship from my family and my communities, including\nmany in the Hispanic community, have been foundational to my career. I am proud that I\ncan bring my own perspective and background to how I view the economy and economic\ndata—just as I value learning and hearing from others—because I know the decisions I\nmake can affect the lives of all Americans. As a Fed Governor, I serve all Americans,\nand I strive to recognize the economic contributions that come from all corners of this\ncountry.\nToday, I will talk about the entrepreneurial spirit that many Latinos embody and\nshare with you the importance of Latinos to the whole of the U.S. economy. I will then\nprovide my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nEntrepreneurial Spirit\nLet me start by saying that I have a strong affinity for entrepreneurs and recognize\nthat they are a driving force behind economic growth and job creation—which I know\nfrom the data, as I have spent most of my career as a labor economist and researcher. But\nI truly understand the crucial role they play in the economy because my grandparents and\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nfather were entrepreneurs. My maternal grandfather was a dairy farmer, and I still recall\nthe effort and dedication I saw as a child while joining him as he went from store to store\nselling milk early in the morning—before starting his other job as mayor of the town.\nAnd my paternal grandparents owned an electronics shop, where they worked shoulder to\nshoulder. My grandpa ran the front end of the shop, and my grandma was in charge of\nthe accounting and inventory. The lessons on the value of hard work and taking initiative\nhave stayed with me throughout my career in academia and continue to now in my work\nas a policymaker. I have always brought an entrepreneurial spirit to everything I do,\nseeking to be proactive about identifying opportunities and pursuing new or better\nsolutions to long-standing challenges.\nAnd that is exactly what millions of Latino entrepreneurs do across the U.S. every\nday. There are roughly 5 million Latino-owned businesses that provide jobs to millions\nof other workers across the country.2 And the number of entrepreneurs is growing fast.\nBetween 2007 and 2022, there was a 57 percent increase in the number of Latin-owned\nbusinesses, and the number of employees on their collective payrolls grew 1.2 million.\nAs I have emphasized in my past speeches, the growth in new business formation has\nbeen critical in sustaining the productivity growth that we have experienced in recent\nyears, which has allowed us to achieve an economic expansion while reducing inflation.\nI see this growth as I travel around the country and meet with workers and\nbusiness leaders. For example, I noted in a recent speech in Miami that South Florida is\n2 See Bárbara Gómez-Aguiñaga, George Foster, and Jerry I. Porras (2024), 2023 State of Latino\nEntrepreneurship, a publication of the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (Palo Alto, Calif.:\nStanford Graduate School of Business, in collaboration with the Latino Business Action Network, March),\nhttps://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/pdfs/state-latino-entrepreneurship-2023.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nan area with a large and vibrant Latino community and is also one of the top regions for\nnew business formation.3\nOther data are also consistent with an elevated level of entrepreneurship in our\ncommunity. Latino adults who did not previously own a business created a new\ncompany at nearly twice the national rate in 2023.4 And while the overall new\nentrepreneurship rate edged lower after a pandemic-era jump, the rate for Latino\nentrepreneurs continued to rise to a new record high in 2023. This growth matters to the\nU.S. economy. Entrepreneurs improve the way of doing business and generate new jobs\nand wealth. They often create new processes, products, markets, and services that solve\nproblems and improve the quality of life for many. Entrepreneurs also bring fresh\nperspectives and contribute to economic progress. For example, a recent survey by the\nStanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative shows that Latino-owned businesses\noutperform others in the adoption of artificial intelligence.5\nLatinos in the Economy\nBeyond starting businesses and creating jobs, Latinos are a large and growing part\nof the economy—as consumers, workers, and investors. Collectively, Latino households\ngenerate trillions of dollars in economic activity each year in the U.S. There are 34\nmillion Latino workers in the U.S. labor force, and the median weekly earnings of\nLatinos working full time has doubled over the past 20 years, according to the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics. Those data points suggest that many Latino workers are moving into\n3 See Adriana D. Kugler (2025), “Entrepreneurship and Aggregate Productivity,” speech delivered at the\n2025 Miami Economic Forum, Economic Club of Miami, Miami, Florida, February 7,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm.\n4 See Robert W. Fairlie (2024), “Indicators of Entrepreneurial Activity: 2023,” working paper, January,\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4708111.\n5 See Gómez-Aguiñaga, Foster, and Porras, 2023 State of Latino Entrepreneurship, in note 2.\n\n- 4 -\nhigher-wage, higher-productivity jobs. Overall, nearly one in every five Americans are\nof Latino heritage. In some states, such as Texas, that figure is closer to two in five. And\ngiven that the Latino population is growing, it is not surprising that Texas also led the\ncountry in job creation last year, adding 284,000 jobs to payrolls.6 Across the U.S., the\nLatino labor force has grown 14 percent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, much\nfaster than the about 4 percent growth for the total labor force.\nLatinos tend to work or seek employment at high rates. The Latino labor force\nparticipation rate was 66.9 percent in February versus 62.4 percent for the population\noverall. In addition to filling jobs for employers and meeting consumer demand for\ngoods and services, this labor force growth was a helpful counter to inflation at a time\nwhen the labor market was historically tight.\nThe growth in the Latino workforce contributed to the rebalancing of the U.S.\nlabor market in recent years. The labor market has cooled from an overheated state to a\nstable position characterized by low unemployment and diminished wage pressures.\nLatino workers especially aided that rebalancing by taking positions that had been\ndifficult for employers to fill. For example, early in the pandemic many Americans\nremodeled or expanded their homes, where they were suddenly spending much more\ntime. And anyone in this room that undertook such a project in 2021 or 2022 likely\nremembers how difficult it was to hire carpenters, plumbers, and other workers. Many\nskilled Latino workers filled that void. As of February, Latinos accounted for 35 percent\nof all construction workers, up from about 30 percent five years ago. Similarly, Latino\nworkers have outsized representation in several other fields in which hiring has been\n6 See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2025), “State Employment and Unemployment Summary,” news release,\nMarch 17, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nchallenging in recent years. Over one-third of warehouse and storage workers and one-\nfourth of couriers—both important to the e-commerce industry—are Latino. Latinos also\nrepresent a large share of critical childcare, automotive repair, and building maintenance\npositions—the people that make it possible for everyone to get to work and do their jobs\nwell.\nMoving forward, the young Latino population will continue to contribute to the\nlabor force, as 1 million Latinos every year will turn 18 over the next two decades. And\nthe educational attainment growth of Latinos is three times faster than that of other\ngroups. Already one-fourth of the nation’s K–12 students are Latino—thus on track to\nsoon contribute to the skilled labor force.\nEconomic Outlook\nOf course, I am always studying how the economy is playing out for Americans\nof all backgrounds. As such, I would like to share with you my economic outlook before\nI conclude.\nThe U.S. economy has been on solid footing in recent years. Consistent with that\nassessment, real gross domestic product grew 2.5 percent last year. The most recent data\non economic activity in the early part of this year have shown some signs of softness:\nRetail sales plunged more than 1 percent in January. However, that slowing was not\nentirely unexpected after the strong showing in December, some bad weather earlier this\nyear, and the difficulties in the seasonal adjustment of the data. Moreover, growth in\nretail sales moved back up into positive territory, increasing 0.2 percent in February.\nThe labor market appears to be stable through February. U.S. employers added\n151,000 jobs in February and 125,000 in January. The pace of hiring during the first two\n\n- 6 -\nmonths of the year is a slowdown compared with the strong gains in November and\nDecember, but, again, that could reflect weather disruptions and seasonal adjustment\nchallenges. Over the past six months, employers added a solid average of 190,000 jobs a\nmonth. The unemployment rate—4.1 percent last month—is low and has remained near\nits current level since last summer.\nTurning to inflation, I have been keenly aware that price increases have been\npainful for American families, and I have supported policies intended to bring inflation\nsustainably back to our 2 percent target. This effort has paid dividends. Inflation has\ncome down a long way from its peak of more than 7 percent in June 2022. Based on the\nconsumer price index and producer price index data for February, it is estimated that the\n12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was 2.5\npercent last month. That is welcome progress, but that progress has slowed since last\nsummer. In certain subcategories there is evidence that inflation reaccelerated in recent\nmonths. Importantly, while goods inflation was negative in 2024—as was the norm\nbefore the pandemic—it has turned positive in recent months. This development is\nunhelpful because goods inflation has often kept a lid on total inflation and also affects\ninflation expectations. In addition to the increase in prices already captured in official\ndata, surveys show that consumers are expecting further increases in the near term. For\ninstance, both short-run and long-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey\nhave climbed in recent months. According to comments from survey respondents, much\nof this uncertainty appears to be tied to trade policy. I am paying close attention to the\nacceleration of price increases and higher inflation expectations, especially given the\nrecent bout of inflation in the past few years. Given the economy’s overall solid position\n\n- 7 -\nand the heightened level of uncertainty, I supported the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) decision last week to maintain the policy rate at its current level. I\nsee current policy as continuing to be restrictive and I judge that FOMC policy is well\npositioned. The committee can react to new developments by holding at the current rate\nfor some time as we closely monitor incoming data and the cumulative effects of new\npolicies. I remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal while\nmaintaining a solid labor market. As always, I will carefully assess the incoming data,\nthe evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering the appropriate policy\nrate.\nThank you again for having me here.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAlbert Hirschman Lecture\n2024 Annual Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association and the\nLatin American and Caribbean Chapter of the Econometric Society\nMontevideo, Uruguay\nNovember 14, 2024\n\nThank you for your generous introduction, Marcela, and thank you for the\nopportunity to be here and speak to you today.1 I believe I am the first central banker\nfrom the U.S. to address this annual meeting, but I know, and am proud to say, that I am\nthe first who is also Latin American. And, of course, I have been part of the LACEA\nExecutive Committee and I have presented papers at many LACEA conferences over the\nyears, so it is a pleasure to be back here among many colleagues.\nWhen the United States suffered very high inflation beginning in 2021, it was a\nnew and unfamiliar experience for many too young to recall the last time this occurred in\nthe 1970s and 1980s. Of course, very high inflation is not such a distant memory for\npeople from Latin America and the Caribbean, and that includes me. Growing up in\nColombia, I vividly recall the daily challenges of trying to plan and live with sustained\ndouble-digit inflation, and I especially remember the pain it imposed on disadvantaged\npeople.\nGaining control over inflation requires a commitment by society to accept the\ntradeoffs and sacrifices often needed, and it also requires deliberate and principled\ndecision making by central banks.2 Central bankers must both formulate their best\njudgment of the correct policies that will achieve a desired level of inflation and follow\nthrough by executing and maintaining those policies. It has been widely recognized—\nand is a finding of economic research—that central bank independence is fundamental to\nachieving good policy and good economic outcomes. It is not sufficient by itself to\nachieve those goals, but, over time, it is almost always necessary.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See the box “Monetary Policy Independence, Transparency, and Accountability” in Board of Governors\n(2024, pp. 42–44).\n\n- 2 -\nLet me start by defining terms. An independent central bank is one that can carry\nout monetary policy insulated from pressures arising from other parts of government or\nelsewhere. When there is central bank independence, the role of national or jurisdictional\ngovernments is typically one of representing the public in specifying a mandate for the\ncentral bank and holding the central bank accountable by monitoring its performance and\nappointing central bank leadership. In this arrangement, the public, through\nrepresentative government, specifies the overall objectives that central banks should\npursue.\nSome noteworthy examples of central bank mandates include the dual mandate\nestablished by the U.S. Congress that requires the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nThe European Central Bank’s primary mandate of price stability is spelled out in a treaty\nenacted by the legislatures of its constituent member states. The central bank of Brazil\npursues price stability as its primary objective as well. In the United Kingdom, its\nparliament has mandated that the Bank of England pursue monetary and financial\nstability.3 Similarly, the objectives of the central banks of Chile and Uruguay are both to\nkeep inflation low and stable and to foster the stability and efficiency of the financial\nsystem.\nBefore we discuss why monetary policy independence can benefit the economy,\nlet me take a step back and discuss the tradeoffs associated with the conduct of monetary\npolicy. Central banks significantly influence prices, interest rates, employment, and\nincome in the economy, so it is natural that sometimes there would be differing views on\n3 The European Central Bank, the central bank of Brazil, and the Bank of England have as additional\nobjectives, without the prejudice of their monetary stability mandates, to contribute to economic growth.\n\n- 3 -\ntheir decisions. For instance, monetary policy actions that promote economic activity and\nemployment growth can put upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, policies to lower\ninflation tend to slow economic activity and employment growth. This tradeoff typically\nmeans that returning inflation to a specific target level when inflation has been allowed to\nrun high may require more restrictive policy and a reduction in demand and higher\nunemployment. As I pointed out in a speech last spring at Stanford University, however,\nwe have seen this tradeoff dissipate over the past couple of years, pointing to the\npossibility that we have been now for some time on the steep part of the Phillips curve,\nwhere inflation can come down substantially without a big increase in unemployment.\nYet there is a possibility that this tradeoff may become more prominent as we move\ntoward the flatter part of the Phillips curve.\nThe economic literature points out that striking a balance in these tradeoffs can be\ndifficult for an elected or otherwise representative government for various reasons. One\nreason highlighted in the literature is that an elected government may be naturally\nfocused on the short-term goals of its constituents and may have an incentive to try to\nlower the unemployment rate in the short run, with less concern about the longer-term\neffects on inflation and growth. The literature has labeled this fundamental problem\n“time inconsistency.”4 This incentive may generate undesirable economic cycles,\npotentially destabilizing prices. And if the public learns over time that the central bank is\nresponsive to these incentives to increase inflation to boost employment temporarily,\nexpectations of future inflation would rise, a symptom of a loss of credibility of the\nmonetary policy authority. Governments also may have an incentive to increase inflation\n4 Research on “time inconsistency” was pioneered by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Calvo (1978). This\nproblem was analyzed in more detail in the context of monetary policy by Barro and Gordon (1983).\n\n- 4 -\nto monetize their debts, which become effectively smaller as the purchasing power of\nmoney declines. Also, if elected officials are responsible for monetary policy decisions,\nthe typical alternation in control of government between different parties may lead to\ndifferent preferences in the tradeoff between employment and inflation, destabilizing\nprices and the economy in the long term.5 In summary, economic research argues that\ndemands on government to address concerns in the short term may result in excessively\ndiscretionary monetary policy and do not provide the best incentives for effective\nmonetary policy that promotes the long-term health of the economy.\nA solution devised by governments and explored in economic research is to\ndelegate monetary policy to an independent entity: the central bank.6 By establishing\npolicy mandates in laws or treaties, the government voluntarily constrains itself from\nsuddenly altering policy, and thus it also discourages public pressure to do so. As in\nHomer’s Odyssey, in which Odysseus asks his crew to tie him to the mast of his ship to\navoid being bewitched by the Sirens’ songs, policy mandates help central banks avoid\nbeing swayed by short-term desires to the detriment of longer-term goals.\nNow that we have discussed the reasons for delegating the authority to conduct\nmonetary policy to an independent entity, we are left with the task of describing how\nsuch independence should be designed and implemented in practice. There are two broad\ncategories of central bank independence. The first of these is goal independence—to\nwhat extent is the central bank free to define its goals? The research literature makes a\n5 Alesina and Stella (2010) and Kiley and Mishkin (2024) provide summaries of the literature on rules\nversus discretion.\n6 Rogoff (1985) suggested the appointment of a central banker predisposed toward keeping inflation low\nand stable as a solution to the time-inconsistency problem; additional discussions are presented in Persson\nand Tabellini (1993) and Walsh (2003, chap. 8).\n\n- 5 -\ndistinction between instrument independence—the prerogative to make monetary policy\ndecisions, which I will discuss more later—and goal independence.7 In particular, the\nFederal Reserve’s goals are defined by law, so it is not goal independent. Nevertheless,\nin spelling out those goals, the law provides the Federal Reserve with some degree of\nindependence in defining them in detail.\nFirst, let’s talk about the extent to which the law has defined the Federal\nReserve’s monetary policy goals. Unlike some other central banks that target inflation,\nthe FOMC has been handed two coequal goals—maximum employment and price\nstability. The Committee is not free to pursue one or the other—it must pursue both.\nAnd these two sides of the mandate are pretty clear. Maximum employment means, in\neffect, the lowest unemployment rate that is consistent with stable prices. The law does\nnot spell out a level of inflation that fulfills the goal of stable prices, but it has\ntraditionally been viewed as a low and stable inflation rate.\nMandates limit goal independence, but the form of those mandates can allow\nsome role for the central bank in setting out its goals. The 1977 law defined the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate, allowing the FOMC to work out the details. In 2012, the FOMC\ndefined price stability as a longer-run annual inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by\nthe Commerce Department’s estimate of the rate of increase in the personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) deflator. Because maximum employment is unobserved and likely\nchanges over time, it can be estimated only with considerable uncertainty; thus, the\nCommittee chose not to define it in numerical terms. But Committee participants\n7 See Debelle and Fischer (1994) and Fischer (1994).\n\n- 6 -\nestimate a related number, the longer-run rate of unemployment, which is published\nevery three months in the Summary of Economic Projections.\nAnother aspect of independence is instrument independence, which affords\ncentral banks flexibility in how to use the tools of monetary policy, such as policy interest\nrates, to achieve their goals. In the case of the FOMC, instrument independence has\nallowed it to adopt new ways to achieve its goals, as the financial system has evolved\nover the decades. This has been particularly important when the economy faced\nunprecedented challenges, as it did during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and during\nthe 2020 pandemic. Because of this flexibility, the Federal Reserve Board and the\nFOMC were able to respond promptly and, as it turned out, very effectively.\nAcross countries and jurisdictions, goal independence and instrument\nindependence have different dimensions and many variations. In some countries,\nincluding India, Brazil, and South Korea, the targets for inflation rates are jointly decided\nby the central bank and the ministry of finance. In contrast, the central banks of Chile,\nColombia, Mexico, and Peru, among others, are given authority to choose their own\ninflation objectives.\nTo understand how governments have come to embrace the independence of\ncentral banks, it is helpful to review how they have evolved from their origins in the 17th\ncentury. Sweden’s Riksbank was established by the private sector in 1688 to lend the\ngovernment funds, and the Bank of England followed in 1694, with a similar structure\nand purpose.8 Other European central banks followed in the 19th century and a wave of\nmany more in the 20th, including the Federal Reserve. At different times, these central\n8 See Bordo (2007).\n\n- 7 -\nbanks made the transition from wholly private to wholly public institutions and became\naccountable to government, and by the mid-20th century, there was a growing\nrecognition that independence made for a more practical and, ultimately, more effective\ncentral bank. In the United States, the moment of truth came in 1951. During World\nWar II, the Federal Reserve had agreed to peg interest rates on Treasury securities in\norder to ensure smooth funding of the war effort, and after the war, it continued to peg\nthe longer-term Treasury rate. In the early 1950s, inflation soared, but Treasury favored\ncontinuing a cap on longer-term interest rates so that debt management costs could\ncontinue to be low during the Korean War. After a series of high-level meetings, the\nFederal Reserve and the Treasury reached an agreement in 1951 that freed the Fed from\nthe obligation to fix interest rates and allowed it to use monetary policy independently to\npursue national economic goals.\nResearchers have analyzed the historical experiences of particular central banks,\nsuch as the Federal Reserve, to understand the transition toward central bank\nindependence and how it affects economic performance.9 In addition, researchers have\nalso developed large cross-country indexes measuring the level of central bank\nindependence while capturing multifaceted aspects of this independence based on banks’\nlegal statutes over long periods.10 The empirical regularity that stands out in many\ndifferent studies analyzing these indexes is the rise in central bank independence starting\nin the 1980s, with studies analyzing at least 120 countries.11\n9 For a review of the historical experience of the United States in particular, see Binder S, Spindel M.\n(2017).\n10 One early index is due to Cukierman, Webb, and Neyapti (1992). It captures some aspects of various\ninstitutional arrangements, such as the presence of a mandate on price stability or additional mandates.\n11 See Dincer, Eichengreen, and Martinez (2024). See also Romelli (2024).\n\n- 8 -\nEconomic research has cited several factors driving this adoption of central bank\nindependence. In the 1980s and 1990s, emerging economies saw central bank\nindependence as a way to facilitate access to global trade and financial markets, which\nwere liberalized during that time.12 Another important factor was the experience of\ndeveloping country debt crises during this period, which led to demands by creditor\nbanks and international lenders for central bank independence.13\nTo whatever extent these other factors pushed governments toward central bank\nindependence, a consensus developed that such an arrangement yielded better economic\noutcomes. Based on measures of central bank independence, researchers indeed have\nfound a relationship between independence and lower inflation, especially for advanced\neconomies.14 While evidence of a negative relationship between independence and\ninflation has been a bit more elusive in the case of emerging market and developing\neconomies (EMDEs), the economic literature does find a relationship between\nindependence and lower inflation volatility in these countries.15 Among the reasons I\nwould cite for why it is more difficult to find a relationship between independence and\nlower inflation in EMDEs is that legal measures of central bank independence, also called\n“de jure independence,” may not reflect the relationship between the central bank and the\ngovernment that exists in practice—referred to as “de facto independence.” In countries\nwhere the rule of law is not as strongly embedded in their institutions, there can be wide\ngaps between the formal, legal institutional arrangements and their practical effect.16\n12 See Maxfield (1997).\n13 See Cukierman (2008).\n14 See Crowe and Meade (2008).\n15 See Garriga and Rodriguez (2020).\n16 Cukierman and others (2002) provide some evidence on the relationship between inflation and central\nbank independence across different countries.\n\n- 9 -\nIndeed, alternative measures of independence, such as turnover of central bank\ngovernors, point to de facto measures being negatively associated with inflation,\nespecially in emerging economies.17 Another possible reason is that emerging economies\nmay be more exposed to volatile shocks and governmental regime changes, leading to\ngreater turnover in central bank leadership and clouding the relationship between central\nbank independence and inflation.18\nThe relationship between central bank independence and lower inflation and\ninflation volatility is therefore clear. But the connection to faster growth in economic\nactivity is not. On the one hand, the primary reason for central bank independence in\nmost countries with a single mandate is to provide price stability, so the lack of\nassociation between monetary policy independence and adverse economic consequences\nis not surprising.19 On the other hand, indexes of central bank independence may be\nbiased. Most indexes of central bank independence tend to penalize the presence of\nadditional mandates or responsibilities beyond price stability.20 However, a mandate that\nexcludes full employment does not seem optimal, given that a central banker should\nfocus on the consequences of its actions on long-term growth and economic activity.\nResearch has emphasized complementarities between price stability, economic stability,\nand financial stability, providing a rationale for these overlapping objectives at many\ncentral banks.21 Also, in practice, although the recent inflation run-up showcased the\n17 See, for instance, Jácome and Vázquez (2008) and Vuletin and Zhu (2011).\n18 See Jácome and Vázquez (2008).\n19 For instance, Alesina and Summers (1993) find no increase in business cycle volatility in developed\ncountries.\n20 Take, for instance, the very recently updated index by Romelli (2024): The joint presence of price\nstability together with economic growth or full employment or responsibilities in bank supervision, as is the\ncase for the Federal Reserve, depresses the score.\n21 See Kiley and Mishkin (2024).\n\n- 10 -\ncommitment of most central banks to fight inflation, it also appears that they have been\nwilling to provide some accommodation after having gained greater confidence that\ninflationary pressures have dissipated. In fact, most central banks have initiated an\neasing cycle even with inflation still somewhat above their respective targets and\nregardless of the presence or not of an employment goal in their mandates.\nSo if central bank independence does improve inflation outcomes, one question is\nhow it accomplishes this. Let me return to an issue I mentioned earlier: credibility. If\nthe central bank is credible about its longer-run inflation target, it would be a natural\noutcome that long-run inflation expectations will tend to be closer to the target than when\nthat credibility is lacking. And a central bank will be more credible if it takes actions that\nlead the public to be confident that the central bank is actively pursuing its stated goal.\nIt is possible to formalize the channel through which a central bank chooses a\nlong-run inflation target and the public slowly learns about its commitment to achieving\nit, thus gradually anchoring long-run expectations.22 The public observes inflation and\neconomic activity outcomes as well as the central bank actions (say, changes in the\nfederal funds rate), and it updates its long-run inflation expectations, which, in this\nmodel, coincide with its perception of the long-run target. For instance, a nominal\ninterest rate that is higher than expected, given observed inflation and economic activity\nand the public’s long-run inflation expectations, leads to an updated—lower—value of\nthe perceived inflation target.\n22 Kiley (2008) develops a model in which the public does not observe the central bank inflation target and\nit has to infer the target from observations on macro variables and interest rates. Long-run inflation\nexpectations in Kiley’s model are the optimal estimates of the unobserved long-run target. The estimates in\nKiley (2008) suggest that the updating of long-run inflation expectations is affected by monetary policy, in\ncontrast to alternative frameworks, such as adaptive expectations.\n\n- 11 -\nIf the central bank’s policy actions are consistent with its long-run inflation goal,\nthe public’s long-run expectations will gradually settle at the central bank’s long-run\ngoal: This dynamic will anchor inflation expectations to the long-run target. The stock\nof credibility of a central bank will be reflected in long-run inflation expectations moving\nin a relatively narrow range close to the stated inflation goal. Conversely, inconsistent\nactions will imply that agents will update their long-run expectations higher or lower,\ndepending on the direction of surprises in central bank actions, causing de-anchoring of\nexpectations. Despite a very large inflation shock starting in 2021, available measures of\nlong-run inflation expectations, such as those in the Survey of Professional Forecasters or\nthe Livingston Survey, increased just a bit compared with the inflation run-up and\nquickly descended in 2023. That can be taken as a sign of anchoring and sufficient\ncentral bank credibility through the lens of the model just described. And, to the extent\nthat long-run inflation expectations matter to the dynamics of actual inflation, such as in\nsome Phillips curve models, anchoring of inflation expectations is one of the key\nelements leading to stable inflation.23\nThe model also offers an interpretation of and a contrast to the behavior of\ninflation and inflation expectations during the Great Inflation of the 1970s and in the\npost-pandemic period. As inflation rose in the 1970s and monetary policy actions failed\nto rein it in, the Federal Reserve lost credibility, and longer-term expectations of future\ninflation rose toward the end of the decade. The Federal Reserve struggled for years to\nrebuild that credibility, resulting in high and volatile inflation. Conversely, in the recent\nepisode, inflation has traveled a long way from its peak, with no deterioration in\n23 See Yellen (2015).\n\n- 12 -\neconomic activity and comparatively limited movement in long-run inflation\nexpectations.\nCredibility is enhanced by transparency and accountability, and I will conclude\nwith a discussion of how these principles are carried out by the Federal Reserve. The\nFederal Reserve seeks to explain as clearly as possible what it is trying to do in carrying\nout its dual-mandate objectives and how it is trying to do it. Such transparency and\naccountability are necessary under our democratic system but are perhaps especially\nimportant for the Federal Reserve, which has been assigned such an important role in\npromoting a healthy economy. In addition to conferring legitimacy for decisions,\ntransparency makes monetary policy more effective, as the public better understands our\nmonetary policy reaction function, which informs the public on how our decisions are\nshaped by economic conditions. Monetary policy works in part by trying to influence the\npublic’s view of future economic conditions, so it is crucial that these intentions are\nclearly communicated. The Federal Reserve promotes transparency by issuing a\npostmeeting statement explaining its decision and then following up with more detailed\nminutes three weeks later. Every three months, FOMC participants’ projections for\ninflation, unemployment, economic activity, and the likely path of monetary policy are\npublished in the Summary of Economic Projections. The Chair conducts press\nconferences after each FOMC meeting, and both the Chair and FOMC participants\nfurther explain their reasoning on policy in speeches, news interviews, and other public\nappearances. The Chair testifies to Congress on monetary policy twice a year,\nresponding to questions from lawmakers. Transcripts of FOMC meetings are published\nafter five years. More recently, the Fed has adopted the practice of periodically\n\n- 13 -\nreviewing its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices, including\nholding public Fed Listens sessions around the country to get public input.\nTransparency is likewise seen in other economies as fundamental to monetary\npolicy independence, which has increasingly been recognized for delivering better policy\ndecisions that are more focused on the longer-term health of an economy. Research\ncontinues to add to our understanding of the extent of these better outcomes in different\neconomies and also how independence works in different institutional arrangements. The\ngoal, of course, is more stable economies that deliver broadly rising living standards—in\nLatin America, the Caribbean, and around the world.\nLet me now turn to the current economic outlook in the United States and how\nour monetary policy independence has permitted us to get where we are now. The United\nStates has seen considerable disinflation while experiencing a cooling but still resilient\nlabor market. Numbers just released this week show headline and core PCE inflation\nhave fallen substantially from 7.1 percent to an estimated 2.3 percent and from 5.6\npercent to an estimated 2.8 percent, respectively. While wage moderation and anchored\ninflation expectations may allow us to continue making progress on inflation, stubborn\nhousing inflation and high inflation in certain goods and services categories may stall\nprogress in reaching our target. At the same time, labor markets have rebalanced, given\ngreater labor supply from immigration and prime-age workers and lower demand from\nrestrictive monetary policy. Thus, although the labor market experienced an extended\nperiod of low unemployment and job creation these past several years and strong real\nwage growth, the labor market has cooled. This combination of a continued but slowing\ntrend in disinflation and cooling labor markets means that we need to continue paying\n\n- 14 -\nattention to both sides of our mandate. If any risks arise that stall progress or reaccelerate\ninflation, it would be appropriate to pause our policy rate cuts. But if the labor market\nslows down suddenly, it would be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce the policy\nrate.\nThank you again for inviting me to address you today. I would be glad to spend\nsome time on further discussion of my presentation and to respond to your other\nquestions.\nReferences\nAlesina, Alberto, and Andrea Stella (2010). “The Politics of Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M.\nFriedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3.\nAmsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 1001–54.\nAlesina, Alberto, and Lawrence H.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nJune 18, 2024\nSome Reasons for Optimism about Inflation\nRemarks by\nAdriana D. Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 18, 2024\n\nThank you for your introduction, Adam, and thank you for the invitation to speak\nhere today. It is great to come to Peterson to discuss the economic outlook and monetary\npolicy, which is my topic this afternoon.1\nAs I stand here today, inflation remains too high, but I am encouraged by the\noverall progress and trajectory. Recent data on the economy and inflation also give me\ncautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway toward the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) inflation goal of 2 percent. That progress\nmay have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on\neconomic activity, the labor market, and inflation points to renewed progress.\nOver the last year through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\ninflation was 2.7 percent, down from 7.1 percent at its peak in 2022. Core PCE\ninflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories—was 2.8 percent\nthrough April, down from its peak of 5.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price\ninflation for May released last week, I estimate that 12-month PCE inflation in May was\na bit lower than in April. I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports,\nparticularly the continued improvement in market-based services inflation, which is\nbased on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values. That’s\nimportant because market-based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall\ntrend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.\nHousing services inflation, meanwhile, continues to be persistent. Market rents\nfor new tenant leases have already cooled significantly, but further progress in overall\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nhousing services inflation will rely on the ongoing pass-through of the previous market\nrents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases.\nSo inflation is still too high, and further progress is likely to be gradual.\nHowever, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and\ncooling demand will support continued disinflation.\nThe first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with\ndeclining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price\nsensitive. I think of this from several, related angles—I will mention a few.\nAs I have discussed in previous speeches, reduced frequency of price adjustments\nhelps moderate prices. And the frequency with which firms adjust prices, which\naccelerated to less than every five months in early 2022, moved closer to every seven\nmonths as of the end of 2023.2 Price adjustment frequency picked up some early this\nyear, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been\nconsistent with ongoing disinflation.\nAn additional basis for price-setting optimism is the fact that longer-run inflation\nexpectations have remained well anchored. Research by the Richmond Fed has found\nthat price-setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path\nof overall inflation, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in\nprice setting consistent with those lower price expectations.3\n2 These facts are from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), “Price-Setting during the Covid Era,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3298. I thank the authors for providing me with updated data through\nearly 2024.\n3 For research on firms’ price-setting and inflation expectations, see Felipe F. Schwartzman and Sonya\nRavindranath Waddell (2024), “Inflation Expectations and Price Setting among Fifth District Firms,”\nEconomic Brief 24-03 (Richmond, Va.: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, January),\nhttps://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-\n\n- 3 -\nIn addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to\ncontinue falling. While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple\nestimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still\nremain above their pre-pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector.4 A return of\nmarkups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation.\nA final factor for optimism about positive price-setting developments is the range\nof anecdotes from firms themselves. The most recent edition of the Fed’s Beige Book\nsuggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional\nprice increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the\nnear term. Beyond the Beige Book, I have gleaned from recent earnings reports by\npublicly traded companies that lower-income consumers are pulling back from their\npurchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or, in some cases,\nactually cutting prices. What I have heard in my own conversations with business\ncontacts is that consumers are “trading down” to lower-cost products and that firms are\nresponding with more discounting. And some large retailers have publicly spoken about\ncutting prices in the face of resistant consumers. These various indicators—markups,\nprice adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of\n03#:~:text=Evidence%20from%20a%20Federal%20Reserve,most%20firms%20set%20their%20prices.\nWith regard to overall measures of inflation expectations, anchored longer-run inflation expectations are\napparent in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, where 5-to-10-year-ahead expectations\nremain close to values seen a decade ago; in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, where 10-year inflation\nexpectations are close to pre-pandemic norms; and in other sources.\n4 For example, the ratio of the producer price index (PPI) for final demand goods to the employment cost\nindex for private goods industries rose roughly 20 percent from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2022. In\nservices, this ratio rose roughly 5 percent. The ratios for both sectors have come down from their peak\nlevels but were still above their end-2020 levels as of the first quarter of this year—and they had been on\ndownward trends before the pandemic. Similar analysis using PCE prices instead of PPI yields a\nqualitatively similar result for goods industries, though, in services, the PCE price-to-wage ratio has been\nroughly flat.\n\n- 4 -\nsources—suggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move\ncloser to consistency with the FOMC’s inflation target.\nA second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in\nthe costs faced by businesses. Among those, nominal wages are a big part of total costs\nin the services sector. Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent\nwith a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance. Of course,\nas a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for\nthat wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with our inflation target.\nNotably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre-\npandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been\nincreasing. But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs.\nFor example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings has been running just\nabove 4 percent over the past couple of months after peaking at around 6 percent in 2022\nand falling more or less steadily since then. The latest readings compare with an average\nof around 3 percent a year before the pandemic, when inflation was running below our\n2 percent goal. Wage moderation is especially evident in some service sectors for which\nlabor is a large share of costs. If this moderation in wage growth continues, it will soon\nbe at levels consistent with price stability. And I note that the market-based services\ninflation measure I mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth.\nOther developments in labor markets also point toward continued resilience, but\nthere are signs of gradual cooling and continued wage moderation. Gains in payrolls\naveraged 218,000 over the past two months, which is a solid pace. But most other\n\n- 5 -\nindicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market, supported by cooling\ndemand for hiring as well as strong supply.\nIn terms of demand, both the job openings rate and the hiring rate have come\ndown from their highs of late 2021 and early 2022. The job opening rate is not far above\nits pre-pandemic range, and the hiring rate is below pre-pandemic. Surveys of business\nhiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers. On the supply side, we\nhave seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year. Labor force participation\namong prime-age women, in particular, reached another all-time record in May. And the\nstrong inflows of immigrants I have discussed in previous speeches have continued this\nyear, which points to continued labor supply growth as recent immigrants gradually make\ntheir way into the labor market.\nWith cooling demand and solid supply, measures of labor market tightness have\ncontinued to ease. The unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached\n4 percent in May, still very low in historical terms and the 30th straight month at\n4 percent or lower. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the ratio of job vacancies\nto the number of people counted as looking for work, crossed an important threshold in\nApril. After rising as high as 2 vacancies for each person seeking a job during the\npandemic, that ratio fell to 1.2, which was the level before the pandemic. Another\nindicator of labor market tightness, the rate of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, is\nactually below the pre-pandemic level. The average duration for job vacancies is down,\nand it is becoming easier for employers to fill jobs. We policymakers like to make our\njudgments based on a preponderance of the data, and a preponderance of the labor market\ndata indicates that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance.\n\n- 6 -\nA third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am\nalso cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply\nexpansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic\ngrowth. One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which\nstarted early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month.5\nEconomic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive, a\nsmall subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly, eventually making\nsignificant contributions to aggregate productivity.6 And the pandemic-era business\ncreation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech sectors, such as computer systems\ndesign and research and development services.7 Some recent history favors a payoff to\nproductivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship. Before the jump in productivity\ngrowth in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, there was a similar wave of strong\nbusiness entries in high-tech industries.8 I suspect that most of the productivity benefits\nof the recent entry surge are still ahead of us.\n5 See Ryan Decker and John Haltiwanger (2023), “Surging Business Formation in the Pandemic:\nCauses and Consequences?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, BPEA Conference Draft, September\n28–29, pp. 1–87, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4_Decker-\nHaltiwanger_unembargoed.pdf?mod=djemRTE_h. Data from the Census Bureau’s Business Formation\nStatistics suggest business creation has remained above pre-pandemic norms through May 2024.\n6 See Titan Alon, David Berger, Robert Dent, and Benjamin Pugsley (2018), “Older and Slower: The\nStartup Deficit’s Lasting Effects on Aggregate Productivity Growth,” Journal of Monetary Economics,\nvol. 93 (January), pp. 1102–47; and Ryan Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda\n(2014), “The Role of Entrepreneurship in US Job Creation and Economic Dynamism,” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, vol. 28 (Summer), pp. 3–24.\n7 See Ryan Decker and John Haltiwanger (2024), “High Tech Business Entry in the Pandemic Era,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 19),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3499.\n8 See Lucia Foster, Cheryl Grim, John C. Haltiwanger, and Zoltan Wolf (2021), “Innovation, Productivity\nDispersion, and Productivity Growth” in Carol Corrado, Jonathan Haskel, Javier Miranda, and Daniel\nSichel, eds., Measuring and Accounting for Innovation in the Twenty-First Century, vol. 78: Studies in\nIncome and Wealth (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 103–136.\n\n- 7 -\nAnother basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread\nimplementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms. To be sure, there is\ntremendous uncertainty around the future path of AI and its effects on the economy, and\nwe must all think carefully about how it may affect workers and the kinds of tasks they\nperform. But AI technology has the potential to make workers and firms more\nproductive—effectively boosting aggregate supply. Of course, many technologies can\ntake a long time to show through to aggregate productivity. The spread of electrification\nmore than a century ago required complementary assets like power lines and appliances\nto be created and installed. But I suspect that AI may diffuse more quickly, in part\nbecause many of the complementary assets needed for the initial spread of AI—such as\ncomputers, networks, and the like—are already in place, even while there is still an\nenormous amount of additional hardware buildout still ahead of us. And survey data\nfrom the Census Bureau suggest that firms in many sectors are already employing AI.9\nOnly time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the\npossibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and\nemployment.\nMy fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current\nstance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring\ninflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a\nsignificant deterioration of the labor market. Interest rates remain elevated relative to a\nyear ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic\n9 Data are from the Census Bureau’s Business Trends and Outlook Survey. In data released May 23, 2024,\nthe share of firms reporting current AI usage was 18 percent in the information sector and 12 percent in the\nprofessional services sector. Several other sectors had shares at 5 percent or above.\n\n- 8 -\nactivity. Of course, some aspects of financial conditions, such as house prices and,\nespecially, stock prices, remain robust; and credit is still generally available, though high\ninterest rates make borrowing expensive. These factors likely have some distributional\nimplications: Higher-income people with large stock portfolios may not feel that\nconditions are so restrictive, while lower earners who need to borrow to buy a house or a\ncar do not need to be told that finances are tight.\nBut the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest rate–\nsensitive sectors. For example, the level of residential investment in the first quarter—\nthough showing some modest improvement relative to last year’s pace—was still roughly\n15 percent below its peak in 2021. Business investment in equipment contracted a bit in\n2023 and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year. And while\nconsumption growth has been resilient over the past couple of years, fueled in part by\nexcess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed\npre-pandemic levels, it slowed noticeably in the first quarter, especially for spending on\ngoods. Indeed, high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying\nconditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods, which often have to be\nfinanced.10\nThe effects of restrictive financial conditions are also evident in labor markets.\nAs I discussed earlier, the labor market has cooled gradually, and, looking ahead, I expect\nsome cooling of economic activity to continue. But I am watching closely for any signs\n10 In the Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the net shares of respondents reporting that now is a bad time to\nbuy, versus a good time to buy, motor vehicles or large household durables, specifically because of high\ninterest rates, remain well above pre-pandemic levels, though there has been some gradual improvement\nsince mid-2022.\n\n- 9 -\nof labor market deterioration that may take hold, as the FOMC also pays attention to the\nother side of our mandate.\nNotwithstanding my optimism about the economic outlook, I am mindful of a\nnumber of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. On the inflation side, the resurgence\nof import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning, even if import prices came\ndown some last month, and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the\ncoming months. Goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year\nor so, as supply chains have healed. While supply chains appear to have been fairly\nresilient to a series of shocks since the end of last year—including attacks on shipping in\nthe Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal—geopolitical developments in\nUkraine and the Middle East still could lead to a sharp rise in global energy and food\nprices and disrupt global supply chains. Another risk I am focused on is that a further\ncooling of the U.S. economy could lead to a sharp deterioration in labor market\nconditions. Output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year, and while\nconsumer spending still grew in the first quarter, the May retail sales report we received\nthis morning may be another signal that the long-expected deceleration in consumer\nspending may finally be upon us. After a considerable decline in job vacancies, firms\nfacing decreasing demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers. Lastly, I also\nsee risks to the global economy that could spill back to the U.S. economy. While growth\nin some countries—notably in Europe—appears to be picking up from a soft patch last\nyear, that pickup remains tentative. And the latest data from China suggest that economic\nmomentum there has slowed considerably amid a continuing real estate crisis.\n\n- 10 -\nLet me now turn to the implications of my economic outlook for monetary policy.\nWhile I remain cautiously optimistic that inflation is coming down, it is still too high, and\nit is moving down only slowly. I believe that policy has more work to do, which is why I\nsupported the FOMC’s decision last week to keep the federal funds rate in a range of\n5¼ to 5½ percent. We need to see more progress toward 2 percent inflation before I will\nhave confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward that objective. For the\nreasons I have outlined today, I believe economic conditions are moving in the right\ndirection. If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to\nbegin easing policy sometime later this year. But, as always, my judgment will be guided\nby the data.\nLet me conclude by acknowledging that the surge in inflation over the past few\nyears means that prices are now significantly higher than they were just a few years ago,\neven as the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since mid-2022. While I am\nheartened by data showing that nominal wages are now growing at a faster rate than\nprices, I know many Americans are still struggling with high costs. I also know that\nmany Americans are facing high borrowing costs. That’s why I will be watching the data\ncarefully in the months ahead to ensure that we are on track to achieve both sides of our\ndual mandate.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:20 p.m. EST (5:20 p.m. local time)\nMarch 7, 2025\nThe Rebalancing of Labor Markets across the World\nRemarks by\nAdriana D. Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nConference on Monetary Policy Transmission and the Labor Market\nBanco de Portugal\nLisbon, Portugal\nMarch 7, 2025\n\nThank you, Tiago, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I am\ndelighted to be at the Bank of Portugal, among friends, including Governor Centeno, and\nto be speaking at a conference focusing on matters I deeply care about—monetary policy\nand labor markets.1 Before I became a monetary policymaker, a large share of my work\nas an academic researcher addressed the effect on labor markets from policy choices such\nas payroll taxation, employment protections, occupational licensing, and unemployment\ninsurance (UI). I was able to apply some of these insights in my work as the chief\neconomist at the Department of Labor, analyzing the labor market and supporting\nresearch on policies and their effectiveness.\nAnd, of course, labor markets are central to carrying out the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.\nRecently, labor supply and demand in the United States have been roughly in balance,\nand the unemployment rate has been running close to the estimates of FOMC participants\nfor its longer-run rate, which is consistent with the Committee’s maximum-employment\ngoal.\nToday’s employment report for February corroborates this view. The net number\nof new jobs created was 151,000, not too far from the 177,000 average of the previous six\nmonths. The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, still in the narrow range between 4\npercent and 4.2 percent that it has remained in since last summer. Labor force\nparticipation was 62.4 percent—likewise within the range of values observed in the past\nyear. Consistent with this stability and evidence of balanced labor supply and demand,\naverage hourly earnings are up 4 percent in the past 12 months, and with strong\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nproductivity growth in recent quarters, I do not believe wages are a significant source of\ninflation pressure.\nOn the price side of the FOMC’s dual mandate, inflation has fallen significantly\nsince its peak in mid-2022, and we have lowered our policy rate accordingly, with a\nreduction of 100 basis points since last September. Still, inflation has moved sideways\nsince the second half of last year, with uneven progress across its major categories.\nInflation for market-based core services excluding housing has stepped down to an\nestimated 2.4 percent in January from a level of about 3.5 percent in the first quarter of\n2024. Housing inflation, which has stubbornly hovered above 5 percent for most of last\nyear, has finally come down to an estimated 4.5 percent in January. Adding to that,\nmeasures of new rents, such as those published by CoreLogic, suggest further progress in\nhousing inflation going forward.\nUnfortunately, one category of prices that has put upward pressure on inflation is\n“non-market-based” core services, which are imputed rather than observed. Although\nsome of the components in that category may be affected by difficulties in measurement,\nothers, such as prices for some financial services, are tied to the stock market and may\nhave been signaling wealth effects that helped push up aggregate demand. Core goods\ninflation has also been slowly rising. In the first half of 2024, core goods inflation was\nnegative 0.6 percent on average, close to its pre-COVID rate. But, starting in May, core\ngoods inflation has stepped up, and it was estimated to be about 0.3 percent in January.\nConsistent with an increase in goods prices, the releases of manufacturing and\nnonmanufacturing surveys this week, including those by the Institute for Supply\nManagement, showed a jump in prices paid for purchases inputs. This rise is not a\n\n- 3 -\nwelcome development because, over the long term, goods price deflation has offset price\nincreases in other categories and kept a lid on overall inflation.\nNotwithstanding the well-balanced labor market, there are important upside risks\nto inflation. Some measures of inflation expectations have risen significantly in the past\ncouple of months, including those from the Michigan survey, the Conference Board, and\nthe Atlanta Fed’s survey of businesses. For example, the measure of inflation\nexpectations 1 year in the future from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers\nrose from 3.3 percent in December to 4.3 percent in January, while the expectations in the\nnext 5 to 10 years rose over the same period—from 3.2 percent to 3.5 percent. There is\nalso considerable uncertainty about the inflationary effects of new policies and policy\nproposals. With all these factors in mind, I strongly supported the FOMC’s decision at\nour January meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-\n1/2 percent. Given the recent increase in inflation expectations and the key inflation\ncategories that have not shown progress toward our 2 percent target, it could be\nappropriate to continue holding the policy rate at its current level for some time. Going\nforward, I will continue to closely monitor the effects of policies on the economy, and I\nwill carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and any changes in the balance\nof risks.\nLet me now take a step back. To understand the recent experience of a resilient\nand balanced U.S. labor market, it is helpful to look outward and consider how labor\nmarkets behaved around the world after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its\nsignificant effects on employment. In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss\nsimilarities and differences in labor market recoveries in different countries, with a\n\n- 4 -\nspecial emphasis on the possible factors that helped the United States achieve a\nrebalancing of its labor market and rapid disinflation, and I will also address the potential\nfor changes in these trends moving forward.\nThe worldwide pandemic disrupted the global economy and immediately caused\nhigh levels of unemployment and other forms of slackness in labor markets. While the\ntiming and extent of job losses and recovery from the pandemic varied widely across\nadvanced and emerging economies, there were some commonalities. By the spring of\n2021, lower-skilled and younger workers had been hit harder than other groups, with\nlarger increases in unemployment rates and larger declines in labor force participation.2\nAcross different countries, there was also considerable variation in labor market policies\nenacted in response to the pandemic disruptions. For example, while the United States\npursued, among other initiatives, its usual approach of extended unemployment benefits\nto displaced workers, supplemented with unprecedented extra benefits to individuals,\nAustralia and several European countries used short-term subsidies to employers to keep\nworkers in their jobs. After accounting for these policy variations, which were, in some\ncases, rooted in longstanding differences in how different governments try to stabilize\nemployment, academic research has also found significant variation in the reasons why\npeople were not working during the acute phase of the pandemic.3 For instance,\nresearchers found that, in the United States, a greater share of the unemployed had lost\n2 See chapter 3, “Recessions and Recoveries in Labor Markets: Patterns, Policies, and Responses to the\nCOVID-19 Shock,” in International Monetary Fund (2021), World Economic Outlook: Managing\nDivergent Recoveries (Washington: IMF, April),\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/03/23/world-economic-outlook-april-2021.\n3 See Robert Breunig, Wei Cheng, Laura Montenovo, Kyoung Hoon Lee, Bruce A.

Net immigration fell in North America and Europe. In\nthe United States and the United Kingdom, people retired at greater rates than had been\nexperienced before the pandemic.4 In the U.S., many workers caring for elderly or ill\nrelatives or children out of school left their jobs and the labor force or curtailed the\nnumber of hours they worked.5 In one study that looked at the United States, Canada,\nand four European countries, the declines in employment and hours worked were\nparticularly large among women, with this gender gap being at least partially explained\nby childcare needs. 6 While this difference between men and women was significant in\nthe United States for both employment and hours, in other countries, such as Germany, it\nonly generated a gender gap in hours worked, probably because Germany’s policies were\naimed at keeping workers in their jobs and minimizing dislocation. Across the world, the\nnumber of younger workers neither in school nor in the labor force also rose, with larger\nincreases in North America relative to Western Europe—for example, the 3.5 percentage\n4 For evidence on the U.S., see Joshua Montes, Christopher Smith, and Juliana Dajon (2022), “‘The Great\nRetirement Boom’: The Pandemic-Era Surge in Retirements and Implications for Future Labor Force\nParticipation,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-081 (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, November), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2022.081.

With a\nsurprisingly rapid recovery in economic activity in most countries, labor demand surged,\nbut labor supply continued to be hampered by many lingering factors, including illness,\nvoluntary social distancing, early retirements, and still-low levels of net immigration.8\nAs economies reopened, the imbalance between supply and demand was amplified by\nconsumers, who had been prevented from spending on many in-person services, abruptly\nswitching their spending from goods to services.9 This substitution induced a large\nincrease in the demand for workers in the services sector, leading to acute labor shortages\nin some industries. The labor shortage throughout the economy was reflected in low\nemployment-to-population ratios and labor force participation rates (LFPRs) for many\nadvanced economies. Tighter labor markets lowered unemployment rates and boosted\n7 See International Labour Organization (2024), Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024: Decent Work,\nBrighter Futures (Geneva: ILO, August), https://doi.org/10.54394/ZUUI5430.

In the euro area, where the V/U ratio has\ntraditionally been lower, Federal Reserve staff estimate that it also reached a historical\nhigh of 0.45 in the second quarter of 2022, more than 50 percent higher than its 2019\nlevel.\nTo understand the cross-country differences in the rebalancing from tight to\nlooser labor markets, I want to highlight three important factors that contributed to the\ncross-country performance of labor markets over the past few years: first, the increases\nin LFPRs, especially for prime-age workers; second, increased labor productivity; and\nthird, an increase in net immigration and also the absorption of these immigrants into\nlabor markets.\nLet’s start with LFPRs. In the United States, after participation by prime-age\nworkers fell early in the pandemic, its recovery was quite strong until last year, and it\nreached levels not seen since the late 1990s. A notable contributor to this recovery was\nthe LFPR of prime-age women, which reached historical highs last year, likely due to\nadditional help in childcare responsibilities from other family members and flexible work\narrangements.11 While prime-age worker participation recovered, the LFPR for all\n10 See chapter 2, “Wage Dynamics Post–COVID-19 and Wage–Price Spiral Risks,” in International\nMonetary Fund (2022), World Economic Outlook: Countering the Cost-of-Living Crisis (Washington:\nIMF, October), https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2022/10/11/world-economic-outlook-\noctober-2022.\n11 See Camilo Garcia-Jimeno and Luojia Hu (2024), “Female Labor Force Participation in the Post-\nPandemic Era,” Chicago Fed Insights (Chicago: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, July),\nhttps://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-insights/2024/female-labor-force-participation.\n\n- 8 -\nworkers has remained stubbornly below its pre-pandemic level in the U.S. and other\nadvanced economies. In the case of the United States, unusually high rates of retirement\nduring the 2021–22 period played an important role, a phenomenon driven by, among\nother factors, increases in wealth fueled by gains in the stock market and rising home\nprices.12 Of course, another factor driving the drag in U.S. participation has been the\naging of the population and the expected ongoing retirement of baby boomers.\nBy contrast, the euro area saw the LFPRs surpass their pre-pandemic levels by\nearly 2022, as policies in these countries promoted job retention. Moreover, because far\nfewer Europeans continue working after the age of 65, the participation rate of older\nworkers did not fall as much during the pandemic.\nDifferences in labor market policies likely contributed to the different recovery\npaths of the LFPR across advanced economies. In the United States, estimates show that\nunemployed workers leave the labor force at a rate about 10 times higher than that of\nemployed workers.13 After leaving the labor force, a typical worker remains there for a\nsignificant period and may never again look for work. Thus, one might expect that labor\nmarket policies that have different effects on the severity of spikes in unemployment\nwould also affect labor force participation differently.14 As many European countries\nthat faced lower increases in unemployment also faced lower decreases in the LFPR, it\n12 See the box “Why Has the Labor Force Recovery Been So Slow?” in Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2023), Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of Governors, March), pp. 13–16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20230303_mprfullreport.pdf.\n13 See Bart Hobijn and Ayşegül Şahin (2021), “Maximum Employment and the Participation Cycle,”\nNBER Working Paper Series 29222 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research,\nSeptember), https://www.nber.org/papers/w29222.\n14 Cajner, Coglianese, and Montes document sluggish cyclical behavior of the LFPR relative to the\nunemployment rate for the U.S.; see Tomaz Cajner, John Coglianese, and Joshua Montes (2021), “The\nLong-Lived Cyclicality of the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2021-047 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2021.047.\n\n- 9 -\nseems that unemployment spells during the COVID-driven downturn might have\ncontributed to exits from the labor force. So, to the extent that the emphasis on job\nretention in Europe helped limit such exits, this policy choice may have helped explain\nthe higher rates of labor force participation in the euro area relative to the United States.\nThe second factor I want to highlight that boosted labor supply during the\neconomic recovery from the pandemic is productivity growth, which in a way acts like an\nincrease in labor supply, as it increases the output that each worker can produce. It seems\nlikely that U.S. labor market policies spurred the higher rates of productivity growth in\nthe United States relative to the euro area.\nOn the one hand, worker retention policies in Europe preserved the human capital\nof those specific firm–worker relationships. These relationships are quite valuable when\njob-finding rates are low, and workers may spend longer times being unemployed.15\nIndeed, euro-area businesses have been reluctant to let go of workers, and indicators of\nlabor hoarding are higher than their pre-pandemic levels. 16 One consequence of this\nhoarding is that hours per worker remain below pre-pandemic levels, pointing to a lower\noutput per worker.\nOn the other hand, in economies such as the United States that have relatively\nhigher job-finding rates, UI promotes the flow of workers to more-productive sectors of\nthe economy and results in less labor hoarding. Research by Federal Reserve staff shows\n15 For a comparison on the duration of unemployment spells between the U.S. and Europe, see Olivier\nBlanchard and Pedro Portugal (2001), “What Hides behind an Unemployment Rate: Comparing\nPortuguese and U.S. Labor Markets,” American Economic Review, vol. 91 (March), pp. 187–207,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1257/aer.91.1.187.\n16 For an analysis on labor hoarding in the euro area, see Vasco Botelho (2024), “Higher Profit Margins\nHave Helped Firms Hoard Labour,” ECB Economic Bulletin, no. 4, pp. 54–58,\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/ecbu/eb202404.en.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nmore sectoral reallocation of workers in the United States compared with the euro area.17\nAs I argued in a speech in October at the European Central Bank, this pattern is very\nlikely a major reason why productivity growth has been higher in the United States\nrelative to other advanced economies.18\nU.S. labor market policies that rely more heavily on UI may have contributed to\nhigher productivity growth in the United States, and to our recovery from the effects of\nthe pandemic, by better matching the skills of individuals with jobs that make the best use\nof those skills. Research finds that longer durations of UI allow workers to search for\nlonger and find better job matches, even within the same industry. That is the conclusion\nof research that I conducted with academic colleagues before I joined the Federal Reserve\nBoard, and it can also be applied to the pandemic period because of the extended UI that\nindividuals received during the period.19 These larger benefits may have improved the\nefficiency of the U.S. labor market by also freeing up jobs that UI recipients would have\ntaken but that would not have been as good a fit for them. These openings may have\nallowed other UI nonrecipients to also match up with better employers given their\nqualifications and may have improved labor market efficiency. Consistent with this idea,\nU.S. workers switched jobs at higher rates than in past recoveries, as reflected in higher\n17 See Joaquín García-Cabo, Anna Lipińska, and Gastón Navarro (2023), “Sectoral Shocks, Reallocation,\nand Labor Market Policies,” European Economic Review, vol. 156 (July), 104494,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2023.104494.\n18 See Adriana D.

It seems very likely that the emphasis on UI in the United States, relative to\nits European peers, in the recent downturn contributed to higher productivity rates\nthrough better job matching.\nThe third important factor boosting labor supply since the pandemic was\nincreased immigration in a number of countries. While immigration flows into some\nEuropean countries were comparable in proportion to those into the United States in 2022\nand 2023, new immigrants often integrate more quickly into the labor force in the U.S.,\nrelative to European countries, possibly because of the higher flexibility of U.S. labor\nmarkets.20 More broadly, because immigrants often have different backgrounds, cultures,\nand experiences, they bring a diverse set of skills to the labor market, which also leads to\nbetter matches between firms and workers, and, hence, a more efficient labor supply, a\ntheory supported by recent research.21 For these reasons, immigrants probably boosted\nthe U.S. labor supply compared with other countries.\nI have had a lot to say about labor supply across countries, but labor demand has\nalso been a factor in the rebalancing of labor markets. Central banks responded to the\nworldwide surge of inflation starting in 2021 with the most synchronized tightening of\nmonetary policy since 1970.22 Restrictive policy worked, and by 2022, labor demand\nbegan to soften, and vacancy rates decreased across advanced economies. We also saw\n20 See Courtney Brell, Christian Dustmann, and Ian Preston (2020), “The Labor Market Integration of\nRefugee Migrants in High-Income Countries,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 34 (Winter), pp. 94–\n121, https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.34.1.94.\n21 See Gianluca Orefice and Giovanni Peri (2024), “Immigration and Worker–Firm Matching,” Review of\nEconomics and Statistics, pp. 1–45, https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01476.\n22 See Kristin Forbes, Jongrim Ha, and M.

The better balance between\nlabor demand and supply has been seen in lower V/U ratios across many advanced\neconomies. As I mentioned before, in the United States, this ratio went from the all-time\nhigh of 2 in early 2022 to 1.1 in January 2025, which is currently below the average\nobserved in 2019, just before the pandemic. The rebalancing of the labor market is also\nevident in the moderation in wage growth since 2021, a big factor in the significant\nprogress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. However, because different\ncountries experienced different cumulative increases in their consumer prices in the\nrecent episode of high inflation, wage growth has been “catching up” with inflation at\ndifferent rates across countries, as workers aim to recover real income losses.\nI should mention some other differences in the structure of labor markets that\ncould explain differences in wage growth. A larger share of workers in Europe\nnegotiates wages through labor unions. The euro area experienced a larger energy shock\nafter Russia’s attack on Ukraine, which led to union-driven wage negotiations aiming to\nrecoup real income losses and more persistent wage growth in the euro area. Putting\nwelfare and humanitarian aspects aside, which are quite important, the fact that many\nimmigrants do not enter the labor force in the euro area when they first arrive because,\namong other reasons, they get support from government programs, also likely impedes\nthe downward pressure from immigration on wage growth. Moreover, those immigrants\nwho do enter the euro-area labor force may enter the pool of unionized workers and not\nbargain unilaterally for their wages, thus not putting downward pressure on wage growth.\nAdditionally, higher productivity will allow wage growth to settle at higher levels\nwithout adding inflationary pressures to our economies, and with productivity growth in\n\n- 13 -\nthe U.S. running at a faster pace than in Europe, U.S. wage growth may end up settling at\na higher level. Thus, I see the recent pace of U.S. wage growth as being consistent with\nour 2 percent inflation target once we account for catch-up effects and productivity\ngrowth.\nAs in some other parts of the world, I see the U.S. labor market as having\nsubstantially rebalanced, and conditions have stabilized at a level that I believe is close to\nthe FOMC’s goal of maximum employment. Still, I am closely monitoring any signs of\nchanges in the labor market so that we can keep it in the good place that it is now while\nbringing down inflation to our target.\nThank you.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2025 Federal Reserve Board Macro-Finance Workshop\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 29, 2025\n\nThank you, Olesya, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It is\nsuch a pleasure to contribute to this conference.\nOur profession has increasingly recognized, especially after the Global Financial\nCrisis, that research in the interdisciplinary topics between macroeconomics and finance\nis indispensable both for monetary policy and for promoting financial stability. As a\nresearcher myself, and having spent many years in academia, I place great value on the\nsocial contribution of research and its potential to improve policymaking.\nI want to express my appreciation for your efforts in using macro-financial data\nand theoretical models to enlighten us on several critical issues. For instance, let me cite\na few topics of the conference that shed light on important issues:\n• The work on the transmission of monetary policy to both households and firms\nprovides insights into how policy decisions ripple through the economy, a topic I\nrecently addressed in a speech at the University of Minnesota. In this speech, I\ndiscussed my approach to monitoring monetary policy transmission and\nhighlighted some of its key elements, such as the long and variable lags associated\nwith policy effects.\n• The exploration of the neutral rate of interest—that which neither slows nor\nstimulates economic activity—provides another angle to this important concept.\nThis is a topic I have addressed in previous remarks, and I am especially\ninterested in the potential factors that can affect the neutral rate.\n• The work on how and why financial conditions faced by firms and households\nchange with data releases and underlying macroeconomic conditions also\n\n- 2 -\nenhances our grasp of the complex interplay between economic indicators and\nreal-world financial experiences.\n• The research on the functioning of the Treasury securities market and how it is\naffected by regulatory constraints sheds light on a crucial aspect of our financial\nsystem.\nI commend you for pushing ahead with a research agenda that furthers our\nunderstanding of topics so relevant to our monetary policymaking.\nIn the spirit of stimulating your research appetite, I’d like to mention some topics\nthat have captured my attention recently. These represent emerging challenges and\nopportunities in the field, and I believe they warrant further investigation.\nFirst, recently, I have been paying attention to the possible interaction between the\nfinancial vulnerabilities of firms and their exposure to trade. As global economic\ntensions rise and supply chains evolve, understanding how a company’s financial health\nintersects with its international trade exposure becomes increasingly crucial. This\nresearch could provide valuable insights for both policymakers and business leaders\nnavigating an uncertain global economic landscape.\nSecond, lately, I have been monitoring the financial stability implications of the\npotential lower desirability of U.S. financial assets in flight-to-safety events.\nTraditionally, U.S. assets have been seen as a safe haven during times of global economic\nuncertainty. One notable example of this was during the Global Financial Crisis.\nHowever, we recently saw instances in which the VIX went up, stock prices went down,\nlong-term yields from U.S. Treasury securities went up, and the U.S. dollar depreciated\nagainst the currencies of advanced foreign economies (AFEs), with a notable role for the\n\n- 3 -\neuro. Importantly, the historical relationships and the observed moves in the VIX and\ninterest rates of AFEs would have been associated with a decrease in long-term yields\nfrom U.S. Treasury securities and an appreciation of the dollar. As the global economic\nlandscape shifts, it is crucial to examine how possible changes in the role of U.S.\nfinancial assets as a safe haven might affect financial stability both domestically and\ninternationally.\nLastly, I have been keenly interested, for some time now, in how stresses in the\ncommercial real estate (CRE) sector could potentially spill over to the rest of the U.S.\neconomy. The CRE sector continues to face challenges from low vacancy rates and\nvaluation losses, especially in urban centers for the office sector. Another challenge is\nthat some banks, insurers, and securitization vehicles continued to have concentrated\nexposures to CRE. As we have seen in past crises, such as the Global Financial Crisis,\nvulnerabilities in specific sectors can have far-reaching consequences for the financial\nsystem. Understanding potential vulnerabilities and potential domino effects are vital for\nmaintaining overall economic stability and crafting preemptive policies.\nThese, I believe, represent some of the most pressing questions facing our field\ntoday. They offer rich opportunities for groundbreaking research that could significantly\ninfluence future policy decisions.\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate my gratitude for the vital work you are all doing.\nYour research not only advances our understanding, but it also provides a solid\nfoundation for informed policymaking. As we navigate the complex interplay of\nmacroeconomics and finance in an ever-changing global landscape, the importance of\nyour work cannot be overstated.\n\n- 4 -\nI encourage you to continue pushing the boundaries of our knowledge, to ask the\ndifficult questions, and to pursue the answers with rigor and dedication. Your efforts\ntoday will shape the policies of tomorrow, influencing the economic well-being of\nmillions.\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to the insightful discussions and\npresentations that will unfold during this conference.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nHousing Partnership Network Symposium\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 17, 2025\n\nThank you, Robin. And thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on\nthe important topic of housing and how housing fits in with the broader economy.1\nFirst, I want to step back and say that housing—our homes—has a central role in\nour lives beyond what statistical reports capture. Housing matters greatly for our welfare\nbecause shelter is a basic human necessity. Our homes—be it city apartments,\nfarmhouses passed through generations, or suburban dwellings—are among the most\nsignificant places in our lives. In terms of household finances, housing is an important\nsource of wealth for many American families. Housing also supports access to good\njobs, because the jobs people can take depend on where they live and how far they need\nto commute.\nIn addition, the housing sector matters a great deal to the economy as a whole,\nand it is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted. That is why\nI study it closely as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). From\nthe perspective of the labor market, many workers have ties to housing-related sectors,\nincluding construction, real estate, and the mortgage finance industry. And because\nhousing is a large fraction of household wealth, the housing market influences consumer\nspending. From the price-stability perspective, shelter has a large weight in measures of\ninflation. Specifically, shelter is currently 16 percent of the expenditures in the basket\nused to calculate the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the\nFOMC’s preferred inflation measure.2\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Shelter has an even larger weight in the consumer price index—it is 35 percent for the index including all\nurban consumers.\n\n- 2 -\nToday I will discuss several aspects of housing affordability in the U.S., a topic\nthat I know is important to many of you, as it is to me. When studying affordability, it is\nimportant to distinguish between the cost of shelter, by which I mean the cost of\noccupying a home, and the costs of purchasing and owning a home. I will discuss each\nof these in turn, with the common theme being that both are elevated from a historical\nperspective. Next, I will discuss some supply and demand factors that explain how we\ngot to this point and offer some thoughts on how these influences might evolve. Finally,\nI will discuss my overall outlook of the U.S. economy and its implications for monetary\npolicy.\nCost of Shelter\nI will start with a discussion of the cost of shelter, which is not only needed for\nsurvival, but is also a large portion of household budgets. Because of this, increases in\nshelter prices leave less for families to spend otherwise. It is common to measure the\nprice of shelter with rents because rent reflects the price of occupying a home. Rents\nsurged early in the pandemic recovery, rising 8.3 percent over the 12 months ending in\nDecember 2022. This year, rent growth eased to 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending\nin May.3 The recent increase in multifamily construction has contributed to this\nmoderation. For lower-end properties, we have not seen as much of a cooling in rental\ninflation, in part because new construction has been aimed at the high end of the market.\n3 The figures cited are calculated from the rent of tenant-occupied housing component of the PCE price\nindex.\n\n- 3 -\nEven with the slowdown in rent growth, rents continue to rise faster than overall\ninflation, as was the case before the pandemic.4\nNevertheless, rents have not risen at a faster pace than household incomes. The\nconstant-quality cost of a rental unit relative to the median family income is currently no\nhigher than its average from 2014 to 2019. The share of renters spending more than 30\npercent of their income on rent was about the same in 2023 as it was in 2019, about 40\npercent in both years. Of course, this fraction is high, indicating that rental housing is a\nlarge expense for many families. This ratio is significantly higher for certain groups. In\n2023, 43 percent of Hispanic households spent more than 30 percent of their income on\nrent, while 47 percent of Black households spent that share. For households whose head\ndid not attend college, the figure is 46 percent.5\nCost of Homeownership\nWhile shelter is a necessity, homeownership is an opportunity because it is a\npathway for families to build wealth. It also provides a greater sense of stability because\nowner-occupants do not have to worry about a landlord deciding not to renew the lease.\nLike renting, the costs of purchasing and owning a house are elevated.\nThe cost of homeownership is related to several factors. One is the cost of\npurchasing a home. Like rent, house price growth has slowed from the fast pace seen a\nfew years ago, and this slowing has been more pronounced for higher-priced homes.\nZillow’s index for high-value homes increased 1 percent per year over the past three\n4 From 2015 to 2019, the rent component of the PCE price index rose 3.7 percent per year, more than\ndouble the rate of increase of the PCE price index excluding rent and owner-occupied shelter, 1.2 percent\nper year.\n5 Calculations are based on household-level data from the 2023 American Community Survey provided by\nIPUMS; see Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Matthew Sobek, Daniel Backman, Grace Cooper, Julia A.\nRivera Drew, Stephanie Richards, Renae Rodgers, Jonathan Schroeder, and Kari C.W. Williams (2025),\nIPUMS USA, version 16.0 [dataset] (Minneapolis, Minn.: IPUMS), https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V16.0.\n\n- 4 -\nyears, whereas it increased 3 percent per year for low-value homes.6 Despite this\nslowdown, the level of prices is quite high, even relative to income. The ratio of house\nprices to median family income is about 20 percent higher than its average from 2014 to\n2019.\nIn addition, the costs associated with owning a home are also elevated. Mortgage\nrates have ranged between 6 and 7.5 percent in the past several years. Property taxes\nhave risen along with home values. Homeowners insurance premiums have increased as\ninsurers seek to offset expenditures tied to recent natural disasters and the rising cost of\nreplacing structures. Federal Reserve Board staff research shows that, factoring in high\nhouse prices, mortgage rates, property taxes, and homeowners’ insurance, the costs of\nowning a home relative to median income in 2023 were at the highest level seen since\n1980.7\nGiven these costs, it is no surprise that some families cannot afford a home.\nBoard staff research shows that increases in mortgage rates reduce purchases by lower-\nincome borrowers, especially low-income first-time homebuyers.8 And, indeed, the\nhomeownership rate of heads of households younger than 45 decreased from 2022 to\n2024. This decline is a partial reversal of changes seen in the previous few years when a\ncombination of very low interest rates and fiscal support caused ownership rates to rise.\nYet, on net, the ownership rate for several groups remains above levels recorded before\n6 This reference reflects data through May. Zillow’s high-value index reflects value for homes within the\n65th to 95th percentile range for a given region, and the low-value index reflects value for homes within the\n5th to 35th percentile range for a given region.

In 2024, homeownership rates for household heads aged 35 to 44 were\n62 percent, 2 percentage points above their 2019 level. The ownership rates for Black\nhouseholds were 4 percentage points higher, and the rate for Hispanic households was\n1.5 percentage points higher.9\nDemand Factors\nThe relative affordability of housing is the outcome of the forces of supply and\ndemand. Let me first focus on the long-run trends on the demand side, where household\ngrowth—that is, the change in the number of households over time—plays an important\nrole. Household growth is a function of population growth and household size. In the 10\nyears before the pandemic, the U.S. population rose slightly less than 1 percent a year.\nImmediately following the pandemic, population grew at a faster rate, reflecting a higher\nvolume of immigration. That trend has since reversed. Academic research examining\nimmigration flows finds that rent growth increases in the short run after a wave of\nimmigration, but these rent increases may not persist if the housing supply expands over\ntime to meet the increase in housing demand.10 In fact, a study found that increases in\nimmigration do lead to more residential construction.11 In terms of the whole population,\nthe Census Bureau projects that population growth will ease over the next 10 years but\n9 The homeownership statistics are from the Housing Vacancy Survey; see U.S. Census Bureau (2025),\n“Housing Vacancies and Homeownership,” webpage, https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/index.html.\n10 See Albert Saiz (2003), “Room in the Kitchen for the Melting Pot: Immigration and Rental Prices,”\nReview of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (August), pp. 502–21; Albert Saiz (2007), “Immigration and\nHousing Rents in American Cities,” Journal of Urban Economics, vol. 61 (March), pp. 345–71; Abeba\nMussa, Uwaoma G. Nwaogu, and Susan Pozo (2017), “Immigration and Housing: A Spatial Econometric\nAnalysis,” Journal of Housing Economics, vol. 35 (March), pp. 13–25; Umut Unal, Bernd Hayo, and Isil\nErol (2024), “The Effect of Immigration on Housing Prices: Evidence from 382 German Districts,”\nJournal of Real Estate Finance and Economics (May), pp. 1–39; and Ibrahim Alhawarin, Ragui Assaad,\nand Ahmed Elsayed (2021), “Migration Shocks and Housing: Short-Run Impact of the Syrian Refugee\nCrisis in Jordan,” Journal of Housing Economics, vol. 53 (September), 101761.\n11 See Libertad Gonzalez and Francesc Ortega (2013), “Immigration and Housing Booms: Evidence from\nSpain,” Journal of Regional Science, vol. 53 (February), pp. 37–59.\n\n- 6 -\nremain positive, based on mortality rates, birth rates, and the age distribution of the\npopulation.12 Thus, population growth should put less upward pressure on demand for\nhousing going forward.\nLet me turn to some cyclical forces on the housing demand side, with some\nfactors pushing demand in opposite directions. A strong labor market for several years\nhas fueled demand for both renting and owning housing, while the recent increase in\nmortgage rates and other costs of ownership have damped demand for owning.\nSupply Factors\nTurning to housing supply, it is no surprise to those in this room that it has been\nincreasing at too slow of a rate relative to demand. Research shows that growth of the\nhousing stock has declined steadily since the 1960s and 1970s. Specifically, it estimates\nthat if the housing stock had expanded at the same rate from 2000 to 2020 as it did from\n1980 to 2000, there would be 15 million more housing units in the U.S.13\nResearch finds that local regulations are an important factor constraining the\nhousing supply, leading to higher house prices.14 In response, some state and local\ngovernments have begun to enact policy changes aimed at relaxing these supply\nrestrictions. For example, in 2020 Minneapolis enacted a large-scale zoning reform that\n12 The Census Bureau makes a range of population growth projections under various assumptions about\nimmigration. This statement refers to its projections under its baseline immigration assumption and its\nlow-immigration assumption. Under its high-immigration assumption, population growth would be about\nin line with that seen over the past decade.\n13 See Edward L. Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko (2025), “America’s Housing Supply Problem: The Closing\nof the Suburban Frontier?” NBER Working Paper Series 33876 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, May), https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w33876/w33876.pdf.\n14 For summaries on the literature, see Joseph Gyourko and Raven Molloy (2015), “Regulation and\nHousing Supply,” in Gilles Duranton, J. Vernon Henderson, and William C. Strange, eds., Handbook of\nRegional and Urban Economics, vol. 5 (Amsterdam: North-Holland), pp. 1289–1337; and Nathaniel\nBaum-Snow and Gilles Duranton (2025), “Housing Supply and Housing Affordability,” NBER Working\nPaper Series 33694 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April),\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w33694.\n\n- 7 -\neliminated parking requirements for new development, encouraged apartment\ndevelopment in commercial corridors, and permitted duplex and triplex construction on\nall residential lots. These zoning reforms may have boosted construction in Minneapolis.\nOther states and cities have also implemented policies intended to increase the number of\nhousing units, but it is still too early to tell whether these changes will meaningfully\naffect house prices or rents.\nMaterial and labor costs for home construction have increased about 25 percent in\nreal terms since the mid-2000s.15 Recent policy changes at the national level could\nfurther increase those costs. Anecdotal reports, including those in the Beige Book,\nsuggest that changes in immigration policy are starting to restrict the supply of\nconstruction workers. Research has found that past declines in immigration have reduced\nresidential construction while increasing housing prices.16 In terms of tariff policy\nchanges, to date there has been some effect on homebuilder costs. The National\nAssociation of Home Builders estimates tariff policy, including tariffs on steel and\naluminum, has increased the cost of new construction by about 3 percent of the average\nprice of a new home, and additional tariffs, such as the one proposed on imported lumber,\ncould raise construction costs further.\nAnother aspect of housing supply is the number of homes for sale. Elevated\ninterest rates have made it much less appealing for existing owners who have a mortgage\nwith a low fixed rate to sell and purchase a different house, because doing so would\nrequire them to take out a new mortgage at a much higher rate. Therefore, the supply of\n15 See Glaeser and Gyourko, “America’s Housing Supply Problem,” in note 13.\n16 See Troup Howard, Mengqi Wang, and Dayin Zhang (2024), “Cracking Down, Pricing Up: Housing\nSupply in the Wake of Mass Deportation,” working paper, October.\n\n- 8 -\nexisting homes for sale in the past few years has been much lower than normal. Board\nstaff research shows that this “rate lock-in” effect has boosted house prices in markets\nthat were already tight in 2019, because the decrease in homes for sale was proportionally\nlarger than the decrease in the number of potential buyers.17\nConsidering all these factors in concert, the housing market has gone through\nsome pronounced swings over the past four years. Looking through these ups and downs,\ngrowth in demand for shelter has continued to outpace supply, putting upward pressure\non rents across a wide range of locations and types of families. Although rent growth has\nnot been faster than income growth, rental expenditures are still a large fraction of\nincome for many households. House prices have risen, too, and combined with elevated\nmortgage rates and increases in other ownership costs, the costs of owning a home are\nhigh relative to Americans’ incomes.\nLooking forward, growth in housing demand may soften over the second half of\nthis decade because of a slowdown in population growth. But even with this softening, it\nis not clear that growth in the housing supply will be large enough to meet demand.\nProspects for house prices and rents over the next few years also depend materially on the\neconomic outlook, to which I will turn now.\nEconomic Outlook\nI will start by saying that while my discussion so far has focused on the housing\nmarket, I look at economic conditions across the entire economy and in every region of\nthe country when making monetary policy decisions. Thus, I pursue the monetary policy\n17 See Aditya Aladangady, Jacob Krimmel, and Tess Scharlemann (2024), “Locked In: Mobility, Market\nTightness, and House Prices,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2024-088 (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, November; rev. May 2025),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/locked-in-rate-hikes-housing-markets-and-mobility.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nthat I believe will achieve our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price\nstability for all Americans.\nOverall, I see the labor market as stable and resilient, and economic activity\nmoderating some. In contrast, I see upward pressure on inflation from trade policies, and\nI expect additional price increases later in the year. While I am monitoring policy\ndevelopments in many areas, I continue to see trade developments as the key drivers of\nthe U.S. economic outlook.\nStarting with price stability, based on data received this week, it is estimated that\nthe headline PCE price index rose 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in June, a somewhat\nstronger gain than the 2.3 percent recorded in May. Core inflation, which excludes\nvolatile food and energy costs and is a good guide for future inflation, came in at about\n2.8 percent in June, also higher than in May. Both headline and core inflation have\nshown no progress in the last six months. While core services inflation decreased relative\nto the end of last year, core goods inflation has pushed up inflation recently.\nI see firmer core goods inflation as already partially reflecting the pass-through of\nincreased tariffs, which has been shown by research done at the Fed.18 In addition, CPI\nand PPI reports released in the past two days show that increases in core goods prices\nwere more broad-based in the month of June. While many forecasters may have been\nexpecting a sooner and sharper increase in overall inflation, there are many reasons to\nthink that larger effects of tariffs are still coming. First, businesses built up inventories\nahead of anticipated tariff increases, giving them leeway to still sell goods at pre-tariffed\n18 See Robbie Minton and Mariano Somale (2025), “Detecting Tariff Effects on Consumer Prices in Real\nTime,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 9),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/detecting-tariff-effects-on-consumer-prices-in-\nreal-time-20250509.html.\n\n- 10 -\nprices. Second, given the many changes in implemented tariff policies, businesses may\nnot yet be passing the higher tariffs to their selling prices because they are waiting for\ngreater clarity. Third, businesses, especially larger ones, may also be waiting to capture\nmarket share from others that hike prices sooner. Fourth, the current environment of still-\nelevated short-run inflation expectations makes it easier for workers to seek higher wages\nand business to charge higher prices, which could increase the persistence of price hikes\ngoing forward. Fifth, tariff rates could increase further, as seen in newly proposed\nreciprocal tariffs for several countries and the new tariffs on copper introduced last week,\nputting further upward pressure on prices.\nOther unforeseen shocks, such as geopolitical ones, may further push inflation\nupward soon. Board staff research shows that increased geopolitical risk is associated\nwith high inflation in the U.S., with effects peaking about two years after the geopolitical\nshock.19 Renewed tensions in the Middle East, together with the possibility of an\nextension and escalation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are important geopolitical\nrisks to monitor.\nTurning to the employment side of our mandate, I see a labor market that has been\nstable and resilient. The June employment report showed that employers added a robust\n147,000 jobs, boosted by jobs in the state and local government sector. Private payroll\nemployment increased by 74,000, showing some moderation relative to previous months.\nAdditionally, the unemployment rate has stayed in a narrow and historically low range\nfor more than a year. Layoff measures have remained subdued, and the ratio of job\n19 See Dario Caldara, Sarah Conlisk, Matteo Iacoviello, and Maddie Penn (2024), “Do Geopolitical Risks\nRaise or Lower Inflation?” working paper, April.\n\n- 11 -\nvacancies to unemployed workers has largely been stable at a level that suggests demand\nand supply for labor are roughly balanced.\nConclusion\nConsidering the near-term outlook that I just outlined, I see that the U.S. economy\nhas remained resilient, with labor markets appearing to be stable and close to full\nemployment. Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the FOMC’s 2 percent goal and is\nfacing upward pressure from implemented tariffs. Moreover, I judge that inflation is\nlikely to increase further as tariff effects build up during the rest of the year.\nGiven the stability in the employment side of our mandate, with the\nunemployment rate still at historically low levels, elevated short-run inflation\nexpectations, and goods inflation rising due to the upward pressure from tariffs, I find it\nappropriate to hold our policy rate at the current level for some time. This still-restrictive\npolicy stance is important to keep longer-run inflation expectations anchored. Moving\nforward, I will make policy decisions based on incoming economic data, the evolving\noutlook, and my assessment of risks to both sides of our dual mandate.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n21st Annual Economic Measurement Seminar,\nNational Association for Business Economics Foundation\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nThank you for your generous introduction, Ellen. I am delighted to be here with\nthe National Association for Business Economics (NABE), and, in particular, I am\npleased to be speaking at a conference covering an issue that is close to my heart and on\nwhich I have spent many years working: economic measurement.\nWhen Federal Reserve officials tell audiences that their judgments are data\ndependent, some skeptics perhaps presume that monetary policy is already on a path set\nin stone. But most in this room likely know what I mean when I talk about data\ndependence. I am a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which, of\ncourse, pursues a dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.1 When I say\nI am data dependent, that means I am considering the totality of the data—the full range\nof economic indicators that provide a sense of where the labor market, economic activity,\nfinancial conditions, and inflation have been and where they might be going.\nPolicymakers must have high-quality and accurate data to understand the economy and\nset the correct policy.\nThe truth is that it is not just the Fed that needs data. Consumers, businesses,\ninvestors, and others have access to more information than ever before when making\ndecisions. It is incumbent on economists, private- and public-sector data collectors, and\nothers to ensure that available data are carefully collected, accurately measured, and\nclearly presented, and that data collection and measurement efforts are further enhanced\nand continue to improve.\nTo be sure, data collection and economic measurement can be challenging, and\ndifferent types of data face pros and cons, which is why I take an expansive approach to\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors and the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nusing data, as I will explain a bit later. But I will begin by highlighting a few challenges\nto economic measurement. I will then provide some examples of how those challenges\nmight be addressed. I will also provide examples of how nontraditional data generated\nby the private sector can help provide additional angles from which to view aspects of the\neconomy that may not be clear in data produced by government statistical agencies.\nFinally, I will offer some examples of how, in recent years, our statistical agencies have\nadapted and innovated, sometimes by incorporating private-sector data to address specific\nmeasurement challenges I have in mind. To be clear, my interest in nontraditional data is\nnot a critique of the statistical agencies. To the contrary, official data are critically\nimportant to policymakers, researchers, and the public. Rather, I view public and private\ndata as being complementary and helping to provide a more complete picture of the\neconomy.\nImportance of Data\nEconomic measurement, the task some of you contribute to every day, is at the\ncore of real-time policy analysis and forecasting. We at the Board of Governors rely on a\nbroad array of data produced by both government and the private sector. And we\ncarefully scrutinize every important economic release and are very familiar with the\nmethodological details of those reports. Suffice it to say, we care a lot about economic\nmeasurement at the Fed.\nAnd the Fed itself produces many important data series, including two principal\nfederal economic indicators: the Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization report\n\n- 3 -\nand the Consumer Credit statistical releases.2 In addition, our website features numerous\nother data products that look at bank assets, liabilities, and structure; monetary\naggregates; international finance; business finance; and household finance—including\ndata on the level, share, and composition of wealth for households at different points in\nthe wealth and income distribution, as well as for different demographic groups.3 The\nBoard also conducts separate surveys of consumers and household economic decision\nmaking and surveys of loan officers and credit officers, well known as the SLOOS and\nthe SCOOS. Beyond the Federal Reserve Board, each of the Federal Reserve Banks\nengages in measurement and data production of various kinds, including closely watched\nsurveys of firms and households. For example, the New York Fed conducts a survey of\nconsumer expectations, which was just released last week, the Atlanta Fed tracks wage\ndata, the Richmond Fed surveys firms on price-setting behavior, among other things, and\nseveral Reserve Banks publish alternative measures of inflation and reports on factory\nand business activity in their regions.\nChallenges with Measurement\nOf course, as one reviews various sources of data, one can see that there are some\ncommon measurement challenges. I will mention a few. These are not new, nor is my\nlist exhaustive. My intent here is to focus on challenges that highlight the tradeoffs in\nusing public and private data and to show how these sources of data complement each\nother.\n2 See Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and\nRegulatory Affairs, and Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States (n.d.), “Schedule of Release\nDates for Principal Federal Economic Indicators for 2024” (Washington: OMB),\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pfei_schedule_release_dates_2024.pdf.\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024), “Data,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nThe first challenge I will identify is that traditional measurement approaches\nsometimes struggle to track rapidly changing economic developments. This was the case\nearly in the pandemic and is often true at turning points in the business cycle. Of course,\nit is at those very moments when policymakers, and the public, are most critically\ninterested in how the economy is faring. The reasons for this lag are well known.\nStatistical agencies can only survey households and businesses every so often, and it\ntakes time to compile and publish high-quality statistics. However, financial markets and\nbusiness decisions move quickly. Reports produced on a monthly or quarterly basis,\noften with a multi-week lag, may not be available with sufficient frequency to inform\nreal-time decisions. Also, some indicators, by design, take on new market information\nslowly. A recent and relevant example is housing services inflation, as measured as part\nof the consumer price index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditures price\nindex. Both rely heavily on slowly changing leasing agreements that only adjust to\nmarket conditions over many months. Business entries and exits, sometimes called births\nand deaths, are similar in that they take time to appear in surveys that underlie important\nstatistical products. I will touch on that a bit more later.\nA second challenge is that many statistical reports were created decades ago and\nmay not be focused on newer or growing sectors of the economy. For example, there are\nmonthly reports on factory orders, shipments, inventories, and output among the principal\neconomic indicators. Because developments in the goods sector can matter importantly\nfor economic fluctuations, that level of detail is indeed helpful to have. But we would\nbenefit from the same depth of information on domestically produced services, too.\nWhile service-sector output constitutes a larger share of U.S. gross domestic product\n\n- 5 -\n(GDP), the category has only one single dedicated quarterly report, even though much of\nthe post-pandemic recovery requires us to understand how services consumption and\nemployment have evolved. For example, did you know that quarterly hog and pig counts\nare a principal economic indicator? Yet, there is not a regular government report\nspecifically dedicated to the gig economy. I am certainly glad we collect data for\nimportant agricultural commodities, but I think we should probably be examining the\nlarge and diverse gig economy as much as we do the pig economy. I believe the\nstatistical agencies grapple with these issues, and it takes time to lay the groundwork and\ndevelop new data series, but this challenge is a real one. If reports are built for the past,\nthat may mean they struggle to capture big developments today and in the future, such as\nthe changing nature of where and how people work or the rising use of artificial\nintelligence (AI) technology.\nFinally, there is an impediment that everyone here is acutely aware of: These\nchallenges are made even more difficult because official surveys have seen declining\nsurvey response rates. That results in lower precision of statistical estimates and can lead\nto the need for further, costly surveys to collect the necessary amount of information, as\none may need to conduct several rounds of data collection before having sufficiently\nlarge samples that can provide reliable estimates. Declining response rates may also be\nselective and pose a challenge to representing the broader population. Innovative\nmethods for data collection and behavioral interventions to encourage survey responses\ncan be used to address concerns and are being tried in some cases by statistical agencies.\n\n- 6 -\nA Data Explosion\nWhile these challenges in traditional data that I have described may take some\ntime to be addressed, I am encouraged by the explosion in data produced by the private\nsector over the past decade or so that can greatly enhance our understanding of the\neconomy. Such data give an opportunity to measure economic developments with\ngreater timeliness, at a higher frequency, and with more granularity. That said, those data\noften face their own challenges, including issues with representativeness, the lack of\nmethodological consistency, and a short time-series history. Nevertheless, such\nnontraditional data can be helpful, especially when used jointly with official statistics to\nwhich these new sources can be benchmarked.\nA prominent example of valuable private-sector data is employment statistics\nfrom payroll providers. Such weekly data allowed economists at the Federal Reserve\nBoard to understand, essentially in real time, employment losses when the pandemic first\ntook hold in the United States in March 2020. In comparison, it took until early May to\nget similar information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) employment report.4\nIndeed, in trying to understand the rapidly changing economy during the pandemic, Fed\neconomists closely followed a variety of privately produced higher-frequency data.\nThese included reports on restaurant reservations, hotel occupancy, and airport\n4 Both the private-sector data-based measure and the official payroll survey are eventually benchmarked to\nofficial data from the BLS. See Tomaz Cajner, Leland D. Crane, Ryan A. Decker, Adrian Hamins-\nPuertolas, and Christopher Kurz (2023), “Payroll Employment at the Weekly Frequency,” AEA Papers and\nProceedings, vol. 113 (May), pp. 145–50; and Tomaz Cajner, Leland D.

Economists even used anonymized phone-tracking data to estimate business\nshutdown rates and trends in retail spending.5\nCredit and debit card transaction data are another example of a helpful, private-\nsector tool that economists use to understand consumer behavior in various sectors or\nregions in close to real time. These figures provided what proved to be a pretty reliable\npicture of economic developments during the pandemic, well before traditional\nstatistics—such as quarterly GDP and monthly retail sales—became available.6 The need\nfor timely, high-frequency information is not limited to pandemics and turns in the\nnational business cycle. For example, Federal Reserve Board economists have used\ncredit and debit card transaction data to estimate the effects of local natural disasters\nalmost in real time when official statistics are often not available.7\nWhen we look at economic turning points, it is also important to consider reports\non expectations and anticipated outcomes from nongovernment sources. Those include\nsurveys of expectations of future inflation, anticipated hiring or layoffs, and consumer\nand business sentiment on the economy or the path of the economy. I pay close attention\nto these surveys because they are forward looking and help inform where behaviors by\nbusinesses and households may be trending.\n5 See Leland D. Crane, Ryan A.

One important source of\nsuch data is the Institute for Supply Management’s surveys of purchasing managers.\nWhile those series are well established and closely followed, Fed economists found them\nparticularly helpful in recent years to observe supplier delivery times, order backlogs,\nitems in short supply, and measures of inventory satisfaction. Other private-sector data\ngive economists insight into supply chains as well, including measures of air, sea and\noverland freight costs; the number of waiting container ships; and the volume of railroad\ntraffic. These data series offered additional details on the level of constraint in supply\nchains following the pandemic shock, alongside reports from official statistical agencies.\nI will offer two additional examples of how I use nontraditional data at the Fed—\none from each side of our dual mandate. To better understand the labor market, I have\nbeen watching job vacancy, quit, and layoff data closely for many years. The official\ngovernment source for this information is the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey\n(JOLTS). While extremely important, JOLTS data are released with a lag of more than a\nmonth. And this survey has seen a particularly large decline in response rates.8 This\ninstance turned out to be another example of where private data could enhance my\nunderstanding. Job search sites’ data on postings are updated more frequently than the\nfederal report and generally confirm that JOLTS measurement appears to be accurate.\nSimilarly, JOLTS data on layoffs are lagged. That is why I also look at other figures,\nincluding unemployment insurance claims; Worker Adjustment and Retraining\nNotification, or WARN, notices; employment reductions from the Institute for Supply\n8 See Bureau of Labor Statistics (2024), “Household and Establishment Survey Response Rates,” webpage,\nhttps://www.bls.gov/osmr/response-rates/home.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nManagement; anticipated layoffs from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and\nChristmas; and mentions of layoffs in earnings reports and the Beige Book.\nWith inflation, an important component to track recently has been housing\nservices costs, which is typically the single largest expense for U.S. households. Housing\nservices are a big reason why the overall inflation rate remains above our 2 percent target.\nThe official measures of housing services inflation are intended to capture overall growth\nof housing costs—that is, costs incurred by owners and renters—drawing from a survey\nof rental lease terms. But rental leases tend to change only gradually, so the official\nmeasures can significantly lag current market conditions. That is why policymakers can\nalso rely on current market rent data, showing what landlords charge new tenants,\ninformation that is available from multiple private-sector sources. Those data can\nprovide some early signal of where official housing inflation series are likely headed.\nHere I have mentioned just a handful of private-sector data examples. But each of\nthese helps address measurement challenges I mentioned earlier. From these data, we\ncan gain timeliness and higher frequency, with a better read on underlying economic\ndynamics like market pricing. And with often low survey response rates in official data,\nthese private-sector sources may provide another perspective on underlying economic\ndevelopments.\nOfficial Innovations\nWhile I see great value in considering data produced outside of statistical\nagencies, the private sector is not the only place where innovation in economic\nmeasurement is occurring. Statistical agencies have long made use of private-sector data,\n\n- 10 -\nso there is nothing “nontraditional” about using private-sector data to shed more light on\neconomic measurement; in fact, it is a long tradition. I can think of several examples.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) taps many private-sector sources in its\ncompilation of GDP statistics, covering topics ranging from oil and gas drilling to\ninsurance premiums.9 At the Board, the Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization\nreport features a long list of private data sources for the output of products ranging from\nsemiconductors to lumber.10 And our Consumer Credit statistics rely in part on data from\na large credit bureau and an association of credit unions.11 I could go on, but the broader\npoint is that our country’s statistical agencies do not ignore valuable sources of economic\nmeasurement that the private sector has to offer—far from it. They make significant use\nof private information in combination with official surveys and administrative data. And\nthey are actively advancing that practice further.\nEconomic developments in recent years have been met by a flurry of innovation\nand adaptation from statistical agencies, relying not only on private-sector sources but\nalso on novel uses or production of government data. One notable product that I have\nmentioned in past speeches is the Census Bureau’s Business Formation Statistics (BFS).\nFirst published in 2018, the BFS series was developed in collaboration with the Board’s\n9 National income and product accounts (NIPA) data sources are listed in detail in the NIPA handbook; see\nBureau of Economic Analysis (2023), Concepts and Methods of the U.S. National Income and Product\nAccounts (Washington: BEA, December), https://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/nipa-\nhandbook/pdf/all-chapters.pdf. Some private-sector data are retrieved by the BEA itself, while others are\nalready incorporated into statistical products the BEA obtains from other agencies. For example, the BEA\nuses Census Bureau data on construction value put in place to construct estimates of nonresidential\nstructures investment; the Census Bureau, in turn, uses private-sector data on construction starts to build the\nsampling frame for its construction survey.\n10 The data sources for Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization can be found at Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System (2024), “Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization - G.17,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/About.htm.\n11 The data sources for Consumer Credit can be found at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2022), “Consumer Credit - G.19,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/about.htm.\n\n- 11 -\nstaff and relies on new business applications for Employer Identification Numbers, or\nEINs.12 During the early months of the pandemic, weekly data from the BFS provided a\ntimely indicator of the initial decline in economic activity, and then later the figures\nlikewise documented the rebound.13\nAnother measurement invention was created during the early months of the\npandemic: the Census Bureau’s high-frequency “Pulse” surveys—one each for\nhouseholds and businesses. Those surveys leveraged existing Census Bureau resources\nto provide quick-turnaround information about the rapidly evolving health and economic\nsituations.14\nThe Household Pulse Survey was rapidly developed shortly after the pandemic\nstruck the U.S., with participation from a broad set of government agencies.15 The\nsurvey provides a range of economic information about Americans, including the\npandemic-induced jump in remote work. The survey has adapted over time as the health\nand economic situations have evolved, incorporating questions about vaccination, access\nto infant formula during a product shortage, inflation, and other issues. The Small\nBusiness Pulse Survey provided timely information about employment, revenue,\nfinancial conditions, and expectations for future growth, survival, and needs in the highly\n12 See Kimberly Bayard, Emin Dinlersoz, Timothy Dunne, John Haltiwanger, Javier Miranda, and John\nStevens (2018), “Early-Stage Business Formation: An Analysis of Applications for Employer\nIdentification Numbers,” NBER Working Paper Series 24364 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, March), https://www.nber.org/papers/w24364.\n13 See the box “Small Businesses during the COVID-19 Crisis” in Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (2020), Monetary Policy Report (Washington: Board of Governors, June), pp. 24–26,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20200612_mprfullreport.pdf.\n14 See Census Bureau (2022), “Small Business Pulse Survey: Tracking Changes during the Coronavirus\nPandemic,” webpage, February 11, https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/small-\nbusiness-pulse-survey.html.\n15 See documentation at Census Bureau (2024), “Household Pulse Survey Technical Documentation:\nMethodology,” webpage, https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/technical-\ndocumentation/methodology.html.\n\n- 12 -\nuncertain pandemic environment. Later iterations of the survey shed light on supply\nchains, as the United States grappled with input shortages and disrupted freight networks.\nThe Small Business Pulse Survey was discontinued, but it planted the seeds for the\ncurrent Business Trends and Outlook Survey, which provides a similar wealth of\ninformation about business conditions and is already the gold standard for understanding\ntrends such as business-level implementation of AI technologies.16\nThe national accountants at the BEA have also shown a flair for innovation. For\nexample, the bureau has introduced many “satellite accounts” and other special series\nover the years—some still in experimental form—with national account–style\ninformation about special topics, including health care, income distribution, global value\nchains, small business, the digital economy, and the space economy, among others.17\nThinking of special-topic national accounts is a way the statistical agencies can keep up\nwith an ever-evolving economy. In fact, the treatment of research and development\ninvestment in current GDP methodology originated as a satellite account.18\nAnother example comes from the BLS and, specifically, how the agency tracks\nmarket rents as part of its inflation data series, an issue I mentioned earlier. While the\nofficial statistics on housing services inflation do not break out new tenant market rents\n16 See Kathryn Bonney, Cory Breaux, Cathy Buffington, Emin Dinlersoz, Lucia S. Foster, Nathan\nGoldschlag, John C. Haltiwanger, Zachary Kroff, and Keith Savage (2024), “Tracking Firm Use of AI in\nReal Time: A Snapshot from the Business Trends and Outlook Survey,” NBER Working Paper Series\n32319 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April),\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w32319.\n17 Other topics with satellite accounts or similar products include arts and culture, outdoor recreation, travel\nand tourism, household production, marine economy, and coastal areas. Related special topics are covered\nby the integrated macroeconomic accounts and the integrated industry-level production account (KLEMS).\nFor descriptions, see Bureau of Economic Analysis (2024), “Special Topics,” webpage,\nhttps://www.bea.gov/data/special-topics.\n18 See Carol E. Moylan and Sumiye Okubo (2020), “The Evolving Treatment of R&D in the U.S. National\nEconomic Accounts” (Washington: Bureau of Economic Analysis, March),\nhttps://www.bea.gov/system/files/2020-04/the-evolving-treatment-of-rd-in-the-us-national-economic-\naccounts.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nfrom the rest of the index, BLS staff recently began exploiting the housing survey data\nthat underlie the CPI to construct a New Tenant Rent Index (NTRI).19 The NTRI looks\nat quarterly changes in the terms offered in new leases. Data users are still learning how\nto best combine the signal from the NTRI with other measures of market rents, but this\nresearch effort shows the agility of the statistical agencies in responding to current needs\nof understanding inflation dynamics.\nThese are but a few of the many innovations that have arisen from statistical\nagencies. Regarding the measurement challenges I mentioned earlier, the examples I just\nlisted have helped observers better track the economy during periods of rapid change or\nwhen there are shifts in the structure of the economy, such as increased remote work or\nthe rise of AI, changes to immigration patterns, and supply bottlenecks. A harder nut to\ncrack is declining response rates, but it may be that more integration of private-sector\ndata with official data provides an avenue for addressing this problem as well.20\nSeeing Where the Economy Stands\nI hope my discussion today highlights the tremendous innovation in economic\nmeasurement in recent years, supplied by both inventive private-sector data generation\nand nimble statistical agencies. It is incumbent on economists, researchers, and officials\nfrom statistical agencies around the world—many of you who are here today—to be open\n19 See Bureau of Labor Statistics (n.d.), “New Tenant Rent Index,” webpage, https://www.bls.gov/pir/new-\ntenant-rent.htm.\n20 For helpful discussions of traditional and nontraditional data and their potential relationship, see\nKatharine G. Abraham (2022), “Big Data and Official Statistics,” Review of Income and Wealth, vol. 68\n(December), pp. 835–61; and Katharine G. Abraham, Ron S. Jarmin, Brian C. Moyer, and Matthew D.\nShapiro (2022), “Introduction: Big Data for Twenty-First-Century Economic Statistics: The Future Is\nNow,” in Big Data for Twenty-First-Century Economic Statistics, National Bureau of Economic Research,\nStudies in Income and Wealth (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 1–22,\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c14265/c14265.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\nto new and diverse ways to measure the economy so that this healthy pace of innovation\ncan continue.\nI want to again stress two things. First, the United States has world-class\nstatistical agencies that have both a long history of rigorously constructing government\ndata sources and adapting and combining information from private-sector with official\nsources. And, second, private-sector data will continue to be useful for providing\ngranularity, timeliness, and frequency advantages that can complement official statistics,\nso long as data users are appropriately cautious. Despite the many challenges, the future\nof economic measurement is bright. The statistical agencies have already proven their\nability to innovate and adapt, even under tight resource constraints. And the wealth of\nprivate-sector data sources will only expand in the future. When I form my economic\noutlook and policy assessments, my approach is to watch a wide range of indicators, both\nofficial and unofficial, with a focus on the strengths and weaknesses of each.\nAll the data I carefully examine in my current role allow me to better understand\nwhere the economy stands. My colleagues on the FOMC and I make determinations on\nthe policy actions that will be most appropriate for achieving our dual mandate, and so I\nwould like to briefly share my views on how I see the economy evolving and how I see\nappropriate monetary policy.\nDespite a few bumps at the beginning of the year, inflation has continued to trend\ndown in all price categories. But inflation remains above our target. I do believe that\nsupply and demand are gradually coming into better balance. Supply-side bottlenecks\ncontinue to heal, and demand has moderated amid high interest rates and as households’\nexcess savings have depleted. The labor market likewise has seen substantial rebalancing\n\n- 15 -\nand nominal wage growth moderating as a result—even while keeping up with inflation.\nJob vacancies and the quits rate have come down from their historically high levels from\na couple years ago, and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is now back at its pre-\npandemic level. On the labor supply side, the increased entry of prime-age workers and\nimmigration have both helped to expand the labor force and compensate for excess\nretirements we saw during the pandemic. This continued rebalancing suggests that\ninflation will continue to move down toward our 2 percent target. As I have discussed in\nrecent remarks, if economic conditions continue to evolve in this favorable manner with\nmore rapid disinflation, as evidenced in the inflation data of the past three months, and\nemployment softening but remaining resilient as seen in the past few jobs reports, I\nanticipate that it will be appropriate to begin easing monetary policy later this year. But\nmy approach to this policy decision will continue to be data dependent and to rely on\nmultiple and diverse sources of data to form my view of how the economy is evolving,\nespecially as upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment have become\nmuch more balanced. If the labor market cools too much and unemployment continues to\nincrease and is driven by layoffs, I would see it as appropriate to cut rates sooner rather\nthan later. Alternatively, if incoming data do not provide confidence that inflation is\nmoving sustainably toward 2 percent, it may be appropriate to hold rates steady for a little\nlonger.\nAs I conclude, I want to thank those of you in this room who do the hard work\neach day to create and analyze the economic data that allow not only policymakers like\nme, but also consumers and businesses, to gain a better understanding of ongoing\n\n- 16 -\ndevelopments in the U.S. economy. And let me thank NABE again for having me. It\nwas a pleasure to speak with you today.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nReykjavík Economic Conference 2025\nThe Central Bank of Iceland\nReykjavík, Iceland\nMay 9, 2025\n\nThank you, Francine, and thank you to the Central Bank of Iceland for the\ninvitation to speak to you today.1\nMy subject is the Federal Reserve’s mandate of maximum employment. In the\nFed’s monetary policymaking, maximum employment and stable prices are linked in the\nmandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by U.S. law, which we refer to as the dual\nmandate. Icelanders, I know, are a seafaring people, and those here will understand what\nI mean when I say that the dual mandate is our “lodestar,” a word our two languages\nshare. It is our goal and our guide in setting monetary policy.\nThere is an important distinction between our dual-mandate goals. For reasons\nthat I will explain, while the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has defined\n“stable prices” as 2 percent annual inflation, such numerical precision is not possible in\ndefining maximum employment.\nTo achieve price stability, the Fed adopted a numerical target for inflation in 2012\nthat hasn’t changed. It has remained unchanged because the Committee has repeatedly\nreaffirmed the judgment that it made in 2012 that 2 percent inflation is the rate most\nconsistent with its statutory mandate. In contrast, the Federal Reserve has not spelled out\na numerical goal for the unemployment rate or some other measure of employment\nbecause maximum employment can move up and down over time and is not directly\nmeasurable, and also because the different factors that determine it are either difficult or\nimpossible to measure in real time.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nPlan of the Talk\nThe unemployment rate is the statistic that the public most often uses to form\nviews about labor market conditions, and it is also the statistic that economists most often\nuse to try to infer maximum employment. And economists frequently refer to u* as the\nunemployment rate that corresponds to maximum employment. That said, in my speech\ntoday, I would like to offer historical examples of why u* varies over time and why it\nwould be a mistake to assume that it is a fixed number.2 Then, I will review the\nevolution of the unemployment rate over the past two decades and show that this rate has\nvaried over time, moved by the interplay of myriad factors such as demographics, labor\nmarket regulations, changes in business or consumer confidence, or cyclical changes in\naggregate demand and monetary policy shocks. In contrast, u* is moved mostly by either\nstructural changes, such as skill deterioration or capital depreciation, or by long-run\nfactors in the labor market, such as the demographic and skill composition of the\npopulation. As a result, u* does not move as much as the unemployment rate over time.3\nThis is significant because monetary policy is aimed at managing the business cycle to\nminimize deviations from maximum employment.\n2 In fact, early on, economists have embarked to estimate the time-varying maximum employment in the\neconomy. At least since Perry (1970), it was noted that u* can vary over time; see George L. Perry (1970),\n“Changing Labor Markets and Inflation,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 3, pp. 411–48,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1970/12/1970c_bpea_perry_schultze_solow_gordon.pdf.\n3 Consistent with the view that u* moves less than the unemployment rate over time, in this speech, most of\nthe models that I review assume that u* is the trend component of the unemployment rate. For an\nalternative view that challenges the weaker cyclicality of u* relative to the unemployment rate, see Robert\nE. Hall and Marianna Kudlyak (2023), “The Active Role of the Natural Rate of Unemployment,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 31848 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November;\nrevised December 2024), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31848.\n\n- 3 -\nIn reviewing the unemployment rate, I will also note that it certainly bears\nvaluable information, but, in many cases, this needs to be complemented with other labor\nmarket indicators to have a fuller picture of the state of the economy.\nAs I have noted, maximum employment is not directly measurable. Likewise, we\ncannot observe u* directly, and it has to be inferred by statistical techniques, which I’ll\nreview.4 One element common to all the approaches that I review is that they use a\nnumber of labor market indicators in addition to the unemployment rate in forming their\nestimates of maximum employment. Another element in common to some of the\napproaches is that they try to separate transient factors, or higher-frequency variation,\nfrom a more permanent, long-run feature of the economy that can be interpreted as u*.\nCase Study: The Assumption of a Fixed Maximum Employment in the 1970s\nA common assumption in the economics profession during the 1960s was that u*\nwas 4 percent.5\nWhile this number might have been a decent approximation of u* during that\nperiod, it did not consider the possibility of meaningful changes in that value and,\nspecifically, changes due to the rapid growth in labor supply from the post–World War II\nbaby boomers entering the workforce. Especially because younger workers have higher\nlevels of unemployment, the advent of the baby boomers meant that u* in the 1970s was\nsurely higher than 4 percent. The Federal Reserve was slow in revising its estimate of u*.\n4 For some early examples of the use of advanced statistical techniques such as the application of Kalman\nfiltering techniques, see, for instance, the early examples of Peter K. Clark (1987), “The Cyclical\nComponent of U.S. Economic Activity,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 102 (November), pp. 797–\n814; and Kenneth N. Kuttner (1994), “Estimating Potential Output as a Latent Variable,” Journal of\nBusiness & Economic Statistics, vol. 12 (July), pp. 361–68. For a recent summary of the literature, see\nAlessandro Barbarino, Travis J. Berge, and Andrea Stella (2024), “The Stability and Economic Relevance\nof Output Gap Estimates,” Journal of Applied Econometrics, vol. 39 (September/October), pp. 1065–81.\n5 See Arthur M. Okun (1962), “Potential GNP: Its Measurement and Significance,” Proceedings of the\nBusiness and Economics Statistics Section, pp. 98–104.\n\n- 4 -\nThe high unemployment rate and too low fixed estimate of u* minimum unemployment,\nin conjunction with the failure to recognize the slowdown in trend productivity, led the\nFederal Reserve to exaggerate the estimate of slack in the economy and maintain\nmonetary policy that was too loose, adding to other factors driving persistently high\ninflation over that decade.6 This experience led the Federal Reserve to recognize that a\nfixed 4 percent value for u* was a poor basis for understanding the cyclical position of\nthe economy.\nThe experience of the 1960s and 1970s made it clear that demographic changes\nneed to be considered in estimating u*—a topic I will explore further in my speech.\nThe U.S. Labor Market over the Past Two Decades\nThe U.S. labor market over the past two decades provides some valuable\ncircumstantial evidence for how maximum employment can change over time. Let me\nstart by discussing the Great Recession, which began in late 2007 and was driven by a\nsevere financial crisis. In the months before the recession began, the unemployment rate\nreached a low of 4.4 percent and then peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. Although\nthe unemployment rate is a useful metric of the severity of that event, an additional\nvariable that reflects the depth and persistence of the downturn in the labor market after\nthe Great Recession was the share of long-term unemployed—the percentage of\nunemployed people out of work for 27 weeks or more—which was nearly twice as high\nas during the deep recession of the 1980s. Longer spells of unemployment can generate\npersistence because the longer the duration of unemployment for workers, the more their\nskills erode and the harder it is to become reemployed, leading, in turn, to higher\n6 See Athanasios Orphanides (2003), “The Quest for Prosperity without Inflation,” Journal of Monetary\nEconomics, vol. 50 (April), pp. 633–63.\n\n- 5 -\nunemployment, a phenomenon known as hysteresis. While some have argued that only\nworkers unemployed for shorter durations should be counted in estimating the slack in\nthe economy, hysteresis is an important part of slack during periods with high\nunemployment.7 Instead, the experience of the Great Recession reinforced the value of\nconsulting other useful measures of slack.\nAfter the Great Recession, it took eight years for the unemployment rate to reach\nthe pre-recession low, but when it did, in 2016, it continued to fall, reaching 3.5 percent\nin 2019 and remaining close to this level until the beginning of the COVID-19 recession\nin 2020. One thing that was remarkable about this period was that this low level of\nunemployment occurred without any escalation of inflation. Personal consumption\nexpenditures inflation ran well below an annual rate of 2 percent for almost all of the\ndecade after the Great Recession, when monetary policy was highly accommodative.\nOne could infer that u* had moved down over this period.\nTurning to the pandemic recession, the unemployment rate rose to nearly 15\npercent in two months, but a distinguishing feature of this increase was that a large\nfraction of the unemployed were temporarily laid off.8 Economic research suggests that\nthose who lose their jobs via temporary layoffs have a high likelihood of being recalled,\nwith the latest estimates suggesting a 60 percent probability.9 Considering this, it was not\n7 See, for instance, Olivier J. Blanchard and Lawrence H. Summers (1987), “Hysteresis in Unemployment,”\nEuropean Economic Review, vol. 31 (February–March), pp. 288–95.\n8 In addition, the rise in temporary layoffs was considered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to be\nunderstated, because many respondents to the Current Population Survey misreported their status as\nemployed but not at work—that is, the properly measured unemployment rate would have risen by much\nmore than was actually reported; see, for example, page 6 of the May 2020 Employment Situation report,\nwhich is available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website at\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_06052020.pdf.\n9 See the classic study of David M. Lilien (1980), “The Cyclical Pattern of Temporary Layoffs in United\nStates Manufacturing,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 62 (February), pp. 24–31. For a more\n\n- 6 -\nsurprising that the post-pandemic recovery was characterized by a fast decline in the\nunemployment rate.10 In this sense, the unemployment rate alone was not a sufficient\nindicator of the true state of the labor market. In the post-pandemic recovery, the\nunemployment rate fell to 3.4 percent by April 2023. Again, for a second time we saw\nthe unemployment rate falling to levels that were in the past associated with price\npressures, whereas in this case inflation was also falling.\nIn summary, the past two recessions underscored that there are useful statistics\nbeyond the unemployment rate that help inform a reading of maximum employment, and\nthe past two recoveries suggest that the U.S. economy may sustain unemployment as low\nas 3.5 percent.\nTurning to the current state of the labor market, the unemployment rate has risen\nonly very slowly, and it has moved within a tight range of around 4.2 percent, which is its\ncurrent reading. In addition, temporary layoffs are back at their pre-pandemic level, and\nvacancies and quits have leveled off. As a consequence, I judge the labor market to be\nstable. Most likely, the labor market is also close to maximum employment given that\nthe estimates of u* from some of the models that I will consider in the rest of this speech\nare in the vicinity of 4.2 percent.\nI have used some historical examples to illustrate how the unemployment rate has\nchanged over time, and I have made some informal inference on the movements of u* in\nrecent paper that makes use of matched employer–employee data, see Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber\n(2015), “Recall Expectations and Duration Dependence,” American Economic Review, vol. 105 (May), pp.\n142–46.\n10 Moreover, academic research also suggests that the extent of firms’ recourse to temporary layoffs is\ncorrelated with firms’ expectations of near-term economic activity. This would have suggested in real time\nthat a sharp rise in temporary layoffs was not as worrisome as a similar increase in permanent job losses.\nSee Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber (2020), “Seven Facts about Temporary Layoffs,” CEPR Discussion\nPaper 14845 (London: Centre for Economic Policy Research, June 3),\nhttps://cepr.org/publications/dp14845.\n\n- 7 -\ncertain periods. Now let me explore different ways of estimating maximum employment.\nI will cover three separate methods: a method that uses the demographic composition of\nthe population; a definition that considers the unemployment rate in conjunction with\ninflation in order to get closer to a definition of u* consistent with stable prices; and,\nlastly, a definition that focuses on maximum employment that one can obtain by taking\ninto account that workers take time to find jobs and firms take time to fill job openings.\nSome of the models that I review also consider the labor force participation rate, as\nstructural variation in this rate also affects maximum employment. Historical experience\nwith the different forces that can move around maximum employment indicates that all\nthree of these approaches could be helpful in the future when trying to estimate maximum\nemployment.11\nEstimation of Maximum Employment Using Demographics\nIn describing the impact of the baby boomers on the labor market, I have already\nprovided an example of how the demographic composition of the workforce may affect\nmaximum employment. More generally, the age distribution in the population or\neducational attainment or skill distribution are always important factors in evaluating the\npotential workforce. Beyond the composition of the workforce, developments within\nspecific demographic subgroups also may be relevant for maximum employment. For\ninstance, the increase in labor force participation of women over the past 50 years has\nbeen an important factor that has augmented the available workforce. Granular data from\n11 Some studies distinguish long-run unemployment, which would fall in the first category of models that\nuse demographic information, from stable price unemployment, which also adds a Phillips curve to the\nmodel.

Nekarda, and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau\n(2020), “Unemployment Rate Benchmarks,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-072\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.072.\n\n- 8 -\nthe Labor Department’s monthly survey of household employment known as the Current\nPopulation Survey, sometimes in conjunction with data on job openings and flows in and\nout of employment, can add demographic details to the estimation of maximum\nemployment.\nThe models that exploit demographic data separate the trend or structural factors\nin both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate from transient factors in\nindividual demographic groups, allowing an estimate of maximum employment.12 I\nthink of this as a “bottom up” approach.13\nOne can add an additional layer of complexity in working with demographic\ngroups. One important aspect of the unemployment rate is its characteristic\ncountercyclical dynamics—that is, the way this rate increases at the onset of recessions\ndue to an increase in the flow out of employment or layoffs, and its decline in expansions\nas more unemployed workers find jobs and flow into employment. In recognition of the\nimportance of these flows, one alternative to extracting trends by demographic group is to\nextract trends in the flows by demographic groups and reconstruct u* dynamics from\n12 The resulting unemployment rate trend can be thought of as a “natural rate.” The first reference to a\n“natural rate” of unemployment is from Milton Friedman in 1968. Friedman made it clear that he used the\nterm to try and separate real forces from monetary forces, which are assumed to be more transient;\ntherefore, it seems appropriate to use the term “natural rate” for estimates from demographic trends. See\nMilton Friedman (1968), “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, vol. 58 (March), pp.\n1–17. That said, such a concept is controversial; see Richard Rogerson (1997), “Theory Ahead of\nLanguage in the Economics of Unemployment,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 11 (Winter), pp.\n73–92.\n13 See, for instance, Stephanie Aaronson, Bruce Fallick, Andrew Figura, Jonathan Pingle, and William\nWascher (2006), “The Recent Decline in the Labor Force Participation Rate and Its Implications for\nPotential Labor Supply,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, pp. 69–154,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/2006a_bpea_aaronson.pdf; Daniel Aaronson,\nLuojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini, and Daniel G.

The implicit assumption is that the trend components of flows into and out\nof unemployment capture structural characteristics of the labor market, including market\nimperfections and the cost of job searches for both workers and employers.14 The models\nin this class estimate a trend unemployment rate in the range between 4.1 and 4.3 percent\nin the fourth quarter of 2024. 15\nEstimation of Maximum Employment Consistent with Stable Prices\nAs I mentioned, the dual mandate includes stable prices. The models that I have\njust described do not contain information on prices. However, one may include price\ninformation by adding inflation as a measure of aggregate price pressures in order to\ncome up with an estimate of maximum employment consistent with stable prices.16 A\nhigher unemployment rate signals more workers are available to work, indicating more\nslack. As more workers are employed, the economy is moving to a situation of fewer\nresources being available for additional output and most likely to more price pressures.\nMaximum employment consistent with stable prices ideally strikes a balance between\nadditional workers being hired and additional increases in prices. I have alluded to this\n14 See, for instance, Mary C. Daly, Bart Hobijn, Ayşegül Şahin, and Robert G. Valletta (2012), “A Search\nand Matching Approach to Labor Markets: Did the Natural Rate of Unemployment Rise?” Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, vol. 26 (Summer), pp. 3–26.\n15 See Murat Tasci (2012), “The Ins and Outs of Unemployment in the Long Run: Unemployment Flows\nand the Natural Rate,” Working Paper 12-24 (Cleveland: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, November),\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/2012/wp-1224-the-ins-and-outs-of-\nunemployment-in-the-long-run-unemployment-flows-and-the-natural-rate. See also Richard K. Crump,\nStefano Eusepi, Marc Giannoni, and Ayşegül Şahin (2019), “A Unified Approach to Measuring u*,” BPEA\nConference Drafts, March 7–8, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/A-Unified-\nApproach-to-Measuring-u.pdf. Ahn adds unemployment duration in conjunction with flows to estimate u*;\nsee Hie Joo Ahn (2023), “Duration Structure of Unemployment Hazards and the Trend Unemployment\nRate,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 151 (June), 104664.\n16 Estimates that use prices are sometimes referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of\nunemployment, or NAIRU, although NAIRU is somewhat of a misnomer. In fact, the inflation process in\nthe Great Moderation is not described well by an accelerationist Phillips curve but rather by a mean\nreverting process around a stable trend, conveniently proxied by long-run inflation expectations. In that\ncase, it would be more accurate to talk about “NIRU,” or non-inflationary rate of unemployment.\n\n- 10 -\nconcept in an informal way when arguing that in the period after the Great Recession, u*\nmay have moved down through 2019.\nIn practice, inflation information is folded into the model by adding a relationship\nbetween prices and the unemployment rate known as the Philips curve. There is a long\ntradition in extracting trend employment consistent with stable prices using a various\nlabor market and output measures. I will draw upon that heritage and briefly describe a\nmodel that like the statistical methods that I have already reviewed also aims at\nestimating maximum employment by separating the unemployment rate from cyclical\nfactors, but it does so by using numerous output and labor market indicators in\nconjunction with price information.17 Output indicators include both gross domestic\nproduct and gross domestic income. Among labor market indicators, in addition to the\nunemployment rate, there are payrolls, the workweek, and labor force participation,\nwhich means that the model is not limited to just the unemployment rate in inferring\ntrend unemployment. The purpose of using many indicators is the belief that all of them\nfollow the same cycle, and that it is easier to identify and separate the cycle from trend\nusing a large set of indicators. Coming back to the Phillips curve, I would note that\nmodels that estimate u* are somewhat sensitive to the specification of the Phillips curve.\nFor instance, the model that I have just described has a u* estimate of about 5 percent in\n17 The estimate that I report are from a variant of the model in Charles A. Fleischman and John M. Roberts\n(2011), “From Many Series, One Cycle: Improved Estimates of the Business Cycle from a Multivariate\nUnobserved Components Model,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2011-46 (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201146/201146pap.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nthe fourth quarter of 2024, but alternative Phillips curve specifications may lower it\nbelow 5 percent.18\nEstimation of the Efficient Level of Employment\nA third, often less mentioned concept of full employment is the “efficient” level\nof unemployment. This concept starts with the idea that it is inefficient for society to\nhave unemployed workers and job openings. Society as a whole would gain by matching\nthose workers with those job openings in a productive way. Of course, it is impossible to\ninstantaneously reduce unemployed workers and job openings to zero. Newly\nunemployed workers take time to find a job, and vacancies take time to fill as firms find\nand screen applicants with the right skills. The empirical relationship between the\nunemployment rate and the job openings rate is summarized by the Beveridge curve, a\ndownward-sloping curve along which more unemployed workers are associated with\nfewer job openings. The Beveridge curve is a structural aspect of the labor market, and it\nis effectively a constraint on the relationship between the unemployment rate and the job\nopenings rate. However, given the Beveridge curve, monetary policymakers can try to\nmove the economy along the curve closer to a point at which the total number of\nvacancies plus unemployed is minimized. One can show that this happens somewhere in\nbetween the two, precisely around a value of the unemployment rate equal to the\ngeometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rate.19 The current estimate of this\n18 For instance, the Phillips curve could be non-linear as in Pierpaolo Benigno and Gauti B. Eggertsson\n(2023), “It’s Baaack: The Surge in Inflation in the 2020s and the Return of the Non-Linear Phillips\nCurve,” NBER Working Paper Series 31197 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research,\nApril), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31197.\n19 The efficient level of unemployment is also referred to as the “full employment rate of unemployment”\nor FERU; see Pascal Michaillat and Emmanuel Saez (2024), “u* = √uv: The Full-Employment Rate of\nUnemployment in the United States,” BPEA Conference Draft, September 26–27,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/5_MichaillatSaez.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nfull employment concept places the unemployment rate at 4.2 percent in the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\nConclusion and Policy Message\nI want to draw some conclusions from the points I have made today.\nMy discussion has touched upon many different statistics of the labor market,\nincluding the possibility of using data that exploits the heterogeneity of different\ndemographic groups, which I judge to be very informative about u*. The reason is that\ndifferent business cycles are generated by different shocks that affect the economy in\ndifferent ways, so that useful indicators of slack in past cycles may not be as insightful in\nthe future. For instance, when there is slack in the labor market, measures taking into\naccount unemployment duration can be more informative about the persistence of\nunemployment and future slack. By contrast, when labor markets are tight, measures of\nflows into, out of, and across jobs will give a better measure of the job opportunities for\nworkers and potential upward pressures on wages. Similarly, the vacancy and\nunemployment ratio combination used in the definition of efficient u* can provide an\nalternative measure of maximum employment.\nOf course, any one of the estimation techniques that I have reviewed has\nlimitations. For instance, there are constraints on the number of indicators that each\nmodel can process. This implies that some models will be better at capturing some\ndrivers of maximum employment than others. That is why I cannot point to the best\nstatistic or best model of maximum employment. I can only acknowledge that a rich set\nof models and indicators only benefits the policymaker. Given the uncertainty in\nestimating maximum employment in real time and the many options available, I consider\n\n- 13 -\nit undesirable to adopt one particular measure to guide monetary policy. This is\nsomething to bear in mind as I approach the current review of the FOMC’s Statement on\nLonger-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we call our framework.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2024 Diploma Ceremony\nFrank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy\nUniversity of Virginia\nCharlottesville, Virginia\nMay 18, 2024\n\nThank you for your generous introduction, Dean Solomon, and thank you for the\ninvitation to be here and share this special day with all of you. Let me begin by\ncongratulating the Class of 2024. Let’s give a huge round of applause to our graduates,\nwho are all so deserving of being recognized. And let’s clap our hands together and also\ncongratulate the families and friends who are here, too, because—believe me, I know—it\ntakes a village! So let’s thank all those who supported you along the way and who made\nsure you had what you needed to make it here today. I want to acknowledge that this is a\nreal milestone. You have all accomplished so much already as you now embark on a\ncareer in public policy and leadership. And you are now joining the many Batten\ngraduates who have made great contributions in careers in the service of others.\nI suppose I am here, at least in part, because I represent the promise and the\npossibility of a career spent in large part in public-policy-related work. I work in that city\nthat many of you possibly hope to work in—I am told that nearly half of master’s degree\nstudents and more than one-fourth of bachelor’s degree students graduating from the\nBatten School end up in Washington, D.C. In various roles, I have been fortunate enough\nto do some of the kind of policy work that many of you have set your sights on. I\nunderstand that a sizable share of Batten students indeed end up working in government\nbut also in think tanks, in nonprofits, and in the private sector. Some of you have worked\nin Washington already or done internships there, and many of you will go forth from here\nand travel the well-worn path of Routes 29 and 66, avoiding rush hour if you can and\nfinding two like-minded classmates so you can use the express lanes, too.\nSome of you probably came to the University of Virginia (UVA) and Batten\nknowing exactly what you wanted to do, with a clear view of the path to get there. Some\n\n- 2 -\nof you probably settled on that goal and that path over the course of your studies.\nCertainly, higher education is a big investment, and everyone needs a plan for recouping\nthat investment—in terms of income, of course, but also in terms of opening other\nopportunities that education can provide. As a professor of public policy at Georgetown,\nI always hoped to provide tools that would be useful for graduating students in their new\njobs. And I do know, given the caliber of Batten, that your studies here have helped you\nto not only attain the tools and knowledge you will need moving forward but also to\nmake the contacts and build the networks that will help you in your careers. Most\nimportantly, I hope that your time at UVA has opened your eyes to opportunities that you\nhadn’t even imagined when you first set foot on Grounds. Importantly, I do hope that\nyou have learned over your time here about the many ways in which public policy work\ncan be fulfilling for you personally and can also allow you to improve the lives of others,\nwhether pursuing work on housing affordability, budget priorities, or access to health and\neducation; building infrastructure capacity; or tackling financial stability. Ultimately,\npublic policy and leadership are about helping people.\nIt is with that latter point in mind that I am going to tell you about my own\nexperience and the importance of allowing yourself to take risks and follow your own\npath as you pursue a career in public service. While this may contradict some of the\nadvice you have received about managing your careers, I strongly believe that it will\nmake you more successful and more fulfilled in the long run.\nI tell you this because I am probably an unlikely person to have been appointed to\nthe Federal Reserve Board, as the first Latin policymaker in the Fed’s history. I was\nraised in Colombia and came to the United States at age 15, speaking almost no English.\n\n- 3 -\nI attended public schools. In high school, I carried around to every class one of those\nthick Merriam-Webster dictionaries because, of course, back then there was no Google\nTranslate on smartphones, and also no smartphones!\nAnother thing I carried with me, along with my dictionary, was the memory from\nmy childhood of traveling around Colombia with my parents and witnessing great\npoverty and the suffering and social problems that come from poverty. At an early age,\nmy brother and I would accompany my parents to shantytowns around Bogota to help\nwith social projects, and we traveled the countryside to visit my maternal grandparents,\nwho lived in one of the poorest states in the country. I would spend my summer with my\ngrandparents since both my parents worked. My grandfather, who had to leave high\nschool as a teenager to help his widowed mother raise his five siblings, would take us to\nhis dairy farm at four o’clock in the morning to help milk the cows and put the milk in\nstainless steel tanks. Traveling the unpaved roads into town, we would then stop at\nvarious stores to sell the milk. But my grandpa’s day was just getting started, because he\nwas also the mayor of his town, and every morning, he would open his office and deal\nwith the business of being mayor. While my grandpa never graduated from high school,\nhe was an autodidact, and he worked hard to put all his siblings and his six children\nthrough college, and he saw serving as mayor as a way to help his neighbors. The\nmemories of my grandfather overcoming many obstacles but also devoting his life to\nhelping others were certainly an inspiration and remain a source of motivation for me\neven today. In fact, I remember going back to visit my grandparents over the years,\nsummer after summer, and seeing the new roads that had been paved and the improved\n\n- 4 -\nschool and health clinic in the town and seeing how a life devoted to public service can\nimprove lives.\nSo when going to college, while not totally definite about what to study, I found\nthat the memories from my childhood and the desire to find ways to address poverty\nguided my decision to gravitate toward economics and political science, and I figured the\nbest path for me was to work in public policy. In particular, I discovered that economics\nwas a science that would allow me to better combine my interest in math with my desire\nto help address poverty, so I moved in that direction, pursuing a PhD.\nI want to emphasize that my career was not linear or perfectly planned, but rather\nI have chosen to take detours. And, importantly, I have chosen to take risks along the\nway. Yet what was always a constant was my commitment to use my technical expertise\nto tackle poverty and social challenges. But I also could have never imagined that some\nof the detours I took would actually help me down the road in preparing me for my\ncurrent role.\nAs an undergrad, I decided to apply out of the blue for an internship with the\njunior senator from Maryland at the time, Senator Barbara Mikulski, only because I read\na newspaper article about her work in the Senate as the daughter of Polish immigrants,\nwhich really resonated with me. Little did I know that I was going to be back at the Hart\nbuilding a few decades later, making the rounds to meet with various senators as I\nprepared for my Senate confirmation for the Federal Reserve. In grad school, I spent\ntime as a visitor both at the Brookings Institution and at the San Francisco Fed—where I\nworked on my PhD research while surrounded by policy-focused professionals. Stepping\ninto these institutions pushed me out of my comfort zone and into the world of policy and\n\n- 5 -\ndiscussions about what it took to prepare for Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeetings while I was a grad student immersed in a highly technical PhD. program. Little\ndid I know that I was going to be back at the Fed attending those FOMC meetings myself\nand at Brookings just a few months ago giving my first speech as a governor. I know as\nstudents, many of you have already done internships and searched for these opportunities\naround policymaking, and I want to tell you that this is exactly what will make you grow\nmoving forward. Like me, you may someday be surprised to find yourself revisiting\nthose important places where you once studied and learned, but now as a senior\nprofessional in a position to provide service in a very different way.\nFor decades, I spent much of my career in academia pursuing answers to my big\nquestions on poverty by doing research and teaching at universities. Throughout, I\nalways focused on those same questions that drove me to study economics in the first\nplace—and always with my sights on the role of policy and the implications for real\npeople, like my grandpa and others I had seen in Colombia and in the United States, who\nlacked opportunities. And that’s when my next big detour came. Just one year after\nbeing recruited by Georgetown, I was approached by the U.S. Department of Labor to be\nits chief economist. While I knew I could contribute my knowledge in the middle of the\nGreat Recession about the drivers of unemployment and effective policies to create jobs,\nI had never spent time working in government. This certainly pushed me out of my\ncomfort zone again, and I am very glad it did, because I learned a great deal about how\npolicy actually gets made while using my expertise and knowledge to conduct evidence-\nbased policymaking. Little did I know that the data on prices and employment produced\n\n- 6 -\nby the Labor Department would be the same data that I analyze in my current role at the\nFed, looking for evidence-based insights to make policy that benefits all Americans.\nMy point with all this biography is to show how the crucial professional\nexperiences in my life have come from keeping my options open, being open to new\nopportunities, and taking risks. It is reassuring, and very tempting, to set one’s sights on\none and only one goal and to stay strictly focused on the path to get there. Any map will\nshow the most direct route from Charlottesville to Washington—just take a right turn at\nGainesville, right? But there are other destinations, and other ways to get where you are\ngoing, that may make the journey more enriching and rewarding. Be open to those\npossibilities. Be ready to try new things. One of the things you may gain from this\napproach is discovering talents and abilities that you may not know you had. To invoke a\nprinciple of economics, trying new things and considering new possibilities may help you\ndiscover your comparative advantage. Discovering a comparative advantage in this way\nis really just about learning more about yourself, a more general goal for life that I would\nrecommend to everyone. And you may be surprised at how often the winding road brings\nyou back to old landmarks you may have previously visited, but now with a stronger set\nof tools for providing service.\nAs I said earlier, this approach to your career planning might contradict some very\ngood advice from your professors and advisers, and maybe from your own parents, on\nhow best to use the great advantage of your education at the Batten School. By\nencouraging you to step off the path now and then to consider other possibilities, I don’t\nmean you shouldn’t work as hard as possible to achieve your goals. Absolutely you\n\n- 7 -\nshould put your heart and soul into what you do, hopefully because you will find a job to\nwhich you are deeply committed and you love.\nMy own career so far has followed a winding road. It is certainly not what I\nexpected when I was sitting where you are sitting today. But I’m glad I said yes, took\nsome chances, and experienced different kinds of jobs in different types of organizations.\nKeep a lookout for opportunities and consider saying yes even if doing so might move\nyou off your planned path for a time. You may discover strengths and abilities you didn’t\nrecognize before. You may develop interests and even passions that you never expected\nto develop. Changing the world might begin with a change of perspective that helps you\nbetter understand the realities around you and also yourself. Be open to all that.\nCongratulations, again, to the Class of 2024, and the best of luck wherever the road takes\nyou. And if that is the Fed, please do make sure to pop in to say hi!",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nWhittington Lecture\nMcCourt School of Public Policy\nGeorgetown University\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\nThank you, Tom, and thank you for the invitation to give the Whittington\nLecture.1 It is humbling to be here giving this lecture to honor the memory and legacy of\nLeslie Whittington. While I did not cross paths with Leslie here at Georgetown\nUniversity, when I arrived, I heard so many stories about her contributions to the school,\nthe university, and the students. She worked on research about the effects of economic\npolicies on children and families, so I know that if I had had the good fortune to overlap\nwith her as a colleague, I would have benefited greatly from her work and presence. It is\nalso an honor to be giving this lecture, because so many dynamic leaders have previously\nstood before you, including some who have been inspirations to me in my career, such as\nAlice Rivlin and Cecilia Rouse.\nToday I will be discussing a topic that has certainly captured the attention of\ncentral bankers, and the public at large, in recent years: inflation and the relationship\nbetween inflation and unemployment. But before I talk about a lens through which to\nthink about the inflation experienced in the pandemic period, I want to update you with\nmy views on the current outlook for the U.S. economy and the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) efforts to sustainably return inflation to our 2 percent objective\nwhile maintaining a strong labor market.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe overall picture is that the U.S. economy remains on a firm footing, with\noutput growing at a solid pace. Real gross domestic product grew 2.5 percent in 2024.\nConsumer spending continued to drive this solid pace last year. While retail sales posted\na decline last month, January data are often difficult to interpret. Bad weather and\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nseasonal adjustment difficulties may have affected the release, and it should be noted the\nslowdown came after a strong pace of sales in the second half of last year. That said, as\nusual, I pay attention to many indicators to gauge the state of the economy. Employment\nreadings show that the labor market is healthy and stable. Payroll job gains have been\nsolid recently, averaging 189,000 per month over the past four months, according to the\nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). After touching 4.2 percent as recently as November,\nthe unemployment rate has flattened to 4 percent since then, consistent with a labor\nmarket that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.\nInflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, though the\npath continues to be bumpy and inflation remains somewhat elevated. Readings last\nweek from the BLS showed price pressures persisted in the economy in January. Our\npreferred inflation gauge at the Fed, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price\nindex, will be released next week. Based on the consumer price index and producer price\nindex data for January, it is estimated that the PCE index advanced about 2.4 percent on a\n12-month basis in January. Excluding food and energy costs, core prices are estimated to\nhave risen 2.6 percent. Those readings show there is still some way to go before\nachieving the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\nRegarding monetary policy, the FOMC judged in September that it was time to\nbegin reducing our policy interest rate from levels that were strongly restrictive on\naggregate demand and putting downward pressure on inflation. We reduced that rate\n100 basis points through December, leaving our policy rate at moderately restrictive\nlevels. At our latest meeting in January, I supported the decision to hold the policy rate\nsteady. I see this as appropriate, given that the downward risks to employment have\n\n- 3 -\ndiminished but upside risks to inflation remain. The potential net effect of new economic\npolicies also remains highly uncertain and will depend on the breadth, duration, reactions\nto, and, importantly, specifics of the measures adopted.\nGoing forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch\nthese developments closely and continue to carefully assess the incoming data and\nevolving outlook.\nNow, turning back to the main topic of my speech, I will start with the core\nmission of the Federal Reserve: to pursue the dual mandate, given to us by Congress, of\npromoting maximum employment and stable prices. We saw firsthand during the\npandemic period why the price-stability portion of the mandate is so important. High\ninflation imposes significant hardship and erodes Americans’ purchasing power,\nespecially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing,\nand transportation. As a policymaker and economist, I think it is vitally important to\nhave a good understanding of inflation dynamics and how those dynamics may have\nevolved over time. This knowledge allows me to pursue the best policies to deliver stable\nprices while maintaining a solid labor market.\nWaves of Inflation\nFive years after the pandemic took hold suddenly and with little warning, there is\na tendency to remember the inflation buildup as a fast and uniform phenomenon. But\nthat was not the case. Inflation stemming from the pandemic shock came in waves.\nToday I will first describe the different waves of inflation experienced in the pandemic\nperiod. Then I invite you aboard the sailboat that we will use to navigate those waves:\nYou could call it the SS Phillips Curve. The Phillips curve is a model that has been used\n\n- 4 -\nfor a long time to try to explain inflation dynamics and the tradeoffs between inflation\nand unemployment. Finally, I will discuss with you how this voyage may have changed\nthe charts for policymakers.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S., and much of the world’s developed\neconomies, experienced a prolonged period of low inflation. Then, when the economy\nbroadly shut down in March and April 2020, the U.S. experienced a brief period of\ndeflation. But by the middle of that year, we saw that the first of several waves of\ninflation began hitting the economy’s shores.\nThe first notable wave of inflation came from food prices. With many restaurants\nclosed and people fearful of gathering, consumers pivoted their spending to grocery\nstores and online grocery delivery to meet their families’ needs, with some stockpiling\nessential items because they feared future shortages. This jump in demand was met with\nsnarled supply chains for food processing and groceries. Annual food inflation reached a\nfirst peak of 5 percent in June 2020. There was a second food inflation wave with the\nonset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the middle of 2022. Beyond the cost alone,\ngrocery prices are an important determinant of inflation expectations for consumers since\nfood is purchased so frequently.2 Another wave of inflation came from goods other than\nfood and energy—what economists call “core goods.” In the years immediately before\nthe pandemic, goods prices were not a significant source of inflation. During the\nexpansion from 2009 until 2020, core goods inflation declined 0.5 percent annually on\naverage. However, once the pandemic took hold, consumer demand rotated from\n2 D’Acunto, Malmendier, Ospina, and Weber (2021) show that consumers disproportionately rely on the\nprice changes of goods in their grocery bundles when forming expectations about aggregate inflation; see\nFrancesco D’Acunto, Ulrike Malmendier, Juan Ospina, and Michael Weber (2021), “Exposure to Grocery\nPrices and Inflation Expectations,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 129 (May), pp. 1615–39.\n\n- 5 -\nservices to goods. At the same time, additional supply chain issues arose, including\nclosed factories and disrupted ports. As consumption rapidly shifted toward goods, their\nprices rose sharply.3 Core goods inflation picked up markedly in the spring of 2021 and\nreached a peak of 7.6 percent on a 12-month basis in February 2022. This was a notable\ndevelopment because, during most of this century, goods price deflation offset price\nincreases in other categories and thus kept a lid on overall inflation.\nA third wave of inflation came from services costs, excluding housing. Near the\nstart of the pandemic, millions of Americans lost their jobs, and many left the labor\nmarket, with some retiring and others fearful of being exposed to the virus. When the\neconomy began to reopen from shutdowns, demand for workers rose faster than the\nsupply. As a result, the labor market quickly became very tight. To attract workers,\nemployers raised wages. And to offset that expense, many raised prices. Given that\nlabor is the most important input into the production of services, core services inflation\nensued, reaching a peak of 5.2 percent on a 12-month basis in December 2021. Core\nservices inflation stayed persistently high until it began to turn down in February 2023.\nThe final wave of inflation I will discuss came from PCE housing services\ninflation. During the pandemic, many Americans reassessed housing choices, including\nthose who preferred to move to detached homes in the suburbs from multifamily\ndwellings in cities. The supply of housing has long been constrained, so when a further\nincrease in demand met limited supply, prices rose. Housing inflation rose to a peak of\n8.27 percent on a 12-month basis in April 2023 and has moved lower since then. The\n3 Ferrante, Graves, and Iacoviello (2020) show that a sharp reallocation of demand from one sector to\nanother can exacerbate supply chain disruption and cause aggregate inflation; see Francesco Ferrante,\nSebastian Graves, and Matteo Iacoviello (2023), “The Inflationary Effects of\nSectoral Reallocation,” Journal of Monetary Economics, supp., vol. 140 (November), pp. S64–81.\n\n- 6 -\nrun-up in housing inflation came more slowly, but it is also the component most slowly to\nabate. This is an area that experienced catch-up inflation, as housing inflation rises and\nfalls slowly because rents are reset infrequently, usually only once a year for most\nrenters.\nFor the remainder of this discussion, I will focus on core inflation, and\nspecifically core goods and core services inflation. My objective is to discuss several\nadditions to an augmented Phillips curve model that allow us to capture the dynamics of\nthose waves we encountered on our journey.\nThe Traditional Phillips Curve\nSince price stability and maximum employment are the two components of the\nFed’s dual-mandate goal, it is important for policymakers to be able to interpret the\ninflation process and relate it to macroeconomic conditions, including unemployment.\nOne traditional way of understanding the usual tradeoff between inflation and\nunemployment is the use of the Phillips curve. It was first employed by New Zealand\neconomist A.W. Phillips in 1958 to describe a simple relationship between wage growth\nand unemployment. Basically, it demonstrates that wage inflation is lower when\nunemployment is high, and higher when unemployment is low. Since then, several\nvariants and updates have been offered to the Phillips curve model, and I will offer\nupdates, too.\nOne of the most notable updates came from Milton Friedman in 1967 in his\npresidential address to the American Economic Association.4 In that speech, he argued\n4 See Milton Friedman (1968), “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, vol. 58\n(March), pp. 1–17; and Edmund S. Phelps (1967), “Phillips Curves, Expectations of Inflation and Optimal\nUnemployment over Time,” Economica, vol. 34 (135), pp. 254–81.\n\n- 7 -\nthat there is only a temporary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, because\ninflation depends on both the unemployment rate relative to a natural rate (the\nunemployment gap) and expectations of future inflation.\nThe unemployment gap measures how much unemployment is above or below\nsome reference level such as the natural rate of unemployment, or NAIRU (non-\naccelerating inflation rate of unemployment), which is thought to be the normal level of\nunemployment absent cyclical forces. An unemployment rate that is above the reference\nlevel indicates that there is slack in the economy. Conversely, if the unemployment rate\nis below the reference level, the economy is tight. The unemployment gap has an inverse\nrelation to wage and price inflation, because slack in the economy means that there are\nexcess resources to meet demand while tightness in the labor market means there is little\nroom to expand demand without putting upward pressure on prices. Let’s turn now to the\nother ingredient in Friedman’s Phillips curve: inflation expectations. Inflation\nexpectations represent the rate at which people expect prices to rise in the future. A\nPhillips curve model that includes inflation expectations is called an “expectations-\naugmented Phillips curve.”\nThe idea behind adding inflation expectations to a Phillips curve is that workers\ncare about their inflation-adjusted wage, rather than nominal wages, over the course of a\nperiod of employment when bargaining their pay. Meanwhile, price-setting firms care\nabout their relative price in pricing their products. Both sets of agents must forecast as\nbest as possible the future path of inflation to efficiently bargain their wages or set their\nprices. In other words, both parties form expectations about the general price level, and\n\n- 8 -\nthese expectations will feed back into the inflation process.5 Friedman assumed that\ninflation expectations respond to lagged observed inflation—or what are called “adaptive\nexpectations”—and when that is so, it provides a mechanism for inflation to be persistent.\nThis view captured inflation dynamics in the 1970s and early 1980s fairly well;\nhowever, it was not broadly applicable to the period from the late 1980s through 2019,\noften called the “Great Moderation.” Rather, regarding inflation dynamics over an\nextended period, inflation appears to be more strongly related to long-run inflation\nexpectations than to lagged inflation or short-run inflation expectations measures.\nMonetary policy can play an important role in setting long-run inflation expectations.\nBoth wage seekers and price setters form their inflation expectations, in part, from their\nbeliefs about the central bank’s inflation goal. When long-run inflation expectations stay\nclose to the central bank’s goal, we say that inflation expectations are anchored at that\ngoal. That goal is currently set at 2 percent, and long-run inflation expectations have\nindeed been in a tight range around that target.6\nThe empirical literature on the Phillips curve has considered additional variables\nthat may affect inflation and used those variables to create new versions of a Phillips\ncurve. For example, Phillips curves have long included measures of “cost-push”\npressures such as core import prices. These cost pressures more fully capture shocks to\n5 Friedman did not consider forward-looking price-setting firms, but more recent advances in\nmacroeconomics do, such as New Keynesian models; see Jordi Galí (2015), Monetary Policy, Inflation,\nand the Business Cycle: An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework and Its Applications\n(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press).\n6 In an earlier speech, I have sketched a model in which agents infer the central bank target by observing\ninflation, interest rates, and unemployment data; see Adriana D. Kugler (2024), “Central Bank\nIndependence and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Albert Hirschman Lecture,\n2024 Annual Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association and the Latin American\nand Caribbean Chapter of the Econometric Society, Montevideo, Uruguay, November 14,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241114a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nfirms’ costs coming from global price pressures and not captured by other measures of\nslack. Other Phillips curves also include lags of inflation to capture persistence in the\ninflation process.7\nTo summarize, the empirical literature has come to the conclusion that inflation\ndynamics can best be captured by a Phillips curve that includes lags of inflation, long-run\ninflation expectations, and a measure of slack, as well as import and energy prices as\ncost-push shocks. An instance of that formulation of a Phillips curve is included in\nformer Chair Janet Yellen’s speech from 2015.8 Next, I would like to assess the accuracy\nof this baseline model during the recent run-up of inflation and consider how to augment\nthe Phillips curve model with some new variables that may be able to capture some of the\nshocks experienced during the pandemic and post-pandemic period. A large literature\nhas emerged on how to interpret the recent run-up in inflation, and more research is\nneeded to fully understand this complicated episode. The Phillips curve model that I will\nuse is another approach to consider. This is a simple approach, but it is possible to\nconsider more complex models, such as models that consider the joint dynamics of\ninflation and other variables or models that explicitly consider nonlinearities.9 However,\nI still see value in starting from this simple framework, seeing what it can and cannot\n7 For a review of Phillips curve formulations, see Robert J. Gordon (2018), “Friedman and Phelps on the\nPhillips Curve Viewed from a Half Century’s Perspective,” Review of Keynesian Economics, vol. 6 (4),\npp. 425–36.\n8 The model that I will use is similar to the one described by Janet Yellen in her famous speech at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts in 2015; see Janet L. Yellen (2015), “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary\nPolicy,” speech delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst,\nSeptember 24, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20150924a.htm.\n9 See Pierpaolo Benigno and Gauti B. Eggertsson (2023), “It’s Baaack: The Surge in Inflation in the 2020s\nand the Return of the Non-Linear Phillips Curve,” NBER Working Paper Series 31197 (Cambridge, Mass.:\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, April), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31197.\n\n- 10 -\nexplain about pandemic inflation, and then seeing whether the addition of certain\nvariables can help the model more fully account for inflation during the pandemic.\nEstimation of the Phillips Curve Today\nAs I just explained, the Phillips curve model allows flexibility in the choice of\nvariables, but economists employing the model must decide how to weight these\nvariables. And those weights must be chosen in some way. Economists choose weights\nby examining available data and deciding which capture the inflation process in the best\npossible way. This decision is called “estimation.” The modern way to undertake such\nan estimation is called “training.” Economists train a model on a specific set of data and\nconsider different cuts of the data set to determine different ways to compute those\nweights.\nI will consider quarterly data that have been consistently produced since 1964,\nallowing us to include the periods of the Great Inflation, the Great Moderation, and the\nmost recent inflation run-up. We could use this entire data set to train the model.\nHowever, subsample analysis also serves to prove some valuable points.\nFirst Result: Examining the Great Moderation\nLet’s start by updating former Fed Chair Yellen’s results. She estimated the\nmodel using the data during the so-called Great Moderation; I will update her results by\ntraining the model through 2019, the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold\nin the U.S. As the term “moderation” implies, this was a period in which both inflation\nand output became much less volatile. We do not know exactly what brought about the\nGreat Moderation. Hypotheses include the effects of better inventory management or\nbetter monetary policy. We do know, however, that inflation settled into a trend near to\n\n- 11 -\nor slightly below 2 percent during that period. We estimate the model with data from this\nperiod, and we decompose how much of inflation is explained by the variables and how\nmuch is left unexplained, which economists call the “residual.” As it turns out, this\nmodel does a good job of capturing the inflation process over that period before the\npandemic, and my results are similar to Yellen’s. The model explains 70 percent of the\nvariation in inflation, meaning that only 30 percent of the variation in inflation is\nattributed to unexplained residuals. An alternative way to understand the unexplained\npart is as the standard deviation of the residual or the unexplained portion of the model,\nwhich was 0.50 percentage point for the period from 2010 to 2019, compared with the\nstandard deviation of inflation of about 0.8 percentage point.\nThis model, however, struggles to explain the run-up in inflation in the years\nimmediately after the pandemic took hold. The unexplained portion of inflation, the\nresidual, rises dramatically in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, the unexplained portion is almost\n2 percentage points, and the following year, it is about 1.5 percentage points. Perhaps we\nshould not be surprised by the outcome. These years saw inflation reach a four-decade\npeak, but the model has been trained on a Great Moderation sample that saw relatively\nquiet inflation.10\nSecond Result: Using a Longer Sample\nThe results are more encouraging if, instead, we also include data from the\nprevious period of significant inflation and train the model on data starting in 1964.\nIntuitively, it makes sense that including a period with persistent inflation, like the 1970s,\nmight help us better understand another inflationary episode. I stop at 2019 because I\n10 The results that I obtain for the 1990–2019 period are similar to those that Yellen reports for the 1990–\n2014 period.\n\n- 12 -\nwant to see if training on data from the previous 55-year period can explain the post-2020\ninflation.\nThe model captures more of the most recent run-up in inflation when using the\nlonger period of analysis. The unexplained residual drops to about 1.5 percentage points\nin 2021 and to a bit above 0.5 percentage point in 2022. Allowing for greater persistence\nin inflation allows an inflation equation to fit the pandemic period better, though it does\nnot settle the question of whether the pandemic inflation was caused by large and\npersistent shocks or by large shocks and a persistent inflation process—for example,\nbecause of greater feedback between wages and prices.\nTo improve the model further, it would be useful to include additional\nexplanatory variables that could better capture the overheating of the economy. In what\nfollows, I include variables that might account for factors experienced in the most recent\nbout of inflation, such as a very tight labor market and supply chain snarls.\nThird Result: Alternative Measure of Slack\nAs I mentioned before, the very tight labor market was an important contributor to\ninflation in recent years, especially to services inflation, yet the weight on the\nunemployment gap in the Phillips curve for the more recent period is very small. This\nmeasure of slack has become less and less important over time in explaining inflation,\nexcept during selected episodes such as in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis,\nwhich was characterized by a very sluggish recovery. Outside of that episode, and very\nfew others, the Phillips curve places little weight on that measure of slack in explaining\ninflation over the Great Moderation, including during the recent run-up. This is also a\nreflection of training the model over the Great Moderation, in which inflation moved\n\n- 13 -\nfairly tightly around a very flat trend. Notice that this would suggest a “flat Phillips\ncurve” or a big penalty in terms of unemployment needed to reduce inflation. Instead, I\nfocus on another very promising alternative measure that I have paid a lot of attention to\nsince I was chief economist at the Department of Labor—and again since I joined the\nBoard of Governors—and that I am very familiar with as a scholar of labor markets. The\nmeasure is the ratio of vacancies to the level of unemployment.11 In effect, this ratio\nmeasures how much competition there is for a given job, or the “tightness” of the labor\nmarket. Labor is an important input into most production processes, and, thus, tightness\nin the labor market is closely related to price pressures. I use the standard version of this\nratio that measures job openings from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey as\nthe numerator and the unemployment level from the Current Population Survey as the\ndenominator. This allows me to use data back to the 1960s.12 The vacancy-to-\nunemployment ratio as a measure of slack is more effective at explaining inflation than\nthe unemployment gap. This represents an interesting result because it offers a larger\nrole to heated labor markets in explaining the run-up in inflation. My results echo\nresearch that finds the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is a helpful measure of slack to\nconsider in out-of-sample forecasting exercises.13\n11 The ratio of job openings to unemployment has attracted the attention of many researchers. See, for\ninstance, Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S. Bernanke (2023), “What Caused the US Pandemic-Era\nInflation?” NBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, June), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31417.\n12 Although job openings from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) go back only as far\nas the early 2000s, I use here the extended series from Barnichon that pieces together JOLTS data for the\nmore recent period with a corrected version of the help-wanted index originally from the Conference Board\nfor the period before 2001. See Regis Barnichon (2010), “Building a Composite Help-Wanted Index,”\nEconomics Letters, vol. 109 (December), pp. 175–78.\n13 See Regis Barnichon and Adam Shapiro (2022), “What’s the Best Measure of Economic Slack?” FRBSF\nEconomic Letter 2022-04 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, February),\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2022/02/what-is-best-measure-of-\neconomic-slack; and Régis Barnichon and Adam Hale Shapiro (2024), “Phillips Meets Beveridge,” Journal\nof Monetary Economics, supp., vol. 148 (November), 103660.\n\n- 14 -\nFourth Result: Supply Chain Snarls\nAlthough the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio offers a promising measure of slack\nand supply chain pressures due to labor shortages, that measure does not necessarily\ncapture supply chain snarls whose roots lie outside of the labor market. As I mentioned\nearlier, there were substantial supply chain disruptions during the past few years that\ncame at the same time as strong demand. That resulted in material and labor shortages.\nAttempts at quantifying supply-side disruptions have been around for some decades\nnow.14 I rely on a new monthly shortages index created by a team of Fed Board\neconomists, which relies on textual analysis to scan news articles for sentences that\ninclude the word pairs “labor shortages,” “material shortages,” or “food shortages.”15\nThe Shortage Index allows us to better measure cost-push pressures from different\nsources and is constructed all the way back to the beginning of the previous century.\nThus, it makes a difference to have access to advances in natural language processing.16\nWhen I add the Shortage Index to the baseline Phillips curve or to the vacancy-to-\nunemployment–based Phillips curve, I obtain that the Shortage Index explains an even\nlarger portion of the inflation run-up during and after the pandemic. The residual for\n14 The Institute for Supply Management’s Supplier Deliveries Index has been around since the 1950s, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index since 1998, and the Census\nBureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization since 2008.\n15 See Dario Caldara, Matteo Iacoviello, and David Yu (2024), “Measuring Shortages since 1900,” working\npaper. Their index is available at https://www.matteoiacoviello.com/shortages.html.\n16 Other authors have used natural language processing in an attempt to produce a measure of shortages.\nFor instance, see Paul E. Soto (2023), “Measurement and Effects of Supply Chain Bottlenecks Using\nNatural Language Processing,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, February 6), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/measurement-and-effects-\nof-supply-chain-bottlenecks-using-natural-language-processing-20230206.html. Blanchard and Bernanke\nuse Google searches for the word “shortage” as an indicator of sectoral supply constraints in a Phillips\ncurve equation; see Blanchard and Bernanke, “What Caused the US Pandemic-Era Inflation?” in note 11.\nFor an early-attempt, hand-coded shortage index, see Owen Lamont (1997), “Do ‘Shortages’ Cause\nInflation?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 281–306.\n\n- 15 -\n2020 is cut in half, the residual for 2021 is about 1 percentage point, and the residual is\neffectively eliminated in 2022. I judge this a noteworthy result and a proof of concept\nthat with additional augmentation, the Phillips curve model can better capture inflation\ndynamics during the recent period. Through the lens of this model, supply shortages\nplayed an important role in 2022 in constraining output to grow at an anemic rate and in\npushing up inflation. Moreover, the model is also able to capture the decline in inflation\nin 2023 and 2024 despite the strong expansion in real activity. I view the Shortage Index\nas a powerful indicator of the nonlinear effects stemming from a compounding of the\ncontemporaneous interaction of demand and supply bottlenecks.\nI have offered additional variables to account for a measure of slack as it relates to\nlabor supply and material supply. This exercise could be extended further to better\naccount for some of the subcategories of inflation that caused the waves I discussed\nearlier. For example, food inflation, which is characterized by two distinct waves, can\nmostly be explained by the Food Shortage Index, which captures a large portion of the\nresidual in the baseline model.\nLessons for the Policymaker\nToday I have discussed the waves of inflation the country faced starting five years\nago. I also talked about how the vessel we use to navigate those choppy waters can be\nimproved upon. As I conclude, I want to discuss with you how central bankers might\nrecalibrate their compasses, based on what we learned from considering these\naugmentations to Phillips curve models. I think a clear lesson is that no single model\nalone can give a policymaker an understanding of every possible state of the economy.\nPolicymakers must be open to various options, models, and frameworks—and not be\n\n- 16 -\nafraid to experiment in search of more accurate answers. Policymakers must be very\nattentive to the most recent contributions from academia and empirical practitioners.\nBroadly, that is the approach I take, and why I apply the same rigor I did as an academic\nresearcher to the monetary policy decisions that I confront.\nThe recent run-up in inflation in many ways was a rather unique period, spurred,\nat least initially, by the first onset of a global pandemic in more than a century. Fully\nunderstanding the dynamics at play has provided a tough test for economists. The\nmodels I described today have had some success in capturing salient features of the\ninflation process during the pandemic period. I hope this illustrative analysis helps you\nsee the difficulties of forecasting inflation in real time.\nAnother lesson to be learned from this experience is that the feared harsh tradeoff\nbetween unemployment and inflation, one that requires large costs in terms of job loss\nand reduction in incomes in order to reduce inflation, did not materialize in the years\nimmediately after the 2022 inflation peak. Inflation has been significantly reduced while\nthe labor market has remained solid. This is a historically unusual, but most welcome,\noutcome. While this outcome is in part due to the actions of Fed policymakers, it is also\npossible to explain that remarkable result through the lens of the models that I have\npresented today. A large fraction of the rise in inflation, most specifically core goods\ninflation, can be explained by supply chain snarls. The untangling of supply chains\ncontributed to a decline in inflation with little cost in terms of unemployment. Likewise,\nlabor markets were very tight in this period. As workers returned to the labor force, labor\nmarkets became less tight, and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio declined. That\n\n- 17 -\ncorresponded with a subsequent decline in inflation. That is a consistent result because\nservices inflation is closely connected to the cost of labor.\nThank you for your time today. Once again, it is humbling to be asked to give the\nWhittington Lecture to honor the memory of fellow educator Leslie Whittington. I look\nforward to your questions.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Public Talk: Reflections on Recent Economic Developments,” cosponsored by\nthe Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies and\nthe Julis-Rabinowitz Center for Public Policy and Finance\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton, New Jersey\nApril 2, 2025\n\nThank you, Alan, and thank you to the Griswold and Julis-Rabinowitz Centers for\nthe opportunity to speak to you today.1 As someone who has worked in both the public\nsector and academia, I applaud the common purpose of both centers in connecting\nresearchers, policymakers, and the private sector to pursue policy ideas that serve the\npublic good.\nTo that end, I can think of few individuals who have done more—as a teacher,\nresearcher, government official, and public figure—than Alan Blinder. That includes\neducating the public about economic policymaking. In the spring of 2022, as many\nwondered whether Russia’s war on Ukraine would add to the factors then driving up\ninflation, Professor Blinder wrote in the Wall Street Journal that a more important factor\nwould probably be the public’s expectations of future inflation.2\nAs I will relate in these remarks, he was, of course, absolutely correct. As in the\npast, inflation expectations have played a crucial role in the course of inflation since the\nspring of 2022, and I expect they will be important in the Federal Reserve’s ongoing\neffort to achieve sustained inflation of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to focus on\ninflation expectations today, before discussing my outlook for the U.S. economy and the\nimplications for appropriate monetary policy. First, I will describe inflation expectations\nwithin the conceptual framework that many economists use to connect inflation to\nbroader economic activity, known as the Phillips curve. Second, I will discuss the central\nimportance of the stability of these expectations, which we have come to call the\n“anchoring” of inflation expectations. Third, I will explain how firms and households\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Alan S. Blinder (2022), “Wish the Fed Luck as It Seeks a Soft Landing on Inflation,” Wall Street\nJournal, April 6.\n\n- 2 -\nform their inflation expectations and how these expectations affect their economic\ndecisionmaking. Throughout, I will make some references to historical experiences with\ninflation but focus on the period since the pandemic.\nEconomists have long recognized the connection between inflation and overall\nmacroeconomic conditions, but it was in trying to explain this empirical relationship and\nmeasure it with some precision that the importance of inflation expectations was\nrevealed.\nThe foundation of this work was laid by New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, a\nfascinating figure who was, among other things, a mechanical genius who built an early\neconomic model operated by hydraulics rather than electronics. In contemplating the\nmechanics of the economy, in 1958 Phillips set about to explain why nominal wage\ngrowth was slower when unemployment was high and faster when unemployment was\nlow. His and other subsequent research showed that a crucial factor was the utilization of\nresources, such as labor and capital.3 Generally, when firms use labor and capital very\nintensively, production costs tend to rise, and firms have more scope to pass those cost\nincreases along in the form of higher prices for their products and services, which, in\nturn, may push up inflation across the economy. In contrast, when that level of utilization\nis low, costs tend to rise more slowly (or even fall), and firms have less scope for raising\nprices, thus pushing down inflation. This tradeoff has been called the Phillips curve.\nIn this simple form, this tradeoff implies that governments can achieve and\nmaintain very low unemployment only if they allow inflation to rise to a certain level. In\n3 For a literature review on the relationship between inflation and resource utilization, also called the slope\nof the Phillips curve, see Francesco Furlanetto and Antoine Lepetit (2024), “The Slope of the Phillips\nCurve,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2024-043 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, May), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2024043pap.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nthe latter 1960s, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps asserted that this orderly tradeoff\nwas only temporary and would ultimately break down because of the role of expectations\nand, in particular, inflation expectations.4 To use an example, while current production\ncosts are important to a factory owner setting prices, that owner will also consider future\nproduction costs, future levels of demand, and expectations for inflation throughout the\neconomy. Likewise, workers will factor expectations of future economic conditions into\ntheir pay demands, and banks will consider future inflation in deciding loan rates.\nConsumers, whose purchases constitute some two-thirds of economic activity, make\ndecisions about whether to purchase something today with an idea of what it will cost in\nthe future. All these decisions are influenced by expectations, and this is the way in\nwhich expectations may shape inflation now. In turn, when we think about the Phillips\ncurve and its tradeoff nowadays, we account for the important role of expectations of\ndifferent individuals throughout the economy.\nThere are different measures of inflation expectations, some from surveys polling\nbusiness owners, others asking consumers, and yet others estimating expectations among\nbond investors based on the differences in yields between nominal and inflation-indexed\nsecurities. While most of my points apply broadly to all measures of expectations, my\nexamples come mostly from surveys of consumers and businesses. While there are\nquestions, which I will address, about how well these surveys measure inflation\nexpectations, I closely monitor them because they complement market-based indicators\n4 See Milton Friedman (1968), “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, vol. 58\n(March), pp. 1–17; and Edmund S.

In these\ncases, adjustments in these terms are often benchmarked on past inflation, as, for\ninstance, when workers and landlords aim to recoup losses from increases in general\nprices. To cite one example, as the economy reopened after the pandemic, workers\nsought higher wages to compensate for the early wave of inflation in food and core\ngoods, thus further pushing up inflation, especially in the services sector, where labor\naccounts for the largest share of this sector’s costs.5 And, because rental agreements\ntypically last for 12 months or more, landlords faced a lag in adjusting rents to reflect the\nescalation of inflation after the pandemic and sought to recoup those losses when\nrenewing leases.\nBy looking at price changes this way, in a rearview mirror, some decisionmakers\nin the economy end up making inflation more persistent. That is important to me as an\neconomic policymaker who must pay attention to both expectations of future inflation\nand the persistence of current inflation.\nWhen we speak of expectations of future inflation, it is crucial to define the time\nhorizon, and different surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve and others ask about\ninflation from 1 year to as many as 10 years in the future. Surveys with a shorter horizon,\n5 For a discussion about the timing of the inflation waves of different categories, see Adriana D. Kugler\n(2025), “Navigating Inflation Waves: A Phillips Curve Perspective,” speech delivered at the Whittington\nLecture, McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University, Washington, February 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nsuch as the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers’ question on inflation 1 year\nahead, shown in figure 1, are heavily influenced by current inflation. Near-term inflation\nexpectations tend to be more volatile, moving up when, for example, energy prices\nincrease, or down when energy or some other volatile set of prices decreases. These\nexpectations are important because many economic decisions, such as major consumer\npurchases and hiring and investment for firms, focus on horizons of only a few years\nahead.\nBy contrast, inflation expectations over longer horizons, such as the Michigan\nsurvey’s question on inflation during the next 5 to 10 years (the red line in figure 1), say\nless about current conditions than about the trend for inflation for some time in the future.\nYou can think about these longer-term expectations as much less affected by the forces\nthat push inflation up or down in the short term, what economists call “shocks.” Longer-\nterm inflation expectations tend to be less volatile, affected less, for example, by what oil\nor food prices have done lately than by the stability of inflation over years or decades.\nI mention these different time horizons because they matter in my job as a central\nbanker. Expectations a year from now reflect short-term shocks to the economy, as well\nas ongoing efforts from monetary policymakers to bring the economy back to its longer-\nrun state. Thus, while short-term expectations may indicate whether inflation is expected\nto move toward its target, they are not the best gauge of monetary policy credibility.\nLonger-term inflation expectations, however, should be much less influenced by short-\nterm shocks to the economy, and a change in those expectations has implications for the\nFederal Reserve’s prospects for meeting its price-stability goal.\n\n- 6 -\nWhen these longer-term expectations are reasonably low and unresponsive to\nshorter-term developments, we say they are “anchored.” It is not clear who first defined\nthe term, but Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2007 gave a speech on inflation\nexpectations in which he described “anchored” expectations as “relatively insensitive to\nincoming data.”6\nSo how should we think about the process of anchoring and de-anchoring of\ninflation expectations? The dynamics of short- and long-term inflation expectations shed\nlight on this issue. If the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their shorter-\nrun expectations, they will revise up these shorter-term expectations to ensure that their\nnear-term plans account for the change in the economic environment. That’s what\nhappened after the pandemic, when inflation based on personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) rose to a peak of 7.2 percent and one-year expectations rose to more\nthan 5 percent. But longer-term inflation expectations remained anchored, with values\nwithin the range seen since 1995. I would contrast this experience with the United\nStates’ previous bout of high inflation from the 1970s to the early 1980s. Among other\nissues, such as high energy prices and accommodative monetary policy, rising inflation\nand inflation expectations fed a cycle of escalating inflationary pressures.7 Inflation was\nhigh and very volatile over this period, and that is reflected in shorter and longer-term\ninflation expectations that were high and volatile, too.\n6 See Ben S. Bernanke (2007), “Inflation Expectations and Inflation Forecasting,” speech delivered at the\nMonetary Economics Workshop of the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute,\nCambridge, Mass., July 10, quoted text in paragraph 7,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070710a.htm.\n7 For evidence on how longer-run inflation expectations may be driven by short-run inflation surprises, see\nCarlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusepi, Emanuel Moench, and Bruce Preston (2023), “Anchored Inflation\nExpectations,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 15 (January), pp. 1–47.\n\n- 7 -\nAnother important difference between these two episodes has to do with the\nperformance of the Federal Reserve. As opposed to the late 1960s and most of the 1970s,\nmost recently the Fed acted aggressively to tighten monetary policy, raising the federal\nfunds rate more rapidly than in previous tightenings and lowering inflation more quickly\nthan ever before. This came after 30 years of success in keeping inflation in check, and\nthe credibility earned by the Fed’s inflation discipline surely helped keep longer-term\nexpectations stable. This shows that an important role of the central bank is to convince\nthe public, through actions and communications, about its intention to shape economic\nconditions and to use its policy tools to bring inflation to its target.8 By committing to\nkeep inflation low in the future, central banks seek to influence expectations of future\ninflation, which, in turn, influence conditions now and over time. The Fed’s credibility in\nkeeping inflation low and stable, won over decades, kept longer-term inflation\nexpectations stable, and that contributed significantly to the Fed’s success in reducing\ninflation while keeping the labor market strong.\nThose are some of the basics about inflation expectations and how they influence\nthe economy and the conduct of monetary policy. Next, I want to note some of the\npatterns we see in survey measures of inflation expectations, what influences\nexpectations, and how inflation expectations are used by the public in their\ndecisionmaking. Fortunately, there is a rich body of economic research that has shed\n8 For a survey on how central banks communicate with the general public and the effectiveness of such\ncommunications, see Alan S. Blinder, Michael Ehrmann, Jakob de Haan, and David-Jan Jansen (2024),\n“Central Bank Communication with the General Public: Promise or False Hope?” Journal of Economic\nLiterature, vol. 62 (June), pp. 425–57.\n\n- 8 -\nlight on these questions, and I will focus on the evidence for households and firms.9 We\ncan then take some lessons from these empirical patterns for monetary policymaking.\nOne important observation is that both short- and long-term inflation expectations\nare often notably higher than actual inflation, even after a period of very low inflation.\nThere is evidence that survey respondents often believe the inflation they have\nexperienced is higher than it is. Another pattern is that there is a wide dispersion of\nviews about both shorter and longer-term inflation expectations, reflecting, at least in\npart, the dispersion of inflation in the consumer baskets of goods and services purchased\nby different people. Research also finds that some groups, such as women and lower-\nincome households, tend to have systematically higher inflation expectations. In addition\nto this variation in expectations, there is high uncertainty in forecasts of future inflation.\nWhen people are asked to assign probabilities to different forecasts for inflation, surveys\nreport wide distributions in the likelihood of one outcome or another. Finally, short-term\ninflation expectations tend to be correlated with both recently realized inflation and\nperceptions about recent inflation.10\nThese patterns tell policymakers that inflation expectations of households and\nfirms are diffuse and likely harder to influence through monetary policy relative to\nfinancial market participants and professional forecasters who follow the news more\nclosely. Still, expectations from business owners and workers ultimately inform firms’\npricing decisions and costs and, thus, may even be more relevant for inflation outcomes;\n9 For a literature review on this topic, see Michael Weber, Francesco D’Acunto, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and\nOlivier Coibion (2022), “The Subjective Inflation Expectations of Households and Firms: Measurement,\nDeterminants, and Implications,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 36 (Summer), pp. 157–84.\n10 See David Lebow and Ekaterina Peneva (2024), “Inflation Perceptions during the Covid Pandemic and\nRecovery,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January 19),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/inflation-perceptions-during-the-covid-pandemic-\nand-recovery-20240119.html.\n\n- 9 -\ntherefore, it is important for policymakers to communicate clearly with the public our\nintentions to bring inflation back to our target.11\nSo, because inflation expectations are diffuse and heavily influenced by recent\nexperience, let’s consider the reasons for the dispersion in these expectations.\nUnsurprisingly, it starts with the considerable variation in the sources that the public uses\nto collect information about inflation. Households report that their main source of\ninformation is their own shopping experiences, making regular purchases such as\ngroceries and gasoline, and the price changes in those goods and services are what affect\ninflation expectations the most.12 Also, it seems that inflation expectations of\nhomeowners tend to respond to changes in mortgage rates because homeowners have\nmore of an incentive to track changes in rates that might affect, for example, their\nprospects for loan refinancing.13 Another important source of information is energy bills,\nwith evidence also pointing to households’ inflation expectations being more sensitive to\nenergy prices when inflation is higher.14 More generally, consumers and firms seem to\npay more attention to news related to inflation when inflation is high, and this has been\nfound for many countries.15\n11 See Ricardo Reis (2023), “Four Mistakes in the Use of Measures of Expected Inflation,” AEA Papers\nand Proceedings, vol. 113 (May), pp. 47–51.\n12 See Francesco D’Acunto, Ulrike Malmendier, Juan Ospina, and Michael Weber (2021), “Exposure to\nGrocery Prices and Inflation Expectations,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 129 (May), pp. 1615–39.\n13 See Hie Joo Ahn, Shihan Xie, and Choongryul Yang (2024). “Effects of Monetary Policy on Household\nExpectations: The Role of Homeownership,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 147 (October), 103599.\n14 See Francesco D’Acunto and Michael Weber (2024), “Why Survey-Based Subjective Expectations Are\nMeaningful and Important,” Annual Review of Economics, vol. 16 (August), pp. 329–57. For evidence on\nthe higher sensitivity of inflation expectations when inflation is higher, see Paula Patzelt and Ricardo Reis\n(2024), “Estimating the Rise in Expected Inflation from Higher Energy Prices,” CEPR Discussion Paper\n18907 (Paris: Centre for Economic Policy Research, March), https://cepr.org/publications/dp18907.\n15 See, for instance, Anat Bracha and Jenny Tang (2024), “Inflation Levels and (In)Attention,” Review of\nEconomic Studies; and Michael Weber, Bernardo Candia, Hassan Afrouzi, Tiziano Ropele, Rodrigo\nLluberas, Serafin Frache, Brent Meyer, Saten Kumar, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Dimitris Georgarakos, Olivier\nCoibion, Geoff Kenny, and Jorge Ponce (2025), “Tell Me Something I Don’t Already Know: Learning in\nLow‐ and High‐Inflation Settings,” Econometrica, vol. 93 (January), pp. 229–64.\n\n- 10 -\nWhile the unique experiences of survey respondents matter, this evidence points\nto inflation expectations being dependent on the state of the economy. Thus, we\npolicymakers should account for different economic conditions when assessing the risks\nof a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. For instance, with fresh memories of the\npost-pandemic inflation and with recent surges in prices of some food items regularly\npurchased, inflation expectations of workers and firms may now be more sensitive to\nanticipated future price increases relative to the pre-pandemic period.\nLet me now turn to how households and businesses employ their inflation\nexpectations in their economic decisionmaking, with much of the evidence consistent\nwith what one would expect based on long-standing economic theory. Starting with\nhouseholds, in addition to any influence on wages from past inflation, expectations of\nfuture inflation help shape demands for pay raises. Workers care about their inflation-\nadjusted wages, rather than nominal wages, and (as shown in figure 2) we see a positive\ncorrelation between inflation expectations from consumers and wage growth, with a close\nco-movement during the recent inflationary bout. A complementary decision for the\nworker is to look for a new job that pays more, especially if the person envisions a low\nprobability of getting a raise in the current job or if the raise will likely not fully cover\nlosses in real incomes from inflation. Indeed, measures of general wage growth are more\nsluggish relative to those of job switchers. Moreover, researchers also find evidence of\nhigher job-to-job transitions for workers who have higher inflation expectations.16 So\n16 See Ina Hajdini, Edward S. Knotek II, John Leer, Mathieu Pedemonte, Robert W. Rich, and Raphael S.\nSchoenle (2022), “Low Passthrough from Inflation Expectations to Income Growth Expectations: Why\nPeople Dislike Inflation,” Working Paper Series 22-21 (Cleveland: Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\nJune), https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/working-paper/2022/wp-2221-low-passthrough-from-\ninflation-expectations-to-income; and Laura Pilossoph and Jane M. Ryngaert (2024), “Job Search, Wages,\nand Inflation,” NBER Working Paper Series 33042 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, October), https://www.nber.org/papers/w33042.\n\n- 11 -\ninflation expectations of workers are an important influence on nominal wage growth and\nan important indicator of inflationary pressures for us policymakers.\nNow let’s consider how these expectations influence firms’ decisions. As I\ndiscussed in the context of the Phillips curve, firms with higher inflation expectations\nwould be expected to increase prices more, and, indeed, researchers find causal evidence\nfor this.17 During the recent period of high inflation, the fact that business owners’ short-\nterm expectations about costs or input prices rose only modestly and soon returned to\nlevels close to 2 percent just suggests that firms’ inflation expectations were not a strong\nsource of inflationary pressures (as seen in figure 3). Still, researchers at the Richmond\nFed also found that during this period, business leaders incorporated more information\nabout aggregate inflation measures in their own pricing decisions compared with times\nbefore the pandemic inflation surge.18 While researchers also find that business leaders\npaid less attention to inflation as it came down, this evidence points to the inflation\nexpectations of businesses being sensitive to underlying inflationary dynamics, and\nmonetary policymakers should remain attentive to this.\nNow let me turn to the recent developments in inflation expectations, the current\nU.S. economic outlook, and the implications for monetary policy.\nIn recent months, we have seen several measures of inflation expectations\nincrease, with both consumers and businesses reporting new and proposed tariffs as an\nimportant reason. Among surveys looking one year ahead, there have been notable\n17 For the relationship between inflation expectations and pricing decisions, see Olivier Coibion, Yuriy\nGorodnichenko, and Tiziano Ropele (2020), “Inflation Expectations and Firm Decisions: New Causal\nEvidence,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 135 (February), pp. 165–219.\n18 For evidence on the recent inflationary episode, see Felipe F. Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath\nWaddell (2024), “Inflation Expectations and Price Setting among Fifth District Firms,” Economic Brief\n24-03 (Richmond: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, January),\nhttps://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-03.\n\n- 12 -\nincreases for surveys by the University of Michigan, the Conference Board survey of\nconsumers, the Atlanta Fed’s survey of businesses, the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of\nProfessional Forecasters, and the New York Fed’s consumer survey. For instance, last\nFriday’s release of longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey was the\nhighest since February 1993. Additionally, the recent spike in short-term inflation\nexpectations appears to be mostly “anticipatory,” as one can infer from the divergence\nbetween falling inflation perceptions—what consumers think price increases have been in\nthe past year—and climbing short-run inflation expectations, both data from the\nMichigan survey. This anticipatory nature of the recent increase in short-run\nexpectations may allow for price pressures through a second channel: Businesses may\nfeel a greater ability to pass along higher costs to consumers when they come from\nexternal factors out of the control of these businesses. Indeed, firms are already reporting\nnot only higher costs, but also expectations of higher costs, according to some surveys,\nsuch as the one conducted by the Atlanta Fed, along with other manufacturing surveys.\nFor now, I take some comfort from the much smaller increases in longer-term\nexpectations as measured by the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters,\nas well as the stability of longer-term measures of what we call inflation compensation,\nwhich is based on yields from nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities.\nAs in past episodes when inflation expectations increased, uncertainty about\nfuture inflation seems to have also gone up, as measured by the disagreement between the\n75th and 25th percentiles of the distribution of individual respondents to the Michigan\nsurvey. Simultaneously, in recent months, we have also seen measures of economic\npolicy uncertainty increase (seen in figure 4), and there is evidence that policy\n\n- 13 -\nuncertainty and inflation uncertainty correlate over time.19 One possibility is that policy\nuncertainty may be contributing to a rise in inflation expectations as well as to\nuncertainty about future inflation. Still, it is hard to say at this point, and I will keep\nmonitoring these developments.\nLet me turn from developments on expected inflation to realized inflation. After\nthe substantial decline in inflation from its peak in 2022, recent disinflation has been\nslower, and the latest data indicate that progress toward the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) 2 percent goal may have stalled. Core PCE inflation was 2.8\npercent in the 12 months ended in February, which puts us back at the same level seen in\nthe last quarter of 2024. The best news for February comes from housing services\ninflation, which has come down steadily for at least a year to a 12-month rate of 4.3\npercent, even if it is still above the pre-pandemic level of 2.5 percent. For the rest of the\ninflation categories, the news was less positive. Core goods inflation, which had been\nnegative for a large share of 2024, increased to 0.4 percent relative to a year before.\nFebruary likely also marked an upward shift in market-based services inflation. While I\ndo not discount price pressures in nonmarket services, which remain elevated, the\nacceleration in market-based services in February from an estimated 3.1 percent to 3.5\npercent is also not welcome, given that this category often provides a better signal of\ninflationary pressures across all services.\n19 For evidence on how policy uncertainty and inflation uncertainty correlate over time, see Carola C.\nBinder (2017), “Measuring Uncertainty Based on Rounding: New Method and Application to Inflation\nExpectations,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 90 (October), pp. 1–12.

Davis (2016), “Measuring\nEconomic Policy Uncertainty,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 131 (November), pp. 1593–1636.\nThe measure of trade policy uncertainty is from Dario Caldara, Matteo Iacoviello, Patrick Molligo, Andrea\nPrestipino, and Andrea Raffo (2020), “The Economic Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty,” Journal of\nMonetary Economics, vol. 109 (January), pp. 38–59.\n\n- 14 -\nOn the other side of the FOMC’s dual mandate, employment continues to grow at\na moderate pace, and the overall labor market has remained resilient through February.\nThe net 151,000 jobs added last month was not too far from the 177,000 average of the\nprevious six months. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1 percent, and labor force\nparticipation moved down to 62.4 percent. Other labor market indicators suggest\ncontinued moderation in the labor market but not significant weakening.\nGiven the recent lack of progress on inflation, recent increases in inflation\nexpectations, and upside risks associated with announced and prospective policy changes,\nI strongly supported the FOMC’s decision at our March meeting to maintain the target\nrange for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. I will support maintaining the\ncurrent policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic\nactivity and employment remain stable. Going forward, I will carefully assess incoming\ndata, the evolving outlook, and changes in the balance of risks.\nThank you.\n\nInflation Expectations and\nMonetary Policymaking\nAdriana D.

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nDetroit Economic Club\nDetroit, Michigan\nDecember 3, 2024\n\nThank you, Jason, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here in Detroit\ntoday.1 This visit has allowed me to see the many encouraging signs in this region:\ngrowth here in downtown; the area’s famously hard-working labor force; and the gritty\nDetroit Lions, with 11 wins this season and counting. The nation has taken notice. But,\ntruly, one of my favorite parts of serving as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board is\nvisiting communities across the country and hearing directly from the families, workers,\nand businesses we serve.\nI am also glad to have the chance to speak with you near the end of the year. I\nthink it is an appropriate time to look back and assess how the U.S. economy has\ndeveloped over the course of 2024. I will also share with you my outlook and offer my\nviews on U.S. monetary policy.\nI will start by saying that I view the economy as being in a good position after\nmaking significant progress in recent years toward our dual-mandate goals of maximum\nemployment and stable prices. The labor market remains solid, and inflation appears to\nbe on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal, even if there have been some bumps along\nthe way, as I will discuss later.\nReaching this point for the economy was far from assured, especially if you\nreflect on the pandemic disruptions of nearly five years ago. Even the more recent\nperformance of the economy, at least on the surface, has been surprising to many\nforecasters. Economic growth remained solid, while inflation moderated from its recent\npeak without the painful job losses that have often accompanied past efforts to counter\nhigh inflation.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nHeading into this year, that was not necessarily the forecast of many observers,\nwho were expecting a notable deceleration of economic activity. For example, the Blue\nChip Economic Indicators in December 2023 expected 1.3 percent GDP growth for all of\n2024. More recent estimates show the economy is on track to grow at almost twice that\nrate this year.2\nSo how does one interpret these positive, if somewhat unexpected, results? For\nme, I turned to looking at not just the realities around me and listening to people around\nthe country, but also to my background as an academic researcher who uses an evidence-\nbased approach to recognize two very important developments that have shaped the\neconomy this year: growth in the labor force stemming from an increase in immigration,\nand a surge in productivity. I have been closely monitoring these developments and\ndiscussing them for more than a year.\nAssessing the Economy Entering 2024\nEntering this year, I took notice of several peculiar puzzles that seemed to be\nplaying out in the economy. In terms of overall growth, I noticed a significant\ndivergence between two important measures of output: gross domestic product, or GDP,\nand gross domestic income, or GDI. While, over time, these two gauges should move\ntogether, they appeared to be out of sync heading into this year. The GDI data suggested\nrather anemic growth, averaging about 1 percent a quarter in 2023, contrary to very\nstrong GDP readings of more than 2.5 percent. The two measures of output had\ncontrasting implications for productivity growth.\n2 See Wolters Kluwer (2023), Blue Chip Economic Indicators, vol. 48 (December 8).\n\n- 3 -\nThere was a second puzzle in the labor market. Many forecasters expected that\nthe labor market would remain somewhat tight this year, as rebalancing in the labor\nmarket had already attracted a large fraction of the available working-age population:\nThe labor force participation of prime-age workers had reached levels not seen since the\nlate 1990s. However, upon closer examination, I saw a more mixed picture.\nOn the one hand, payroll gains, while slowing, were still averaging a very robust\npace of more than 200,000 jobs per month. Data from that time suggest that workers\nwere easily able to find jobs, and measures of layoffs were low by historical standards.\nIn fact, in certain industries, such as health care as well as leisure and hospitality,\nemployment had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That raised questions about\nwhether the supply of workers for those fields could keep pace with demand.\nBut, on the other hand, the unemployment rate was flat instead of declining. This\nwas puzzling considering a robust pace of payroll gains and the assumption that labor\nsupply was constrained. And the two most important labor market surveys sent\nsomewhat divergent signals. The payroll survey of employers showed hiring was\nabnormally above the gain recorded by the survey of households. Was the economy\nexpanding at a robust pace, as indicated by the payroll survey? Or was it slowing more,\nas suggested by the household survey?\nIn considering these questions, I interpreted the strong pace of payrolls from the\nestablishment survey and the cooling of various measures of resource utilization as a\nsignal that perhaps the official population estimates were understated to the downside.\nStarting at the end of 2023, I asked, what if substantial increases in the labor force due to\n\n- 4 -\nthe arrival of workers from other countries had not yet been picked up in Census\nestimates?\nWe had seen something similar before. In the late 1990s, official measures of the\npopulation were substantially revised up due to mismeasured immigration. During this\nperiod, establishment and household counts of workers also significantly diverged.\nAnd a third puzzle, with inflation, also warrants attention. Inflation had steadily\nprogressed toward the FOMC’s target during 2023, perhaps faster than some economists\nexpected. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index eased from a peak\nof 7.2 percent in June 2022 to about 3 percent at the end of 2023, measured on a 12-\nmonth basis. When excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation similarly\neased from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022 to 3 percent at the end of last year.\nWage growth measures were consistent with inflation declining.\nEconomic Developments This Year\nAt the turn of the new year, new data and other economic developments appeared\nto cloud the picture further. An uptick in consumer spending and overall economic\nactivity in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as a stretch of above-trend hiring gave a\nsignal of unexpected strength to start the year. Adding to the puzzling figures, core\ninflation rose 0.5 percent in January, a notable acceleration from an average monthly\nincrease of 0.15 percent in the previous quarter. Stronger-than-expected economic\nactivity, faster hiring, and a reacceleration of prices gave some economists pause: Was\nthis a temporary acceleration, or a more sustained reheating of the economy? I viewed it\nas likely temporary, as it turned out to be.\n\n- 5 -\nMy view has always been that progress in the fight against inflation has to be\njudged from trends, not from a data release or two. I also anticipated that the process of\nbringing down inflation was likely to be sometimes bumpy. However, I viewed the\nelevated inflation readings as partly stemming from seasonal and one-off factors not fully\naccounted for in the data. In addition, price changes in some categories are difficult to\nmeasure, as I have described in previous speeches.3 That is particularly true for certain\nservices categories for which direct sources of prices are not available; for example, the\ncost of living in an owner-occupied home or costs associated with certain financial\ntransactions. And, as I have also discussed, the slow adjustment in workers’ wages and\nrelative prices may have contributed to bumps on the road to disinflation. Indeed, by the\nsecond quarter of the year, it became clear that the earlier firmer inflation figures were\nindeed temporary. Inflation stepped back down to average monthly increases of less than\n0.2 percent. A factor in that was a cooling labor market, which I will discuss in a\nmoment. With the labor market less tight, wage growth leveled off, and that in turn\nallowed prices for labor-intensive services to moderate.\nThere was another important development early this year: Estimates of\npopulation growth were revised substantially higher, according to a Congressional\nBudget Office report.4 The report showed about 6 million additional immigrants than\nwere included in official estimates. Those workers added to the supply of labor, which\n3 See Adriana D. Kugler (2024), “The Challenges Facing Economic Measurement and Creative Solutions,”\nspeech delivered at the 21st Annual Economic Measurement Seminar, National Association for Business\nEconomics Foundation, Washington, July 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm.\n4 See Congressional Budget Office (2024), The Demographic Outlook: 2024 to 2025 (Washington: CBO,\nJanuary), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59697.\n\n- 6 -\nhad rebounded early in the pandemic recovery at a time when the unemployment rate was\ntrending near half-century lows.\nThat information was consistent with my hypothesis that the strength in the\neconomy was in part due to a larger-than-estimated labor force, or what economists call a\npositive supply shock. You may be more familiar with negative shocks, like the\npandemic causing constrained supply chains. But the increase of workers was a positive\nshock and is notable because the underlying demographics of the U.S. heading into the\npandemic were consistent with a slow-growing population and lower labor force\nparticipation, and that dynamic got worse as the pandemic generated excess retirements\nand a fall in immigration.\nIn terms of the labor market, I anticipated that after several months of strong job\ngrowth at the turn of the year, the labor market would cool significantly. And, indeed, by\nthe middle of this year, the process of the labor market normalizing was taking shape.\nPayroll gains declined from an average pace of 260,000 in the first quarter to less than\n200,000 in the second. Reports on the labor market included unusually large downward\nrevisions to previous gains, and the unemployment rate moved higher, from 3.7 percent\nin January to 4.1 percent in June. At this point, other economists quickly shifted from\nworrying about a labor market that might be too hot early in the year to one that might be\ncooling too quickly. As a Fed policymaker, I had to consider if this movement was\nconsistent with our mandate for maximum employment.\nEven with the easing in the labor market, consumer spending and overall\neconomic activity continued to show solid growth. The combination of strong spending\ndata and a cooling labor market was confounding. In thinking about this, I examined the\n\n- 7 -\nproductivity data that I follow closely and did not see the type of productivity growth I\nwould have expected based on several other observations of the economy.\nFor example, new business formation had surged in the post-pandemic period. It\nhas been shown that newer firms foster innovation and boost productivity growth.\nBusiness formation has remained elevated, from which I infer that the boost to\nproductivity growth is not just a one-time phenomenon. Also, in the post-pandemic\nperiod, workers switched jobs at much higher rates than typical. This likely led to better\nmatches where workers can find more productive uses of their skills. In some cases,\nimmigrants filled job openings for which employers traditionally struggle to attract\nworkers. Therefore, immigration can also contribute to improvements in job matches in\nspecific but key sectors. As the economy reopened from the pandemic, many firms also\ninvested in technology to substitute for workers, who were in short supply, which should\nsupport productivity gains. Emerging technologies, most notably artificial intelligence,\nmay also be starting to contribute to enhanced productivity.\nTherefore, my speculation was that higher productivity was a possible explanation\nfor the unusual combination of strong economic output, a cooling labor market, and\ndeclining inflation—even if it was not apparent in the quarterly data.\nThat hunch was confirmed in September, when annual revisions to important\neconomic data showed that economic activity and productivity growth had been stronger\nthan previously estimated. The new figures indicated an average annual rate of\nproductivity growth of 1.9 percent since 2020, notably higher than the approximate\n1.4 percent annual rate in the five years before the pandemic. So that reveals our second\npositive shock: American workers have been more productive in recent years. This is a\n\n- 8 -\nhugely important development because it increases the productive capacity of the\neconomy and allows more rapid economic growth without overheating. What’s more,\nrevisions resulted in much better aligned GDP and GDI measures, and the two measures\nnow also had much more aligned implications for productivity.\nIn summary, the surprising and largely desirable outcomes for the economy in\n2024 are easier to understand once we solve the puzzles I discussed. My thorough\nassessment of a wide range of data sources revealed that an unusual combination of\nreports over the past year were gradually resolved once we understood the two positive\nsupply shocks I discussed: growth in the labor force due to an increase in immigration,\nand higher productivity growth.\nEconomic Outlook\nThe data we have received in recent weeks have been consistent with the\neconomic forces I described earlier. Real GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in\nthe third quarter. The latest readings of retail sales have been strong. If household\ndemand remains resilient, that would support growth in the fourth quarter and into next\nyear.\nMonthly payroll gains have eased from earlier in the year, consistent with a\ngradual cooling of the labor market. It was difficult to draw a clear signal from the most\nrecent jobs report, due to significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes. I look\nforward to reviewing additional labor data on Friday. The unemployment rate, at\n4.1 percent in October, is near the level I judge as roughly consistent with our maximum-\nemployment mandate. After rising earlier this year, the rate has stabilized, though this\n\n- 9 -\nwas partly due to some withdrawals from the labor force. That bears watching moving\nforward.\nThe trend in immigration slowed in the second half of this year, and there is\nreason to expect immigration flows could further slow. I will closely monitor this data.\nInflation readings released last week show that overall PCE prices rose\n2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE prices increased\n2.8 percent. I still view those readings, as of now, as consistent with inflation on a path\nto return to our 2 percent goal, and I am encouraged that inflation expectations appear to\nremain well anchored. But they also show the job is not yet done. Housing services\ninflation, in particular, remains elevated. And while global inputs to inflation have been\nmostly modest in recent months, it is difficult to predict future pressures.\nI have observed that the trade policy uncertainty index has risen in recent months,\nlikely reflecting risks of changes in trade policy.5 Of course, the incoming\nAdministration and Congress have not enacted any policies yet, so it is too early to make\njudgements. Studying the specifics, when they come out, will be important, as trade\npolicy may affect productivity and prices. I will make assessments about what the net\neffects of any policy changes will be on prices or employment and how the balance\nbetween the two legs of our mandate will be affected.\nOutlook for Monetary Policy\nGiven how the economy has developed this year, most notably the continuation of\ndisinflation and a modest cooling in the labor market, I see the Fed’s dual-mandate goals\n5 See Dario Caldara, Matteo Iacoviello, Patrick Molligo, Andrea Prestipino, and Andrea Raffo (2020), “The\nEconomic Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 109 (January), pp.\n38–59.\n\n- 10 -\nof maximum employment and price stability as being roughly in balance. In light of the\nprogress toward our goals, my colleagues and I on the FOMC judged it appropriate to\nlower our policy rate in September and again last month. These actions were steps\ntoward removing restraint, as we are in the process of moving policy toward a more\nneutral setting.\nLooking ahead, it is important to emphasize that policy is not on a preset course.\nI will make decisions meeting by meeting and carefully assess incoming data, the\nevolving outlook, and the balance of risks. While I have gained more confidence that the\ntwo positive supply shocks I described have helped create the solid economic conditions\nthat are currently in place, I will vigilantly monitor for incoming risks or negative supply\nshocks that may undo the progress that we have achieved in reducing inflation. I view\nour current policy setting as well positioned to deal with any uncertainties we face in\npursuing both sides of our dual mandate.\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFed Listens event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nSchenectady, New York\nJune 23, 2025\n\nThank you, President Williams. And thank you to everyone who took the time to\njoin us here today to offer your feedback.1\nIt is my pleasure to be here in Albany, a region of the country that has been so\ncritical to the growth of our nation’s economy. One of the aspects I enjoy most about my\njob is having the opportunity to visit every region of the country and see how the\neconomy is unfolding on the ground. I am happy to be able to do that again today.\nThe purpose of this Fed Listens event, specifically, is to receive your input as part\nof the public review of our long-run goals and strategy for monetary policy. We call this\ndocument our framework.2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last reviewed\nthis important document in 2019–2020. At that time Committee members decided it was\nappropriate to complete a similar review every five years. The 2025 review consists of\nthree elements: a research conference, discussions and deliberations at our policy\nmeetings, and, very importantly, Fed Listens events such as this. As Chair Powell said\nlast month, in this review we are reconsidering aspects of our strategic framework in light\nof the experience of the last five years. I anticipate that consideration of changes to the\nframework, based on the information and perspectives gathered during this review, will\nbe complete in coming months. As part of this process, I am paying particular attention\nto what we have learned about the economy in the past five years, and the way changes\nmade in the last framework review were interpreted by the public. The Committee will\nalso consider possible enhancements to the FOMC’s policy communication tools.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For more information, see the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-\ncommunications-2025.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nBut, of course, I enjoy hearing from the public on a regular basis, not just as part\nof our framework review. Obtaining that on-the-ground insight is an essential ingredient\nto my approach in making policy. As a Fed policymaker, who is also an academic\neconomist, I am always analyzing data to better understand how the economy is\ndeveloping. However, I feel strongly that it is best to add to that technical training by\nhearing from people across the country, people like you. I am proud to say that I have\nvisited nearly every Fed District during my relatively short time on the Board, and I have\nplans to see the remaining Districts in the near future. It is important to hear from\nAmericans for whom we make policy. I want to listen to the perspective of families\nconsidering significant purchases and employment decisions. I want to hear from\nbusiness owners about investment and hiring plans. I want local leaders to tell me about\nhow their communities are faring. This information matters greatly to me as a\npolicymaker. I thank you for taking the time to share your stories.\nNow the primary purpose of this event is for me and President Williams to listen\nto you, so I will stop here, and look forward to hearing from all of you. Thank you again.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:30 p.m. EDT (3:30 p.m. CDT)\nApril 3, 2024\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nAdriana D. Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nWeidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy\nWashington University in St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nApril 3, 2024\n\nThank you, Andrew, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.1 I am\nvery pleased to be talking here at the Weidenbaum Center. As an economist currently\nworking on policy, but with a long trajectory in research, I particularly appreciate the\ncenter’s multidisciplinary approach to building bridges between these two applications of\neconomics.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been working to lower\ninflation in the context of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\nToday I will discuss economic developments in the U.S. and how I view the current\nstance of monetary policy in light of recent data and longer-run trends. Since I am an\neconomist, you will not be surprised that I will talk about recent economic developments\nby highlighting the dynamics of supply and demand.\nAs you all know, inflation began to rise in 2021. By mid-2022, 12-month\ninflation, based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was around\n7 percent—much too high and far above the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run objective. But\nsince that time, PCE inflation has slowed significantly, declining to 5.4 percent at the end\nof 2022, then to 2.6 percent at the end of 2023, and then to 2.5 percent in February.\nInflation can sometimes be hard to read from overall PCE inflation figures due to\nthe volatility of food and energy prices. For that reason, it is sometimes helpful to focus\non “core” PCE inflation, which excludes those categories and is a better guide to the\ndirection of inflation. Core PCE inflation peaked at a rate above 5-1/2 percent in early\n2022 but fell rapidly during 2023. In fact, the core PCE disinflation we saw last year was\nthe fastest since the early 1980s. The progress has sometimes been bumpy from month to\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nmonth, and, indeed, January and February of this year showed a bit of firming in the\ninflation data. But the January numbers, in particular, featured some atypical or seasonal\nfactors that suggest a need to withhold judgment. The 12-month core PCE rate now\nstands at 2.8 percent. That rate represents considerable progress, but it is still\nmeaningfully above the FOMC’s 2 percent target.\nI like to think about core PCE inflation in terms of three main components: goods,\nhousing services, and non-housing services. Twelve-month inflation for core goods\npeaked first, reaching about 7-1/2 percent in early 2022. But goods inflation cooled\nquickly, and in February goods prices were nearly half a percentage point below their\nlevel a year ago. Services inflation peaked later and has cooled less quickly. Within\nservices, housing services—a measure of the cost of rent, and the equivalent for owner-\noccupied housing—rose above 8 percent early last year but was 5.8 percent in February.\nHousing services inflation is naturally persistent because tenant rents often have year-\nlong lease agreements, and estimates of owner-occupied housing costs are imputed based\nin large part using those tenant rents. Data on new tenant rent agreements suggest that\nhousing inflation broadly will continue to cool. Finally, inflation in core non-housing\nservices hovered between 4-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent from mid-2021 through mid-2023 but\nbegan cooling after that, reaching 3.3 percent in February. Continued disinflation will\nindeed require further progress in housing and non-housing services.\nThe rise and subsequent easing of inflation in recent years were related to both\nsupply and demand factors. This development has been confirmed by granular, “bottom-\nup” statistical research looking at price and quantity changes within narrow product\ncategories. Roughly speaking, if a price goes up while quantity goes down, that is an\n\n- 3 -\nindication that a negative supply shock is dominating; if price and quantity move in the\nsame direction, that is an indication that a demand shock is dominating. Research using\nthis method finds that, for the economy broadly, demand shocks accounted for roughly\ntwo-thirds of the 2021 pickup in, and 2023 slowing of, core PCE inflation, with the\nremaining one-third related to supply. The role of supply is somewhat larger in a\nnarrower analysis focused on the domestic manufacturing sector.2 “Top-down” research\nlooking at aggregate time-series data also found significant contributions for both supply\nand demand factors.3\nLet me be a bit more concrete about this point by discussing supply and demand\nfor goods and services in turn. Supply in some goods-producing industries, like motor\nvehicles, was held down for some time by pandemic-related plant shutdowns, shortages,\nand transportation bottlenecks. And demand for goods surged during the pandemic when\nconsumers shied away from in-person services. Businesses frequently highlighted\nshortages of materials as having held down production during the period when supply\nwas tight and demand was strong. Those pressures have eased considerably (though\nperhaps not completely). Supply chains and production have largely recovered, and there\nare signs that goods demand growth since then has eased. For example, the share of\n2 For explaining core PCE inflation generally, see Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), “Decomposing Supply and\nDemand Driven Inflation,” Working Paper Series 2022-18 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco, October; revised February 2024), available at https://doi.org/10.24148/wp2022-18. With regard\nto the manufacturing sector specifically, recent work by the Federal Reserve Board staff focused on\nmanufacturing production and producer price indexes and used additional supply information from the\nCensus Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization. That research found a roughly 50–50 split\nbetween supply and demand. See Robin Braun, Aaron Flaaen, and Sinem Hacioglu Hoke (2024), “Supply\nvs Demand Factors Influencing Prices of Manufactured Goods,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, February 23),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/supply-vs-demand-factors-influencing-prices-of-\nmanufactured-goods-20240223.html.\n3 See Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S. Bernanke (2023), “What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era Inflation?”\nNBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, June),\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w31417.\n\n- 4 -\nconsumer spending devoted to goods rather than services has moved back closer to its\npre-pandemic trend after rising sharply in 2020.\nRegarding services, particularly non-housing services, the most important input to\nservices production tends to be labor.4 For that reason, it is useful to talk about supply\nand demand for labor. Labor supply was held down significantly in the early stages of\nthe pandemic as workers voluntarily and, in some cases, involuntarily stayed out of the\nworkforce. Older workers, in particular, left the labor force in a wave of early\nretirements, and, tragically, COVID-19 caused a rise in mortality. Additionally, many\nprime-age workers—those between the ages of 25 and 54—stayed out of the labor market\nfor a time, perhaps because of health concerns or family care challenges. And\nimmigration was relatively low during the pandemic.\nBut labor supply has been recovering. While most older individuals have not, as a\nwhole, returned to the labor force, many prime-age workers have. Prime-age women, in\nparticular, have significantly increased their labor force participation, which reached an\nall-time high last year and remains close to that all-time high. Moreover, the\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that net immigration increased to above 2-\n1/2 million in 2022 and 3-1/2 million in 2023. If the CBO analysis is correct, population\ngrowth has been a sizable contributor to overall labor force growth.\nA more subtle source of labor supply improvement has been improved quality of\nmatches between workers and firms—how well suited particular workers are, by talent,\nexperience, and preferences, to their employers. In the wake of, and until the end of, the\n4 For example, labor costs are more than 80 percent of value-added in education and health services and\nnearly 60 percent in leisure and hospitality services. See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2023), “Interactive\nData,” tables on composition of gross output by industry, December,\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&step=2&isuri=1&categories=gdpxind.\n\n- 5 -\npandemic, we saw a heightened pace of workers quitting their jobs and finding new ones,\na process that economists generally believe improves matches. Indeed, evidence suggests\nworkers and firms have been fairly efficient at finding each other over the past couple of\nyears.5 High-quality job matches act like additional labor supply: Both firms and\nworkers are likely to be more productive when workers’ skills and preferences are a good\nmatch for their employers’ needs.\nOn the demand side, labor demand was strong in 2021 and 2022. Demand was so\nstrong, in fact, that the job openings rate—that is, the monthly number of job openings\nrelative to total employment—ran almost 50 percent above its pre-pandemic record all\nthe way from July 2021 through July 2022.6\nBut the job openings rate has declined roughly 30 percent from its peak, a sign\nthat labor demand—while still robust—has cooled significantly. So the labor market has\nmoved into better balance.\nImportantly, given the strong labor supply growth, supply–demand imbalances\ncan continue to ease even amid a solid pace of net job growth, as we have been seeing.\nIndeed, I suspect that strong population growth helps resolve the puzzle that forecasters\nhave faced over the past year, in which measures of labor market growth—and growth of\n5 For example, one popular measure of “matching efficiency” shows an initial decline early in the pandemic\nbut a robust recovery to pre-pandemic levels. See Simon Mongey and Jeff Horwich (2023), “Are Job\nVacancies Still as Plentiful as They Appear? Implications for the ‘Soft Landing’ ” (Minneapolis, Minn.:\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, December 1), https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/are-job-\nvacancies-still-as-plentiful-as-they-appear-implications-for-the-soft-landing.\n6 The data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. The pre-\npandemic record job openings rate was 4.8 percent in late 2018 and early 2019. The rate averaged 7.1\npercent from July 2021 through July 2022. The absolute peak job openings rate was 7.4 percent in March\n2022.\n\n- 6 -\nother economic variables, like consumption—have been solid even amid easing\ninflation.7\nAs labor markets have moved into better balance, wage growth has cooled—\nwhich means that increases in the main cost business in the services sector have slowed,\neasing inflationary pressures. Workers and families do not reap the benefit of higher\nwages if those gains are eaten up by inflation. For that reason, it is important that wage\ngrowth be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. The U.S. economy is moving\nback toward that kind of wage growth, including in services industries: The 12-month\ngrowth of average hourly earnings in private services has come down to about 4 percent\nfrom a peak pace above 6 percent in early 2022. And despite the cooling of wage\ngrowth, with inflation easing over the past year, we have seen broader wage increases\nagain outpacing price gains, that is, real wage gains.\nBut you may ask: What role has the FOMC played in all of this? While supply\nconditions are beyond the control of monetary policymakers, the FOMC can influence\nthe pace of inflation by tightening monetary policy to slow the growth of aggregate\ndemand. The FOMC began raising its policy interest rate in early 2022 and proceeded\nexpeditiously. These actions have damped aggregate demand, with the most pronounced\neffects on interest rate–sensitive sectors. For example, in 2023, the level of residential\ninvestment was about 19 percent below its 2021 level, reflecting a much lower pace of\nhome purchases. And business investment in machines has seen somewhat tepid growth\n7 For an analysis of the implications of CBO population estimates for labor markets and consumer\nspending, see Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson (2024), “New Immigration Estimates Help Make Sense of\nthe Pace of Employment” (Washington: Hamilton Project, Brookings Institution, March 7), available at\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-immigration-estimates-help-make-sense-of-the-pace-of-\nemployment.\n\n- 7 -\nlately, even contracting a bit last year, though I note that the construction of new factories\nhas been surging, perhaps partly related to recent legislation, which will boost supply\nover the longer run. More broadly, financial conditions have been a drag on aggregate\ndemand, as suggested by the Federal Reserve Board’s FCI-G (Financial Conditions\nImpulse on Growth) index, which estimates the overall effect on gross domestic product\n(GDP) of changes in financial conditions, including interest rates, asset prices, and\nexchange rates. This measure moved well into restrictive territory in mid-2022 and\nremained quite restrictive for some time, though it has become less restrictive recently.\nIn addition to the direct actions taken to tighten monetary policy, the FOMC has\nalso helped cool inflation through its communication with the public. In particular, the\nFOMC’s stated commitment to bring inflation back to 2 percent, coupled with its actions\nto tighten policy, has helped ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain\nanchored—that is, that households and firms believe that inflation will return to the\nCommittee’s target. Anchored expectations are evident in surveys of consumers\nconducted by the University of Michigan and the New York Fed. Separately, a\nRichmond Fed survey shows a close relation between firms’ expectations of overall\ninflation and their own price-setting plans. As the effects of earlier supply and demand\nshocks fade, firms with anchored inflation expectations will bring their price-setting\ndecisions back into alignment with the FOMC’s inflation target. One way they might do\nso is by adjusting their prices less frequently. Before the pandemic, the typical price\nlasted more than 10 months, but by early 2022, it was lasting fewer than 5 months while\ninflation was near its recent peak. Since then, the frequency of price adjustments has\n\n- 8 -\nslowed considerably, and by the fourth quarter of last year, the typical price was lasting\nmore than 7 months.8\nLet me now turn to the outlook for this year. Given my thinking about the role of\nsupply and demand in recent inflation dynamics, as well as the role anchored inflation\nexpectations are playing in bringing price-setting behavior back to normal, I expect the\ndisinflationary trend to continue.\nThere is still a bit of room for further supply improvement, especially in the\nservices sector, where solid labor supply growth will continue to ease wage and inflation\npressures.\nOn the demand side, I expect consumption growth to slow some this year, as\nhouseholds have drawn down large balances of excess savings accumulated during the\npandemic and are facing restrictive financial conditions. We may already be seeing some\nof that slowing; consumer spending was soft in January and February, on average,\nsuggesting that we are on track for lower consumption growth in the first quarter than we\nsaw during the second half of last year.\nWith less support from consumers, I expect GDP growth this year to be solid but\nslower than last year’s strong 3.1 percent pace. Even with demand growth cooling, given\nthe backdrop of solid supply, my baseline expectation is that further disinflation can be\naccomplished without a significant rise in unemployment.\nThat said, the future is uncertain, and I am attentive to risks—both upside risks to\nmy inflation outlook and downside risks to the outlook for economic activity. For upside\n8 These facts are from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), “Price-Setting during the Covid Era,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/price-setting-during-the-covid-era-\n20230829.html. I thank the authors for providing me with updated data through 2023:Q4.\n\n- 9 -\nrisks, global developments such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East could spark an\nincrease in commodity prices or further disruptions to shipping networks. The tragic\nrecent bridge collapse in Baltimore and effects on the Port of Baltimore could also pose\nsome risk, though it appears that shipping networks are adapting. Additionally,\nconsumption growth could turn out to be stronger than expected, particularly because of\nthe wage gains we have seen across all income groups—but especially among the lowest\nearners who have an especially high propensity to spend out of their income.9 Indeed,\nconsumption was surprisingly strong last year and made solid contributions to GDP\ngrowth in the third and fourth quarters, though some of that strength may have been\nrelated to strong population growth which, more generally, was likely disinflationary.\nBut there are also downside risks to economic activity. Measures of consumer\ncredit delinquencies have been on the rise, which might point to a more significant\nslowing of consumer spending than expected. And labor markets can sometimes\ndeteriorate very quickly, without much warning in closely watched spending data. The\nFebruary employment report featured a rise in the unemployment rate, half of which was\naccounted for by layoffs. I study a range of layoff indicators, both in the official data and\nin measures based on information contained in publicly traded firms’ earnings reports or\nGoogle searches, and I will continue to watch a whole range of indicators closely.\n9 Since the pandemic, workers at the low end of the wage distribution have seen the strongest wage growth,\nwhich is apparent in the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker. For a discussion, see the recent Monetary\nPolicy Report: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024), Monetary Policy Report\n(Washington: Board of Governors, March),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/20240301_mprfullreport.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nFinally, let me briefly discuss monetary policy. As I have noted, policy is\ncurrently restrictive, and my baseline expectation is that disinflation will continue without\na broad economic slowdown—though such an outcome is not assured.\nIn considering the appropriate path of monetary policy, I am guided by the\nFOMC’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. After the March\nFOMC meeting, the Committee said that it “does not expect it will be appropriate to\nreduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving\nsustainably toward 2 percent.”10 After that meeting, we also published the Summary of\nEconomic Projections, which summarizes the forecasts of FOMC participants. Most\nFOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to begin lowering the federal funds\nrate sometime this year. My own expectation is consistent with that; if disinflation and\nlabor market conditions proceed as I am currently expecting, then some lowering of the\npolicy rate this year would be appropriate.\nHowever, I will remain attentive to the totality of the data and be prepared to\nchange my economic and policy outlook if conditions change.\n10 See the March 2024 FOMC statement, available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm (quoted text in paragraph 3).",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2025 Miami Economic Forum\nEconomic Club of Miami\nMiami, Florida\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\nThank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 It is\nsuch a pleasure to be back in Miami, a city I have seen grow and become ever more\ndynamic over the decades, as I have come many times to visit my large extended family\nhere ever since the 1980s.\nAs I discussed in my final speech of 2024, two positive supply shocks have\nsignificantly benefited the U.S. economy over the past two years and have also affected\nthe conduct of monetary policy.2\nThe first of these has been the surge in population over the past few years that has\nhelped bring labor supply into balance with labor demand and, thus, also helped move\ninflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent goal. The\nother positive supply shock, which I outlined in my remarks in December, has been a\nstep-up in aggregate productivity growth since 2020, which is an increase in the amount\nof economic output, across the economy, per hour worked or some other unit of labor.\nAlthough productivity growth, measured quarterly, can be quite volatile, over the past\nfive years this acceleration is quite evident. While productivity grew by about 1.5\npercent a year from 2005 to 2019, starting in 2020 it has grown about 2 percent a year.\nThis difference may not look dramatic, but because of compounding year-over-year, the\nconsequences of an additional 1/2 percentage point in growth over the past five years are\nsignificant for workers and the U.S. economy. When workers are more productive, it\neffectively means that businesses can produce more without needing to add workers, and\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Adriana D. Kugler (2024), “A Year in Review: A Tale of Two Supply Shocks,” speech delivered at\nthe Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, Michigan, December 3,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nthat they can pay workers more without needing to raise prices. When they are more\nproductive, it can also serve as an incentive for businesses to expand. Across the\neconomy, higher productivity growth means that real wages and living standards for\nworkers can rise faster without putting upward pressure on inflation.\nAnd that is exactly what has been happening recently, a period when inflation has\nbeen falling while the economy is expanding. While fast growth in wages was one of the\nfactors driving inflation in 2021 and 2022, most likely some of that increase was due to\nproductivity growth and, hence, was not inflationary. If productivity continues to grow at\nan accelerated pace, it would support the FOMC’s efforts to keep unemployment low and\nreturn inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to spend\nthe balance of my remarks exploring some of the possible reasons why productivity has\naccelerated, and the prospects that this fortunate development will continue.\nNumerous factors affect aggregate productivity, and several may have driven the\nincrease in productivity growth in the U.S. since the pandemic, in contrast to the subdued\nproductivity growth experienced by other advanced economies around the world.\nOne such factor may have been a result of the enormous movement of workers\ncaused by the pandemic. It began with the dramatic loss of 22 million jobs in the spring\nof 2020, the reemployment of many of those workers and the continued mobility as\npeople quit jobs, switched occupations and careers, and relocated in response to the\nenormous changes in work and home life brought about by the pandemic. In finding new\njobs, in what became a very tight labor market, workers had the opportunity to find better\nmatches for their skills and, to some extent, work that they were motivated to carry out\nand which made them more productive. One indication that this was probably a\n\n- 3 -\nsignificant factor in the U.S. is that other advanced economies where there was less\nworker movement have experienced lower rates of productivity growth.3 Economic data\nand research suggest that periods of strong job re-allocation are accompanied or followed\nby higher productivity growth.4\nThe tightness of the labor market since 2021 has also likely led firms to invest to a\ngreater extent in labor-saving as well as labor-enhancing technologies, which, of course,\nis traditionally one of the major sources of productivity gains. For example, many retail\nbusinesses seemed to have installed more self-checkout machines after the onset of the\npandemic, allowing employers to substitute capital for workers when workers could not\ncome to work in person and when there were severe shortages. More generally, digital\ntechnology allowed employees to continue working from home during the period of the\npandemic and beyond, saving commuting time and making employees potentially more\nproductive.5\nTo the extent that these factors are boosting productivity growth, they are by their\nnature one-off developments that eventually will fade. A notable exception may turn out\nto be productivity improvements from investments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI\ninvestment by businesses has stepped up in the past two years, and it appears to be\naccelerating.6 The advent of the internet and related innovations boosted productivity\n3 See Joaquin García-Cabo, Anna Lipińska, and Gaston Navarro (2023), “Sectoral Shocks, Reallocation,\nand Labor Market Policies,” European Economic Review, vol. 156 (July), 104494.\n4 See, for example, Lucia Foster, John Haltiwanger, and C.J. Krizan (2001), “Aggregate Productivity\nGrowth: Lessons from Microeconomic Evidence,” in Charles R. Hulten, Edwin R. Dean, and Michael J.\nHarper, eds., New Developments in Productivity Analysis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 303–\n63; and John Haltiwanger, Henry Hyatt, Erika McEntarfer, and Matthew Staiger (2025), “Cyclical Worker\nFlows: Cleansing vs. Sullying,” Review of Economic Dynamics, vol. 55 (January), 101252.\n5 See Myrto Oikonomou, Nicola Pierri, and Yannick Timmer (2023), “IT Shields: Technology Adoption\nand Economic Resilience during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” Labour Economics, vol. 81 (April), 102330.\n6 Estimates of current AI usage by firms vary widely, but uptake appears to be significant and rising.

And so are their effects on productivity as well.\nBut there is another important factor that is likely to be driving productivity higher whose\neffects may well persist, and that is the surge in new business formation experienced\nsince 2019. As I will explain, new businesses are associated with higher rates of overall\nproductivity growth, and that may be particularly true for some of the sectors in which\nthese businesses were created.\nApplications for new business tax identification numbers jumped shortly after the\npandemic began and have remained elevated since then.7 In 2024, the pace of\napplications that are likely to result in employer business formation was about 30 percent\nabove its 2019 pace. This surge is largely unique to the U.S. In the euro zone, for\nexample, business registrations have been relatively flat. This may help explain why\nlabor productivity growth in Europe has been well below that of the U.S. in recent years.8\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 5),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/measuring-ai-uptake-in-the-workplace-\n20240205.html.\n7 These data, which track applications to the Internal Revenue Service for new Employer Identification\nNumbers, are available from the Census Bureau’s Business Formation Statistics. I focus specifically on\n“high-propensity applications,” which are those applications deemed by the Census Bureau to be\nparticularly likely to result in the creation of new firms with formal employees.\n8 See Francois de Soyres, Joaquin Garcia-Cabo Herrero, Nils Goernemann, Sharon Jeon, Grace Lofstrom,\nand Dylan Moore (2024), “Why Is the U.S. GDP Recovering Faster Than Other Advanced Economies?”\nFEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 17),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/why-is-the-u-s-gdp-recovering-faster-than-other-\nadvanced-economies-20240517.html.\n\n- 5 -\nThe surge in applications in early 2020 was an early signal of an acceleration in\nthe creation of job-creating new firms.9 The latest data available indicate that new firms\ncreated 1.9 million jobs in 2023, 14 percent higher than the total for 2019.10\nA couple of aspects of this surge in business entry in the U.S. are noteworthy.\nFirst, the surge was particularly noticeable in high-tech industries that, historically, are\nimportant for overall innovation and productivity growth.11 Second, while the pace of\nbusiness applications has cooled somewhat over the past year, it still remains elevated\nand well above pre-pandemic norms. It is, in fact, proving somewhat more persistent\nthan some expected.\nFor these reasons, the surge in new business formation is highly relevant to our\ndiscussion about productivity. There is a large body of research that finds that new firms\nare key contributors to innovation and growth in aggregate productivity.12 This might\nseem surprising and counterintuitive, since it is well known that many new firms fail in\ntheir first year or two. But in the commotion of competition that these many new\n9 For extensive documentation and analysis of the pandemic business entry patterns, see Ryan A.

For the role of high-tech industries in aggregate\nproductivity growth, see John G. Fernald (2015), “Productivity and Potential Output before, during, and\nafter the Great Recession,” NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29, pp. 1–51.\n12 The relevant literature is vast. For example, see Marcela Eslava, John Haltiwanger, Adriana Kugler, and\nMaurice Kugler (2004), “The Effects of Structural Reforms on Productivity and Profitability Enhancing\nReallocation: Evidence from Colombia,” Journal of Development Economics, vol. 75 (December), pp.\n333–71; Titan Alon, David Berger, Robert Dent, and Benjamin Pugsley (2018), “Older and Slower: The\nStartup Deficit’s Lasting Effects on Productivity Growth,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 93\n(January), pp. 68–85; and Ryan Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda (2014), “The\nRole of Entrepreneurship in US Job Creation and Economic Dynamism,” Journal of Economic\nPerspectives, vol. 28 (Summer), pp. 3–24.\n\n- 6 -\nbusinesses face, there are always businesses that persist and keep their lights on, and\nthose often do so because they are innovative and more productive. New businesses are\nthe essence of the competition that drives market-based economies, and it is not\nsurprising that they would be an important source of new products or processes for doing\nbusiness—and a source of growth.13\nOf course, not every new firm has to innovate and grow to make important\neconomic contributions. Every entrepreneur contributes even if they just create a job for\nthemselves and their family members. But those new firms that do innovate and grow are\ncritical for improvements in overall productivity over time.\nAs I noted before, since the surge in entrepreneurship after the onset of the\npandemic featured an increase in high-tech businesses as well, the productivity\nimplications could be significant. Indeed, the last period of strong productivity growth in\nthe U.S., which ran from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, was preceded by a surge of\nnew business creation in high-tech industries, including those industries that more\nrecently have been associated with AI-related developments.14 So this is one source of\nmy optimism about continued robust productivity growth in the U.S.\nBut it is not only the innovations produced directly by new businesses that are\nimportant, since by any measure these new firms are a small share of total businesses.\nNew businesses also help drive innovation by existing firms. As they scramble for\n13 See Daron Acemoglu, Ufuk Akcigit, Harun Alp, Nicholas Bloom, and William Kerr (2018), “Innovation,\nReallocation, and Growth,” American Economic Review, vol. 108 (November), pp. 3450–91; and Vincent\nSterk, Petr Sedlacek, and Benjamin Pugsley (2021), “The Nature of Firm Growth,” American Economic\nReview, vol. 111 (February), pp. 547–79.\n14 See Lucia Foster, Cheryl Grim, John C. Haltiwanger, and Zoltan Wolf (2021), “Innovation, Productivity\nDispersion, and Productivity Growth,” in Carol Corrado, Jonathan Haskel, Javier Miranda, and Daniel\nSichel, eds., Measuring and Accounting for Innovation in the Twenty-First Century (Chicago: University\nof Chicago Press).\n\n- 7 -\nfunding, customers, and human capital, new businesses will increase competition with\nexisting ones, forcing them to innovate as well so they can succeed. This is surely also\ndriving the recent acceleration in productivity growth.\nMany predicted that the surge in new business creation would disappear as effects\nof the pandemic have faded, but this has not really happened. It is possible that the surge\nin entry will recede and that its productivity effects will likewise be temporary. On the\nother hand, the productivity gains from a surge in entry could last for some time, since\nthese highly productive young firms have been found to grow rapidly for several years,\ncontributing to aggregate productivity growth along the way. Time will tell, but for now,\nit seems likely that this is a factor supporting productivity growth at a higher-than-\nhistorical rate.\nI will confess to you all that it is not a coincidence that I have come to Miami to\nhighlight the role of entrepreneurship in innovation and productivity growth. Miami and\nthe Miami metropolitan area is an extraordinarily entrepreneurial area, a place with high\nrates of new business creation, and it is likely an important source of the recent\nproductivity surge.\nOut of more than 900 U.S. cities for which we have data, Miami’s post-pandemic\nnew firm entry rate ranked 8th in the nation.15 And Miami is not alone in Florida; 5 of\nthe top 20 cities for pandemic-era business formation are here in your state.16 Miami\nspecifically, and Florida generally, has been a key part of the U.S. entrepreneurship story\n15 Entry rates are measured as new firms as a share of all firms for 2021–22 (average) from the Census\nBureau Business Dynamics Statistics; the Census Bureau data report entry rates for core-based statistical\nareas.\n16 The 5 Florida cities in the top 20 are Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm\nBeach, Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, and Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-\nDestin.\n\n- 8 -\nfor some time. During the decade before the pandemic, Miami ranked 5th out of more\nthan 900 U.S. cities for firm entry rates, and Florida featured 8 of the top 20 U.S. cities.17\nMiami is special in this regard. I wonder what is in the water here to produce\nsuch a dynamic, entrepreneurial culture. Perhaps it is the extent of sunshine, which has\nlong been associated with optimism. Perhaps it is the friendly economic climate—in my\nown academic research, I have found that policies that facilitate business entry and\nsupport worker or job re-allocation are indeed helpful for dynamism and productivity.18\nBut an interesting question for me as the first Hispanic at the Board of Governors since\nits creation is whether the large Hispanic population in Florida is also a factor behind the\nimpressive pace of business dynamism that I have just described.\nMore than 25 percent of Florida’s population is Hispanic, compared with around\n20 percent for the United States as a whole.19 Nationwide, recent data indicate that\nLatinos account for a dominant—and rapidly growing—share of new entrepreneurship in\nthe U.S., with a particular increase since the pandemic.20 Of course, many of these\nLatino entrepreneurs are also immigrants, another group with a well-known proclivity for\nentrepreneurship.21 There are immigrants in Miami from the Caribbean and all over the\n17 I measure the pre-pandemic decade using average firm entry rates for 2010–19. The 8 Florida cities in\nthe top 20 are Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Cape Coral-Fort\nMyers, Wildwood-The Villages, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Naples-Marco Island, North Port-\nBradenton-Sarasota, and Jacksonville.\n18 See, for example, David Autor, William Kerr, and Adriana Kugler (2007), “Do Employment Protections\nReduce Productivity?

I applaud you all for fostering that culture here in Florida, which is such\nan important contributor to the economic growth of our nation. More entrepreneurs\nmeans more productivity, which is crucial to U.S. prosperity.\nLet me conclude with an outline of my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy\nand the FOMC’s efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a\nstrong labor market.\nThe U.S. economy remains on a firm footing.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) continues to grow at a solid pace. The\nBureau for Economic Analysis estimates that real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth\nquarter of 2024, and private domestic final purchases, which is the best indicator for GDP\none quarter ahead, grew a solid 3.2 percent. Therefore, I anticipate solid GDP growth also\nin the first quarter of this year. In addition, earlier today the Labor Department reported\nthat U.S. employers created 143,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate edged\ndown to 4 percent, consistent with a healthy labor market that is neither weakening nor\nshowing signs of overheating.\nInflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, and in\nSeptember the FOMC judged that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate\nfrom levels intended to strongly restrict aggregate demand and put downward pressure on\ninflation. We reduced our policy rate 100 basis points through December, but the recent\nprogress on inflation has been slow and uneven, and inflation remains elevated. There is\nalso considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of proposals of new policies.\n\n- 10 -\nGoing forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these\ndevelopments closely and continue to carefully assess incoming data, the evolving\noutlook, and the balance of risks.\nThank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nI am very pleased to be speaking here at the Brookings Institution, one of the\ncountry’s premier centers for policy discussion and analysis.1 As you all know, the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been working to lower inflation in the\ncontext of achieving our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\nToday I will discuss recent economic developments in the U.S., talk about how I\napproach our dual mandate, and explain how I view the current stance of monetary\npolicy.\nBy way of introducing myself, my career in both academia and public service has\nincluded a focus on both labor markets and inflation. In my academic work, I have\nexplored various aspects of labor markets—including the effects of labor market policies\nand the role of educational attainment, among other topics—as well as detailed\nmeasurement of productivity and prices. As the chief economist at the U.S. Department\nof Labor, I engaged regularly with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces data on\nboth employment and inflation. I have approached these topics through both a rigorous\nfocus on measurement considerations and a broader view of the real-world experiences of\nthe people who underlie the headline data. I will continue to do that as a member of the\nFOMC. With that background, I will now turn to recent economic developments and the\noutlook for this year.\nThe pace of inflation continues to slow. Twelve-month inflation, as measured by\nthe personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, was 2.6 percent in December, down\nfrom its peak of 7.1 percent in June 2022. And the six-month rate for PCE inflation was\neven lower, at 2 percent. While the FOMC uses PCE inflation for our 2 percent target,\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nwe also look to core PCE inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices,\nas an indication of the underlying inflation trend. Core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent in\nDecember, also down from its high of 5.6 percent in February 2022, and six-month core\nPCE inflation was just 1.9 percent in December. We have made great progress. The\nslowing in total and core PCE inflation that we have seen over the past year or so is the\nmost dramatic since the early 1980s—even though this progress has been uneven from\nmonth to month.\nI like to look under the hood of the inflation numbers for clues about the inflation\noutlook. A lot of the disinflation we have seen has come from the goods sector, where\nmany prices have actually fallen as demand has cooled and supply chains have mostly\nhealed from pandemic disruptions. Price declines in the goods sector have been helpful,\nthough the core goods category constitutes less than one-fourth of the total PCE index.\nWe have seen less—though still meaningful—progress on services inflation, but there are\nreasons for optimism. Measures of housing services inflation are naturally persistent;\ntenant rents move slowly because of the prevalence of year-long lease agreements, and\nestimates of owner housing costs are imputed based in large part using those tenant rents.\nThese measures react only gradually to data on newly signed rental agreements, and such\ndata do suggest continued easing of housing services inflation—a category that accounts\nfor about 15 percent of the total PCE index.\nThat leaves us with the category of core services excluding housing. This\ncategory saw a 12-month inflation of 3.3 percent in December, down considerably from\nits peak of 5.2 percent in December 2021. Continued overall disinflation will depend\nheavily on core services excluding housing, which accounts for roughly half of the total\n\n- 3 -\nPCE index. While this category’s inflation rate is still elevated, there is reason to expect\nimprovement, as I will discuss now.\nI see three factors as likely to contribute to continued disinflation, especially in\nthe category of core services excluding housing: continued moderation of wage growth,\nnormalization of price-setting behavior by firms, and anchored inflation expectations.\nFirst, the disinflationary process is being helped by wage growth moderation\nassociated with the ongoing cooling of the labor market. The pace of payroll gains has\nslowed considerably over the past couple of years. The three-month average of payroll\ngains surged above 700,000 in mid-2021 and then trended down through 2022 and 2023.\nOf course, last week’s payroll report was quite strong. And the three-month average gain\njumped to nearly 300,000. But the broader trend has been one of moderating gains. This\nmoderation in payroll growth largely reflects cooling demand. Actual hiring and hiring\nplans have eased, as is evident in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or\nJOLTS, data and in other business surveys as well.2 Job openings have also declined,\nsuch that the ratio of openings to unemployment has come down to 1.5 from a peak of 2.0\nand is now closer to the pre-pandemic ratio of 1.2. I am pleased that this cooling of labor\ndemand has been accomplished without a marked rise in layoffs, which would impose\nhardships and difficult transitions for individuals, families, and communities.\nAt the same time, labor supply has improved significantly, returning to pre-\npandemic levels. Labor force participation has risen sharply for prime-age workers since\nearly in the pandemic, particularly among women, who last year reached the highest\nparticipation rate on record. And we have seen an increase in immigration—a source of\n2 Hiring plans in the National Federation of Independent Business survey have cooled significantly from\ntheir peak in mid-2021. Cooling of hiring plans is also evident in the January Beige Book.\n\n- 4 -\nworkers that is particularly important for certain sectors. For example, in the\nconstruction sector, about one-fourth of all workers are non-natives, and in leisure and\nhospitality, the share is about one-fifth.3\nWith easing labor demand and robust labor supply, we have seen a slowing trend\nfor wage growth. Of course, as a general matter, I prefer to see robust growth of\nworkers’ wages, but for wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with 2\npercent inflation. Further wage growth slowing is likely to be important for ongoing\ndisinflation, particularly in the labor-intensive services industries. For private services\noverall, 12-month growth of average hourly earnings was 4.4 percent in January, down\nfrom its peak pace of 6.1 percent in March 2022. More specifically, in the leisure and\nhospitality sector, earnings growth was 4.4 percent in January, down from a peak rate of\n13.9 percent in late 2021. In education and health, earnings rose 3.7 percent in January,\nversus a peak pace of 6.9 percent in late 2021. Some of these sectors did see a pickup in\nwage growth in January, but the broader cooling trend is clear.\nI mention these sectors because they exemplify just how labor intensive the\nservices sector can be. For example, labor costs are roughly 60 percent of value-added in\nleisure and hospitality and more than 80 percent of value-added in education and health\nservices.4 An easing of labor-cost growth in these and other labor-intensive services\nindustries is likely to be passed on to consumers as lower prices and to help reduce\ninflationary pressures.\n3 These shares refer to the share of workers who are foreign born, averaged over 2015-2023. Data from\nBureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey.\n4 See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2022), “Composition of Gross Output by Industry” tables,\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&step=2&isuri=1&categories=gdpxind.\n\n- 5 -\nThe second factor that is likely to contribute to continued disinflation has to do\nwith how frequently individual prices are adjusted by firms. Research by Federal\nReserve Board staff and others has found that the rise in inflation during 2021 and 2022\nmostly reflected firms changing prices more frequently, rather than firms making larger\nadjustments when they did change prices. In particular, before the pandemic, the median\nprice lasted more than 10 months, but by early 2022, the median price was lasting less\nthan 5 months. Encouragingly, the frequency of price adjustment has declined since then,\nwith median price duration moving up to nearly 7 months in the third quarter of last\nyear.5 I am looking for a return to pre-pandemic price adjustment patterns in the services\nindustries as cost pressures ease and as the FOMC’s actions to support a return to price\nstability continue to affect consumer and firm behavior. There are some signs that\nbusinesses may be more wary of the response by consumers to higher prices and may\nalready be responding by raising prices less frequently. For example, mentions of\nconsumer “price sensitivity” have become more common in the Fed’s recent Beige Book,\nwhich reports economic conditions across our 12 Districts from various market\nparticipants.\nThe third factor favoring continued disinflation—one that is related to the other\ntwo factors I have just mentioned—is the stability of inflation expectations. Inflation\nexpectations can feed into wage demands and negotiations as well as into price-setting\ndecisions. To understand why this matters going forward, I will first look back: Over the\n5 Updated data from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), “Price-Setting during the Covid Era,” FEDS\nNotes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/price-setting-during-the-covid-era-\n20230829.html. The authors also find that the likelihood of upward (versus downward) price adjustments\nwas higher in the pandemic episode than in previous years, another important component of the inflation\nstory.\n\n- 6 -\npast couple of years, some workers have demanded large pay increases to catch up with\nhigher-than-normal growth in the cost of living resulting from various pandemic-related\nshocks. Some of these wage gains, in turn, likely passed through to higher prices as part\nof firms’ frequent price adjustments.\nIf expectations for future inflation had become unanchored or persistently higher,\nthen workers might have continued to demand higher-than-normal wage increases going\nforward, and firms might have continued to pass on these costs to consumers.6 But\ninflation expectations have stayed reasonably well anchored. As inflation expectations\nstay anchored and in tune with inflation slowing further in the future, employees—many\nof whose wages have recently been rising faster than price inflation—are less likely to\ncontinue demanding very large wage and salary increases.7 Similarly, as businesses\nexpect the prices of labor and other inputs to rise more slowly (or, for some inputs, even\nto fall), they will be less likely to plan to significantly increase their own prices\nthroughout the year, which in turn helps reduce inflation. Survey data from the\nRichmond Fed show a close relationship between firms’ expectations for overall price\ninflation and those firms’ own price-setting plans. In particular, as inflation comes down,\nfirms become less reactive, and inflation expectations play less of a role in firms’ price\nadjustments.8\n6 For a helpful discussion of this potential “wage–price spiral,” see Guido Lorenzoni and Ivan Werning\n(2023), “Wage–Price Spirals,” paper presented at the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity Conference,\nheld at the Brookings Institution, Washington, September 28–29, https://bpb-us-\nw2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/c/3483/files/2023/10/5_Lorenzoni-Werning_unembargoed.pdf.\n7 Real wages—that is, wages adjusted for price inflation—declined earlier in the recent inflationary\nepisode. But real wages have been recovering more recently.\n8 See Felipe F. Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell (2024), “Inflation Expectations and Price\nSetting among Fifth District Firms,” Economic Brief 24-03 (Richmond, Va.: Federal Reserve Bank of\nRichmond, January), https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-03.\n\n- 7 -\nSeveral data sources support the idea that expectations are indeed well anchored.\nOne closely watched source is the Michigan survey, in which expectations for inflation\nduring the next 5 to 10 years have remained fairly flat recently, near levels seen for much\nof the past decade. And expectations for inflation in the year ahead have come down a\nfair bit after peaking in 2022. Expected inflation in the New York Fed’s Survey of\nConsumer Expectations shows a similar pattern, with both one-year and three-year\nexpectations close to their pre-pandemic norms. Expectations also appear well anchored\nin surveys of forecasters and in market-based measures of future inflation. This\ninformation suggests that firms, workers, and investors understand that price- and wage-\nsetting behaviors are likely to return to pre-pandemic norms, which will help us return to\nthe price stability we enjoyed before the pandemic.\nI have noted three reasons I expect continued progress toward the FOMC’s\n2 percent target for inflation, and I believe monetary policy has played a key role in\ndriving these factors. An open question looking ahead, though, is how spending\nmomentum will evolve this year, which may either help or hinder this disinflationary\nprocess. I expect consumer spending to grow more slowly this year than last—which\nshould help with disinflation. Large balances of excess savings accumulated early in the\npandemic have supported household spending during the past few years. By now, these\nexcess savings are likely exhausted, at least for households in the bottom half of the\nincome distribution. And we have begun to see signs that some households have come\nunder increased stress, such as rising delinquency rates on credit cards.9 Just two days\nago, the Federal Reserve released the January survey of senior loan officers (or SLOOS).\n9 Rising credit card delinquency rates can be seen, for example, in quarterly “call reports” data from the\nFederal Reserve, which currently extend through the third quarter of 2023.\n\n- 8 -\nThat survey showed continued tightening of credit card lending standards, the latest in a\nstring of such surveys documenting tighter conditions for a variety of consumer lending.\nThese signs of tight financial conditions point to slower consumer spending. Business\nspending growth is also likely to be a bit slower this year, since the widely discussed\nboom in factory construction may level off, albeit at a high level. Eventually, equipment\ninvestment should rise to fill those newly built factories with machines, but that process\nwill likely be gradual.\nAnd I closely watch developments in broader financial markets as well. Some\nmeasures of financial conditions have become a bit less restrictive in recent months but\nremain relatively tight. Indeed, the FCI-G, a measure of financial conditions published\nby the Board, and other indicators suggest that overall financial conditions are consistent\nwith continued progress on our inflation mandate.\nSo I am pleased with the disinflationary progress thus far and expect it to\ncontinue. I must emphasize, however, that the Committee’s job is not done yet.\nConsumer spending was surprisingly strong last year. Gross domestic product (GDP)\ngrew at a nearly 5 percent rate in the third quarter, led by consumption. And even though\nspending and output growth moderated some in the fourth quarter, consumption\ncontributed nearly 2 percentage points to fourth-quarter GDP growth. So consumers\ncould surprise us again this year, and that could slow progress on inflation. Last week’s\nemployment report was also surprisingly strong amidst the broader cooling trend. It is\nimportant that supply and demand in both product and labor markets broadly continue\nmoving into better balance.\n\n- 9 -\nI am also paying close attention to the upside risks to inflation posed by\ngeopolitical developments. Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine and the widening of the\nconflict in the Middle East could contribute to higher commodity prices and disrupt\nglobal trade, in turn pushing up goods inflation in the U.S. When I worked at the World\nBank, I followed these issues on international supply chains and commodity prices\nclosely, and I certainly continue to do so now.\nI will remain focused on the inflation side of our dual mandate until I am\nconfident that inflation is returning durably to our 2 percent target. I am keenly aware\nthat high inflation vastly complicates business decision making and importantly creates\nserious hardships for our most vulnerable households and individuals. Having lived in\nColombia during periods of high and volatile inflation, I know firsthand how destructive\nit can be. It is critical that inflation returns to 2 percent, as that is indeed the pace the\nCommittee has deemed to be consistent with price stability.\nOf course, I am mindful of our employment mandate, and I am closely tracking\nlabor market developments. While historically we have sometimes seen a tradeoff\nbetween inflation and employment, the recent experience of disinflation has been\nsustained without a significant increase in unemployment. I do expect job growth to\ncontinue; however, history has shown that labor market conditions can change quickly,\nsometimes before we see strong signals in spending data. Thus, I am watching closely\nthe totality of the data, with risks on both sides of the mandate in mind.\nI am also cognizant of international risks to our employment mandate. For\nexample, a broader slowdown in Europe or China—two of the engines of global\ngrowth—could become a drag on the U.S. economy.\n\n- 10 -\nFor now, I see the risks to our dual mandate as roughly balanced; our policy\nstance is restrictive, but the target range for the federal funds rate has been steady for\nsome time now, and the most recent Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC\nparticipants suggests that the rate is at its peak level, if the economy evolves as expected.\nAt some point, the continued cooling of inflation and labor markets may make it\nappropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. On the other hand, if\nprogress on disinflation stalls, it may be appropriate to hold the target range steady at its\ncurrent level for longer to ensure continued progress on our dual mandate.\nIn summary, I am pleased by the progress on inflation, and optimistic it will\ncontinue, but I will be watching the economic data closely to verify the continuation of\nthis progress. This approach is the surest path to achieving and maintaining both of the\nFOMC’s economic objectives and promoting an economy that benefits everyone in\nAmerica.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n4:00 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 25, 2024\nHow We Got Here: A Perspective on Inflation and the Labor Market\nRemarks by\nAdriana D. Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nMossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government\nHarvard Kennedy School\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nSeptember 25, 2024\n\nThank you, John, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.1 It is\ngood to be back at the Kennedy School and in particular at the Mossavar-Rahmani\nCenter, which has a long tradition of engaging on important policy issues.\nIn my remarks today, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and the\nimplications for monetary policy. The combination of significant ongoing progress in\nreducing inflation and a cooling in the labor market means that the time has come to\nbegin easing monetary policy, and I strongly supported the decision last week by the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points.\nWhile future actions by the FOMC will depend on data we receive on inflation,\nemployment, and economic activity, if conditions continue to evolve in the direction\ntraveled thus far, then additional cuts will be appropriate.\nI will begin by summarizing where we stand on inflation, including details on\nhow the different components of inflation have changed over time, since these facts form\nthe basis for my judgment on where inflation is headed. I will then talk about the recent\ncooling in the labor market and the forces driving it as well as how shifts on this other\nside of our mandate fit into the overall economic outlook for the rest of this year. I will\nconclude with the implications of all this for appropriate monetary policy and our focus\non our dual mandate.\nInflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has come down\nfrom a peak of 7.1 percent on a year-on-year basis to 2.5 percent in July. Core PCE\ninflation, which excludes energy and food prices and tends to be less volatile, has come\ndown from a peak of 5.6 percent to now 2.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nprice indexes, I estimate headline PCE and core PCE inflation to be at about 2.2 and 2.7\npercent, respectively, in August, consistent with ongoing progress toward the FOMC’s 2\npercent target. The progress on inflation is good news, but it is important to remember\nthat households and businesses are still dealing with prices for many goods and services\nthat are significantly higher than a couple of years ago. Prices for groceries, for example,\nare about 20 percent higher than before inflation started rising in 2021, and while\nearnings have been rising faster than inflation, it may take some time for it to feel as\nthough prices are back to normal.2\nInflation data are produced by the Labor Department, and when I served as chief\neconomist at Labor, I delved into the differential effects of inflation on various\ndemographic groups. When inflation was at its peak in 2022, it was more than\n1 percentage point higher for lower-income households, for those without a college\ndegree, and for those aged 18 to 29—all groups that spend a higher share of income on\nnecessities and have less wealth to draw from.3 Fortunately, research by staff at the Fed\nshows that disinflation helps close that gap as well, something that only adds to the\nurgency I feel about returning inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal.\nResearch on the causes of inflation and the subsequent disinflation show that both\nsupply and demand forces have played an important role. In the past two years,\nspecifically, improvements in supply, along with moderation in demand in part due to\n2 Unlike in previous recoveries, those in the lower half of the distribution have benefited more from the real\nearnings increases during the post-pandemic period. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings and\nthe employment cost index have been rising faster than consumer price index inflation for those in the first\nand second quartiles since 2019 and since 2022, respectively, and for everyone across the distribution for\nroughly a year.\n3 See Xavier Jaravel (2021), “Inflation Inequality: Measurement, Causes, and Policy Implications,” Annual\nReview of Economics, vol. 13, pp. 599–629.\n\n- 3 -\ntighter monetary policy, have both played a role in the disinflationary process.4 Supply\nchain bottlenecks as well as the drastic drop in the labor force due to excess retirements\nand the withdrawal of prime-age workers contributed to the initial rise in inflation, but\nthe resolution of these disruptions and the return of workers to the labor force have also\nhelped rein in inflation. Early on, consumers shifted spending from services to goods, a\ndevelopment that goods producers struggled to accommodate, putting upward pressure on\nprices. But as the demand shock to goods unwound and consumer spending shifted back\nto services, goods inflation fell and has been running below zero in recent months. Also,\nthe increased demand due to the fiscal response to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 has more\nrecently been roughly neutral on growth, as shown by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and\nMonetary Policy in their measure of fiscal impact. And, of course, as I will discuss in a\nmoment, tight monetary policy has been and continues to be a moderating force on\ndemand, primarily by raising costs for interest-sensitive goods and services.\nAs I think about where inflation is headed, I find it helpful to consider how it has\nevolved over the past several years and in particular how the major components of\ninflation have behaved, so I want to take a few minutes to walk through those details.\n4 Different approaches allow a parsing of the relative contributions of supply and demand, top-down\napproaches by Bernanke and Blanchard (forthcoming) and Benigno and Eggertson (2023) and bottom-up\napproaches by Braun, Flaaen, and Hoke (2024) and Shapiro (2022); see Ben Bernanke and Olivier\nBlanchard (forthcoming), “What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era Inflation?” American Economic Journal:\nMacroeconomics; Pierpaolo Benigno and Gauti B. Eggertsson (2023), “It’s Baaack: The Surge in Inflation\nin the 2020s and the Return of the Non-Linear Phillips Curve,” NBER Working Paper Series 31197\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April), https://www.nber.org/papers/w31197;\nRobin Braun, Aaron Flaaen, and Sinem Hacioglu Hoke (2024), “Supply vs Demand Factors Influencing\nPrices of Manufactured Goods,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, February 23), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/supply-vs-demand-factors-\ninfluencing-prices-of-manufactured-goods-20240223.html; and Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), “How Much\nDo Supply and Demand Drive Inflation?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2022-15 (San Francisco: Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco, June 21), https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-\ninsights/publications/economic-letter/2022/06/how-much-do-supply-and-demand-drive-inflation. All of\nthese studies agree that both supply and demand shocks contributed to the surge in inflation as well as its\nfall.\n\n- 4 -\nAs I have indicated, the big picture is that goods inflation surged early on in 2020\nand 2021, followed by prices for services excluding housing, and then housing, with\nsome overlap in those steps. Disinflation has followed that course in reverse. Core\ngoods inflation rose, after almost a year of social distancing shifted spending from\nservices and after production and delivery of goods was disrupted by the pandemic. This\nwas a big change because over the long expansion leading to the pandemic, core goods\nprices actually fell, slightly but consistently.5 On a 12-month basis, core PCE goods\ninflation rose above zero in December 2020, reached a peak of 7.6 percent in February\n2022, and fell again below zero at the end of 2023. In July of this year, it was negative\n0.5 percent. This recent disinflation offset still-rising prices for services and helped\nreduce overall inflation. Goods inflation has reverted to its longer-term pattern as\ndemand has moderated and supply chain problems have abated. This is reflected by\nvarious indexes of supply chain bottlenecks that showed the supply-side disruptions that\ncontributed early on to surging inflation have now retreated to pre-pandemic levels.6\nOther data show that computer chip supply, which fell far short of demand early in the\npandemic, is back to normal conditions as well.\nFood and energy prices, always subject to larger ups and downs than other parts\nof inflation, rose also early on. Food inflation increased in 2020 as shoppers began\nstockpiling groceries and as warehouses and production facilities had difficulty staffing\ndue to COVID. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, energy price inflation reached a peak\n5 The causes most often cited by economists are competition from globalized trade and productivity gains,\nincluding from technological advances.\n6 The most commonly used indicators of supply chain bottlenecks are the Global Supply Chain Pressure\nIndex produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Supplier Deliveries Index from the Institute\nfor Supply Management, and the percent of answers to the question of why production is not at capacity in\nthe Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization fielded by the Census Bureau and funded by the Federal\nReserve Board.\n\n- 5 -\n12-month rate of nearly 45 percent and food inflation reached a peak of 12 percent in\nmid-2022, highlighting the importance of petroleum and agricultural commodities from\nthat part of the world. Food and energy inflation has moderated over the past two years\nand are now both running at 12-month rates of 1.4 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively,\nas supply chain issues have resolved and production in the U.S. and elsewhere has\nincreased. Food and energy expenses represent a sizable share of consumer spending, but\nthe frequent purchase of these goods means that they are highly salient in the public’s\nviews on inflation. Research by Francesco D’Acunto and coauthors has shown that the\nweights that consumers assign to price changes in forming their inflation expectations are\nnot based on the actual share of their expenditures but instead on the frequency of\npurchases, which happen to be highest for food and energy goods.7 Thus, the fall in food\nand energy prices is important because it may feed back into lower inflation in other\ncategories by moderating overall inflation expectations and also real wage expectations in\nwage bargaining.\nHousing services price increases were the last component of inflation to escalate,\nrising to a peak 12-month rate of 8.3 percent in April 2023 and moderating to a 5.3\npercent pace in July. It took time for housing prices to escalate and has taken longer for\nthem to moderate because of both the nature of the rental market and the data collection\nmethod from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as I have discussed at length in other\nspeeches.8 However, new rent increases, which better capture rental price changes in real\n7 See Francesco D’Acunto, Ulrike Malmendier, Juan Ospina, and Michael Weber (2021), “Exposure to\nGrocery Prices and Inflation Expectations,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 129 (May), 1615–39.\n8 Rental prices are the basis for all estimates of housing service costs. Prices tend to change only when\nrented homes change tenants, which happens relatively infrequently. Prices tend to change more when\nthere are new tenants, while the majority of lease renewals tend to keep the same price-generating\n\n- 6 -\ntime, are falling and are the main reason why I expect housing services costs to moderate\nfurther.\nThe final component of inflation is services excluding housing, which accounts\nfor 50 percent of PCE inflation and is heavily influenced by labor markets. On a 12-\nmonth basis, this component of inflation rose to a peak of 5.3 percent in December 2021,\nstayed persistently high until February 2023, and has moderated since then to 3.3 percent\nin July of this year. Its escalation was driven both by the rise in labor costs and by the\ntransition of demand from goods to services following the pandemic. Labor costs are a\nsubstantial share of the total costs for services. For example, labor accounts for between\n60 percent to 80 percent of costs in construction, education, and health services.\nAmong the initial forces driving the escalation in wages were the increase in food\nand energy prices, as wage demands tend to track closely with the prices of these\nfrequently purchased goods. Data on wage demands from the New York Fed’s Survey of\nConsumer Expectations indeed show a sudden increase early on during the pandemic\nright after the first bout of food inflation.9 Importantly, worker shortages likely allowed\nthose higher wage demands to be realized, contributing to the rise in wages. Later, as\ndemand for services quickly rose and employers were creating a large number of jobs in\nseveral service sectors, workers were able to be more selective, and the ensuing “Great\nResignation” took hold, allowing people to choose different careers. The relatively high\npersistence. In addition, the Bureau of Economic Analysis samples rents only every six months. As a\nresult, substantial lags are built into the official statistics. See Adriana D. Kugler (2024), “The Outlook for\nthe Economy and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C.,\nFebruary 7, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240207a.htm; Adriana D. Kugler\n(2024), “Some Reasons for Optimism about Inflation,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for\nInternational Economics, Washington, D.C., June 18,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm.\n9 The Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Fed collects data on “reservation wages,”\nwhich are what workers report as being the minimum wage that they would require to accept a job.\n\n- 7 -\ndemand relative to the supply of workers in some service sectors encouraged workers to\nmove from job to job for higher wages, benefits, and other improvements in working\nconditions. Evidence from the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker suggests that during\nthis period, wages for job switchers grew more than 2 percentage points faster than wages\nfor people staying in the same job, though this wage premium for job switchers\ndisappeared by the second half of last year.\nBut now inflation for services excluding housing is declining, after a temporary\nescalation in the first quarter of this year that was likely partly due to residual seasonality.\nThere had been fears that wage increases would drive a wage–price spiral, as the U.S.\nexperienced in the 1970s, but this did not occur.\nTo sum up, inflation has broadly moderated as the supply of goods and services\nhas improved, and as producers and consumers have adjusted to the effects of higher\nprices. Demand has moderated, in part due to tighter monetary policy. And, as I just\nnoted, changes in the pace of wage growth have also played an important role in the ups\nand downs of inflation, which points me toward a discussion of labor markets, which has\nrecently become a greater focus of monetary policy.\nAs I have noted, there has been a significant moderation in the labor market\nrecently, but I want to start by pointing to what really has been a remarkable performance\nof the labor market over the past four years. After the unprecedented job losses early in\nthe pandemic, and even accounting for the quick recovery of a large share of those losses,\nthe recovery of the labor market that followed was historically swift. Unemployment was\n7.8 percent in September 2020 and 4.7 percent only 12 months later, and it fell to under 4\npercent 3 months after that. That is a more rapid recovery than the U.S. has experienced\n\n- 8 -\nsince the 1960’s. What started, at that point, was 30 straight months of unemployment at\nor below 4 percent, which had not happened during the pre-pandemic period, the boom of\nthe 1990s, or anytime during the 1980s, and it was only exceeded by the strong labor\nmarket of the latter half of the 1960s. Something that I think was just as remarkable has\nbeen the narrowing of the typical gap between labor market outcomes for less-advantaged\ngroups. For example, there has been a reduction in the unemployment rate between\nBlack and Latino workers, on the one hand, and white workers, on the other hand. There\nhas also been a narrowing of the prime-age labor force participation rate among these\ngroups, and, perhaps most notable of all, wage inequality among them has narrowed,\nwhich is not typical during economic expansions, according to research by David Autor\nand several coauthors.10 They found that one benefit of the unusually tight labor market\nof the past few years was that the heightened competition for scarce workers produced\nmore rapid wage gains for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution. The real wage\ngains for those in the lower quartiles of the distribution and with higher propensities to\nconsume, in turn, likely spurred consumption and helped sustain growth after the\npandemic.\nAfter a couple of years in which labor demand exceeded supply, the labor market\nhas come into balance, reflecting an economy that has moderated in part due to tighter\nmonetary policy. On the labor supply side, two forces have contributed to this\nrebalancing of the labor market. Labor force participation suffered due to the disruptions\n10 See David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2024), “The Unexpected Compression:\nCompetition at Work in the Low Wage Labor Market,” NBER Working Paper Series 31010 (Cambridge,\nMass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March; revised May 2024),\nhttp://www.nber.org/papers/w31010. Using Current Population Survey microdata, they show that\nincreased labor market competition for scarce workers produced more rapid real wage gains at the bottom\nof the wage distribution, reducing wage inequality.\n\n- 9 -\nin work during the pandemic but rebounded strongly in 2022 and 2023 as the labor\nmarket tightened and wages rose sharply. The labor force participation rate for prime-age\nwomen reached historic highs over the past year and reached yet another historic record\nhigh in August. The overall increase in participation among workers aged 25 to 54, in the\nprime of their working lives, helped offset the loss of many workers aged 55 and over\nwho experienced excess retirements during the pandemic. The second force boosting\nlabor supply has been the large increase in immigration. The Congressional Budget\nOffice estimates that net immigration boosted the U.S. population by close to 6 million\npeople in 2022 and 2023, the majority of them of working age, and, by most accounts,\nrates of immigration have remained high in 2024.\nAs a result of improved supply and easing of demand for workers, the labor\nmarket has rebalanced. After running at very low levels, unemployment has edged up\nthis year to 4.2 percent in August, still quite low by historical standards. The slowdown\nin labor demand is most evident in payroll numbers. Job creation averaged 267,000 a\nmonth in the first quarter of the year and now stands at an average of 116,000 in the three\nmonths ending in August, which is still a healthy pace of job creation. Yet, given recent\nrevisions in the payroll numbers, it is important to continue monitoring additional labor\nmarket indicators. In addition, the fall in diffusion indexes suggests that job creation\ncooling has been broad based, complementing the payroll data in showing rebalances in\ndemand and supply across sectors. Beyond payroll data, voluntary quits, which tend to\nreflect the rate at which people find a better job, are now back around where they were\nbefore the pandemic. The ratio of job vacancies to the number of people looking for\n\n- 10 -\nwork, the V/U ratio, has also fallen close to its pre-pandemic ratio.11 In summary, after a\nperiod of demand exceeding supply, the labor market appears to have rebalanced.\nIn tandem with the cooling in the labor market, economic activity has slowed but\nis still expanding at a solid pace. After adjusting for inflation, gross domestic product\n(GDP) grew 2.5 percent in 2023 and at around a 2 percent annual rate in the first half of\n2024. Personal spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity, has been\nsolid this year, supported by a resilient labor market so far and high levels of household\nwealth relative to income. But given a rise in credit card and auto delinquencies, a rise in\ncredit card balances, and a cooling labor market, I expect spending to grow at a\nsomewhat more moderate pace moving forward.\nCertainly, tight monetary policy has contributed to cool off aggregate demand and\nslow the economy. It has done so in large part by slowing spending on interest-sensitive\nexpenditures, such as housing, as well as autos and other durable goods. Other spending\ntypically financed with credit, such as business equipment, has also been slower.\nAnother effect of tight monetary policy is to keep expectations of future inflation\nin check. And, to the extent that expectations affect decisions by businesses to set prices\nand by workers to negotiate wages, this has helped put downward pressure on inflation.\nSurvey- and market-based measures of future inflation did increase when inflation\nsurged, but only modestly, and they have moved down in tandem with inflation and have\nlargely returned to their 2019 levels.\n11 I consider here a V/U ratio in which the numerator is the ratio of the vacancy rate for the total nonfarm\nsector computed as job openings over the labor force. Job openings data are from the Job Openings and\nLabor Turnover Survey fielded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The denominator is the unemployment\nrate. The last data point available for job openings is July 2024, while the last data point for the\nunemployment rate is August.\n\n- 11 -\nIn conclusion, I would say that recent economic developments, against the\nbackdrop of the experience of the past four years, have validated the Federal Reserve’s\nfocus on reducing inflation and set the stage for the shift in monetary policy that occurred\nlast week. The progress in bringing down inflation thus far, coupled with the softening in\nthe labor market that I have described, means that while our focus should remain on\ncontinuing to bring inflation to 2 percent, we should now also shift attention to the\nmaximum-employment side of the FOMC’s dual mandate. The labor market remains\nresilient, but the FOMC now needs to balance its focus so we can continue making\nprogress on disinflation while avoiding unnecessary pain and weakness in the economy\nas disinflation continues in the right trajectory. I strongly supported last week’s decision\nand, if progress on inflation continues as I expect, I will support additional cuts in the\nfederal funds rate going forward.\nThank you.",

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nConference on Monetary Policy 2024: Bridging Science and Practice\nEuropean Central Bank\nFrankfurt, Germany\nOctober 8, 2024\n\nThank you, Isabel, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here at the ECB\ntoday.1 I am particularly pleased to be part of this year’s conference because the theme\nyou have chosen has, for some time now, also been a theme of my career as an academic\nand public servant. Every day, of course, central bankers must bridge science and\npractice, drawing on the insights that research provides, specifically, because the\neconomy and the world are continuously subject to new circumstances. We must do so,\nand put those insights into practice, because everyone in the United States, and in Europe,\nand around the world, depends on a healthy and growing economy, and depends on\npolicymakers making the right decisions to help keep it that way.\nBut well before I came to the Federal Reserve, I was also bridging science and\npractice. First, as a labor economist, when, for example, I was exploring how\nemployment, productivity, and earnings are influenced not only by educational\nattainment and experience, but also by policies. Later, as chief economist at the\nDepartment of Labor, I brought science to bear in carrying out its mission of supporting\nworkers. As the U.S. representative at the World Bank, economic science was likewise\ncrucial in deciding how to best direct the institution’s resources to where they were\nneeded the most. In each of these roles, I have learned a bit more about the need to\nbalance rigorous scientific understanding of the problems that people face with the real-\nworld experiences of those people, which sometimes do not fit so neatly into an\neconomic theorem or principle.\nMost recently, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) have been focused on the very practical task of reducing inflation while keeping\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nemployment at its maximum level. To understand the recent experience of high inflation\nin the United States, it is helpful to consider how inflation behaved around the world after\nthe advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss\nthe global dimensions of the recent bout of high inflation in different economies, both\ncomparing similarities and contrasting differences, with a special emphasis on the factors\nthat enabled the United States to achieve disinflation while having stronger economic\nactivity relative to its peers. I will then conclude with some comments on the U.S.\neconomic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.\nStarting with the similarities in our inflationary experiences, in early 2020, a\nworldwide pandemic disrupted the global economy and ultimately caused a surge of\ninflation around the world. Global goods production was hobbled, transportation and\nother aspects of supply chains became entangled, and there were significant labor\nshortages, all combining to cause a severe imbalance between supply and demand in\nmuch of the world. Sharp increases in commodity prices were exacerbated by Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine. The result was a global escalation of inflation. As you can see by\nthe black line on slide 2, a measure of world headline inflation in 26 economies\naccounting for 60 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) rose to a degree that\nhad not been experienced since the early 1980s.\nThis worldwide increase of inflation was synchronized and widespread across\nadvanced and emerging economies. To measure the synchronization and breadth of this\ninflationary period, Federal Reserve Board researchers have employed a dynamic factor\n\n- 3 -\nmodel to estimate a common component of inflation across these 26 economies.2 As you\ncan see by the blue line on slide 2, the estimated global component accounts for a large\nshare of the variation of headline inflation among these economies after inflation began\nrising sharply in 2021. This evidence is consistent with the familiar story of widespread\nlockdowns, shutdowns of manufacturing plants in different parts of the world, disrupted\nlogistic networks, increases in shipping costs, and longer delivery times. In the recovery,\nwe also saw globally higher demand for commodities, intermediate inputs, and final\ngoods and services, with demand exceeding a still-constrained supply.\nIndeed, one important contributor to the recent co-movement in inflation across\nthe world has been food and energy prices. As you know, most of the time variations in\ninflation are heavily influenced by food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile\nthan the prices for other goods and services. Because many food and energy\ncommodities are traded internationally, retail prices paid by consumers also tend to have\nsome degree of global synchronization. Thus, as you would expect, the black line in the\nleft chart on slide 3 shows that food and energy inflation faced by consumers around the\nworld—here called noncore inflation—rose substantially in the recent inflationary\nepisode. Moreover, world noncore inflation is largely accounted for by its global\ncomponent in yellow, thus also showing a high degree of global synchronization.\nAnother thing we can say about the recent worldwide escalation of inflation is\nhow widely diffused it was across different price categories. Core inflation excludes food\n2 See Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, Luca Guerrieri, Matteo Iacoviello, and Michele Modugno (2024), “Lessons\nfrom the Co-Movement of Inflation around the World,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, June 28), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/lessons-\nfrom-the-co-movement-of-inflation-around-the-world-20240628.html.\n\n- 4 -\nand energy prices, and it includes many categories more exposed to domestic conditions\nsuch as housing and medical services. Yet, as shown by the black and red lines in the\nright chart on slide 3, the recent rise in core inflation showed a high degree of global\nsynchronization, with the global component accounting for a large share of the post-\npandemic inflation. Looking back in history, this is the first time since the 1970s that we\nsaw a rise in core inflation so widespread across such a large number of countries.\nMoreover, underlying this rise in core inflation in the United States and other advanced\neconomies, research carried out by Federal Reserve Board economists shows that there\nwas a widespread rise in prices across the whole range of categories within the core\nbasket.3\nAcademics and policymakers have debated about the possible reasons explaining\nthe recent co-movement of inflation around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic was a\nglobal phenomenon and had effects on supply and demand that were similar in many\ncountries. On the supply side, businesses closed, affecting goods production and the\nprovision of services. There were labor shortages due to illness, social distancing, early\nretirements, and declines in immigration, with all of these factors making it harder to\nproduce goods and services.4 Production disruptions and labor shortages propagated\n3 I refer to updated estimates from the following works: Hie Joo Ahn and Matteo Luciani (2020),\n“Common and Idiosyncratic Inflation,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-024 (Washington:\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March; revised August 2024),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.024r1; and Eli Nir, Flora Haberkorn, and Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia\n(2021), “International Measures of Common Inflation,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, November 5), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-\nnotes/international-measures-of-common-inflation-20211105.html.\n4 See Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, Musa Orak, and Zina Saijid (2023), “Drivers of Post-Pandemic Inflation in\nSelected Advanced Economies and Implications for the Outlook,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, January 13), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-\nnotes/drivers-of-post-pandemic-inflation-in-selected-advanced-economies-and-implications-for-the-\noutlook-20230113.html.\n\n- 5 -\naround the world due to long and intricate supply chains forged over several decades of\ngrowing globalization in trade. The imbalance between supply and demand widened as\nconsumers switched their spending from services to goods, straining transportation\ncapacity that further disrupted supply chains.5 This re-allocation of demand from\nservices to goods also strained the ability of firms to produce, as they struggled to find\nqualified workers due to the needed re-allocation of workers across sectors.6 This\ndemand was also likely fueled by the fiscal response to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021.\nAll of these factors drove up costs, and there were others. Russia’s war on Ukraine\nintensified the increases in energy and food commodity prices during the recovery from\nthe pandemic. And the interaction of these different forces also likely played a role.7 For\nexample, as Asia increased production to meet higher demand for goods in the U.S., this\nmay have driven up wages and other input costs in Asia, increasing demand for imports\nfrom other places and, in turn, raising costs there, and so on. My assessment is that both\nsupply and demand contributed to the recent global inflationary episode, including in the\nUnited States, with international trade of goods, including commodities, and services\nplaying an important role in disseminating these forces around the world.\nOne salient aspect of past inflationary episodes is the observation that core\ninflation typically falls more slowly than it increases. As we can see by the red lines on\nslide 4, world core inflation rose more quickly than it decreased in the three most recent\n5 See Gianluca Benigno, Julian di Giovanni, Jan J.J. Groen, and Adam I. Noble (2022), “The GSCPI: A\nNew Barometer of Global Supply Chain Pressures,” Staff Reports 1017 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank\nof New York, May), https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1017.html.\n6 See Francesco Ferrante, Sebastian Graves, and Matteo Iacoviello (2023), “The Inflationary Effects of\nSectoral Reallocation,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 140, supplement (November), pp. S64–S81.\n7 See Paul Ho, Pierre-Daniel Sarte, and Felipe Schwartzman (2022), “Multilateral Comovement in a New\nKeynesian World: A Little Trade Goes a Long Way,” Working Paper Series 22-10 (Richmond: Federal\nReserve Bank of Richmond, November), https://www.richmondfed.org/-\n/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/working_papers/2022/wp22-10.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nepisodes of significant inflation and disinflation—from a trough in 1972 to a new trough\nin 1978; from 1978 to a trough in 1986; and then the recent episode, from the end of 2020\nthrough the first quarter of 2024. In these episodes, the escalation of four-quarter core\ninflation increased by an average of 7/10 percentage point per quarter to its peak, while it\ndecreased by an average of only 3/10 percentage point per quarter to the trough.8\nStill, it is important that central bankers not only compare similarities across\neconomies in the recent inflation fight, but also contrast the differences. Notably, another\nimportant feature of the last three inflation and disinflation periods is that though the\nshare of core inflation explained by the common component increases when inflation\nrises, this share decreases when inflation falls, as can be seen by the black shaded areas of\nthe three panels on slide 4. This suggests that while the reasons underlying the co-\nmovement of inflation across the world—such as global supply disruptions and\ncommodity price shocks—may have been important when prices were increasing, they\nhave been less important when prices have decreased. This evidence indicates that\nfactors that vary from economy to economy become more relevant in the disinflationary\nperiod.\nEconomic researchers have raised several possible explanations for the different\ninflation trajectories experienced by different economies during this post-pandemic\nperiod. For example, some point to differences in the magnitudes of the demand and\nsupply imbalances driven by the shutdown and reopening of each economy, with this\n8 For the 1972–78 period, we define the inflation ascent path as 1972:Q3 to 1974:Q4, while its descent path\nis 1975:Q1 to 1978:Q2. For the 1978–86 period, we define the inflation ascent path as 1978:Q3 to\n1980:Q2, while its descent path is 1980:Q3 to 1986:Q2. For the 2020–24 period, we define the inflation\nascent path as 2021:Q1 to 2022:Q4, while its descent path is 2023:Q1 to 2024:Q1 because it is the latest\navailable data.\n\n- 7 -\nimbalance possibly playing a larger role on inflation in the euro area relative to the\nUnited States.9 While noting that differences in the size of fiscal stimulus in different\ncountries were likely important, the targeting of that stimulus also differed, in some cases\nwith a greater emphasis on addressing supply disruptions.10 Global factors also affect\nvarious economies differently, with studies showing that the exposures to fluctuations in\ncommodity prices are an important issue.11 For instance, Europe was heavily affected by\nnatural gas shortages related to Russia’s war on Ukraine, while gas supplies in the United\nStates were more plentiful during this period. Also, supply chains were untangled at\ndifferent speeds in different parts of the world, with, for instance, low water levels in the\nPanama Canal and attacks in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels affecting different shipping\nroutes differently around the world. And, last but not least, differences in labor market\ntightness very likely played a role, with evidence pointing to its importance in the United\nStates in driving up nominal wage growth, a factor that likely helped keep employment\nand economic activity at healthy levels.12\n9 See Domenico Giannone and Giorgio Primiceri (2024), “The Drivers of Post-Pandemic Inflation,” NBER\nWorking Paper Series 32859 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, August),\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w32859.\n10 For the economic effects on the size of fiscal stimuli, see Oscar Jorda and Fernanda Nechio (2023),\n“Inflation and Wage Growth since the Pandemic,” European Economic Review, vol. 156, 104474.\n11 See Christiane Baumeister, Gert Peersman, and Ine Van Robays (2010), “The Economic Consequences\nof Oil Shocks: Differences across Countries and Time,” in Renee Fry, Callum Jones, and Christopher\nKent, eds., Inflation in an Era of Relative Price Shocks (Sydney: Reserve Bank of Australia), pp. 91–128,\nhttps://www.rba.gov.au/publications/confs/2009/pdf/conf-vol-2009.pdf; and Andrea De Michelis, Thiago\nFerreira, and Matteo Iacoviello (2020), “Oil Prices and Consumption across Countries and U.S.\nStates,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 16 (March), pp. 3–43.\n12 For the effects of labor market tightness on price and wage inflation, see Olivier J.

Other cross-country research suggests\nthat wage developments help explain services inflation dynamics.14 Indeed, services\ninflation from both the United States and the euro area have been elevated. Still, while\nU.S. housing services inflation has been running higher than the wage-driven nonhousing\ncomponent, the reverse is true in the euro area.\nWhile the cross-country differences during the recent bout of high inflation have\nemerged more prominently during the disinflationary period, economic growth has been\nvery heterogenous since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generally speaking, the\nU.S. has experienced a significantly stronger recovery than other advanced economies.\nAs we can see in the left panel on slide 6, real GDP has grown substantially more in the\nUnited States since 2021. This is also the case with respect to the larger components of\nGDP, such as consumption and investment, shown in the right two panels.\nIn explaining why the U.S. has managed to bring down inflation and experience\nstrong economic activity, I believe that the combination of restrictive monetary policy\n13 See Maria Aristizabal-Ramirez, Dylan Moore, and Eva Van Leemput (forthcoming), “What Goes Up\nTogether Must Not Come Down Together: An Analysis of Services Disinflation,” Forthcoming as an\nInternational Finance Discussion Paper (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).\n14 See Pongpitch Amatyakul, Deniz Igan, and Marco Jacopo Lombardi (2024), “Sectoral Price Dynamics in\nthe Last Mile of Post-COVID-19 Disinflation,” BIS Quarterly Review, March, pp. 45–57.\n\n- 9 -\ntogether with convex supply curves can help explain these developments.15 In addition,\nthere are three supply-related factors that have also made significant contributions to the\ncombination of rapid disinflation together with continued and resilient growth.\nFirst, there are important factors that have affected total factor productivity\ndifferently across countries. For instance, the U.S. has seen greater business dynamism,\nas reflected in a higher rate of new business formation, shown in the left panel on slide 7.\nThis is important because while most new firms fail, a small share of those that survive\ngrow rapidly and make significant contributions to aggregate productivity.16 Moreover,\nthe pandemic-era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech\nsectors, such as computer systems design as well as research and development services.17\nIn fact, we have also seen greater growth in total factor productivity in the U.S. relative to\nother advanced economies, as shown in the right figure on slide 7. In addition, while the\nartificial intelligence (AI) technology is still in its nascency, U.S. businesses across\ndifferent sectors of the economy are investing in and adopting AI. According to the\nBusiness Trends and Outlook Survey of the Census, more than 20 percent of companies\nin 15 sectors have adopted AI.18 It may be too early to tell, but additional productivity\n15 See Adriana D.

In other economies, the emphasis was on maintaining employment,\nand specifically keeping workers employed in their existing firms when the pandemic\narrived. This was the case, for example, in the euro area, and the middle panel indeed\nshows that the unemployment rate peaked several times higher in the United States. This\napproach minimized euro-area job losses, but it may have limited the flow of workers to\nmore-productive sectors of the economy, which is supported by Federal Reserve Board\nresearch showing substantially more sectoral re-allocation of workers in the United States\ncompared to the euro area, as seen in the right figure on slide 8.21\nThird, the U.S. labor supply has grown in the post-pandemic period. The labor\nforce participation rate increased solidly, especially from the beginning of 2021 through\nthe middle of 2023, and the U.S. population increased strongly because of high levels of\nimmigration. While recent immigration flows into some European countries have been\ncomparable in proportion to those into the U.S., as seen in the left figure on slide 9, new\n19 See Lisa D.

This performance gave us time to strongly focus on the\ninflation side of our mandate. And this, together with the bump in inflation early this\nyear, helps explain why we began to ease monetary policy to less-restrictive levels only\nafter other central banks of advanced economies had done so. But now, the combination\nof significant ongoing progress in reducing inflation and a cooling in the labor market\nmeans that the time has come to begin easing monetary policy, and I strongly supported\nthe decision by the FOMC in our September meeting to cut the federal funds rate by 50\nbasis points.\nLooking ahead, while I believe the focus should remain on continuing to bring\ninflation to 2 percent, I support shifting attention to the maximum-employment side of\nthe FOMC’s dual mandate as well. The labor market remains resilient, but I support a\nbalanced approach to the FOMC’s dual mandate so we can continue making progress on\ninflation while avoiding an undesirable slowdown in employment growth and economic\nexpansion. If progress on inflation continues as I expect, I will support additional cuts in\nthe federal funds rate to move toward a more neutral policy stance over time.\nStill, my approach to any policy decision will continue to be data dependent and\nto rely on multiple and diverse sources of data to form my view of how the economy is\n22 See Courtney Brell, Christian Dustmann, and Ian Preston (2020), “The Labor Market Integration of\nRefugee Migrants in High-Income Countries,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 34 (Winter), pp. 94–\n121.\n\n- 12 -\nevolving. For instance, I am closely monitoring the economic effects from Hurricane\nHelene and from geopolitical events in the Middle East, since these could affect the U.S.\neconomic outlook. If downside risks to employment escalate, it may be appropriate to\nmove policy more quickly to a neutral stance. Alternatively, if incoming data do not\nprovide confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, it may be\nappropriate to slow normalization in the policy rate.\nAs I have described, the escalation of inflation unleashed by the pandemic was\nglobal in scope, and the fight to reduce inflation has also been global. Each of our\neconomies faces its own unique mixture of challenges, but by comparing our similarities\nand contrasting our differences, I believe we can learn from each other’s experiences.\nIn conclusion, let me thank those of you in this room who contribute to bridging\nscience and practice. For those working on the policy side, thank you for the hard work\nyou do each day to analyze the economic data that allows not only policymakers like me,\nbut also consumers and businesses to gain a better understanding of ongoing\ndevelopments in the global economy. On the academic side, thank you for your\ncreativity and ingenuity in asking policy-relevant questions and pushing the boundaries\nof our understanding of an ever-changing economic landscape.\n\nThe Global Fight Against\nInflation\nAdriana D.

Kugler\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nEconomics Commencement Ceremony\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nBerkeley, California\nMay 20, 2025\n\nThank you, Stefano, and before I say anything else, congratulations to the Class of\n2025!1 My family is here today, so let me acknowledge my husband Ignacio, my\ndaughter Miri, my son Danny, and my parents who are watching from elsewhere. I start\nwith family because I know it takes a village! So, I want to acknowledge the enormous\naccomplishment by the graduates and also by their families and friends who supported\nthem through this journey. Let’s give all of them a big round of applause! I also want to\nthank the leaders of Berkeley’s economics program for giving me the privilege of\nreturning here, as a graduate of this program, to be a part of what is, in fact, my very first\neconomics commencement ceremony here at Berkeley.\nOn a similar spring afternoon in 1997, when my classmates were walking across\nthis stage, I was across the country, hurrying to finish my dissertation at the Brookings\nInstitution and preparing to start my first job as an economist. I would have loved to be\nhere, as you are, and I praise you for taking the time to share with your classmates,\nfriends, and family this moment of recognition for the huge achievement today\nrepresents. But somehow, at the time of my graduation, I felt the need to get on with\nearning a living and moving forward with my life, as I am sure many of you are eager to\ndo also.\nSo, you can understand that this is a very special—and also a little strange—\nmoment for me because it feels, in a way, like I am celebrating my own graduation 28\nyears later! I think it is also an unusual situation for all of you to listen to this speaker\nwho was once where you are today. It is unusual because standing at this podium now is\nnot just the person I have become in the decades since leaving Berkeley. Standing beside\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nme, very close by today, is also the young woman I was in 1997, who was too busy to\nattend her own graduation. You will be hearing at times from both of us today, and we\nmay even exchange a few words with each other.\nThis sounds a little like that Aubrey Plaza movie you may have seen last year, in\nwhich a young woman gets advice from her older self. Unfortunately, unlike Aubrey\nPlaza’s character, I cannot help my younger version through the many challenges that she\nwill face, and let me tell you, there were many challenges indeed, and yet here I am!\nNevertheless, because of my proximity, today, to that younger self, I hope I can see the\nworld a little more through your eyes, when I try to offer some words of wisdom. I\nknow, I know, commencement speakers are expected to provide wisdom and advice. But\nreally, today, I would like to mainly tell you that the wisdom and also the conviction of\nmy younger self are what allowed me to navigate the challenges along the way. So, trust\nyourselves!\nAs I have indicated, the younger version of me was quite impatient to get her\nprofessional life started and try to make a mark in the world. The older me would say,\n“Take your time, figure out who you are, who you will become! Life is long, and among\nother things, life teaches you to have patience to work for big goals.” There is merit to\nthis advice, of course, but today I am thinking about how I felt when I was in your shoes,\nand I am thinking that one of the underappreciated gifts of younger people is, in fact,\nimpatience. I will say more about this, but if you take a look around at all the many\nurgent challenges we face here in the U.S. and the world, many of which depend on the\npowerful tool of economics and its potential to make people’s lives better, then I would\ncertainly say that some impatience is, indeed, very much what we need.\n\nI speak of economics as a tool because that is all that it is. It is not a philosophy, a\nvalue system, or a religion, although I acknowledge that some in our profession might\ntreat it that way. Economics can’t answer all the questions we face in our lives.\nEconomics can’t tell us how to treat each other, or what kind of world we should strive to\ncreate, but it is a means to those ends.\nAnd even the answers that economics can provide are always evolving, as our\nunderstanding of economic behavior and phenomena evolves. What we understand in\neconomics has evolved in the years since I left Berkeley, and it will continue to evolve.\nWhile this understanding does change over time, I think of it as changing like the\nCalifornia landscape changes. Some towns and cities grow, some decline, and there is\nthe occasional earthquake to shake things up. But the landmarks that guide us in\neconomics—the Golden Gate, the Sierra Nevada—they have been standing for a while\nnow, and I believe they will continue to stand for a long time to come.\nUsing these landmarks, these foundational and time-tested insights, economics\ncan indeed be a powerful tool. But it is a tool, only to the extent, like any other tool, that\nit is useful. A brilliant insight, if not applied, or tested, or employed for some useful\npurpose, is like the gadget you pick up at the hardware store and never use. It is just\ntaking up space in the toolbox. When economics reveals how to use resources efficiently,\nhow to raise production and income and lower costs, these insights are only useful if they\nare applied—if they win in the marketplace of ideas.\nAs you embark on your careers as economists, and the myriad ways in which you\ncan employ the knowledge and skills you have acquired, one cause that I hope you all\nwill embrace is actively participating in this marketplace of ideas. I hope you do,\n\nbecause, from the level of the individual household to the loftiest decisions of business\nleaders and government, employing the foundational insights of economics is the\ndifference between prosperity and the utterly avoidable lack of prosperity.\nIt is tempting to think that time-tested and broadly accepted ideas are permanent.\nIn fact, the debate has never ended on many foundational ideas of economics, some of\nwhich can seem counterintuitive to people. These are ideas that must be fought for,\nbecause, as I said, to lose that fight is to go backward and accept less prosperity.\nAmong the aspirations that each of you hold as you leave the Greek theater today,\nI hope that you will use what you have learned at Berkeley to be part of this fight. I\nwould go further and argue that, along with the diplomas that you are receiving today,\nyou will also carry with you a special responsibility to promote these principles and use\nthem to promote greater prosperity for all. I am not shy in saying that economists have\nsuch a responsibility, nor in saying that the learning you have acquired qualifies you to be\nan active participant in these debates. I believe your expertise matters, because, in the\ncacophony of opinions, and trolling, and disinformation that seems to crowd ever more\ninto the marketplace of ideas each year, I cling to the idea that expertise still matters. In\nhis book The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth, Jonathan Rauch argues\nthat, just as important as America’s written Constitution is an unwritten one, based on a\nwidespread agreement on what is true and what is not true. Knowledge, he writes, as it is\nadded to and preserved over time, is a special glue, that Gorilla clear and precise super\nglue, that helps to hold society together and settle many conflicts. Expertise matters as\nthe basis for that knowledge. When your expertise as economists is absent, when your\nvoices are absent from the debate, knowledge suffers, and we are all poorer because of it.\n\nLet me pause for a moment because I am hearing from my younger self just now\nthat these commencement remarks are maybe getting a little heavy. I can understand\nhow she feels. Think about how things looked in 1997. The Cold War was over! The\ntech boom was just taking off, which meant that Oakland was still affordable. Honestly,\nin hindsight life back then sounds a lot less complicated than it seems today. My first job\nwas at Pompeu Fabra University in Spain, and my second was at a large public\nuniversity, the University of Houston. I had some research ideas, mostly in the area of\nlabor economics, and I found some great collaborators, and I was off to the races. Today,\nI realize that colleges and universities are facing challenges like never before, which\nmeans that the prospect of trying to make a career in academia is much less certain.\nPublic service is another traditional destination for economists, and I have been\nvery fortunate to be able to move forward in my career as an academic, while taking time\nout on three occasions to work in Washington—as chief economist at the Department of\nLabor, as the U.S. executive director at the World Bank, and now as a governor at the\nFederal Reserve Board. By contrast, it is, of course, to put it mildly, a very challenging\ntime to be thinking about starting a career in public service, at least at the federal level.\nI can stand here today and lament the new challenges faced by you and by many\nothers in the Class of 2025. I am a mom, and my kids are also facing new circumstances.\nBut I also look back sometimes and wonder how I got here. And this is another case\nwhere I believe the 27-year-old me had more wisdom than I do. If she were crossing this\nstage today, with you, facing these undeniable challenges, I do not think she would be\ndiscouraged. She would stubbornly say: “I love economic research; I will find a way to\nbecome an academic.” If you told her about the challenges facing colleges and\n\nuniversities, she would say that it is simply unthinkable that America would not support\nthe greatest post-secondary educational system in the world. And if you told her that a\npendulum swing in opinion might limit opportunities in public service, she might say: “If\nthe purpose of life is helping others, (and I think it is) then public service will be valued,\nand it is something I must do, and that I will do.”\nI think if you had told the 27-year-old me that she could not achieve these things,\nwhich she dreamed of, she would stubbornly refuse to accept it. And of course, this is the\nway that humankind eventually solves most big problems. More than anything else, it is\nstubborn determination, which I hope is in good supply among you already, and which I\nencourage you to cultivate. You have already, of course, one of the greatest assets that\nanyone can have to make a career in economics, which is an education from one of the\ngreatest universities in the world—the University of California, Berkeley. When I\nattended here, I had the privilege of taking classes with four winners of the Nobel Prize,\nand many people tell me that, if anything, the faculty is even stronger today. In my\nrecent work at the Fed, I have had occasion to cite research by six current faculty\nmembers in public speeches. You have learned from the best, and with your energy,\nexpertise, impatience, and stubborn determination, I know that nothing will stop you!\nWhatever you choose to do, I hope you will make use of what you have learned at\nBerkeley to be an active part of that marketplace of ideas. Go forth from here and make\nthe world a brighter and better place. Go seize the day as you head out Sather Gate!\nCongratulations, again, Class of 2025, and thank you.",
